Onset for the disease is usually 65 and older.There is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease currently, though various medication and management strategies may help to alleviate symptoms on a temporary basis. Not much is known about the cause of the disease, though about 70 percent of the risk is believed to be genetic. Other risk factors are believed to be hypertension, depression and head injuries.Named after German pathologist and psychiatrist Alois Alzheimer in 1906, the disease currently impacts approximately 29.8 million people worldwide as of 2015.Alexander Povetkin net worth: Anthony Joshua\u0027s opponent\u0027s wealth revealed ahead of fightThe Best FIFA Football Awards 2018: Everything you need to knowUnder Armour Project Rock: The Rock releases new Under Armour sneakers and clothingEuroMillions results: National Lottery numbers for Friday, 21 SeptemberBachelor 2019: Colton\u0027s cast, start date, spoilers and moreLil Wayne Tha Carter V: Weezy fans vent on Twitter after long-awaited album isn\u0027t releasedWhen is the X Factor 2018 final and how to get tickets revealedX Factor 2018 spoilers: Judges\u0027 categories, guest stars, final date and more revealed Mister Rogers\u0027 Neighborhood star is celebrated with a Google DoodleWho is Khabib Nurmagomedov?

To me, if I\u0027m getting my picture taken, it\u0027s modeling, even if it\u0027s for my own brand.\u0027She joked and added she\u0027ll quit \u0027when people stop asking. Maybe that\u0027s the answer.\u0027Crawford continued: \u0027When I started modeling, I thought - because I dropped out of college - I thought I\u0027d model until I am 25 and then maybe I\u0027ll go back to school, or I\u0027ll figure out what I\u0027m really going to do with my life.\u0027I had no idea that I would be standing here today still doing modeling and getting my picture taken.\u0027Kaia Gerber exhibits her model prowess in scribble print...Cindy Crawford cuts a chic figure in polka dot blouse and...Share this article    The supermodel (pictured in 1991), who was signed by Elite Models aged 17, said retirement was not on her mind, after walking away from the industry in 2000 and returning in 2011          Crawford (pictured in 1990) continued: \u0027When I started modeling, I thought - because I dropped out of college - I thought I\u0027d model until I am 25 and then maybe I\u0027ll go back to school, or I\u0027ll figure out what I\u0027m really going to do with my life\u0027Crawford admits the industry has changed in some ways since her heyday, explaining: \u0027The act of modeling has not changed at all. \u0027When you\u0027re a model, you stand in front of a camera, or walk down a runway and that\u0027s still the same. \u0027But now there\u0027s this extra-added layer of keeping up your social media and I think there\u0027s a lot more pressure in a way, because it\u0027s daily. \u0027I always say it\u0027s like a little hungry animal that needs to be fed everyday and it\u0027s never full. It\u0027s always like, \u0027\u0027More, more, more.\u0027\u0027\u0027And so I think that sometimes for young models, and especially when you\u0027re young, you\u0027re not always so, \u0027\u0027Hmm, is this a good thing to post, or a bad thing to post?\u0027\u0027\u0027You know you\u0027re young you make mistakes. So I think it puts some extra pressure on them.\u0027 Crawford also revealed that the secret to her ageless skin is a super antioxidant extracted from a rare melon that\u0027s only ripe only two weeks out of the year in the south of France.          Crawford also revealed the secret to her ageless skin - a super antioxidant extracted from a rare melon that\u0027s only ripe only two weeks out of the year in the south of France          She said she became concerned about her skin when she was only 28, flying out to Paris to visit a special skin rejuvenation expert to obtain a dose of the ingredient She said she became concerned about her skin when she was only 28, flying out to Paris to visit a special skin rejuvenation expert to obtain a dose of the ingredient.Crawford said the melon antioxidant was essential to her Meaningful Beauty products after meeting French Dr. Jean-Louis Sebagh at the height of her career, which was \u0027like love at first sight\u0027.\u0027I would always see him whenever I was in Paris,\u0027 Crawford said. \u0027I think he\u0027s known as the melon doctor. Everyone\u0027s like, \u0027\u0027What\u0027s with those melons? Where can I get the melons?\u0027\u0027 \u0027But you can only get them in the south of France and you can only get them fresh for like two weeks out of the summer.\u0027 Crawford spoke of her pride at having not rested on her laurels despite earning millions as the face of huge advertising campaigns in the 1980s and 1990s.She described it as using the \u0027momentum from modeling and turning it into a business.\u0027The mother-of-two said: \u0027I think what\u0027s exciting to me is not only when women come up to me and tell me they love Meaningful Beauty, but when young models come up to me and say, \u0027\u0027I want a career like yours. I want to have a long career. I want to own my own brand. I want to be in charge of my own image.\u0027\u0027 \u0027So in that way, I guess it\u0027s very rewarding being a role model, especially as now my own daughter is starting her own path into the fashion industry and I\u0027m around a lot more young models and even her friends will come to me for advice, so it\u0027s sweet.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"If Diana worn seatbelt Harrys wedding says 9 11 pathologist","story":"    Princess Diana (pictured) would have walked away with a \u0027black eye\u0027 if she had worn a seatbelt, according to pathologist Dr Richard Shepherd, who worked on her inquestSince that day he has performed more than 23,000 post-mortem examinations, including on victims of murder, suicide, explosions, accidents, mass disasters and terror attacks.He was the pathologist in charge when 35 were killed in the Clapham rail disaster in 1988. He examined the drowned bodies after the Marchioness tragedy in which a Thames pleasure boat sank with the loss of 51 lives in 1989. He was in Bali after the terrorist bomb attacks in 2002 and carried out post-mortems after the London 77 bombings in 2005, having sifted through human remains in the aftermath of 911 in New York four years earlier.After Princess Diana died in August 1997, he re-examined her body for the official inquiry into her death. He also carried out the post-mortems on young mother Rachel Nickell, murdered on Wimbledon Common in 1992, and Stephen Lawrence, the black teenager stabbed to death in a racial attack a year later.Every day he confronts death and sometimes disaster. Yet of all these tragedies and others, familial, national and global, it was Hungerford that prompted the first symptoms in an episode of post-traumatic stress disorder so profound, it led him to thoughts of suicide.          \u0027Instead, she was hurtling forward with the weight of one and a half elephants, and the human body is not designed to suffer those forces,\u0027 said pathologist Dr Richard ShepherdThree years ago — almost 30 years after he had driven through the town in the ghostly half-light that summer evening after the killings — Richard was piloting the small plane he flies for pleasure when he noticed that, quite by chance, he was flying over the town.\u0027I looked down and there was Hungerford,\u0027 Richard, now 65, recalls. \u0027It was as random as that. I started to feel something like nausea, but more ominous.\u0027It came from deep inside me, forcing its way through my body with such power I felt breathless. I felt unhappiness and dread a sense that something terrible was about to happen — even an urge to make it happen — and a ludicrous thought crossed my mind. What if I got out of the plane? I struggled to stay in my seat, to keep breathing, to control the plane.\u0027Then I flew over Savernake Forest and the feeling passed. But it had never happened before in the whole of my career and it was the first intimation that things were building up, an early sign of PTSD.\u0027During 30 years I\u0027d seen bodies in death, decomposition and after illness, crimes and disasters, yet it was the first time I thought my job could have emotional repercussions.\u0027          He also worked on Stephen Lawrence, who was stabbed to death in a racial attack in 1993\u0027I considered various possibilities. I was going to take my seatbelt off and crash the car at speed. I thought it wouldn\u0027t involve anyone else.\u0027But the nurse said: \u0027What about the people who have to sort it all out? And how will your family feel?\u0027Fortunately, the suicidal thoughts soon passed and within a year Richard had stopped taking medication.But the respite from work gave him time to write a memoir, Unnatural Causes, which is just published.\u0027It wasn\u0027t an exercise in self-analysis but it proved therapeutic to be a bit more introspective about my work,\u0027 he says today. \u0027The writing became a sort of therapy.\u0027And I think it\u0027s important people understand what we pathologists do, that we\u0027re not Dracula figures, that our job is a traumatic one and that society needs someone to do it.\u0027We need to know how and why our citizens die, that there isn\u0027t another Harold Shipman around.\u0027 (Richard was also involved in the case of the Greater Manchester GP who killed more than 200 patients before his arrest in 1998.)The man I meet is affable, easy company, with the fluency of thought and speech of someone accustomed to commanding an audience. Tall and long-limbed, with piercing blue eyes and tousled grey hair, he is relaxed in off-duty casuals.He has two children — Chris, 37, a vet, and Anna, 35, a hospital pathologist — from his first marriage to Jen, another doctor, and two grandchildren. When he married Linda, a widow, in 2008, he became stepdad to her three grown-up girls.Revealed: Orla Kiely and husband paid themselves £400,000 as...British museums and US hedge funds battle over £15m Titanic...Share this articleHis marriage to Jen, which ended in orce, was a casualty of their demanding careers. \u0027Our lives were hectic and complicated and our relationship sagged beneath our workloads,\u0027 he says. \u0027One of us was always rushing in as the other rushed out.\u0027His job consumed him. Once, his children walked unannounced into his study to find him stabbing a pillow with a ruler, trying to work out the mechanics of a murder.His ambition to become a forensic pathologist took root early when, as a schoolboy, he became enthralled by a textbook on the subject.When he dissected his first cadaver, the initial fear and revulsion was quickly usurped by a fascination that absorbs him to this day.He writes of a \u0027sense of wonder\u0027 at the human body: \u0027Its intricate systems, its colours and, yes, its beauty. For blood is not just red, it is bright red. The gall bladder is not just green, it is the green of jungle foliage. The brain is white and grey — and that is not the grey of a November sky, it is the silver-grey of darting fish. The liver is not a dull school-uniform brown, it is the sharp red-brown of a freshly ploughed field.\u0027He says he learnt early in his career to isolate himself from the horror of the bodies he dealt with every day, while engaging fully with the intricate business of examining them.He also had to learn to leave the sights of the mortuary behind as he walked through the door and out into \u0027the world of daylight, children and home\u0027.He wonders now whether this continual slipping between horror and mundanity might have precipitated his breakdown. \u0027It became harder and harder to clear the images from my mind,\u0027 he admits.          Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex ride by carriage following their wedding at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle on May 19, 2018 in WindsorI ask, too, how he dealt with friends\u0027 fascination about his work. When he carried out the second autopsy on Princess Diana, for example, he must have been besieged by questions. \u0027People asked: \u0027Was she beautiful?\u0027 \u0027Was she peaceful?\u0027 \u0027Was she pregnant?\u0027 he recalls. \u0027I always made sure I never said anything — in all the cases of public interest I was involved with — that hadn\u0027t already appeared in the Press.\u0027Pathologically there was no evidence that Princess Diana was pregnant, but some women say they know they\u0027re pregnant from the moment of conception. Was she one of those?\u0027He leaves the question hanging, adding: \u0027I wish I could say she would have died whatever happened, but the fact is, if she had worn her seatbelt she would have been here for Prince William and Harry\u0027s weddings.He believes that, had she been strapped in, \u0027she would have walked away with a black eye or maybe a broken arm, but nothing more. Instead, she was hurtling forward with the weight of one and a half elephants, and the human body is not designed to suffer those forces.\u0027He says, too, that there is no enhancement of the procedures and protocols, no extra level of care or commitment, for celebrities or royals apart from a more senior police officer being present.          Forensic pathologist Dr Richard Shepherd (pictured) featured on Autopsy on NetflixHe recalls other high-profile cases: it was he who suggested that a forensic psychologist should be flown in from the U.S. to help solve Rachel Nickell\u0027s murder. And long before Colin Stagg was acquitted of the crime, Richard suspected that the actual killer, Robert Napper — now remanded indefinitely in Broadmoor high-security hospital — was guilty.He did so because he carried out a post-mortem on one of Napper\u0027s subsequent victims, Samantha Bisset, and noted similarities in the method of the two young mothers\u0027 murders both had been stabbed in a frenzied way.He is an expert on knives: he notes the angles at which blades penetrate flesh, the bruises made by the hilt, marks that indicate whether a wound is self-inflicted. And he has developed the capacity to sketch a murder weapon accurately by the track it leaves on a body. Invariably, he can also identify a knife used in a stabbing.\u0027I was always rooting around in the kitchen at home for a knife to stick into a joint of meat,\u0027 he says. \u0027I\u0027d use pork bellies, cow kidneys and joints of beef for stabbing exercises.\u0027He remarks that when he was called to perform a routine post-mortem on a young black man called Stephen Lawrence, who had been fatally stabbed, he had no idea he would give evidence so many times at future dates about the 18-year-old\u0027s murder.\u0027Public scorn at the failure to arrest Stephen\u0027s attackers reached such a pitch that it really began to seem that demands for an inquiry into the Met\u0027s investigative failures would be met,\u0027 he recalls. \u0027I was delighted by the strong move for change which forced a rethink in official and police culture.\u0027He has seen great advances, too, in methods of identifying bodies.Until 2000, fingerprints and dental records were used. He recalls the furore among relatives of those drowned in the Marchioness disaster when, advised not to see their loved ones\u0027 bodies as they were decomposed, it later emerged that some victims\u0027 hands had been removed for identification.\u0027In their position I would have been angry too,\u0027 Richard concedes. But breakthroughs in DNA technology meant that by the time of the 911 attacks, the dead could be identified swiftly by minuscule fragments of material alone.For those who worry that autopsies involve desecration or disfigurement of the dead, Dr Shepherd offers reassurance.\u0027When I perform a post-mortem, I am ascertaining the exact cause of death and doing my job with care and respect. And after I\u0027ve discovered the truth, the bodies are restored faithfully by mortuary technicians.\u0027I don\u0027t feel grief as I incise a body, but I do when I see others suffering their loss.\u0027Unnatural Causes: The Life And Many Deaths Of Britain\u0027s Top Forensic Pathologist, by Dr Richard Shepherd, is published by Michael Joseph."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/21/22/5080D47B00000578-6195153-Situated_in_Los_Angeles_the_true_heart_of_southern_California_th-a-32_1537566802840.jpg","title":"LAs belle epoque revealed photos revelers slick hotel bars dancing nightclubs","story":"    During the early 20th century, thousands of Americans flocked from the chilly East Coast and escaped west to sunny Southern California taking advantage of the numerous luxury hotels that were popping up throughout the region.

He’d wandered into the basement of an art gallery, where a very small Japanese lady in black, peering out from between two curtains of hair, was busily preparing an exhibition. It was called Unfinished Paintings And Objects By Yoko Ono, and was due to open the following day.Yoko — then aged 33 — didn’t recognise John. Then a little-known conceptual artist, she was on a visit to London with her husband and daughter and had seized a rare opportunity to publicise her work.To John, however, it all seemed very silly at first. But he liked silliness, so he decided to go along with it.‘Anyway, I’m looking for the action, and I see this thing called Hammer A Nail,’ he recalled. ‘It’s a board with a chain and a hammer hanging on it, and a bunch of nails at the bottom, and I said: “Can I hammer a nail into it?” She said: “No”, and walked away.’But when the gallery owner told Yoko she’d just said ‘No’ to John Lennon, she walked straight back and asked him for five shillings.John said he didn’t have five shillings because he never carried money. ‘What if I give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer in an imaginary nail. Would that be all right?’ he asked.Yoko agreed that it would indeed be all right.At that point, he knew nothing about her, other than the fact that she was making a short movie, Bottoms (Film No. 4), having put an advertisement in a newspaper for ‘intelligent-looking bottoms’. She’d then filmed 365 of them.Was he attracted to Yoko? Unlikely. If he had been, she’d have known about it, because he certainly wasn’t shy about making his intentions clear. Yet there was something intriguing about her. She might seem half-crazy but she was an enigma, and he’d never met anyone like her before.One day, this odd little Japanese woman would change his life. But back then, John didn’t give her much thought he didn’t even go to her exhibition launch.Yoko, however, decided to pursue John by letter. Viewing him as a multi-millionaire with money to burn, she was determined to win his financial backing for her art.The idea that she ran after John, she’d say later, wasn’t true. Others might say she never left him alone.Finally, in October 1967, John caved in, agreeing to sponsor an exhibition that consisted of half of everything — a bed, a chair and a room — all painted white. He didn’t actually turn up to see it, but Yoko was starting to get under his skin.Then, to his wife Cynthia’s surprise, the Japanese lady turned up at a private meeting. The Lennons and the other Beatles had gone to see the assistant to the Maharishi, an Indian yogi whom they all planned to visit at his Himalayan ashram.\u0027It\u0027s an incredible day for me to finally go to bed with...They\u0027ll need a hedge fund! Owners of world\u0027s highest...More than just a ticket to ride! Stars come out for Paul...John Lennon broke up the Beatles, NOT Yoko: Paul McCartney...Share this articleYoko was already there when they walked in, sitting in a corner armchair. She didn’t explain her presence and John appeared not to notice her.Afterwards, things got even odder. As John and Cynthia walked towards their chauffeur-driven car, Yoko climbed in ahead of them. Even John looked surprised, Cynthia recalled, though he politely asked Yoko if they could give her a lift anywhere.‘Yes, please,’ Yoko said, giving the chauffeur her address. The journey passed in complete silence.‘What was all that about?’ Cynthia asked John afterwards. He said he didn’t know. What he didn’t say was that he’d already seen Yoko several times.A few months before, he’d invited her to a Beatles session at Abbey Road. She had not been bowled over. ‘Why don’t you do something more complex?’ she asked.John had then suggested they go to an assistant’s flat, where he confidently expected to have sex with Yoko. But she’d found his approach crude.Her rejection only made her seem more beguiling and mysterious. By the following month, John had decided that when he went to India, he’d take both Cynthia and Yoko with him — but he lost his nerve at the last minute. Had Yoko still expected to be going to India when she turned up at the meeting? It would appear so.Unwittingly, Cynthia made the break-up easier for John by going on two holidays in quick succession in 1968. After the first, she came home to find John and Yoko — wearing the Lennons’ towelling bathrobes — sitting cross-legged on the floor.It was obvious they’d spent the night together, but Cynthia gave John another chance. The next time he didn’t even wait for her to get home: he sent a minion to Italy to tell her he wanted a orce.The little Japanese lady had won. That same week, in May 1968, the new couple went public, with Yoko clinging to John’s protective arm.In private, he made her write down a list of all the men she’d slept with before they met.Then, as he told me, he made a list for her of all the serious affairs he’d had, going right back to girls in Liverpool whom Cynthia had known nothing about.          John Lennon and May Pang - John Lennon and May Pang, who was wife Yoko\u0027s secretary, had an affair at the end of 1970sSoon John and Yoko would dress in matching white suits, both parting their long hair down the middle. For John, it was a matter of ‘I am he as you are he as you are me and we are altogether’, as he’d sung in I Am The Walrus.In The Beatles, he’d always seen himself as the front man, but now he began to subsume his personality into that of Yoko. One of their first joint enterprises was to make a narcissistic film that merged their faces together.They were now a brand — ‘JohnandYoko’ — and John threw his energies into promoting it. There was Yoko’s balloon event — 365 white ones bearing the message ‘You are here’ were released — then a film of John smiling, which lasted over 30 minutes.Most critics viewed these as no more than Yoko’s vanity projects. For ‘JohnandYoko’ to catch the public imagination, they needed to do something seriously outrageous. So they did. John decided to have them both photographed naked from the back and front, and to use the images on their first joint LP, Unfinished Music No 1: Two Virgins.Then there was a film, Self Portrait, that focused for 20 minutes on John’s private parts. Yoko was at last becoming famous.As work began on a new Beatles LP — The White Album — John insisted she be with him in the studio. The first major casualty was the Lennon-McCartney songwriting relationship.Paul later told me: ‘If I started to think of a line, I’d begin to get very nervous. I might want to say something like “I love you, girl”, but with Yoko watching I always felt that I had to come up with something clever and avant-garde.‘John and I tried writing together a few more times, but I think we both decided it would be easier to work separately.’As PAUL freely admitted, he was annoyed with John, and jealous of Yoko. But he bit his lip and tried to keep his feelings to himself.‘It’s going to be a comical thing in 50 years’ time,’ he told George Harrison, ‘if people say that The Beatles broke up because Yoko sat on an amp.’Amps weren’t the half of it.Later, after Yoko suffered a whiplash injury when John pranged their car during a driving tour of Scotland, four porters wheeled a bed into the studio so she could watch proceedings in comfort, propped up on pillows.The fun was going out of being a Beatle. And, in private, John was now indulging in a far more dangerous kind of fun: heroin. Yoko had tried some at a party and enjoyed it, so he decided to have a go himself.Soon he was hooked. ‘I never injected,’ he’d say. ‘Just sniffing, you know.’ But he rarely did anything he liked by halves, so his denial is questionable.John — who’d always had a callous streak — would speak to Cynthia only once more before the orce. ‘My final offer is £75,000,’ he told the woman he’d once loved to distraction. ‘That’s like winning the pools for you. So, what are you moaning about? You’re not worth any more.’ In the end, they settled for £100,000 (about £1.5 million today).As for Yoko’s husband, Tony Cox, who was caring for their child, John paid him off with £40,000 and despatched him to get a quickie orce in the Virgin Islands. Interestingly, Yoko was less keen than her lover on remarrying. ‘I didn’t like the idea of limiting myself to one man again,’ she said, though she eventually agreed to a low-key wedding in Gibraltar.John was jubilant at having married into the avant-garde intelligentsia. With his new wife, he was no longer just a Beatle: he could take his place as a true ‘artist’ — a word he used constantly in conversations about himself.After all his frenetic years on the road, John, now 28, was going to slow down — ‘because I don’t want to die when I’m 40’.By 1971, John and Yoko had settled in New York.

The establishment closed in the 1960s It quickly transformed the region into a booming mecca for East Coast tourists escaping the harsh, cold winter.The hotel was forced to close after a fire in 1895 and reopened in 1901 – the second version of the resort was even grander than the original. The Raymond boomed with business for decades until the Great Depression caused it to fall into decline. It shut down completely in 1931 after it was foreclosed on and was demolished in 1934.Both the Ambassador Hotel and the Raymond served thousands of visitors over the decades when they thrived with business.Photos are one of the few remaining mementos that represent a time in Los Angeles that is now bygone."},{"url":null,"title":"Shock Kate McCann closes online fundraising shop","story":"    The online shop selling Madeleine McCann merchandise to help highlight the missing girl\u0027s plight and raise funds for her search has abruptly been closed down by her mother Kate          Kate has told how she had to shut the website store because of her \u0027many commitments and pressures.\u0027The McCanns are still waiting to fund out if Scotland Yard will request extra cash to keep the search for Maddie going when their current funding runs out in just eight days.British man, 24, is rushed to hospital in the Costa del Sol...Corbyn\u0027s allies \u0027draw up emergency plans to protect Labour...Share this articleSo far the Met Police has not put in a new bid to the Home Office leaving Kate and Gerry on tenterhooks not knowing what\u0027s happening.A family member told MailOnline today: \u0027We have to wait to see what the Home Office decide about the Grange operation,\u0027          In another fresh blow it has been revealed that donations from the public to the Maddie Fund have dwindled to \u0027virtually zero\u0027 over the past 11yearsThree-year-old Maddie vanished from an apartment in Portugal\u0027s Praia da Luz during a family holiday in May 2007.

Frustration in No 10 has grown over the EU’s insistence on a ‘backstop’ arrangement for Ireland if a deal is not cut on avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.The EU’s plan to keep Northern Ireland in the Customs Union, large parts of the Single Market and the EU VAT system would effectively create a border down the middle of the Irish Sea, which Mrs May rejects as a threat to the integrity of the UK.Under one plan which has been discussed, the UK delegation would physically walk out of the summit in November and refuse to return unless the EU compromised.Pro-Brexit Tory MPs, who object to Chequers on the grounds that it will lash the UK to many EU regulations after Brexit, accuse No 10 of using the ‘threat’ of an Election to cow them into submission on key votes.

Much of the Salzburg ambush has the air of a theatrical production. At some stage in these negotiations there had to be a breakdown, or the drama would not have been complete.We are now in the breakdown phase, which is why the most significant words in the Prime Minister’s statement were the final ones: ‘We stand ready.’ This puts Britain in the position of wanting to resume negotiations when the Europeans are ready. Since we only have a couple of months to go before the absolute deadline for the end of these talks, I imagine they will start again later this month.The first problem to solve is the Irish border, and the next is the outline of the future trade relationship. Both of these are huge issues.The next couple of months are the biggest test Theresa May has ever faced. She will approach them with the determination she always shows. European leaders may have underestimated that strength, but they will not do so in future. But just as she will not be pushed around, she will also not be driven off her path of looking for a deal. If the Europeans respond sensibly, the ice will melt. "},{"url":null,"title":"JACOB REES MOGG PM use power deliver better Brexit","story":"    The bullying approach taken towards Theresa May at Salzburg has revealed more about the weakness of the EU than its strength, writes Jacob Rees-Mogg (pictured)A French president emerged from the sewer of his own scandals to accuse the British of lying.An unelected Pole made a joke that accidentally summed up the European Union’s contempt both for the United Kingdom and our Prime Minister. Then the leader of mighty Malta told our nation to vote again.This, combined with the bullying approach taken towards Theresa May at Salzburg, has revealed more about the weakness of the EU than its strength.The European project is a failure, unpopular across the continent, where its economic policies have blighted the lives of millions, especially of young people who cannot get jobs.Instead of fostering democracy, it is now encouraging the growth of extremist parties, with voters driven into their arms by a complacent and uncaring EU elite.A wise organisation would have seen the Brexit vote as a warning, an indicator of the deep-seated discontent that is not a uniquely British feature, but instead, the EU wants a punishment Brexit, modelling itself on the less attractive elements of the Mafia. This Salzburg summit has proved a useful reminder of why we voted to leave in the first place.Some timorous souls domestically, sometimes linked to the Treasury, are so frightened of the European bully that they argue that we should capitulate and agree almost any terms. Not only would this be a rejection of the largest vote in the nation’s history but it would be the ultimate signal of national decline and weakness. The Suez Crisis was a turning point in the country’s fortunes but would look minor if we succumbed to the aggression of our so-called European partners and the bad manners exhibited towards Mrs May.Theresa May could call ANOTHER snap election as \u0027rattled\u0027 No...Jeremy Corbyn claims he WILL support another Brexit...Share this articleBoadicea would have been impressed by Theresa May as she spoke from a room festooned with Union flags in Downing Street on Friday. The strains of Rule Britannia could have been playing in the background because her words made it clear that Britons never shall be slaves.This glorious, widely praised performance showed the Prime Minister at her best. Polite and conciliatory though she is in normal times, when treated rudely there is an inner steel.Not that this should blind people to the problems with her Chequers plan. Her stirring speech does not make a bad plan good, but it does show that she has the willpower to deliver something better. The EU is blind to have turned down the Chequers proposal – it offers Europe almost all it wants, but in its greed it asks for more. As proposed it would leave the UK a vassal state, chained to rules it could not alter and denied the liberty it voted for. That, in its overbearing arrogance, the EU has rejected this has saved the United Kingdom from a bad deal, but a good solution has always been partly on offer.          Theresa May making a statement on Brexit negotiations at 10 Downing Street on FridayAs Theresa May says, no Government can accept the break-up of the United Kingdom to fit in with the convenience of the Brussels bureaucracy. However, recently the EU has said that technology can be used between Great Britain and Northern Ireland to meet its requirements. In which case, logically, the same can be done between the UK and the Irish Republic.There is nothing to fear from the alternative, leaving with no agreement, on World Trade terms. Apart from saving £40 billion, this is how we already trade successfully, with higher growth rates, with the rest of the world. It allows ‘just in time’ delivery from manufacturers, as checks in Southampton average just six seconds. It would permit the UK to lift tariffs on goods we do not produce, particularly helpful to the least well-off in society.It is a much better option than leaving ourselves in servitude to an organisation that does not wish us well.Salzburg, literally the salt fortress, showed that the relationship between the UK and the EU has been as effectively poisoned as the fields of Carthage once were. Fortunately, this creates more opportunities.It ought to stop the damaging Chequers proposal and open the way for the UK to embrace the benefits of leaving sooner and being able to manage our own trade, economic and regulatory policy.The EU, by discourteously overplaying its hand, has offered us real freedom and the Prime Minister looks willing to grasp the initiative. It needs one more step and then the country can unite against an EU that is unquestionably hostile. "},{"url":null,"title":"Home Secretary claims Britain powerless control border leave EU no deal","story":"    Home Secretary Sajid Javid arriving at 10 Downing StreetHome Secretary Sajid Javid has warned that Britain will be powerless to restrict EU immigrants if we leave the EU without a deal.Mr Javid told Cabinet colleagues last week it would be impossible to have ‘preventative checks’ at airports and ports because of the sheer volume of passengers.He said that to avoid gridlock, EU citizens would still go through electronic passport gates and avoid questioning by Border Force officials.His warning is seen as an attack on Theresa May as she prepares to argue in Cabinet tomorrow that post-Brexit immigration policy should stop favouring EU citizens.It takes an average of 45 seconds to check an EU passport but four minutes for other countries.

He was completing a punishing set of exercises intended to help him walk on his hands and lift himself in and out of a wheelchair.Why is Abdel being put through this routine, which he endures without complaint? Because despite pleas to Britain’s Foreign Aid Minister Penny Mordaunt, he and hundreds like him have been denied the modern prosthetic limbs that would give them some semblance of a normal life.Abdel says: ‘I want to be brave, not sad. I don’t want losing my legs to mean that my life is bad and I will make myself strong.

Staff expect this figure to rise as war continues to rage in the provinces where Bashar Assad’s forces are seeking to retain control.The clinic, just a mile from the Syrian border, is also pitifully rundown. Staff are forced to use antiquated equipment and there are frequent power cuts because the charity cannot afford to buy a back-up generator. On the day we visited, a power cut stopped the basic machinery used to mould prosthetics and plunged physiotherapy rooms into darkness.          Prosthetic limbs Abdel and many others needscould be made within hours using a state-of-the-art 3D printerLast year, senior members of Syria Relief’s medical staff flew to London to plead their case with senior officials from the UK’s Department for International Development (DFID), which is responsible for delivering Britain’s £13 billion foreign aid budget.The charity was refused any direct funding. As a result, it has been forced to go cap in hand to larger humanitarian organisations such as Save The Children. According to Syria Relief, this process leaves it with only a fraction of the financial support it needs.Last night, DFID confirmed it had rejected Syria Relief’s appeal for direct funding. The department also said it had no plans to consider any other similar requests from charities in the region.The UK has launched its largest ever humanitarian operation in response to the war in Syria, committing £2.71 billion to the region since 2012. But earlier this year, a report by the Independent Commission For Aid Impact found DFID had been slow to shift its focus away from emergency relief and that a ‘lack of knowledge and experience’ had led to gaps in its provision of funds to smaller projects.Last night Syria Relief’s medical manager Dr Malik Nizamettin, 33, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘We travelled to the UK for the sake of Abdel and all the children here.‘We cannot make enough limbs to keep up with demand and who knows how more casualties there will be in the battles to come.‘We made our case to DFID and a number of MPs based on our six-month waiting list for limbs and in anticipation of our caseload increasing as the fighting continues in areas such as Idlib province.‘Our staff have gone weeks without pay, our equipment is very basic, and when the electricity supply fails, which happens a lot, we can’t make any legs or arms at all. We can’t afford a back-up generator. Children are suffering because of these shortages.’The Syrian conflict has cost nearly half a million lives and displaced 12 million people from their homes, including 5.6 million refugees who have fled to neighbouring countries such as Turkey.A quarter of the civilians who have been killed are children and almost all died in bomb attacks on areas thought to have been launched by Assad’s forces.

The UN World Food Programme feeds eight million people every month. Half the population has no access to clean drinking water. Last year saw the largest cholera outbreak in recorded history. And 22 million people, over 80 per cent of the population, need humanitarian aid.Shamefully, this crisis is man-made. It’s the result of a brutal civil war, in which Britain is heavily implicated, but which far too few people know about. My visit to Yemen this week convinced me the world needs an urgent wake-up call.Yemen matters for reasons beyond the morality tale that people are dying for no good reason.In its suffering and chaos, the only winners are Al Qaeda and Islamic State, who are gaining ground.The great danger is that, as more people die, Yemen becomes the new Afghanistan, a terrorist breeding ground that threatens life and limb way beyond its borders.The proximate cause of the war is a rebellion four years ago by troops belonging to an Islamic tribe called the Houthis. They stormed the capital, drove out the government and established their rule over more than 70 per cent of the population. Now they are dug in.Starving to death: Skeletal little child is just one of more...Outgunned: America is home to more guns than people and has...Share this articleThe Houthis draw their support from a conservative sect of the Shia branch of Islam. They are a longstanding part of Yemeni society but, in recent years, have gained Iranian backing. Missiles have been fired from Yemen into neighbouring Saudi Arabia – and the Trump Administration has pointed the finger at Iranian technology.In retaliation to the Houthi coup, a coalition, led by Saudi Arabia and supported by the UK and US, was formed to drive them back. It has the support of a UN Security Council Resolution, passed in 2015 at a time when the Obama administration was determined to balance its pursuit of a nuclear deal with Iran with support for Saudi Arabia.The UN resolution offers a carte blanche to wage war, but no roadmap to win peace. Little wonder that the situation in Yemen threatens to spiral out of control.The coalition has mounted more than 18,000 bombing raids to drive out the Houthis. America is the major arms supplier, but Britain is there too. Although more than 7,500 civilians have been directly killed in the fighting, and the UN has denounced ‘widespread and systematic attacks on civilian targets’, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently gave the all clear for more arms sales.But you cannot bomb your way to victory in a civil war. Surely that lesson was learnt in Vietnam.          A child supporter of Yemen\u0027s Shiite Huthi rebels waves a flag as others march in Sanaa during a rally commemorating the fourth anniversary of their takeover of the capital and marking the day of Ashura on September 20The current focus of the military effort, and the humanitarian crisis, is the port city of Hodeidah, on the Red Sea. A wide-ranging alliance, including supporters of exiled President Hadi, has been driving up from the South.Everyone fears a siege of the city, where 300,000 people still live, or an all-out assault. The UN Special Envoy has said such an attack would cut off peace talks at the knees.I tried to visit Hodeidah, but could only get as close as Bajil, a bustling town 30 miles away, because of the fighting. But I met International Rescue Committee staff who had escaped the conflict, and families displaced by fighting.They told me about missiles destroying hospitals, land mines threatening civilians, a climate of fear stalking the city. And not just any city. Up to 80 per cent of Yemen’s humanitarian and commercial supplies are meant to flow through Hodeidah’s port. The UN calculates that only a fraction of the needed supplies are getting through.Food prices are skyrocketing I saw queues half a mile long at petrol stations because of the fuel shortage.The humanitarian consequences of this war are clear. Families traumatised, infrastructure smashed, the economy shredded.But the political consequences of a war that no one is winning are to push a sustainable peace further away. Far from weakening Iranian influence, experienced Yemen watchers like former CIA analyst Bruce Riedel of the Brookings Institution in Washington are convinced the Iranians have a stronger foothold than when the war began.Meanwhile, the threat from extremist groups is growing. Al Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula is indigenous to Yemen. It is a real threat. Islamic State is incubating there too.Nothing comes to mind as strongly as the old adage: When in a hole, stop digging. We should all be imploring Theresa May and Jeremy Hunt, as they head to New York for the UN General Assembly this week, to get a grip.The UK ‘holds the pen’ at the United Nations, which means we are in charge of the process to draft and agree UN Resolutions.       One of the people I met in Yemen talked about the ‘death channel’ into which the country has been plunged. It is a chilling phrase, but it captures the cycle of violence, poverty and crisis that is consuming soldiers and civilians alike. Yemen needs to be hauled out of its death channel. Instead of sponsoring the conflict, outside powers need to get on with stopping it.I wish I could report that America was going to lead this effort. But it won’t. President Trump says his sole interest is defeating extremism. But despite the fact that the current strategy is fuelling extremism, there is going to be no leadership from him. He has abandoned America’s role as the diplomatic motor.Supporters of Brexit, including the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary, say that it liberates Britain to play a global role. Well, here is their chance.It should not be called ‘brave’ to break with a failing strategy. It should be called leadership.That is what the world needs to see this week. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d171a709f978c10da986cb816a869668ac8bba71/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=632f5bb91a8047e17977230746b84bcf","title":"best magazine covers ever art design glossy magazines","story":"A new book celebrates the creative mavericks behind the glamour of postwar magazine covers and explores the magic of a dying cultureAs a teenager in 1960s Belfast, I fell in love with magazines. They introduced me to a community beyond family and school. They were seductive and aspirational. I remember seeing Rolling Stone for the first time in a Belfast boutique in 1968 while wondering if I could afford a Ben Sherman shirt. It was a revelation, voicing a cultural shift that I only hazily understood but knew I wanted to be part of. I bought the magazine, not the shirt. Little did I know, its co-founder, Jann Wenner, would be my boss 24 years later.Like any business, a magazine’s first job is to make money for the owner, and that has traditionally been done through advertising and copy sales. The newsstand cover is crucial in this and the industry has spent millions over the decades trying to find the magic cover formula. Some titles have come close, such as the US weekly People, whose covers have been calibrated with particular brilliance. The received thinking goes something like this. A mainstream cover should be instantly recognisable it should have an attractive, accessible photograph with strong eye contact (we read the picture before the text and we prefer photography to illustration or pure type because it takes less time to decode) plus an easily digestible and relatable mix of cover lines peppered with the odd surprise it should have a tone of warm, light banter and one of the dominant colours should be “buy-me” red.But the covers in Uncovered are different – their newsstand numbers fluctuated between the dismal and the dynamic. I chose them because they broke boundaries and started conversations. They made a moment feel red-hot and meaningful. Some confronted taboos about race and sex. Some ridiculed hypocrisy. Some memorialised a catastrophic event. Some provided a voice that was absent from the mainstream. Some were rallying calls. Some bordered on the crude. Some turned design conventions upside down. Some ended up hanging in galleries, such as George Lois’s Esquire covers, exhibited in New York’s Museum of Modern Art in 2008.They are social documents with unique backstories. I wanted to hear these from the creative mavericks behind them. That’s why I start in the late 1950s prior to this, key players are unavailable. I end when covers were re-energised by the twin political thunderbolts of Brexit and Donald Trump, and the warp speed of the political news cycle. Today, there is an overwhelming sense that the post-1945 magazine era is ending. The internet has taken over as the engine of popular culture and decimated the print business model. On the bright side, there has been a surge of handsome independent niche titles, but as yet their pulling power is limited. With technology, the barriers to producing magazines have never been lower, but those to achieving success have never been higher.So what of magazines’ future? The former Spy editor Kurt Andersen hits the nail on the head: “Eventually, they’ll become like sailboats,” he says. “They don’t need to exist any more. But people will still love them, and make them and buy them.”Uncovered: Revolutionary Magazine Covers is published by Cassell (£30) on 4 October.

O was launched in April 2000 by Hearst and Oprah Winfrey, the entertainment mogul and philanthropist. This image of the magazine’s founder hit a national nerve, prompted “Froprah” mania and clocked up over 337m media impressions. The issue won two National Magazine awards in 2014.Lucy Kaylin: The topic of hair has deeply personal, psychological and political implications… the idea was to start a big, fun, frank conversation about it. As for the cover, we thought: “Let’s see if Oprah would collaborate on a really bold hair moment”. Adam Glassman, our cover magician, knew a wig maker, Kim Kimble. Andre Walker, Oprah’s long-time hairstylist, did an amazing job making it look natural on Oprah. Luckily, our cover model was very much into it. That was the secret sauce: Oprah’s enthusiasm.Adam Glassman: We made it as big and curly as possible. It was like, “OK, I want to be liberated and wear my hair natural like it is when I come out of the shower.” We’ll do an exaggerated version of that. The wig came on a headstand in a bright-pink travel box. It was like the unveiling of the crown jewels. We listened over and over to the soundtrack of The Lion King because Oprah felt like a lioness with this mane of hair. When we showed it to people before we went to press, they were very ided. Some asked if it was too much of a political statement. It really was not the intention.In the early 1970s National Lampoon, the satirical monthly created by Harvard graduates Henry Beard, Doug Kenney and Rob Hoffman, was the incarnation of hip for its predominantly campus-based readership. Its notorious January 1973 cover began as a proposed subscription campaign: “If you don’t subscribe, we’ll kill this dog and, if that doesn’t work, a cat, and the animal death toll will rise until you do.” The campaign did not run but it was the perfect cover for the death-themed issue. “The shot was extremely hard to get,” British-born Tony Hendra recalls. “When the dog looked straight out at the reader he simply appeared victimised. Then someone had the notion of actually pulling the trigger. The dog reacted to the noise and this was the result.”Without National Lampoon, there probably would not have been Saturday Night Live. It incubated talents like John Belushi, Bill Murray, Chevy Chase and Gilda Radner. Hendra, there from the start, had come from the comedy duo Hendra and Ullett, regular performers on US TV variety shows in the 1960s.Tony Hendra: The level of censorship on American television in the 1960s was acute. It basically meant that people of my generation could not mention or discuss any of the things that were on our minds, whether it was the sexual revolution, or liberation of any kind, and certainly not the Vietnam war. So it was a source of explosive frustration. Going to the Lampoon was like walking out of a dark room into sunlight.The dog cover was Ed’s idea. Casting was obviously crucial and the dog we eventually got was modelled on Freckles, my very sweet mutt who had a big patch on one eye. In a funny way, it was more moderate than a lot of the other covers we did around that period but it did nail the fact that what is really sacred for every American family is pets. So that was what gave it, if you’ll excuse the expression, legs. Were people outraged by it? Absolutely. We certainly couldn’t do that cover today without being shot, or banned for ever.From 1962 to 1972, Madison Avenue art director George Lois and American Esquire editor Harold Hayes created some of the most original, ideas-rich, uncompromising and incendiary covers in magazine history. Lois often worked with the photographer Carl Fischer, Lois creating the concept, drawing a tight sketch of each idea and directing them, and then Fischer bringing it to life.“People would say to me, ‘You got some balls doing those covers.’” says Lois. “I would say, ‘No, it’s Harold who has the balls.’ There’s no editor in the world who would do that now – allow me to choose the article in the upcoming issue, and then accept each cover I created with appreciation and pleasure.”“An Esquire cover of me drowning in a can of Campbell’s soup? I love it! But George, aren’t you gonna have to build a giant can of soup?”So said Andy Warhol to George Lois when he heard the cover concept. Lois had already done multiple photomontage covers for Esquire, but this visual joke – part mocking, part homage – ranks as one of his finest. “You could look at it as just funny, or you look at it as how fame swallows people – the absurdity of fame,” he later said. “But he really stood for something. Pop art was ludicrous to me, but I could see why it was catching on.”Carl Fischer: The basic shot was a soup can with the dirty lid open a certain amount so that we could get the logo in. I spent the day dropping children’s marbles, one by one, into the soup. We did a million splashes and finally got one that made a nice hole to drop Andy into.I photographed Warhol a lot. His mother and he lived up the block from me on Lexington. He would do anything to be on a cover of a magazine – and for no money. He ran an ad once in the Village Voice saying he was available for endorsing products.We had him come into the studio and said: “You’re falling into the ocean, just about to drown and you’re dying.” We did a whole bunch of pictures of him with his arms up, his arms out, screaming, whatever. George sent it out to a retoucher and they put the two shoots together.Cover caption: “Every day, people start out in the hope of a better life. We dedicate this issue to you. An especially large number of the refugees coming to Germany are from Arab countries. That’s why Zeit Magazin appears in German and Arabic.”The weekly newspaper Die Zeit launched Germany’s first magazine supplement in 1970. , introduced a double cover, two consecutive photographs, illustrations or type treatments that make a pithy point. This was a special on refugees that Simon Kuper from the Financial Times read “open-mouthed” because it “presented refugees not as helpless mute victims on sinking boats but as grownup humans with insights into their adopted country”.Christoph Amend: I had the idea in the last days of 2014, when I read the first reports about refugees making their way to central Europe. To edit, design and produce the issue was highly sensitive, so we hired Mohamed as a guest editor.Mohamed Amjahid: All the text had something to do with the new lives of refugees in Germany: learning a new language, fighting bureaucracy, getting over homesickness, facing racism. The issue featured many new citizens, not only those from Arabic-speaking countries. However, we decided to publish the texts in Arabic and German since most of the arriving people in 2015 spoke Arabic.Jasmin Müller-Stoy: We split every page into two. Arabic type is read from right to left, but our InDesign wasn’t able to type the Arabic font in the right direction. We had to figure out how to turn the cover in one direction so you can read it as German, and turn it in the other direction to read it as Arabic.MA: I sometimes turned the monitors upside down because it was easier or I printed the pages out, putting them in the middle of the room and running in circles. I am one of the few German journalists who speak Arabic as a mother language and I was the only one at the magazine who could read the whole issue. I felt a huge pressure. It was hard to translate the texts so they made sense at the same time.JM-S: It was tricky to choose a colour for the cover. We first thought about green, but not all Arabian countries have green in their flag and we didn’t want anybody to feel excluded. So we decided to take a neutral colour. Yellow seemed to be perfect. Mohamed helped us find a font that looked modern. We had this idea to use the first pictures that refugees took in Germany inside. They really appreciated this. We tried to do extra copies so they could get them. We took the magazine to several refugee camps in Germany.MA: Was there a message? Refugees welcome. Many German subscribers were amazed. Of course, some rightwing supporters complained that “their Germany will disappear now” because we had published in Arabic.CA: We never had so many requests from organisations and schools for extra copies. Friends from the magazine industry in New York wrote, saying: “We could never do that in America.” It was quite a ride to publish half of a magazine that you can’t read yourself.August 1958Magazine editor: Don SlaterArt director: Eve ElloreeCover artist: Dawn FredericksAlfred Kinsey’s 1948 book Sexual Behavior in the Human Male said that over a third of American men had had same-sex contacts and helped inspire the homophile movement. One came out of that political movement. The idea was to bring all gay people together as “one”.One’s cover artists and editors had to fashion a visual style that would evoke gayness yet avoid inciting backlash from postal authorities, vice squads or censorship groups. Most of the illustrations were drawn by two women who were a couple. A commercial artist named Joan Corbin drew under the pseudonym Eve Elloree during the 1950s, and in the 60s Dawn Fredericks took over: a rare example of female creative control.Their illustrations were non-threatening: the homophile organisations of the 50s were assimilationist they wanted to be accepted by society. What’s striking about this cover is how big the words are – huge letters proclaiming that in a shocking, daring way. But it’s not a menacing image. I’d describe it as a prideful stoicism that says: “I have a right to exist.” Craig M LoftinCraig M Loftin is lecturer in American studies at California State University"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4f115efed52d90f816fd263c978aa2143eb03c7/0_101_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8d852f2195cf3c1918c45446e3e364f","title":"heidi bucher parasol unit london review","story":"Parasol Unit, LondonSculptor, performer and plaster caster extraordinaire, the late Swiss artist Heidi Bucher conjures the past in literal feats of reincarnationA house floats in midair, light filtering through its tawny gold windows. There are shutters and shingles and a period look to the building, which is as classic as a drawing from childhood. But the windows are not made of glass, nor are the shutters wooden, and the house is more like a wall hanging than a substantial installation. It appears to be made out of cloth dipped in beeswax, possibly painted and yet indented with ridges, frames and panels like a real facade. It hangs in the gallery like a dream, fragile but powerfully beautiful.This is the work of the Swiss artist Heidi Bucher (1926-93), sculptor, performer, embalmer, visionary. It hovers between two and three dimensions, like all of her surviving works. Bucher was not prolific and her career was short-lived – a great flourishing in the 70s and 80s, followed by a bewildering neglect that has only quite recently been reversed. This is her first full-scale survey in Britain, and anyone with the slightest interest in the preservation of memories might like to see it.For Bucher’s works are literally traces of the past, very often her own past, growing up in the antique elegance of Winterthur. Here is her commemoration of parquet from a grand house, patterned with a star and looking strangely like a Jasper Johns painting. Here is the floor of her grandparents’ study, mounted in panels on the wall with an eerie iridescence. And the doors of the psychiatric sanitorium in Kreuzlingen where Anna O, one of Sigmund Freud’s first case histories, a tragic figure at the dawn of psychoanalysis, was treated.Even if you had no idea where these pieces were made, or how, they carry a palpably solemn and poignant history. Doors to buildings that can never be re-entered disabled shutters sightless windows through which light passes as through a veil. The size of life and very like, these objects are captivating, instantly conjuring specific places that clearly mean something particular to the artist, but to us too – sliding into the mind as if they were our own memories.This has a great deal to do with the method Bucher hit on in the late 1960s, when she began making what she called her “skinnings”. She would press gauze against the surface of an object or building (or even a person, in her own case) and then smooth liquid latex into the gauze. Just before it dried hard, she would peel off this “skin”, as if it were a monumental face mask. The result is somewhere between residue, facsimile and ghostly essence – a thing flaccid as skin but with its own force and strength, suspended from wall or ceiling.The skin often takes something with it: not just the impression of a door or room, but flakes of paint or vanish, a residue of dust, the imprint of splinters, cracks or nails. Sometimes the fabric is perfectly untouched, producing an extremely pale and spectral effect sometimes a little paint is used, so that one wall glows, while the wall and door to the freezing unit in the old butcher’s premises where Bucher had a studio, in Zurich, is like a faded theatre set, with a faint sheen of pearly light. These are never just casts, pure and simple.Bucher was making these works long before the generation of plaster-casters that includes Antony Gormley and Rachel Whiteread. What she makes is not solid, of course, but neither is it as ephemeral and weightless as it looks. A film at Parasol Unit shows the artist labouring to haul the fabric bindings from the doors of the sanitorium: tough, heavy, stiff as tarpaulins she is physically overwhelmed, disappearing beneath it in her old man’s coat – hidden by the work she has made.Bucher was also known as a performance artist another film shows vast silver vessels drifting and bobbing on a beach like wave-born flotsam, but actually manned from within by Bucher and her family, whose feet you occasionally see. Another shows one of her fragile houses lifting off into the clouds, like a home gone up in smoke. Many smaller pieces commemorate people through the beds they slept in, the petticoats they wore, or the aprons tied around a woman’s waist daily for years, a tribute to her person as well as her labour.Some of these works are like brass rubbings, others more like shrouds or unravelled bandages, preserved behind glass or on small tables. Particles of mother-of-pearl settle upon them like dust, or very fine snow so that they already appear to be halfway into some other world.Bucher’s great gift is for characterising memory itself through this summoning of the past in forms that are tangible yet only quasi-solid – something very filmy held intact, momentarily as it seems, by an image. Draw close to one of her gauzy walls and it still holds the pungent scent of the damp old place it commemorates. Once we lived in these places, she reflects, now they live on in us.• Heidi Bucher is at Parasol Unit, London, until 9 December"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1706e292cc69c6add7e9a40d6f844b68aac0d87/0_0_4476_2838/master/4476.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1edd43cbf39307e22dbfc4b5ba44f240 1400w","title":"comcast outbids rupert murdochs fox to win control of sky","story":"US cable giant wins auction with offer of £30bn, ending years of Murdoch controlRupert Murdoch’s control of Sky is likely to end after three decades after his 21st Century Fox company was outbid by US rival Comcast, which offered £30bn to take full control of the British-based broadcaster in a high-stakes auction.The announcement on Saturday that Comcast has emerged on top was made after both companies submitted blind bids in a highly unusual process overseen by the Takeover Panel following a two-year bidding process. Comcast bid at £17.28 per share, substantially more than Fox’s £15.67 offer.The bid has already been greenlit by Sky’s independent directors and shareholders now have until 11 October to decide whether to accept the recommended offer. The takeover process began in December 2016 when Fox tabled a bid to take full control of the London-based satellite broadcaster in a deal valuing the business at £18bn. The proposal then cleared a number of regulatory hurdles in the face of legal challenges and strong parliamentary opposition from Labour politicians including Ed Miliband and the current deputy leader, Tom Watson.In February, Comcast unexpectedly gatecrashed the deal, forcing Murdoch to engage in a costly bidding war that peaked with Comcast’s £26bn bid. Because neither bidder declared their offer to be final, all parties agreed to take part in an auction process to decide the ultimate winner – the first time that such a process has been used in a decade and a rarity for such a large company.Jeremy Darroch, Sky’s group chief executive, said: “As part of a broader Comcast we believe we will be able to continue to grow and strengthen our position as Europe’s leading direct to consumer media company.“Today’s outcome is down to the hard work of tens of thousands of people who have built and developed this business together over the last 30 years. Sky has never stood still, and with Comcast our momentum will only increase.”The auction marks a dramatic end for Sky as an independent company. The broadcaster began life in 1989 when Murdoch launched a standalone business offering four channels from an industrial estate in west London.

Following negotiations with landlords around Britain, 20 House of Frasers have so far been saved from closure, safeguarding around 3,500 jobs.However, Ashley told the Press Association he had been unable to save outlets in Edinburgh, Hull and Swindon after failing to agree terms.Hundreds of staff employed at the three stores will now go through redundancy consultation.A fourth House of Fraser, in Bath, is also at risk of closure as Ashley negotiates with the city council, the store’s landlord, over new rental terms.It is understood that the landlords were reluctant to agree to the low – or in some cases zero – rents that Ashley was demanding. “I am disappointed that in my opinion a small number of greedy landlords still refuse to be reasonable,” he said.Ashley, who has pledged to save around 47 of House of Fraser’s 59 outlets since buying the chain, recently struck a deal to save its flagship Oxford Street store.Others that have been saved from closure include stores in Altrincham, Aylesbury, Camberley, Carlisle, Darlington, Doncaster, Grimsby, High Wycombe, Lincoln, Middlesbrough, Plymouth, Skipton, Telford, Huddersfield, Leeds, Maidstone, Solihull and Sutton Coldfield.“We’ve shown what we can achieve on the British high street when we work together with landlords,” said Ashley. “I would like to thank those landlords who have helped us to rescue approximately 3,500 jobs at the stores we have saved to date.”Another store to be rescued is in Birkenhead, the constituency of veteran MP Frank Field, who described the news as “tremendous”.“This cornerstone of our town centre is being given a chance to flourish once again,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b4d4a0385b8cd183c87655dbb6c01e34ab5eedf/0_493_1460_876/master/1460.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcf9a7a8b9c5598d8229547a9a467ae7","title":"boohoo fashion online retail john lyttle bonus","story":"Will the brisk rise of online fashion company Boohoo continue?

The shameful absurdity of it all was captured in a magnificent conference speech by Neil Kinnock, in which he had scathing words for a council under the control of one Derek Hatton that had sent redundancy notices to council workers by taxi.Redundancy notices? Yes, the council’s funds were being so mismanaged that “economies” were deemed necessary. That notice of these economies was being sent to the victims by taxi was surreal.Last time I visited Liverpool, for the Labour conference two years ago, I was hailed by several proud denizens who, spying strangers, asked me to spread the news about the impressive developments in the city since the early 80s.A good start on the road to Liverpool’s recovery was made, with that great, go-getting Conservative minister Michael Heseltine inspiring various physical infrastructure projects, and (full disclosure) my late father-in-law, Maurice Stonefrost – probably the country’s leading expert in local authority finance at the time – producing the Stonefrost report, to rescue the city’s financial infrastructure.Alas, local authorities have not been the flavour of the current decade, with austerity-obsessed Conservative governments, and savage economies – or cuts – to services being applied throughout the land. Such needless social disruption undoubtedly contributed to the disillusionment that lay behind the result of the 23 June referendum in 2016.Which brings me to a timely new book by David Coats, a research fellow at the Smith Institute and former head of the economic and social affairs department at the Trades Union Congress. Entitled – echoing TS Eliot’s The Waste Land – Fragments in the Ruins: The Renewal of Social Democracy, it is a rallying cry for Labour to step back from a return to the early 80s in Liverpool and “make capitalism work for everybody” rather than follow “some illusory politics of transformation, by uprooting all existing institutions and replacing them with who knows what”. As Eliot wrote elsewhere: “Human kind cannot bear very much reality.”Coats captures the mood that led so many Labour voters to opt for Leave. It was “more than anything, a cry of protest, a howl of pain and an assertion that the economic and social status quo was unacceptable”. Of course, this also frightened the Labour members for such constituencies who, not to put too fine a point on it, have been worried about their future position.But the crucial point is that leaving the European Union would do absolutely nothing to alleviate the concerns of “left-behind” voters. On the contrary, all the evidence is that it would be a national catastrophe. To make things worse, it would be caused not by some external shock over which we have no control, but by ourselves.It is therefore time for the leadership of the Labour party to, well, show some leadership. We need less of the defeatist attitude of the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, who also happens to be my local MP. In an extensive interview with the Financial Times last week – an interview that gave the impression the FT takes her seriously as a possible successor to Jeremy Corbyn – we were told that “she is unenthusiastic about another Brexit referendum”.Thornberry said: “We can’t turn around and say, ‘Sorry we don’t like your decision, you’re too stupid, whatever, we’re not going to pay attention to what you say.’”Well, as regular readers will know, I myself would prefer parliament to “take back control”, stand up and be counted, and vote to ignore the “advisory” referendum and keep us in the EU. But the people’s vote being advocated so assiduously by the indefatigable Lord Adonis and his growing band of followers would be preferable to lame acceptance of the referendum result.With due respect to Thornberry, there are quite a lot of people who voted Leave who are now becoming more aware by the day of the economic and social damage that potentially lies in store. To advocate a rethink, in the light of events and the showing-up of the Brexit campaign for its blatant lies, is not to say they are stupid."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02824a4aeb73660e086e5c63704fa1056ded03ad/0_16_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dde7f0eb8405f4d90002312d98cc4e68","title":"brexit chequers salzburg irish sea customs union","story":"The rejection of the Chequers plan at Salzburg was no surprise – the EU will never accept a fudge on the Irish borderDonald Tusk’s clear rejection of Theresa May’s Chequers plan at the Salzburg summit yesterday should not come as a surprise. The most important lesson of the Brexit negotiation is that it is not a negotiation, and never has been. Blessed with superior size, wealth and power, the EU has been able to dictate the framework and substance of the talks, and has refused any deviation from its red lines.The second most important lesson of the Brexit negotiation is that the EU will prioritise its economic and political cohesion above all else. That cohesion rests on two key outcomes: an unided single market and an open border on the island of Ireland.It is these principles that have led us to Salzburg. The EU will not accept the Chequers plan, which proposes a single market in goods but not in services, capital or people. It will also not accept any possibility of border infrastructure in Ireland, which is anathema to Dublin and, according to the Police Service of Northern Ireland, presents a credible risk of sectarian violence. That has duly paved the way for the Brexit endgame, which EU negotiator Michel Barnier has now confirmed: there will be a border for goods in the Irish Sea.The EU does not, however, want to antagonise or humiliate the UK, and has scrambled to defuse the drama of this development. Barnier stresses that most checks between Britain and Northern Ireland will take place in offices and warehouses, and only live animals and food products will need to be examined at ports themselves. But no amount of diplomatic politesse can conceal Brexit’s reality: one part of the UK will be economically split from another.Theresa May effectively guaranteed this impasse last December, when she agreed the Irish backstop. The backstop guarantees, as a last resort, Northern Ireland’s alignment with Ireland on the customs union and single market to ensure the free flow of goods. Northern Ireland would be permitted to retain the single market just in goods because the Good Friday agreement depends on it. But no such exemptions would ever be open to the rest of the UK. Although the EU was too coy to admit it at the time, this always meant that the whole UK would have to commit to the prospect of staying in the full single market and customs union, or else concede the erection of trade barriers within its territory.If May had been armed with political judgment, or merely cognisant of reality, she would have prepared the British people – and government – for that concession. She has instead wasted nine months denying she ever made it. It comes as little surprise that the EU has now taken the initiative where the UK refused.The prime minister has boxed herself in with promises she cannot keep. She insists on the ability to strike UK-only trade deals and end free movement of people, while refusing to accept its consequences. In Salzburg she announced “the idea that I should assent to the legal separation of the United Kingdom into two customs territories is not credible”, but failed to acknowledge the lack of credibility in any other option. She resembles a desperate fugitive who urgently needs to escape a building but instead keeps inexplicably locking herself inside it.The most problematic consequence of the EU’s proposals is one that Brussels is most loath to spell out. This is not simply about checking goods. If Northern Ireland permanently operates a different customs regime from the rest of the UK and implements EU tariffs, then Northern Ireland must be exempt from any future UK trade deals. But it is almost inconceivable that the DUP – let alone the UK parliament – would ever agree to such a scenario. The DUP leader in the Commons, Nigel Dodds, has referred even to the checking of goods as “separating Northern Ireland from Great Britain”.Noisiest in their opposition are Tory Brexiters, not least David Davis and Boris Johnson, both of whom quit the cabinet in protest. They argue that the promise to maintain a common rulebook for goods and other continued alignment will mean a post-Brexit UK is tied to the EU without having a say on future rules, rather than being a free-trading independent nation.Labour has also disparaged the proposal, expressing deep scepticism about the so-called facilitated customs arrangement system.Brussels has sought to stay positive, but has deep concerns about elements of the plan viewed as overly pick-and-mix, and thus potentially incompatible with EU principles.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, says he opposes both the customs plan and the idea of alignment for goods. He also makes plain his contention that the Chequers plan contains no workable idea for the Ireland-Northern Ireland border.But at the same time the EU has been careful to not entirely dismiss the proposals, raising the possibility it could accept some adapted version.Officially, May and her cabinet, though even here the backing can seem lukewarm at times. Asked about Chequers, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, said it was the government’s plan “right now”, indicating alternative ideas could be considered.Even May’s allies concede it will be a hugely difficult task to get the plan through parliament. Damian Green, the PM’s close friend and former de fact deputy, described the process as “walking a narrow path with people chucking rocks at us from both sides”.On the remain side of the Conservatives, the former education secretary Justine Greening called the Chequers plan “more unpopular than the poll tax”, saying May should start again from scratch.If anything can save the plan – and it’s an outside shot – it will be a combination of the hugely tight timetable and the fact that, as yet, no one else has yet produced a plan with a better chance of being accepted by parliament.On 20 September, an informal gathering in Salzburg, Austria, will provide a snapshot of current EU thinking. Then, 10 days later, the Conservative conference could show the Chequers plan is holed below the waterline.If it survives these tests, the proposals will then reach the crucial EU summit Brussels on 18 October, with something final needed, at the very latest, in the next two months. PETER WALKERMay consequently has two tasks. First, she must determine whether her government would survive opposition to an effective border in the Irish Sea from the DUP and Commons. But more important, she must decide whether she values the economic integrity of the UK more than the ability to unilaterally change Britain’s tariffs and end migration rights for Polish plumbers.The EU, for its part, knows it holds all the cards and recognises the danger of giving ground. Its priority is to accommodate Dublin, not London. It also concludes that a government so determined to leave must believe it can look after itself. Brussels has no reason or incentive to make any better offer.The government has never understood the Brexit process and therefore has always botched it. It expects the EU to treat the UK both as an equally powerful third country, and as a member state still deserving the EU’s protection. It is neither. And so in a battle of red lines, the UK will lose. That is the most brutal lesson of all.• Jonathan Lis is deputy director of the thinktank British Influence"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87e74e3130293264e9dc49f54d5e27301ac41f06/0_0_4537_2724/master/4537.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=188628b0b48c85af41c291785c19a278","title":"european language brexit britain","story":"For someone who occasionally seems unsure whether their wife is Japanese or Chinese, Jeremy Hunt seems to speak pretty good Japanese.Unless bits of it were Chinese, obviously. Given the way things have gone lately for Theresa May’s government we probably shouldn’t rule anything out, but let’s just assume the Tokyo audience he addressed in their native tongue this week wasn’t just being polite and that he did actually deliver the whole speech in the correct language.Lately there has been some tinkering with grade boundaries to encourage uptake. But while mathematicians and scientists have gone to great lengths to popularise subjects once seen as geeky or intimidatingly difficult, there has been no concerted push behind French or Spanish.And if we’re honest, Britain’s solid international reputation for being rubbish at languages isn’t just down to the kids. How many of us slogged through years of irregular verbs and asking the way to the station, only to be reduced in middle age to fumbled holiday conversations in shops and frantic pointing?But watching Hunt reminded me of something I’ve been wondering for a while, which is whether the prospect of leaving Europe will finally make learning a language feel less like a slog and more like a thrillingly subversive act one great defiant two fingers to everything Brexit Britain stands for.Languages are lovely things to learn in their own right, of course, if you’re so minded living, breathing entities that weave in and out of each other, exchanging sounds and words and ideas. But they’re also one of the purest forms of soft power. Speaking to someone in their own tongue is a disarming act, a gesture of empathy and respect. If you’re not actually very good at it then in some ways all the better at least it’s obvious you’re making an effort, which is why typing furiously into Google Translate doesn’t quite have the same effect.Eventually, once they’re good enough to stop occasionally churning out scrambled garbage, robot translators will presumably put human translators out of business. But they’ll still struggle to convey what a human switching between languages does, which is a fundamental willingness to put oneself out in order to put someone else at ease. Speaking foreign languages is about meeting people halfway, building bridges and accepting differences – all skills sorely in need of some practice, judging by the current tone of public\u0026nbspconversation.But above all, languages open so many doors to understanding. There are few better ways of grasping why so many British negotiating gambits flop in Brussels than reading a German newspaper’s take on them. (I still have fond memories of sneaking into French government briefings at EU summits, the gist of which was usually that the French had conclusively won all the arguments, to compare them with the Downing Street version in which oddly enough it was generally the British who had triumphed.)And even to understand the construction of a language can shed light on a different way of thinking. What seems like basic politeness in English sounds almost weirdly apologetic if translated directly into anything from Spanish to Hebrew, while people translating directly the other way can sound rude, abrupt or stilted to English ears even when that’s not remotely the intention. A basic knowledge of how someone’s first language works goes a long way to avoiding small, grating cultural misunderstandings when they’re using their second.It’s true that English remains the lingua franca of big tourist resorts and business conferences. But the trouble with grandly relying on everyone else to speak your language is that it can make you oddly vulnerable. What stubborn monoglots often don’t realise is that they will only ever hear as much as the people around them want them to hear that private conversations and whispered asides will remain a closed book. If you really want to take back control, then learn a language, and with it the small covert thrill of eavesdropping on conversations that people don’t realise you can understand.But it’s Brexit that could turn an abstract intellectual pleasure into a small private act of defiance, both for grieving remainers and for those liberal leavers who actually meant what they said about leaving the EU but not leaving Europe. For those who can’t bear to see Britain defined by belligerent isolationism, who don’t want the rest of the world to think that this is who we are, then one tiny but practical way of showing it is brushing up on a European language and making a determined effort to use it. Cold comfort, obviously, for those who would rather Britain never left at all. But if the great rupture is coming, then we still have a choice over how culturally isolated we become. The least we can do is keep talking."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2324170e9ea60f30f8c0cb54ee32718d67090cad/0_36_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=768bc0eb360dee42b509b7cd1c496918","title":"tesco jacks little englandism cornish camembert jacks","story":"The new Tesco chain prides itself on its British products – but it’s really selling the myth of post-Brexit self-sufficiencyJack’s dependence on Europe goes deeper than its shelf-stackers.

The colourful, inexplicable Christo installation floating on London’s Serpentine will begin to be dismantled today all done, suddenly, with its strange business of delighting and baffling visitors to Hyde Park.Last week, the 7,506 oil barrels of Mastaba, the artist’s 20-metre high pink, blue and red fortress, were still glinting in the evening sun when I took a trip on the Solar Boat that crosses the lake during the summer months. As we took photographs, on one side of me I could overhear praise for the artwork’s playful grandeur. On the other side, someone was grumbling about how dull and pointless it seemed.Mastaba’s creator, the veteran installation artist who for years worked alongside his late wife, Jeanne-Claude, has always prompted these contradictory responses. Christo has wrapped up Berlin’s Reichstag, the Pont Neuf in Paris and even a network of Australian coastal cliffs in white cloth, making some people gape and others roll their eyes. And he has a long history with oil barrels, creating his first work from them with Jeanne-Claude in 1961.The 83-year-old paid for this floating monolith on the Serpentine with his own money and has promised, with the royal parks, that all his barrels will be recycled and that the lake’s wildlife will benefit from ecological investment afterwards.The name Mastaba, for those of us who don’t recognise it, comes from the flat-topped ancient Egyptian tombs made out of mudbricks. But that doesn’t really explain much.The force of a large-scale public artwork such as Mastaba comes from its gratuitous nature. Nobody needs it. Not, that is, until you are wandering through the park and come across its ludicrous, other-worldliness. Then, like seeing Maggi Hambling’s shell on the beach at Aldeburgh in Suffolk, you are happily reminded that you are on a planet with other humans who see the same things, but differently.And an artwork such as this always changes the landscape around it. The lake looks flatter and the trees rounder – and both seem more improbable in the middle of a dirty city. It can also help, it turns out, when a public sculpture has temporary status. In this case, Mastaba’s departure will mark the end of an especially hot, dry season in this country.When the lake is empty again at the end of the week, park-goers will know what they have lost. It doesn’t seem too much of a stretch to reflect that art, far from being as unnecessary as it might seem, is often a potent marker in time.Mastaba will have imprinted itself by now in many childhood memories. And without, I hope, too much of a leap, this is why letting art into the curriculum of every school is important. And far from just grumbling about cuts, over the last fortnight lots of influential names in the creative industries have begun to mobilise, acting now, rather than simply speaking out, against the diminishing value put on the arts in British education.The Art Fund, the charity that supports galleries and saves significant works for the nation, has launched Artful Opportunities, a scheme to bring paid work in arts institutions to 500 young people. In the same week, Simon Rattle, the esteemed conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra, has pledged to find and nurture more young musical talent across London, starting with 20 string players. Earlier in the month, famous actors and musicians, including Kate Winslet, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Benedict Cumberbatch, rallied at the Royal Albert Hall to call for more arts in schools.So while art can be relied upon to live on in the memory, it would be bleak indeed if we had nothing to look forward to but its power to show us what we have accidentally lost. As the mad, bright Mastaba now weighs its 32 six-tonne anchors and sails off, its departure may also mark the beginning of an autumn of concerted efforts to shore up an artistic future for Britain’s children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20a946927e6ddf4fc472070538a08e54e4768d3b/0_0_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=666f139826e66c3011c5ba24be40de4e","title":"salzburg debacle makes choice starker for mrs may and mr corbyn","story":"When Theresa May woke up on Friday morning to headlines speaking of her humiliation in Salzburg, it was not an entirely novel experience for a prime minister who has become synonymous with calamity. She has had many Catastrophic Fridays. And Miserable Mondays, Terrible Tuesdays, Wicked Wednesdays, Torrid Thursdays, Savage Saturdays and Searing Sundays.One of the notable features of her premiership has been the extraordinary capacity of the human sponge at Number 10 to soak up pitiless batterings that would have crushed other politicians. One of Mrs May’s female colleagues in the cabinet recently offered me the opinion that any man in her tortured position would have long since thrown in the blood-soaked towel.Even so, the Salzburg debacle was exceptionally ignominious for Mrs May, both politically and personally. She did not fly to Austria with the expectation that the EU leaders were going to fully embrace her Chequers proposal for the future relationship. She was not that delusional. The prime minister did think the EU would talk in language that was sufficiently friendly for her to be able to argue that Chequers was still viable and that might help her endure a difficult Tory party conference. The Chequers plan, already pretty friendless in parliament and unpopular with British voters, needed some warm words from the EU if it was to have a hope of staying airborne. Instead, she was shot down in flames.This was in large part a failure, the latest in a sorry saga of them, of British negotiating tactics. In advance of the summit, Mrs May had sent cabinet ministers around European capitals in an effort to find allies. What London conceived of as a “charm offensive” was seen on the continent as an insulting attempt to drive wedges into the EU by trying to set member states against each other and against the commission’s negotiators. The belief that Britain can ide and conquer in the EU has been a persistent miscalculation on the part of its government. The effect has been to draw the EU closer together.Things turned even more sour once the summit got under way in Salzburg. The hills were alive with the sound of other leaders becoming more and more irritated with the prime minister. Some were aggravated by Britain’s failure to produce fresh proposals to resolve the Irish border conundrum. Mrs May, whose emotional intelligence has never been terribly refined, did not help herself at the summit dinner by addressing them as if they were junior members of her cabinet rather than equals whose help she can’t do without. She presented her Chequers plan in a take-it-or-leave-it fashion that many in her audience found too aggressive. There was some incredulity around the table when she even started to read out bits of a newspaper article. Very well, they retorted, we will leave it. Donald Tusk, the European council president, said it clearly: the Chequers plan for selective participation in the single market “will not work” because it would undermine the integrity of the EU. This was not a new position. EU officials have been telling the British at all levels of engagement that Mrs May’s notion of a “common rulebook” for trade in goods is not viable and for a multiplicity of reasons. The EU has been saying this, just a bit more diplomatically than at Salzburg, for weeks. The only difference made by Mr Tusk was to spell it out in blunt language.This exposed another persistent fantasy of the British government: that the EU does not really mean it when it says its “four freedoms” are non-negotiable. The EU has always been consistent in saying that it can’t compromise on this and for good reason. The single market (a British invention, incidentally) will start to unravel if members are allowed to cherrypick bits they like and leave aside those that don’t suit them so well. Even more would this be the case if a non-member, which is what Britain will be, was allowed to opt in and out as it pleased. Hence Mr Tusk’s Twitter joke about Mrs May being offered a cake with “no cherries”. The EU’s own internal fractures, not least on immigration, make it even less willing to countenance special privileges for Britain. Anxiety about its own cohesion, particularly felt by Emmanuel Macron, further militates against conceding anything that might look like a reward for leaving.All of this has been clear since Britain embarked down this peril-strewn path. None of this should have been as large a shock as it was to Mrs May.For the moment at least, she is declaring that her plan is to stay exactly where she is: up a cul-de-sac without a reverse gear. She has made a career of dressing up inflexibility as a virtue and did the same when she made her emergency statement from Number 10 on Friday afternoon. She flatly rejected the two main alternatives to Chequers: staying within the single market (the Norway option) or trying for a much more limited relationship based on a free-trade agreement (Canada-style). Her tone of icy fury was mainly intended for domestic consumption. Sounding steely will probably help her through her conference. A defiant pose may temporarily impress the sort of voter it is designed to please. Others will surely conclude that someone who has to demand “respect” already lacks it. It will have much more lasting and much more dangerous consequences if the EU concludes that further negotiation is futile. For those who are rightly fearful of the prospect of Britain crashing out with no agreement at all, it was alarming to hear her default back to the old rhetorical trope that “no deal is better than a bad deal”.Observe who is happy. The hard Brexiters cannot contain their joy. They pretend solidarity with Mrs May while privately crowing that a Chequers plan that they have always hated is now dead. After a bad few weeks, during which they promised and then failed to produce their own plan, the Brextremists again have a spring in their step. Stalemate is their friend. Deadlock is their drug. They dream of leaving without a deal and calculate that this has just become nightmarishly more likely.Mrs May’s diplomatic debacle is also, and paradoxically, a source of some encouragement for those who want a soft Brexit or to stop Brexit. By ratcheting up the threat of a calamitously chaotic exit, Salzburg may have more Britons fearful of where this is taking us. Campaigners for another referendum have seized the opportunity to dial up the volume.The chances of getting one may be enhanced by what unfolds at the Labour party conference in Liverpool. Last year’s gathering was not allowed to debate Brexit for fear that it would embarrass Great Uncle Jeremy by exposing the gulf between his career-long hostility to the EU and the pro-European views of most members. This time will be different. The deluge of motions from constituency parties was simply too huge for Mr Corbyn to resist. The big trade unions, which control a lot of conference votes, have also been gradually moving towards support for another referendum. Many of the motions submitted for the conference demand that Labour commits to a people’s vote, though precisely what it will be permitted to debate is subject to the traditional procedural shenanigans when the compositing committee meets.Experience has taught us to be highly wary of predicting the ultimate outcome of a Brexit plot that is as complex as it is hazardous. In the wake of the past 72 hours, I think it is safe to say this. The choices confronting Britain are clearer and starker. Hopes of a compromise have become bleaker. The chances of a no-deal Brexit or no Brexit have both gone up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02922f4f1970daaf6238d8e3335b6429766c39a8/0_71_2121_1273/master/2121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e455374342b9439af875a2bed32603f","title":"eight of the best coastal walks in wales","story":"Whether you fancy a stroll with fabulous sea views or a long-distance hike past a medieval castle, you’ll find it all on the coast of WalesThe Welsh coastline has been described as one of the best places on Earth to visit, and it’s not hard to see why. From rugged clifftop peaks to sprawling, serene beaches puffins to porpoises ­– natural beauty of incredible variety and scale is everywhere. Wales is the only country in the world that boasts a walking trail ning its entire coastline. The really dedicated can tackle the whole 870 miles. You can even run it – the current record is 23 days.For those more inclined towards a gentle hike or a relaxed amble, taking in glorious sunsets from castles or viaducts, here are eight of the best coastal walks.Aberaeron to New Quay (6.5 miles)New Quay claims to be the inspiration for Llareggub, the fictional seaside village at the centre of Dylan Thomas’s masterpiece Under Milk Wood – and it is worth a visit alone so that you can make your own mind up. This easy trek between two of the loveliest fishing towns in Wales takes you through forests, waterfalls and fern, finishing at glorious Traeth Gwyn beach in New Quay. Make sure to plan your timing with the tide in mind so you get the full experience, and have time for a swim in fine weather. The Hotel Penwig boasts a seafront location and is ideal for an overnight stay or just a drink to toast a fine walk.St Govan’s chapel, Pembrokeshire, to Stackpole Quay (5.5 miles)Expect medium intensity here, mainly because of the steep steps that take you down to the mystical St Govan’s chapel, the real draw of this lovely walk. St Govan’s origins are debated, including the suggestion that he was Gawain, the legendary knight. Another story has him as an Irish Christian missionary who took shelter from pirates in these rocks and then created his monastic chapel in thanks to God for his survival. The remarkable stone structure has been as weathered by the sea as the rocks around it, but it remains in good shape. Look out for the bird life – chocolate brown guillemots and black razorbills come in the summer to breed on the cliffs. For a different wildlife experience, the walk also takes in Bosherston Lily Ponds, where house martins and swallows skim over the lily-covered fresh water. Also nearby is the beautiful Barafundle Bay – with its clear waters and expanse of golden sands, it is the closest Britain gets to the Caribbean.This short and slightly steep walk is well worth it. One of the best views in Wales awaits you, only a small, well-signposted distance from the town of Barmouth, which was a favourite of the poet William Wordsworth. At the summit, you’ll have a view of the dramatic upland landscape of Cadair Idris, as well as the Mawddach Estuary, but be sure to make time for the spectacular wooden Barmouth Bridge. It is just over 150 years old and, at 699 metres long, it is Britain’s longest wooden railway bridge. You can walk or cycle over the bridge for free.Mumbles to Three Cliffs Bay (12.5 miles)This is a long walk made easy thanks to the well-maintained path. Three Cliffs Bay is a perfect example of the particular charms of the Welsh coastline – the wildness, the feeling of being outside of time, the awe-inspiring peace. This walk is the perfect summer outing, and the bay provides a picturesque picnic location that would be hard to beat. The Gower Coast Path has many highlights, and this scenic walk is one of the most breathtaking.Holyhead to Trearddur Bay (12 miles)You are spoiled for idyllic walks in Anglesey and this stretch offers a perfect mix of cliff-hiking and open coastal views. You begin in the impressive Holyhead Breakwater country park, built on the site of an old quarry. Regular exhibitions and displays offer information about the local wildlife – which include falcons and peregrines – to any accompanying little ones, and a friendly cafe with local suppliers will set you up for the day. The entire Anglesey coastline is designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and this walk has some of the most breathtaking views. Visit South Stack lighthouse to watch the breeding seabirds on the cliffs and experience the full drama of wind and sea. You can also get guided tours of the lighthouse. Once you’ve arrived at your destination, a stay at the seafront Trearddur Bay hotel is highly recommended.The Glamorgan Heritage Coast is so-called because it’s been recognised as an area of notable natural beauty or scientific significance, and walking it you can see exactly why. It’s as much a treat for amateur geologists as it is for keen walkers. You’ll pass by Dunraven Castle, and although it hasn’t survived intact, it makes for a striking and almost magical scene. If you decide to do the full walk, make sure you’re aware of the tides as they can take you by surprise. The Blue Anchor is the perfect traditional countryside pub for a pie and a pint when you’re done.Conwy to Llandudno (18 miles)This ambitious walk is perfect for experienced long-distance hikers, but the route is also easy to ide into smaller sections for those who only have an afternoon. It will take you up the Conwy River estuary and around the Great Orme, allowing for spectacular views of the north Wales coastline. As well as being a scenic delight, this is a walk for the historically minded – Llandudno has managed to keep its briny Victorian charms intact, and Conwy boasts an imposing medieval castle built in the 13th century.A very good walk based around some of Dylan Thomas’s old haunts, taking you via the River Taf and a Norman castle. The Dylan Thomas Boathouse is a must-see, bound to inspire those of a poetic bent – and the deck is the perfect place to sit with a coffee to take in the estuary. Laugharne Castle is a well-preserved and strikingly beautiful site, with a glorious view from the top of the tower. On your return, why not enjoy a beer in famous literary watering hole Brown’s hotel, where Thomas entertained his fellow writers and students.

This treat never quite made it to the table and I ate it while standing at the kitchen counter. Then, a few minutes later, a second piece of bread, this time untoasted with a swirl of the ricotta, its crest pushed down into a hollow deep enough to hold a pool of olive oil. Unmediated, almost spontaneous. Eaten out of pure greed after coming home with a fresh loaf and white cheese as soft as cream.Ricotta barely makes it as a cheese. Traditionally made from the whey left behind after the curds that will become cheese are removed and start their journey to the maturing room, this is the lightest, gentlest-tasting dairy product, next to milk. It has no body to speak of, and can be spread like whipped cream. I like it with strawberries. You can make ricotta al caffe, the famous desert with ricotta and espresso, or use it in a cheesecake to lighten the mixture of eggs, mascarpone or cream cheese.I like it folded into whipped cream as a filling for a sponge cake to be eaten for lunch with raspberries, though it is probably best known as a stuffing, with tiny nibs of candied peel and shards of dark chocolate, in a crisp, cigar-shaped cannoli. If you dust the finished pastry with icing sugar rather than trying to sweeten the ricotta itself, the filling is less likely to weep.For lunch the other day, I brought a dish of baked ricotta to the table, the cheese set into a firm soufflé with eggs and thyme. We piled it on to our plates with roasted tomatoes and spooned over the basil-scented juices. Slicing it like a cake I ate the leftovers the next day, with a dollop of tomato chutney.Salted ricotta, where the fresh curds are drained, salted and pressed, has been the most useful addition to my fridge this summer. The piquant logs of cheese have been crumbled into bowls of raw, roughly chopped peas, or cooked and skinned broad beans, or broken into tiny, gravel-sized nuggets and tossed with basil leaves and olive oil as a dressing for green-shouldered tomatoes. Add a squeeze of lemon and you have a vibrant dressing for the heart of a lettuce or raw shredded cabbage, or you could fold it through chunks of chilled watermelon.It is fair to say it works better as a seasoning than as a principal ingredient and yet many times this summer I found myself breaking off a chalky lump and wolfing it as I might a piece of feta. Another of my little standing-at-the-kitchen-counter pleasures.This is one of those recipes that works both hot and cold, though isn’t at its best served straight from the fridge. Feel free to add a pinch of dried chilli flakes or a little dried mint. I haven’t added salt to the mix but you may wish to, depending on the age of your parmesan. The older, firmer cheeses may well be salty enough.Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Transfer the ricotta to a mixing bowl and lightly mash it with a wooden spoon.Break the eggs into a bowl, beat well with a fork, then fold into the ricotta with finely ground black pepper. Roughly chop the thyme leaves then mix with all but 2 tbsp of the parmesan.Fold the thyme and parmesan into the ricotta then spoon into an oven dish. Smooth the surface then scatter the reserved grated cheese over the top.Place the dish in the oven and bake for 30-35 minutes until the ricotta has risen and the crust is golden brown. Serve immediately with the tomatoes below.Made with good, ripe tomatoes, fruity olive oil and big, peppery basil leaves, this dish can stand up as a light lunch, served with hunks of sourdough to soak up the juices. You could tuck a few olives among the cherry tomatoes and basil leaves, or a few fillets of anchovy.Slice the large tomatoes in half, then scoop out the cores and seeds. Place cut side up, in a baking dish. Cut the cherry tomatoes in half and push into the hollows with the basil leaves, and season with pepper and salt. Fill each tomato almost to the top with olive oil then bake for 35-40 minutes until on the verge of collapse. Serve with the baked ricotta, spooning tomato juices over as you go.Salted ricotta has slowly become one of my go-to ingredients. I appreciate its ability – even a couple of tablespoons grated over warm vegetables – to bring things to life.shelled peas 250gparsley a few sprigstomatoes 150g, smallpea shoots 25gsalted ricotta 4 tbspolive oil for dressingBring a saucepan of water to the boil, salt it lightly then add the peas and cook for 4 or 5 minutes.

Well, regular in one sense but not in another given it is Rúben Neves and Diogo Jota who are sitting in front of a plate of delicious Portuguese custard tarts – pastéis de nata – talking about cricket.For Jota and Neves, who joined Wolves in July last year after playing together at Porto, this little corner of the Black Country feels like home away from home. Hélder Costa, another member of the sizeable Portuguese contingent at the club, is credited with discovering the place, which opened 13 months ago. Monica, who is from Porto, could not have timed things better in that respect, although she has no interest in football and was oblivious to the fact a number of her customers were household names and worth millions of pounds until she saw her boyfriend talking to them and asked how he knew them.Neves and Jota, who got to know each other playing for Portugal’s Under-21s, are terrific company. Humble and affable, they speak with such maturity it is easy to forget they are 21 years old. At times they are like a married couple as they finish off one another’s sentences, no more so than when the conversation turns to the slightly awkward question of how they compare Wolverhampton with Porto.“It’s not possible to compare, it’s completely different,” Neves says, diplomatically. “In Porto it’s a tourist city. It’s close to the river, the ocean as well, there’s a lot of history. The wine and the food also. And here it’s an industrial city. But we’re fine with it. We want to play football … in the best league in the world, so the city doesn’t matter,” Jota adds. “And we have a good home and our family with us,” continues Neves.The overriding impression is that Neves and Jota could not be happier. Jota talks about how much more comfortable he is off the field in Wolverhampton than in Porto, where the level of attention was suffocating at times, and both remark on how refreshing it is to be in a league where the ball is in play a lot more. “Time-wasting is one of the worst things we have in Portugal,” Jota says, sighing. “For example, when we played against Manchester City we still wanted to play when we had Jonny injured. But in Portugal, you’ll get a lot of players ‘injured’.”The follow-up question prompts Neves and Jota to react with laughter and a sense of incredulity. Given that their manager is also Portuguese, does he ever get invited to the birthday dinners? “Nooooooooo!” the two respond in unison, looking flabbergasted. “You can’t cross that line,” Jota says, smiling.Their level of respect for Nuno, who also managed them at Porto, shines through when they talk about him. “He’s a really intense and ambitious coach,” Neves says. “I think the most important thing is the motivation – he’s always motivated to do his best all the time. Even when we’re playing good, he wants us to play better. I think this makes the difference with him.”Everything comes a lot more easily with a ball at their feet. Neves has caught the eye this season with his wonderful range of passing, and it feels a matter of time before Jota, Wolves’ top scorer last season, opens his Premier League account. “We want to make ourselves look good in the best league in the world,” Jota says. “When it was our first game, against Everton, I was very emotional, because it really means something for me. When I came on to the field, I thought: ‘I’m here’.”Saturday’s visit to Old Trafford promises to be another special occasion, especially with José Mourinho in the opposite dugout. Neves, who grew up supporting Porto, can vividly remember their 2004 Champions League triumph under Mourinho, even though he was only seven. “I watched the final with my family,” he says. “We went into Porto to celebrate because all my family are fans. Mourinho is a legend at Porto.”Rather surprisingly neither Neves nor Jota has spoken to Mourinho, despite plenty of common ground, including when it comes to their agent. Jorge Mendes represents all three and it is interesting listening to Jota’s response when asked how important Mendes is from a player perspective.“He’s like my right arm,” Jota says. “I think from a player’s point of view, you feel you are with the best at his job. I feel there is no one better than him to manage my career, so I have nothing to worry about – just to do my job on the field. When you speak with him, he’s really ambitious and he says you can always do more. He’s very confident and believes in you more than you do yourself sometimes.”Monica could probably do with Mendes’s help, too, because sadly Aromas de Portugal is on the market. Monica’s father is ill and the family have asked her to return home, meaning she is trying to find a new owner. All the catering equipment is included in the price and the same goes for a distinguished list of regular customers, provided the place remains in Portuguese hands. “We hope it does,” says Neves. “We have alternatives. But the best place for us is here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a6ad7a2e9076fc115c8c00d3d0b2ccb60ea4d0a/0_97_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=067ce9f9560dadcb3a6d599dbd4f2936","title":"brighton tottenham premier league match report","story":"There are times when any win will do and, for Tottenham, this was certainly one. The vultures had been circling after three defeats and the historians leafing all the way back to the spring of 2004, the last time they lost four consecutive games in a single season. Mauricio Pochettino needed his players to stand tall at what has become one of the Premier League’s more testing venues for the bigger clubs they did that and, while this performance fell some way short of their fluent best, a few suggestions of a return to form flickered, too.Foremost among them was their second, ultimately decisive goal, scored by Érik Lamela after the kind of rapier-like attack Tottenham have made their trademark under Pochettino. Lamela had replaced Son Heung-min eight minutes before taking possession just inside the Brighton half and, via Lucas Moura, working the ball to Danny Rose. He kept running and was rewarded with an accurate cutback that, without breaking stride, he swept beyond Mat Ryan.“That is how we want to play, how we feel football,” Pochettino said of the goal’s construction, although Spurs showed another side that made him even happier. He had pointedly questioned their resolve after Tuesday’s late capitulation at Internazionale and here, amid filthy conditions against a team that had taken 10 points from their previous four home games against last season’s top six, they faced down the kind of challenge tailor-made for anyone curious about their response.They were slightly lucky that Glenn Murray, needlessly handballing Kieran Trippier’s free-kick, gave Harry Kane the chance to dispel the cobwebs that had gathered during an increasingly ponderous first half. They were fortunate, too, that Anthony Knockaert shot straight at Paulo Gazzaniga in the 66th minute when he should have equalised. There was even an improbable wobble at the end after Knockaert, a mite too late in proceedings, got his bearings right with an excellent finish.But Pochettino saw enough to feel Tottenham had recovered something that, even if only for three weeks, had been lost.“I think the spirit we showed today is the spirit I wanted to see in all the games,” he said. “The team was fantastic in how it defended this mentality to fight and always give your best. That’s what pleased me the most today.”Tottenham began authoritatively and might have taken the lead when Toby Alderweireld, meeting Trippier’s corner with a thudding header that flicked off Gaëten Bong, drew a flying one-handed save from Ryan. Both players had been recalled after missing the game at San Siro for what Pochettino had termed “technical reasons” Trippier was heavily involved early on but, after that initial encouragement, their tempo slowed and the doubts set back in.Then Murray, jumping in the wall and repelling the ball with his arm when the adjacent Davy Pröpper had been poised to take one in the face for his team, opened the door for Tottenham and Kane beat Ryan confidently from the spot. The home crowd howled with derision in reality there was no disputing Christopher Kavanagh’s call, although Chris Hughton felt the award of the free-kick itself had been soft.Hughton also felt Brighton should have had their own penalty in the second half when Eric Dier appeared to have grabbed Lewis Dunk’s shirt. But the bigger frustration was that, during a ferocious spell of pressure, Knockaert fired straight at Gazzaniga after doing the hard work by cutting inside Jan Vertonghen. In a frantic period of added time Knockaert scored, watched Ryan save a one-on-one from Kane, and drew another stop from the keeper with the last action of the game. A foot to his right and, suddenly, those proclamations about Spurs’ resolve would have looked far weaker.“For me he was man of the match,” Pochettino said of Gazzaniga, a late call-up in place of the injured Michel Vorm. “He was fantastic – his personality and his character.” Those were the facets he had sought above all and, with some bumps along the way, they were exactly what he was given."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b475a59508abf2d03814fa186e9f3e6b1cb78c63/0_117_2300_1380/master/2300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9b0f39b20cf26adea71dd1eca3041b0","title":"liverpool southampton premier league match report","story":"As Jürgen Klopp is fond of telling, it takes greed, aggression, talent and a phenomenal work-rate to succeed on his terms yet Liverpool are making the hard art of victory look routine. The Premier League summit was reclaimed with ease against Southampton, a seventh straight win stretching a flawless start as well as the idea that healthy competition exists between the best and the rest.Liverpool ended the contest before half-time as a Wesley Hoedt own goal, Joël Matip header and Mohamed Salah tap-in brought an emphatic interval lead over Mark Hughes’ visitors. If Charity Shield results are included, this is now the finest start to a campaign in Liverpool’s illustrious history. They are raking up wins while in second gear, have kept eight consecutive clean sheets at home in the Premier League and have two points more than Manchester City did at the corresponding stage of last season. Not that anyone at Anfield is looking too far ahead, of course.“I once lost seven games in a row and that felt much different,” said Klopp. “Yes, it is a surprise but the performances we showed so far were good enough to win all the games. Different styles and different opponents but the boys were always there.”Liverpool’s formation was even more adventurous than usual with Xherdan Shaqiri handed his first start in a floating role behind Salah, who was deployed as the central striker with Roberto Firmino left and Sadio Mané right. The summer signing was given only 45 minutes to impress against his former Stoke City manager. It was enough. Shaqiri instigated the breakthrough when he collected Mané’s piercing pass following a corner, cut inside Cédric Soares and shot for goal. It would have sailed wide but for a deflection off Shane Long which erted the ball on to Hoedt’s thigh and in.Klopp’s changed system – worked on for only one rain-interrupted training session on Friday – offered Southampton space to attack Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson in numbers. It was an invitation the visitors accepted regularly but the absence of Danny Ings, ineligible against his parent club, and the commanding presence of Virgil van Dijk ensured there was no end product. Van Dijk would exit in the second half with a rib injury that Klopp described as “not cool but not too serious”. His replacement, Joe Gomez, was equally impressive. Southampton paid a high price for the absence of any such authority in the heart of their defence.Liverpool doubled their lead from another corner, conceded by Soares’ superb challenge on Salah as he shaped to convert Firmino’s return pass. Alexander-Arnold swept the delivery deep and Matip towered above Jannik Vestergaard to head his first Anfield goal into Alex McCarthy’s top corner.The game provided a further demonstration of the widening gulf between the Premier League’s leading lights and their supposed competitors. Southampton did not play particularly badly and Liverpool were a long way short of their intensive, dominant best yet they still strolled off at half-time three goals to the good. “It would seem so,” said Hughes when asked if the gap was growing. “I’d like to think that, on our day, we can give the best teams a good go. Hopefully we will prove that along the way but you have to acknowledge that Liverpool have a settled way of playing, personnel who have been here a long time and a manager who has been here a long time as well. They are clearly building something here.”Number three was a simple but important tap-in for Salah. Klopp had played down concerns over the Egypt international’s form ahead of the game but, evidently, the source of 44 goals last season has not yet recaptured his sharpness. Salah went close several times, with one audacious backheel beating McCarthy but trickling agonisingly wide of the far post, before reacting more quickly than anyone to convert from close range after Shaqiri had struck the bar with a free-kick from 25 yards.Shaqiri was replaced by James Milner at half-time as Klopp reverted to his trusted 4-3-3 formation and Liverpool coasted. “I told him I’d never substituted such an influential player at half-time before who wasn’t injured,” said Klopp.The second half was flat by comparison although the watching Jeremy Corbyn, in the city for the Labour party conference and having paid his respects at the Hillsborough memorial before kick-off, can only have been impressed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/477fde9925973504a33634200d5a0610f3e558fa/0_193_3051_1831/master/3051.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c7029ff7012707cbdcde32a6af99164","title":"manchester united wolves premier league match report","story":"Sir Alex Ferguson was back where he belongs – at Old Trafford – for the first time since recovering from a brain haemorrhage but he witnessed a disappointing draw for a Manchester United team who failed to turn dominance into three points. At the close Wolves came close to stealing victory when David de Gea saved a shot from Adama Traoré with a foot and the winger then blasted wide in added time.This left José Mourinho again bewailing his players’ mindset, stating those of Wolves possessed a “World Cup final” attitude and his did not. “They play like I like to play, which is like the World Cup final,” the manager said. “That is the attitude I like my teams to have in every match. We didn’t have that. This is something you learn when you are a kid in the academy. You don’t need experiences at the highest level to learn that. It is a basic law of football.“I can’t explain the difference of attitude because I never had a difference of attitude. For me it is difficult to explain that.”The visitors signalled early on they would push forward when possible, creating two chances for Raúl Jiménez, the attacking spearhead in Nuno Espírito Santo’s 5-4-1 set-up. Both times United were breached along Luke Shaw’s left corridor but Jiménez failed to take full advantage. He miscued the first and De Gea saved smartly from the second.Mourinho paired Victor Lindelöf and Chris Smalling in central defence for a fourth successive game and Alexis Sánchez replaced Anthony Martial on the left. In all there were four changes by United’s manager. By contrast his Portuguese compatriot fielded the same XI he has for all Wolves’ league matches this season.Mourinho’s faith in the Smalling-Lindelöf combination was hardly repaid by what occurred from two João Moutinho corners. When he floated the first over from the right, Ryan Bennett headed over. Then, moments later, Willy Boly forced a superb De Gea save with neither centre-back anywhere near.It was reflective of how United were pinned back in virtually all of the opening passages. Yet after 20 minutes they were in the lead.Shaw wandered forward, close to Wolves’ area and pinged in a cross. Eventually the ball fell to Paul Pogba and he continued his fine form from midweek with a cute reverse-flick to Fred, whose weak right-foot shot beat Rui Patrício.Sánchez continues to struggle for consistency but Ferguson would have approved of how he drove along the left and flipped a clever ball in toward the galloping Pogba and Romelu Lukaku as half-time neared.On the touchline Espírito Santo was a frustrated man due to some of the decisions awarded against Wolves and, when Patrício dawdled and had to hoof the ball out as Jesse Lingard closed in, his frustration turned to fury.United began the second half with a raking Pogba pass that Lukaku controlled expertly with a knee and for a moment Patrício’s goal looked threatened but the centre-forward’s shot was blocked.It was a sign of the home side’s ascendancy, though too often they ceded the ball via clumsy touches, with Fred a chief culprit. This failing led to the visitors’ equaliser, although it was Pogba to blame.The Frenchman attempted a fancy turn near halfway and lost the ball to Rúben Neves as the onlooking Mourinho reacted with concern, knowing what might now happen. It did: when Wolves tore forward, Jiménez passed the ball back inside United’s area to Moutinho, who smacked the ball home.Mourinho’s reaction was to remove Fred and the ineffective Sánchez for Juan Mata and Martial on 62 minutes. Martial combined with Shaw for the latter to swing in a far-post cross from which Fellaini should have beaten Patrício. Instead the ball was erted into the goalkeeper’s hands.Mourinho’s last throw of the dice was the removal of Lingard for Andreas Pereira. The midfielder won a free-kick in a central area, 30 yards out, but it came to nothing and United’s run of victories ended.“I am proud of the way we played,” said Espírito Santo. Meanwhile United are already eight points behind the leaders, Liverpool."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a5db320e10cb17ccdcf65dff1d049405aa31ecf/403_57_1046_628/master/1046.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6d74ce2036964ca4473bda46d0d32d5","title":"liverpool impress ronaldo ridiculousness and cows cows cows football weekly extra","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Lars Sivertsen and Jonathan Wilson to discuss the Champions League, Ronaldo’s red, the timekeeping skills of cows and Mark Hughes’s elusive smileJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

The most popular baby names of 2017 have been announced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), and while Olivia, Oliver and Muhammad – in its varied spellings – remain the most likely names to be heard shouted across the nation’s playgrounds in years to come, the inventiveness of parents shows no sign of slowing down.Aurora, Lyla, Orla, Edith and Hallie enter the top 100 girls’ names, while for boys, popular names include Leo, which enters the top 10, and Ralph, moving into the top 100.Sarah, the most popular name for girls throughout much of the 1970s and 1980s, has dropped out of the top 100 for the first time since records began in 1904.Parents in England and Wales gave 28,222 different names to the 348,071 boys born last year, and 35,475 to the 331,035 girls. More parents seem to be aiming for something celestial, with Luna and Aria among the fastest-rising girls’ names in the past decade.The biggest climber was Harper, the name David and Victoria Beckham gave to their youngest child in 2011. Music and sport often provide inspiration, with 35 parents plumping for Kendrick for boys – perhaps with the rapper Kendrick Lamar in mind – and 50 calling their boys Kobe, possibly after the basketball player Kobe Bryant.However, the British political class does not inspire people so much. There is no Boris, Jeremy or Theresa in either of the top 100s, although Jacob was the sixth-most popular name in 2017, a year in which the arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg has grown in popularity in some quarters. There were only 11 Nigels born last year, compared with 50 Winstons.The names given to the newborns of England and Wales present a different and more erse picture than those registered when Britain joined the EU in 1973. Back then, Michael and Jennifer were the most popular names.There is also considerable regional variation. In Gwynedd, north Wales, Hari is the most popular name given to boys. In Blackburn, it is Zainab for girls. Amelia and Muhammad are most popular in Birmingham, Jack and Olivia in Bristol, and Arthur, Oscar, Florence and Lily in Tunbridge Wells.Muhammad was the 10th most popular name for boys, but if the alternative spellings of Mohammed or Mohammad were included, it would be about as popular as Oliver and its variants, such as Olly, across England and Wales, the ONS said.Two names that do not appear in the top 100s are Walt and Boo, the twins born this week to Chris Evans and Natasha Shishmanian, who had earlier nicknamed the boy and girl Ping and Pong, which do not appear either."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e29b0bed360aa9cafbe90c865eb567059565199b/0_0_2950_1770/master/2950.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34d48701bd0585b611b4463e615966cc","title":"compliment me on my beautiful baby boy go on do i love it","story":"Even on my eight-week-old’s potentially noisy first flight, fellow passengers thrill to the wonder of him‘How old is he?’ asked the woman to my right as we took our seats on the plane. I don’t find flying too stressful but today was proving an exception. The worst I usually get is a little bit of Altitude-Adjusted Lachrymosity, a speculative condition in which some combination of cabin pressure or recycled air results in my becoming overly sentimental if I spend the flight watching movies about brave dogs.As it was my son’s first flight, I was simply delighted we weren’t being offered a sock to gag him. I clarified his age and jiggled him on my lap, as if to suggest he was the kind of baby who never cried. ‘They’re so beautiful at that age,’ the woman said, clasping a hand to her chest, as if it held a letter from the dreamy American soldier who stole her heart.This kind of reaction is common and, frankly, I enjoy it. I find it rewarding to channel the world’s good feeling about babies into my own store of self-worth. Like the father of a child star, pocketing his offspring’s acting fees under the guise of a college fund that doesn’t exist, I accept my son’s compliments, but secretly enjoy them for myself.My wife is the opposite, which is unfortunate, since she constantly attracts the chatty attentions of older English people who mistake an Irish accent for a strong desire to hear about their nephew’s kids. She now leaves all such chats to me, especially since she gets uncomfortable when strangers coo and fuss over the boy. I feel uncomfortable when they don’t. If half a dozen people get on the train and only five collapse into gooey awe at the sight of him, I mark the sixth for death before he sits down. ‘Maybe he hasn’t seen him,’ I say to myself through gritted teeth, slowly tipping the pram on its back wheels, so as to angle the child’s face in his direction.‘My youngest has just gone off to college,’ my neighbour explained, with just the slightest catch in her throat. ‘No one tells you how empty your house will seem after that.’It’s true. No one had told me that. Our friends and family had prepared us for long nights, cranky strops and inflated nappies. We are offered sympathetic shoulder pats and appreciative sighs, not wide-eyed, wistful envy. When I’d told a friend we were taking our eight-week-old on a plane, he gave me the pitying stare usually reserved for news of imminent eye surgery.‘Treasure it,’ my neighbour said as we took off, with a strength of feeling that strongly implied my son could leave for college at any moment. Picking up her book, she abandoned me to the inexorable reach of time’s skeletal hand. I hastily resumed play on Netflix.‘You OK, hun?’ my wife asked as we disembarked the plane. ‘Yes’, I said, wiping my eye. ‘I guess Air Bud: The Soccer Dog was more emotional than I remembered’."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be765529e8d7ad6734938130ec93bb596007878f/0_715_2560_1535/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22a77e85888c167711ebfac8e8cd48fc","title":"magic logic gardening and the lunar calendar","story":"Cold hard facts only get you so far on the allotmentI believe in magic beans.

In 1962, from his base in beautiful Bradford-upon-Avon, Dr Alex Moulton set himself the challenge of ‘improving the classic bicycle with its diamond-frame and large wheels’… And, lo, the original Moulton F-frame was born. In the process, he gave small-wheeled bikes the very thing they’d never had – serious cojones. Would the world-beating Brompton be the bike it is today without Dr Alex?Since then, there have been numerous interpretations of his idea, including the revolutionary lightweight space frame. Now here’s another. This one is the result of a unique collaboration with British bespoke builder ColourBolt, and features one of its signature paint finishes – the effect is called ‘Drenched Black’.It’s a super-tough industrial powder coat that is designed to withstand virtually anything that can be thrown at a bicycle. It has a raised, textured effect which gives the frame a glorious tactile appeal. When you aren’t stroking it, you’ll be riding it, luxuriating in the zip and zest of the world’s most exciting small-wheel bike.Bex is the product of the Zwift Academy global talent ID program which invites both females and male cycliststriathletes to compete for a pro contract by riding Zwift. Participants follow a programme designed by world-class coaches to help uncover hidden talent throughout the Zwift community. A former pro cyclist, Bex was a pilot for blind and visually impaired riders for three years and believes the app is perfect for para-athletes.1. Have you always been a keen athlete? I think for as long as I can remember I have been competitive, growing up with three older brothers I always wanted to keep up or be as good as them. I remember being nine-years old and racing around the “little block” on my pink bike with a basket, inspired by Chris Boardman winning Olympic gold and trying to break the world record, I think my time still stands – maybe I need to go back on the Specialized Shiv to better it.2. When did you first try Zwift? Last July I was involved in a bike crash during a stage race in the Czech Republic, I ended up breaking my wrist and ankle, as soon as I was able to start rehab I began riding my bike. My boyfriend mentioned about signing up to Zwift as I started building up the duration on the bike again. It was the best thing I ever did. I was in plaster for 12-weeks with my wrist and then had surgery in January to resolve the problems, so Zwift allowed me to ride with others and make indoor training so much more fun than staring at a blank wall and watching the seconds tick by.3. How did you discover the Zwift Academy and how were you selected? Did you expect to be selected? In October last year I knew that cross training was going to be my best option to get back to fitness and be structurally strong again. I always said that one day I wanted to do an Ironman and I decided that 2018 was going to be the year to try and do it. I think I was looking for events and saw the advert for the Zwift Academy on the Tri247 website, I thought I had nothing to lose by applying and so that was what I did. It was a fairly simple application asking about our goals and background, I then got an email asking to submit a short video. Secretly I think the guys selecting the academy must have been looking at the data on Zwift as I’m certainly no film maker! I remember coming back in from my longest brick session and relaxing on the sofa, I had an email come through so picked up my phone to find out I had been selected. Never in my wildest dreams did I think that I would be one of the lucky four!4. Had you ever done a triathlon before joining the Zwift Academy triathlon team? I had a brief spell in triathlon way back in 2005. I stumbled across Ironman for the first time whilst on a holiday in Lanzarote, I was completely captivated by the event, I got up first thing in the morning and stayed by the side of the road until last thing at night watching the last finishers come in and those that were outside the time cut. After that holiday I came home and said that is what I am going to do. So I bought a bike, started running and picked up my swimming again. I got some fairly good results with winning the European Age Group championships for my age group and also the London sub 2.30 Triathlon.5. We all have a weakest discipline, what was yours and how did you manage your training to improve in this area? At the moment I would say my running would be the discipline that I am working on the most, it is a sport that you cannot rush because of the impact and risk of injury, so I’ve started from nothing and built up slowly, there is definitely more to come which for me is exciting but it is also taking a long-term approach and staying healthy and injury free.6. What are your tips for making your transition time quicker? Practice laying out your kit and equipment at home and run through the order in which you will do things, you don’t have to practice this every day, but if you include this once a week physically and then rehearse by visualising daily then it will become automatic come race day. Also practice walking your route into and out of transition. Once slowly taking in key markers and then once at speed so you are under pressure trying to find your position.7. How do you recover from your races? Rest is very important, with working full time and training and racing it is important to let your body catch up on what is needed. After a big event I will have two rest days the week after but on a normal training week always one day of complete rest – although that normally involves catching up on life and doing the weekly shop, ironing and all the other chores that tend to get neglected during the rest of the training week8. What is your nutritional prep like? What do you eatdrink before during and after a race? I like to plan the night before for the day ahead, it is important to make sure that I have enough fuel with me at work so that I can complete the training that is necessary. I normally have a breakfast of quinoa with seeds and berries, and during the race, depending on the duration I will eat a mixture of foods.9. Do you have any tips on staying calm in the water at the start line? (and how not to get kicked in the face!) Practice the different scenarios that you might encounter, in training I train with a swim squad at Sale Water Park and we do pack swimming, navigating, deep water starts and trying to make your way through the “piranha pack”. A lot of it is about patience, when the siren goes the red mist comes down with a lot of people, but be confident in your plan and ability, position yourself in a realistic starting place, look at the swim course and the lines that you will take, have a “what if” scenario and what will you do if you lose your goggles? Your hat comes off, someone pulls your wetsuit zip? If the unexpected does happen then you are not phased and can simply deal with it and continue with what you set out to do.10. How does it feel to be given your first chance to compete at an Ironman World Championships alongside some of the best and most famous athletes on the planet? I still can’t believe it is really happening - it’s like a dream come true!11. You were previously a pilot for blind and visually impaired riders, winning bronze at the 2009 World Para-cycling Championships, How and why did you choose to get into this? That’s right, I was a pilot for blind and VI riders from 2007-2010, it came about as I was teaching the British Cycling talent team manager’s daughter to swim, he asked me to come to Manchester for a lab test at the National Cycling Centre and after a chat with some of the coaches they said that I could be quite good if I turned my attention to cycling. I decided I wanted to give it a go and within six-months I was selected for GB as a pilot at my first world championships in 2007. At the 2009 World Championships, my new stoker and I had only met and been riding together for six-weeks before the event when we won bronze in the road race.12. Do you think Zwift could be of benefit to visually impaired and other para-athletes? It’s been great to see some of the riders that I rode with on the para-cycling team sign up to Zwift already, it can sometimes be difficult for B\u0026ampVI riders to co-ordinate pilots to take them out on the road, but with Zwift they can ride with others, in a group or do their inidual sessions and not have to rely on others all of the time. It is also great for para-athletes new and already in the sport to build up fitness.Email Martin at martin.love@observer or follow him on Twitter @MartinLove166"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f72378f7e10fedf36882a88d2c99ba7e615ce78/0_15_6698_4019/master/6698.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbfc5951714cdaf864b8d6f742f076d3","title":"the sheep whisperer having a relationship with sheep can be as complex as reading proust","story":"Axel Lindén explains why he left his job as a lecturer in Stockholm to become a sheep farmerAxel Lindén is a shepherd-philosopher with James Herriot’s knack for mishap and an almost Chekhovian deadpan humour. On Sheep: Diary of a Swedish Shepherd chronicles his Sisyphean struggle to move from “newbie” sheep farmer in search of a sustainable good life to “real farmer” – “a grump who keeps to himself.”In 2010 he ditched his day job as a literary studies lecturer in Stockholm, rejected the ills of consumerism, pulled his three children out of kindergarten and, with his somewhat reluctant lawyer-wife in tow, embarked on a sheep-rearing “project”, possibly long term, possibly not. Either way, Lindén, then 46, “wanted out” of the city and unethical consumerism and into nature.“I wanted to be out there, feeling the cold in my fingers,” he writes, “hitting myself on the thumb and wearing my trousers out at the knees.”So far, so Seamus Heaney gritty and elemental. But during the move to his parents’ old farm, Lindén was reading a lot of Proust, “a writer,” he concedes, “who is the opposite of being grounded in practical, hands-on reality”. Still an ideas man at this stage, Lindén didn’t see himself as part of the natural world, in the manner of the American transcendentalist nature poet William Thoreau, one of his literary pin-ups. He had no plans to be a sheep either, in the manner of British nature writer Charles Foster, who lived as a badger, even eating worms. Lindén’s wife was “not so keen on animals”. He went off and bought 12 ewes and 16 lambs. She preferred cats. Rearing a flock on five rented hectares of the former family farm (his father was a dairy farmer) was part of a non-mechanical means to a non-profit end: small-scale sustainable living.Eight years in, his wife is happily growing their vegetables and flowers, the freezer is stocked with lamb and Lindén has come to know “that seductive sensation of being in direct contact with the natural world”. He now lives in a state of profound empathy with his ovine charges. “You become part of them, and they of you,” he says. “It sounds silly, but it has given me an inner peace.”The transformation was incremental. At first Lindén spent a lot of time putting up fences that promptly fell down, fixing escape holes and reflecting on the psychology of his lost sheep. The manual labour and round-the-clock responsibility for his flock absorbed him: he thought less and less about himself, improving his mental health by weaning himself off the need for praise, and coming to live in the present – that holy grail of 21st-century states of being. But then, even a sense of responsibility and of doing a job slipped away, a feeling “best captured in the notion that I’m not the one who has the sheep it’s the sheep who have me.” His co-habitants dictate the way of things.“You learn about sheep, how they function it’s more than pure knowledge. It’s like a feeling in a deeper sense – what it would feel like to eat grass and have it ruminate inside you. You see the way they form their group – sometimes spread out, sometimes packed together. When you think why they do that, there isn’t a straight answer. It’s a complex world that comes to you – and so you have to change to another thought and then to another and not necessarily come to an answer.”Trust becomes mutual, he says. Sometimes, after counting the sheep or checking up on a weaker lamb, “You lose track of time and just sit down, waiting for them to gather around you and, without really thinking about it, you become part of the flock.” They are “unpretentious and stoical,” rather like Lindén, so it’s no surprise when he adds: “Sheep are special. They really allow you to contemplate. Cows,” by contrast, “are quite hectic. With sheep, you can lie down among them.”“I am not the person I was when I first came here,” he says, and part of the reason for that is how he bonds with the land, as well as the sheep. He became rerooted in it, writing that “my childish tender feet trod on the ancestors of these very nettles” and that during the first half of his life his development was almost “a copy of industrialism itself: rational, progressive, urban. The sheep are making me barefoot again, so to speak. A return to simple things. Only what is simple turns out to be extremely complex, with many different facets.”“Existential insights” come with the organic territory, though he couldn’t be less pompous or more self-deprecating. He was an “urban vegetarian” when he took up his shepherd’s crook, and he still looks the part in checked shirt, rimmed glasses and long hair. Anti-intensive farming literature he read 15 years earlier compared the meat industry to the treatment of Jews in Auschwitz, he says. “I used to think so too. Now I think that is not the case.” Animal husbandry, he says, “is not violence or humans taking power over the lives of animals it is a complex relationship, and a good one. Sheep are iniduals, and you take care of them.”The fact that you will eventually kill them, he says, is part of the relationship. “It sounds very strange, and it was very hard for me to grasp in the first year. I couldn’t take part in the slaughter. I instinctively walked away. But over the years, I have learned to integrate this into the relationship. You learn that life and death go hand in hand.”There is a push-pull tension in the book between Lindén’s determination neither to anthropomorphise nor to sentimentalise his ewes, who are numbered, rather than named, and tomorrow’s lamb chop. Lindén, who eats his own lamb, but is otherwise vegetarian, believes that meat-eaters shouldn’t eat any meat whose slaughter they have not been involved in. “But I don’t want to be too…” He hesitates, not prone to proselytising. “I am not saying everyone should do what I do – I am not that extreme any more – but I do think everyone should ask, ‘What is really possible?’ I had, and still have, a strong belief that we can all change the way we live.“I realised that, living in the city, I couldn’t walk one metre without being an oil consumer. That was the basis for the move.” The farm is ided up now. The Lindéns have a café, where they sell sheepskins. They turn neighbours’ apples into juice for a tiny fee, chop their own wood and generate some of their own electricity. “During my first year on the farm, I hoped that more and more people would come and live here, that it would be a kind of movement,” says Lindén. But visitors come to visit out of curiosity. “They are not interested in living like this all year round.”“Baah!” is a typical Lindén response to disappointment. The sheep, he says, have seen off his anger. Besides, he and his wife “are not authoritarian – we live the way we do, and our children learn from that.” They have one daughter, aged 15, and three sons, aged 15, 13 and eight. Their 15-year-old is an Afghan refugee whom the family fostered two and a half years ago. “They help me catch the lambs and every spring, they spend two or three days taking care of them. My daughter even fostered a lamb once. They have taken part. And they have seen the slaughter.”Generation Z eco-activists they are not. “They are very normal teenagers. We have tried to let them develop their own interests, but then you see your children grow up and become exactly like everyone else. You can’t be disappointed it is a good example of how strong society’s norms are, and how much pressure is exerted to make us all the same.“I think people run after the wrong things,” he continues. “It would be much better if people had some sheep of their own rather than trying to be a good employee or getting likes on Facebook.”Lindén still sees his friends back in Stockholm. “When they ask me, ‘Don’t you miss university and discussing literature?’ I say, ‘I’ve got the sheep.’ It doesn’t mean I sit in a corner of the café like a crazy person. It just means that sitting in a café listening to other people is not the full meaning of my life. It sounds like a moronic answer,” he says, “but it is true, because having a relationship with sheep can be as complex as reading Proust, I think. I don’t think, I know it.”On Sheep: Diary of a Swedish Shepherd by Axel Lindén is published by Quercus at £9.99.

The TBG has promoted its speakers as “guaranteeing a rousing and stimulating conference, filled with great insights from first-class people”.According to leaked documents obtained by the anti-fascist group Hope Not Hate, internal polling of For Britain’s members reveals that nearly half support a ban on people coming to the UK from Pakistan, Bangladesh or Somalia.Hopkins, who recently applied for an insolvency agreement to avoid bankruptcy after a costly libel case involving the food writer Jack Monroe, works for Rebel Media, the Canadian far-right firm that has employed the former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson.Robinson, currently courted by Ukip leader Gerard Batten, will appear in court for the retrial of a contempt of court charge on Thursday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba29997bbb653452b0f3c4535da008541fb2ac91/0_408_6016_3608/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2782f07c16f446015ff2f923c233046","title":"time magazine historic iconic covers","story":"Meredith recently announced that it was selling Time magazine for $190m in cash to Marc Benioff, one of four co-founders of Salesforce, and his wife Lynne.

However, research from Citizens Advice suggests that millions are still being charged for phones that they have paid for after the contract ends, even though they own the phone.The charity has highlighted EE, Three and Vodafone in this, and says the pricing of mobile services and phones should be separated out.More than one in three people go beyond their minimum contract, usually for six months, and many are unaware they are still being charged even though they own the phone, according to the research. This is a simmering problem that has been highlighted before by media regulator Ofcom, which found that one in every seven mobile phone owners don’t know the status of their contract.The problem is not industry-wide, however – Billmonitor, a website that analyses customer bills and offers the best deal according to usage, says Tesco and O2 Refresh will automatically stop charging for handset costs and make adjustments to payments.Ofcom found that one in every four consumers don’t know that they can simply get a standalone sim card and greatly reduce their monthly bills. The regulator has proposed that operators be required to send a notification to their customers 40 to 70 days before the end of the term.EE last week said the splitting idea from Citizens Advice was overly simplistic and that the best way to avoid customers being overcharged was to have clear communications about their options. Three says it makes the lengths of contracts clear to new customers, and Vodafone says it contacts customers when they are approaching the end of their contracts to let them know their options.How to avoid the problem? The answer is simple. Set a reminder on your email or phone for the end of the contract and then stop paying the full “bundled” amount. Go to the market and look for a sim-only deal that best suits your needs.Reaching the limit on your data before the next bill can be frustrating but also expensive, as add-on packages are typically pricey. This leads many to overestimate usage when they sign up for a deal, in turn paying for data they do not need.Klaus Henke of Billmonitor says many people are sold a package but do not investigate whether it is the right one.“If you walk the high street, you will probably find two or three offers saying you can get 20GB for £25 or ‘We double your data’. If you have 3GB they give you an extra 3GB. And you might ask yourself, ‘Why give me that for free?’“The answer is so you can get used to the idea of having 6GB. The next time you are due for renewal, you buy a 6GB bundle, which will cost you more. But actually you are not using the 3GB,” he says.Keeping a close eye on usage will make selecting a deal easier. Billmonitor and ctrlio compare tariffs according to use.The most common form of mobile contract is the bundled deal. Also common within these deals is the lack of information about the effective cost of the phone, according to Citizens Advice.While most people think that they are the cheaper option, in almost three out of four cases, consumers are paying more than they would if they were buying a phone outright.Behind this is the frequently high prices networks apply to bundled deals, where consumers are effectively taking a loan from the network in order to pay off the device.Some networks operate agreements where things such as annual percentage rates (APR) do not need to be disclosed, says commercial director Dan Melia.Some reseller sites can undercut buying the phone direct with a separate sim, according to research from Martin Lewis’s Moneysavingexpert.In one case, buying a phone and 4GB of data allowance from Vodafone – via Mobiles – comes in at £1,092 over 24 months, cheaper than the £1,191 bill from buying outright from Apple and then paying £8 a month for a sim with 3.5GB of data."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98fedac3d45c16ac206d3641173b87b787a17709/0_446_6264_3758/master/6264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5db7322567f8d0f7982b4e44f5a69e3b","title":"cat power i didnt know i loved myself when i was younger ","story":"Erratic stage shows, psychotic breakdowns, rehab… Cat Power’s chaotic life is in direct contrast to her soulful music. Now a new album and motherhood have given her a profound sense of calmCat Power, whose real name is Chan Marshall, meets me in the lobby of her London hotel, and things do not go as expected. First, she is warm and inviting, when her smoky, melancholy records had led me to expect someone much more remote. And second, she is immediately in full swing with her impersonation of my English accent. “Life in the old dog yet, eh!” she says, after we decide to go to her room to avoid the noise and the smoking rules. “Good old Blighty!” she adds, as we get into the lift. I didn’t see this coming – not from a woman who grew up in the Deep South of the US, where she learned to sing about drunks and devils and depravity while dodging them, and has been dodging them ever since. I didn’t know she’d be funny.“Aaaaand relax,” the 46-year-old says, sitting down on the rooftop balcony of her hotel room, after opening a bottle of red wine from the minibar and lighting cigarettes for us that she keeps in a leather pouch she bought in Mexico. As we talk, she tops up my glass but not her own, “I can get you drunk, but not me,” she says, because she has to go on stage tonight. If you’re a fan of Cat Power’s music, you might be thinking: “Well, hang on a minute, she was drunk the last time I saw her live, in fact she turned her back on the audience, muttered something inaudible, stopped in the middle of three songs and then walked off.” Such erraticism is indeed something her live shows became known for in her own life there were psychotic breakdowns, and she went to rehab for alcohol and prescription-drug addiction. Her diehard fans never wavered, though. For them, to know Cat Power’s heartbreaking, raw music is to love her unconditionally, giving her a rightfully elevated position in the American alt-rock scene, alongside contemporaries such as Sonic Youth and Will Oldham. Her blues singing and otherworldly coolness have also been noted by the fashion industry, with Karl Lagerfeld asking her to model Chanel jewellery after seeing her smoking a cigarette outside the Mercer Hotel in New York.Currently, she is on a wave of rebirth, having changed record label, surprised her fans by becoming a mother, and realised her mind was never what others thought it was. Her new album is called Wanderer, she produced it herself, and it has already attracted excitement with its first single, Woman, a duet recorded with Lana Del Rey. One music website explained that the astonishment at their pairing was because Del Rey gets called out for being too fake, while Marshall gets questioned for being too real. But we’re not here to focus on the things that women are criticised for – this is Cat Power’s female solidarity album. She even has a Rihanna cover version on it, which came about after she heard it in a car – and hated it.She explains: a few years ago she was collected from an airport by the man who was then her lover, and the song Stay, a ballad, came on the radio. He said fondly: “There’s my girl,” as she got into the car, and her spirits soared – until she realised he was talking about Rihanna. “I turned off the radio. It was just terrible. So I’ll never forget that song, right?” Yet, years later, she was in a car, again, and heard it from start to finish, “and I then realised why Rihanna is so loved – because of her piercing direction, her vibrating, easy vocal, her delivery. I was on my way to the dentist or somewhere and, fuck, I was bawling in a taxi.”One night she went to a karaoke bar – something she adores, private booths only – “and I found the song, Stay, and I sang it and sang it – then I said to my friend, ‘Do you mind if I sing it again?’ He didn’t care, he just wanted to get drunk and eat food. So I sang it 16 times.” When she started recording her album, she found herself singing it again. Her finished version starts with the chorus and then proceeds to disassemble its tight four-four rhythm into something else entirely. This album contains a lot of layered vocals, where she records herself singing the same line again and again, creating her own echo. I ask her how she knows when a song is finished, but she says it’s quite clear to her.“Like when you’re cooking at your house, you know when you’re done. The purpose is served.”Marshall grew up in a chaotic, poor family with a largely absent blues musician father and a mother from whom she would later become estranged. She has written about alcoholism, violence and assault and, on one song – Black – she sings of running all the way upstairs, to escape someone who “threw me in the bath with an ice and a slap  can of Coke down my throat  on his whole hands and knees”.In her late teens, Marshall got involved in the rock band scene in 1990s Atlanta, a community that she says was full of loss, with people dying of Aids or heroin overdoses before their talent had seen the light of day. (Marshall’s grandmother later told her she was so proud of her not becoming a drug addict or a prostitute.) She had sung in church but had no formal music education, and at about 19 she taught herself the guitar, “just making rhythms, but my best friend Shaun, who passed away, showed me where to put my finger on one chord. That minor sound – sad – is the representation of most of my songs.” On the piano, meanwhile, her trick was to miss out the white keys. “But then I had a lover in South Africa who played saxophone and piano in his jazz club, and one night after the show he showed me exactly where to put my fingers to make a triad.” In her 20s she moved to New York and found a studio where she could record albums Wanderer is her 10th.Talking to Chan Marshall, it is always clear to me what she means. Yet when I come to transcribe the tape recording, it is hard to write up some of the sentences that stop and start, the missing words. You’ll have to imagine the repetitive clicking that takes over her tongue, deep in rhythm, when she says that her grandmother was a farmer, or the swooping gesture her arm makes when describing a sacred musical space, or the direction in which she turns herself, eyes shut, when her mind is looking for a thought that has escaped her. You don’t make records like hers by inhabiting your body like everybody else does.Take the song In Your Face, with its slowed-down Cuban ballroom syncopation and lyrics about a man who protects his conscience with a military fanfare and by forbidding himself to think. Might this, paradoxically, be the first truly beautiful song about Donald Trump?She smiles and explains the title. “In Buddhism, your karma sits on your face. So, there may never be a justification publicly for that bastard – but perhaps one morning he’ll look in the mirror and realise he’s condemned.” She lets out a heartfelt “uuuuggh”, before saying these people come from cultures of hierarchy so there’s never just one of them maintaining the oppression. “It’s a pattern of power. But I think industrialised countries, the people, are becoming more infuriated. Rather than expecting a superhero, you know, a Churchill or a JFK to swoop in, I think people are actually becoming more and more open to paying attention to opposing positions.”So you have some hope? “Well, you have to have hope if you don’t then hopelessness leads to destruction. Or self-destruction. Implosion. Sorry. Sorry!”Marshall ends so many of her thoughts with “Sorry, sorry!” that finally I ask her to promise to stop apologising for herself. “You don’t know how many times I have promised that,” she whispers, with a bittersweet twinkle in her eye, just about managing not to say sorry again. But it is clear that creating peace of mind for herself is something she takes more seriously now. Her old record label, Matador, wanted her last album, Sun, “to be a hit record, and the pressure was overwhelming”. So she moved to Domino, where she felt she could have “some kind of sacred, secret space with this record. I didn’t want to think about what anybody else wanted. I only wanted to think about what arrived in my brain.”Something else that reinforced her, this year, was playing the 20th-anniversary concert of her album Moon Pix in the Sydney Opera House in May. It’s an album that she wrote, inspired by a nightmare when living alone in a farmhouse, and recorded in Australia in 1998, which was then described by Rolling Stone as her “breakthrough record”. The concert cemented something in her head about her own sanity her own power. Marshall met so many fans who wanted to tell her what certain songs helped them through: a brother’s suicide, madness, loss. The more stories she heard, the more she realised what her small act of creation had achieved. Plus, she found a power in the songs themselves that didn’t fit with her memory of the girl who had written them decades earlier. “I didn’t know I loved myself then, when I was younger. But when we played them, I realised the great love that I had had for myself. Those songs had been me trying to prove to myself, you know, it’s OK, you’re all right – but now I know that she did know that, she did know she was worth love.”During that show, Marshall also said to the audience: “I don’t know how many of you here were back with me when I was mad.” I ask her about that now.“You know, I felt like if I was… fucking wacko, then all these motherfuckers were wacko, too. And that’s the whole point, that we weren’t wacko. I definitely wasn’t crazy. And that’s one of the most calming things, the older that I’ve gotten – when I was younger, I wasn’t always able to find inner solidarity, but as I got older it was liberating. It doesn’t even matter if you’re an artist or not: the easiest way out of listening to the truth from a woman speaking it, is to tell her that she’s fucking crazy.”It’s like Sinéad O’Connor, who wanted to tell the world that Catholic priests were sexually abusing children. People wrote her off – but she was right.Three years ago Marshall had a son with a man she doesn’t name, whom she dated for months rather than years. (He is involved, and recently took their son for 10 days on his own, which she admits she found “nerve-wracking”.)“When I was pregnant there was a lot of fear… would I survive birth? When I was born my mom left me at the hospital. She wasn’t well. I think I was very afraid of feeling disconnection from the baby. So any time I’d have that fear I would think back to my great grandma who was a sharecropper, I’d think about what she had to maintain with dignity. Just unapologetic, incredible hard work that still exists on the planet today. And that’s what gave me strength. But it’s not wisdom that grips you when you become a mom – it’s awareness, a new awareness that suddenly just grips your life. It’s a new kind of fear.”As a fellow single mother of a sole child, I ask if she feels a pang when she sees nuclear families with two parents and a couple of kids. She says not as a mother, no, but as a kid she did. They moved house so frequently that she became curious about how other people’s families worked. “I was always the new kid, so I would go into new neighbourhoods to make a friend and I could see how nice it was, their lives: ‘Oh you guys make pancakes?’ And that’s how I live now, because I learned by watching all these humans. I ask my son what he wants for breakfast and I cook it for him. There’s so much happiness in the morning with us.”Might you fall in love again?“I’ll always be a romantic, I think most human beings have that part of their personality. But…” She groans, she smiles, she shuts her eyes. “It would be amazing to fall in love. That’s what everyone’s waiting for,” she says, finally. And she does not apologise.Cat Power’s new album Wanderer is released on 5 October on Domino RecordsFashion editor Jo Jones make-up by Jo Frost at CLM using Dior Backstage Collection and Capture Youth Skincare hair by Paul Donovan at CLM Hair using VO5 photographer’s assistant Sam Reeves fashion assistant Penny Chan This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Sex is a viscous business, as is sweating it out on the dancefloor. Then there’s the fluidity of all of our inidual sexualities. We juggle a diesel rainbow of personas and messy feelings: lust, depression, ambition, wilfulness, to pick just four explored on this long-awaited second album by Christine and the Queens.“I’m a man now,” declared Héloïse Letissier on iT, a track on her extraordinary debut album, Chaleur Humaine (2016), which sold more than 1m copies and introduced a thrilling new voice in pop. She sang in French and English and a peculiar, inflected hybrid of the two that served the rhythms of her songs more than strict sense. Madonna, one of Letissier’s idols, ended up copying her staging.Fast-forward to 2018 and the really rude words are now in Spanish (follarse). And “we are all losing to somebody… we are all losers to somebody” – or so Letissier observes on Feel So Good, a track that apes Michael Jackson in the most successful way. This is an MJ reborn in the body of a 30-year-old Frenchwoman hell-bent on kicking the notion of womanhood around until it’s puree. Letissier has written an album all about these clotted fluid dynamics, set to the squelch of 80s funk the only thing missing from Chris, her second album, is the grease of street food eaten at unlikely hours of the day after some funky bodily exertion.To still refer to the French pop creative as “Héloïse Letissier” seems a little futile when there are such pressing updates. Apparently only her parents still call her that now. To recap: Letissier became Christine of Christine and the Queens when, a heartbroken theatre school dropout, she moved to London in search of a reason to keep going and was given succour by drag queens: the backstory of Chaleur Humaine.For album number two, Letissier has pared back that outré persona – if not quite to the bone, then to the muscle. Honed from dancing Chaleur Humaine around the world on tour, Letissier is now “Chrisssss” – as Girlfriend, the album’s excellent lead single, reintroduced her: a more short-cropped, more buff, pansexual horndog who wants to have all the fun the boys are having, while emoting about it in a way that recalls, at different times, any number of intense French chanteuses, Janet Jackson or Grimes. Doesn’t Matter, one of the finest songs on this ambitious pop album, suggests that “Chris” actually has a fair amount in common with Canadian pop radical Grimes, another cooing female auteur coming at the mainstream from somewhere militantly autonomous. Here, as with Grimes, percussion is used as a weapon none of the lyrics are clichéd top 40 pap. Unlike Grimes, however, Letissier has a bold, synthetic funk payload to commend her, and her lyrics are more obviously personal. She sings about “the suicidal feelings that are still in my head” and – very French, this – “if after the void there is somewhere else to fall”.And that’s just one song. As it winds its way through out-and-out pop tracks – 5 Dollars, the most straightforward tune here – and pretty R\u0026ampB balladry – Make Some Sense – Chris even gives way to yet another identity. What’s-her-face is the title of a more rearward-facing, enigmatic cut. “I’m forever ‘what’s-her-face’,” intones Letissier, processing some long-ago playground trauma she only hints at impressionistically. “It was hard to remember, so my name became a slur.”Chris was written and produced by Letissier, still a feat of enormous will, given how even successful female singers are pressured to mould themselves to the hit-making nous of producers (overwhelmingly male). She had sessions with metrosexuals such as Damon Albarn and Mark Ronson, but Chris is overwhelmingly Letissier’s own work (drum programming, bass, piano, synths, staging) with Dâm-Funk guesting on a couple of tracks – the amazing Girlfriend and Damn (What Must a Woman Do) – and a smattering of musicians fleshing out the sessions. The sole obvious “biz” influence is Cole M Greif-Neill (Beck, Snoop Dogg, Julia Holter), who co-produces.What results is a highly inidual portrait of one singer’s quest to process her newfound confidence: sleep with the people she fancies (“a butch babe in LA” or “a young man fresh asleep The end of our friendship”), to stand her ground and demand, not ask, for more.It’s not without fault. There are tracks so enigmatic you lose the plot. The Stranger features some busy harpsichords, but it’s anybody’s guess what’s on Letissier’s mind: the lyrics feature broncos, Maseratis and water, in a code so opaque it has the air of having just been run through Google translate and stripped of all the nuances of the original French.You fear the worst of a song called Goya Soda, but it’s an earworm of a tune, where Letissier mourns a relationship that never was: a person so elusive that to love him, she sings, was “to scare a mist”. An elegant piano coda fixes it in your mind.She remains a magnificent singer, borrowing from her idols, but always resolutely her Franglish self. Damn (What Must a Woman Do) bends language into juicy phonetics, just more funky sound there are whispered interjections and those Spanish ejaculations. In the biography that journalists receive with the album, Letissier is clear about her obfuscations. “I’m not going to be exactly the queer you want me to be,” she says. “I believe in the question mark more than the answer.” Ultimately, Chris slips and slides, dodging definition."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/496145a0440de2368759bc4bbf5a8cbab7d6d1be/0_110_2832_1699/master/2832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66bdae63232d75f67ecbcdc364410f09","title":"chas and dave hodges a life in pictures","story":"The musician, one half of ‘rockney’ duo Chas and Dave, has died after a short illness• Chas and Dave singer Chas Hodges dies aged 74"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd4f5e16e9150b2f30bbdf34caa66e37382648c0/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=318bcad3ab09ba08363edcd92e32b788","title":"period poverty meet the women behind the campaigns to end it","story":"A growing number of organisations and activists are working to end a phenomenon that’s depriving vulnerable young women of time in education. At the same time, efforts are under way to eliminate tampon tax and taboos around menstruationFrom the time we’re old enough to get our periods, girls can be made to feel ashamed of them. Everyone who sat in a classroom through those strange, secretive years will remember the absolute horror and dread of being caught short or having to ask a teacher for menstrual products. We learn not only to come prepared but to be silent about what’s going on too. It’s second nature for us to conceal the very fact that we have periods at all – hiding tampons and pads on the way to the bathroom, stuffed into pencil cases, bras, sleeves.If it was difficult for those of us fortunate enough to always have these products to hand, it’s shocking to consider the girls among us who are forced by poverty to go without them entirely. Several years ago the concept of period poverty began to rise in public consciousness in the UK. The Ken Loach film I, Daniel Blake, a harrowing account of the realities of poverty in modern Britain, sent awareness of this particular struggle soaring. After its release, food bank managers around England reported that a scene in which a young woman named Katie is forced to shoplift pads sent toiletry donations skyrocketing.Of course, the problem isn’t confined to menstruation when an inidual or a family is living in poverty, it can mean they are forced to choose between eating enough or keeping the lights on and buying all sorts of hygiene essentials. A report by In Kind Direct – an organisation that receives donations from consumer goods companies and distributes them to charities – lists toothpaste, nappies, tampons, razors, deodorant and shampoo as items that had to be foregone by people living in poverty. It is vital that all of these essentials make their way to donation banks. But perhaps one reason that period poverty has especially caught public attention in the past two years is the particular problem of teenage girls, already at economic and social disadvantage, missing out on their education needlessly.Amika George, the teenage campaigner who started the #FreePeriods campaign, became engaged with the issue when she read an article about schoolgirls in Leeds who had been truant on the days of their periods. Concerned teachers had contacted Freedom4Girls, a charity established to provide sanitary products to Kenyan girls and women. Shocked that in modern Britain there were girls forced to choose between missing school and using unsafe alternatives such as socks, toilet paper and rags, George set to work.“I started a petition to call on the government to provide free menstrual products to girls from low-income families, and decided to spread the word and talk unashamedly, not just about period poverty but about menstruation!” she said in an interview with Vogue last year. More shocking to George, and many others, than the problem itself was the fact that nothing was being done about it by the government. Indeed, the fact that sanitary products are taxed as a luxury product means their prices are kept even higher than necessary, blocking more girls from accessing them.At the same time, girlguiding became much more menstruation-positive, with the introduction of a period poverty badge. Guides will be encouraged to discuss this as a social issue, support fundraising for donations, and explore how they feel personally about periods. An activity-led programme of education includes items such as role play of a scenario in which you’ve had a period leak while not at home. Doireann Larkin, the development manager of Tender, a charity that uses drama and the arts to help young people understand healthy relationships, fully supports the initiative: “We need to provide every opportunity for girls to feel confident and secure in school. By failing to address period poverty, we’re denying some girls the chance to focus and participate fully in class and increasing the disadvantage they might already be facing.”Guides will be able to get badges that are decorated with pictures of tampons, pads and menstrual cups, a fact that seems especially encouraging given how previous generations have been taught to hide such images. It’s a strange fact that, until recently, advertising for menstruation products would rarely show the actual product, using isolated fabric samples instead.The Homeless Period Project (HPP) addresses those already at their most vulnerable. While we may understand how desperate a homeless woman’s situation is, we rarely consider the logistical nightmare of menstruating without shelter and access to products. Local chapters of HPP set up their own fundraisers to donate to local shelters.These frontline activists and organisations are crucial. But so too is dismantling the taboo that exists behind all the secrecy and shame. We have to move on from the medieval idea that periods are dirty or not to be spoken of. That’s why young campaigners such as Grace F Victory are so important – she recently collaborated with the Always #EndPeriodPoverty campaign, which has seen the brand donate more than 5m pads directly to schools, a figure that’s estimated to rise to more than 10m donations by the end of the year. After her Instagram post of herself with a menstrual leak lost her hundreds of followers, she spoke out against them. Embarrassment is bad enough in and of itself, but when an inevitable bit of our biology causes us to miss out on daily life, there’s even more need to overcome it. We simply can’t accept that vulnerable young women are being blocked from their education.This is why ending period poverty needs to include taboo busting at its core. We can’t offer help to people too ashamed to ask for it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7ef739b6774f195bdc7c95af7a56bebba7762c9/7_0_1167_700/master/1167.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4df7227ce8218f8f51f310de83d6377b","title":"european press no more forgiving than british over salzburg summit theresa may","story":"If she was hoping for a small crumb of comfort after what the vast majority of the British media saw as a “humiliating” and “disastrous” Salzburg summit, Theresa May did not find it in the pages of the European press.Coverage of the meeting, at which May was bluntly informed that the core components of her Chequers plan “will not work”, was generally focused as much, if not more, on the EU’s disagreements over migration policy as it was on Brexit.But the conclusion of the continental media, few of which made events in Salzburg their top story, was that the prime minister’s predicament was wholly predictable – the EU’s view of Chequers has been known since it was published, many pointed out – and entirely her problem. Commentators were downright scathing.Sheila Sitalsing in the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant said May had “stormed the European continent like a Don Quixote”, Chequers plan and Brexit conditions under her arm: Britain wanted to “keep playing footie and snacking at the canteen, without paying any subs, wearing the club strip or doing bar duty”.The EU27 had “sent her packing in Salzburg”, Sitalsing said, where May had “desperately sought to win sympathy for a Brexit that would not send her population straight back to the Middle Ages”.Her threat that if she was replaced things might get worse “did not impress” EU leaders – but May still seems to believe their hard line “is just a negotiating tactic”. She has got it all wrong: “Poor Theresa May. Poor United Kingdom.”In the Spanish paper El Pais, Álvaro Imbernon Sainz said that since May took office in July 2016, her entire negotiating strategy had been “to postpone decision-making as much as possible, without putting together any kind of clear vision” – but the chickens were now coming home to roost.“The problem is that the differences between the two sides are not technical, but on fundamental principles, and time is beginning to run out,” he said. “Like a bad student who puts off the moment to sit down and study, it’s now up to the UK to make up for lost time.”Britain must “rediscover British pragmatism. For this, the Conservatives, and to a lesser extent Labour, must agree on a coherent and realistic position. Otherwise the historians of the future will be extremely hard on the current British political class”.In France, Le Figaro said May had been “caught in the trap of her ‘it’s me or chaos’” strategy. The prime minister’s Brexit plan was “dead and buried”, the paper said, after she “put her allies up against the wall” by insisting a no deal was the only alternative. “Unfortunately, her plan has met unanimous opposition.”For Le Monde, the EU27 had made plain that “the moment of truth” had come. The bloc’s leaders were “clearly singing from the same hymn sheet” and used the summit to sound the alarm, the paper said: “Brexit talks are in the closing straight – and the EU27 have, for the moment, no intention whatever of softening their stance.”The meeting was above all aimed at “putting maximum pressure on the British prime minister a few days ahead of her party’s annual conference”, it said, adding that the October final deadline set by Donald Tusk, the European council president, for progress on the Irish border was clearly significant.The paper quoted the French president, Emmanuel Macron, saying he had “perfectly summed up” the Europeans’ position on Brexit: Chequers “is not acceptable because it does not respect the integrity of the single market … Leaving the EU cannot be done without costs or consequences.”Tusk “flatly rejected Britain’s plan for future EU-UK trade relations”, wrote Germany’s Die Welt, adding that the EU27 had “categorically thrown out” May’s Chequers plan quite simply “because it fears it would lead to unfair competition from British firms”. Brexit talks, the paper said, “are deadlocked”.The Frankfurter Algemeine Zeitung took the same line, quoting Tusk as saying “May’s Brexit plan will not work” and that negotiations were now at a standstill after “both sides camped firmly on their positions and no agreement was reached”.The Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad said the EU 27 had “approached the British prime minister positively, but given little away”. Britain had “high hopes” of the summit, it said, but “the harvest was meagre”.The EU was walking a tightrope, the paper said: it had to be reasonably positive towards May while not budging, because: “British political drama is the greatest uncertainty around Brexit, and the horror scenario is that whatever is agreed with May proves worthless if she is replaced.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e7b1c630b893a1f544ffd0daaa54ee4ddd4b9b4/0_77_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=044473389bc76ff0448bb7c26968136b","title":"theresa may demands respect from eu in brexit negotiations","story":"PM gives combative speech after rejection of Chequers plan, stoking ‘no deal’ fearsTheresa May has accused the European Union of not treating the UK with respect in a deliberately combative address that prompted a sharp fall in the pound amid fears that it made a no deal Brexit more likely.Twenty-four hours after her Salzburg humiliation, the prime minister gave a hastily arranged televised Downing Street statement in an effort to reassert herself.Speaking from a lectern with two union flags behind her, May tried to accuse her counterparts of bad faith: “I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same. A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.”Her remarks came a day after the Salzburg summit where EU leaders frustrated by May’s insistence on sticking rigidly to her controversial Chequers negotiating plan embarrassed her when the EU council president, Donald Tusk, unexpectedly declared it “would not work”.May retaliated on Friday: “Yesterday, Donald Tusk said our proposals would undermine the single market. He didn’t explain how in any detail or make any counter-proposal. So we are at an impasse.” She called on the EU to spell out “what their alternative is”.But Tusk, the European council president, hit back hard at the prime minister, accusing her of bringing a “surprisingly tough and in fact uncompromising” attitude to the Salzburg summit. He denied May’s claims that the EU had failed to explain its position to the British negotiators, claiming to have spelled out the problems in detail in recent weeks, although he insisted that “a compromise, good for all, is still possible”.Despite the heated rhetoric and plunge in sterling, EU officials are understood to be working on a counter-proposal to the Chequers plan, which is likely to appear in early October, after the Conservative party conference and a week before a make or break Brexit summit in Brussels.No 10 is calculating May can win support by appearing to stand up to the EU, although her critics in the party believe this would be the moment to give up the Chequers plan, or risk facing hostile activists at the party’s annual conference in just over a week.Several cabinet ministers put out statements of support. Penny Mourdant, the international development secretary, again emphasised the possibility of a no deal, saying that while voters “still want a deal” they would be “content to go without one, even folk who voted remain”.But Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the European Reform Group of hard Brexit Tories, said that Salzburg was a failure and repeated that it was time to abandon Chequers. “There is still no reason to suppose that Chequers can work either for the UK or the EU.”Chequers proposes that the UK shares a common rulebook for goods and services after Brexit in an attempt to prevent a return of customs checks for goods crossing the Irish border, a plan so unpopular on the right of the Tory party that Boris Johnson and David Davis resigned rather than support it.That would imply the UK would have to align itself more broadly to EU rules after Brexit to avoid a return to a hard border in Ireland, a proposal that could be difficult for May to sell to her party.Hard Brexiters will step up their campaign against Chequers in the run up to the Tory party conference on Monday. D Davis and other senior rightwing politicians are expected to attend an event at which alternative “Canada plus” trade proposals will be announced.The EU, however, has said that while it would be prepared to discuss a Canada-style deal, that would mean not just taking the UK out of the single market and customs union, it would also mean the return of border controls in Ireland.The prime minister also signalled that the UK would unilaterally safeguard the rights of the EU citizens living in the country in an attempt to reassure them that the impasse in negotiations would not affect their status.“There are over 3 million EU citizens living in the UK who will be understandably worried about what the outcome of yesterday’s summit means for their future. I want to be clear with you that even in the event of no deal your rights will be protected. You are our friends, our neighbours, our colleagues. We want you to stay,” May said.Ministers are expected to confirm details in a couple of weeks, after the party conference season.The prime minister repeatedly rejected an EU backstop proposal that would see Northern Ireland remain inside the customs union if the UK was unable to agree a free trade agreement with Brussels in the orce talks.Ratcheting up the language on the issue, May said: “It is something I will never agree to – indeed, in my judgment it is something no British prime minister would ever agree to. If the EU believe I will, they are making a fundamental mistake.”In a rare direct criticism of a serving prime minister, Tusk made reference to the criticisms of Michel Barnier by the British government, and the refusal of the British side to work on a solution to the Irish border issue by October, as previously promised.“The UK stance presented just before and during the Salzburg meeting was surprisingly tough and in fact uncompromising”, he said. “The response of the EU27 leaders was to reiterate our trust in chief negotiator Michel Barnier and to reiterate our position on the integrity of the single market and the Irish backstop.But he added: “While understanding the logic of the negotiations, I remain convinced that a compromise, good for all, is still possible. I say these words as a close friend of the UK and a true admirer of PM May.” Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, criticised both the prime minister and the EU: “Theresa May’s Brexit negotiating strategy has been a disaster. The Tories have spent more time arguing among themselves than negotiating with the EU.“From day one, the prime minister has looked incapable of delivering a good Brexit deal for Britain. The political games from both the EU and our government need to end because no deal is not an option.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9d9fe18be0b96ce694651ed7e8f1db6b2ebcb41/0_128_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76196bf78d929ee32964f393a358ef34","title":"dawn butler sparks militant controversy at labour conference","story":"Shadow equalities minister spoke approvingly of far-left Labour faction’s resistance to cuts in the 1980sDawn Butler has spoken approvingly about Labour’s controversial former Militant wing, saying that when it came to austerity it was “better to break the law than break the poor”.In the early 1980s, some Labour councillors deliberately set council budgets in excess of the limits imposed by central government.The tactic was condemned at the 1985 party conference, where then leader Neil Kinnock denounced “the grotesque chaos of a Labour council – a Labour council – hiring taxis to scuttle round a city handing out redundancy notices to its own workers”.His intervention was a key moment in the drive to break the far-left Militant group’s hold over parts of the party, which ended with the expulsion of figures including Liverpool council’s deputy leader Derek Hatton.Speaking at the party’s women’s conference, Butler said: “Conference, we are in Liverpool where over 30 years ago the council stood up to Thatcher and said – better to break the law than break the poor.”She called on the party to stand firm against cuts to domestic violence refuges, which she described as a “lifeline to the most vulnerable”, ahead of the launch of Labour’s annual conference on Sunday.Butler’s remarks courted controversy. Richard Angell, the director of Progress, Labour’s centre-left movement, said: “Dawn Butler’s speech is like a lesson from the Ken Livingstone academy for revisionist history. The Militant Tendency did break the law, left the bills to be picked up by the poor and kept the Tories in power for 12 years more.“Labour should look up the local government leaders of today who deliver socialism, not those from 30 years ago who discredited socialism.‬”Glenys Thornton, the shadow Lords health minister and a former equalities minister, tweeted:In 2015, Jeremy Corbyn urged Labour councils not to set illegal budgets in response to local government cuts.Brandon Lewis MP, the Conservative party chairman, said: “This is the sorry state of Labour today: shadow cabinet members praising the hard-left militants of the 1980s. Militant-controlled Liverpool of the 1980s boasted it was better to ‘break the law, than break the poor’, but ran out of money and was forced to sack its own workers.“As Neil Kinnock said himself at the time: you can’t play politics with people’s jobs and people’s homes and people’s services. Labour has learnt nothing from the past and would take the country back to bankruptcy, job losses and worse public services.”A Labour party spokesperson said: “The point Dawn was making was that, like the Thatcher government of the 1980s, this Tory government has prioritised tax cuts for the rich while cutting services like women’s refuges that save lives and keep women safe. Labour will invest in our communities to rebuild Britain for the many not the few.”She pointed to new employment laws introduced in the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand that granted victims the right to paid leave.She also announced that a Labour government would “acknowledge intersectionality”. She said: “The Conservatives have had seven different equality ministers tagged on to four different departments and a budget that’s almost been halved.“This proves the Tories are not taking equalities seriously.”She said intersectionality was “about how different layers of discrimination interact with each other. For example, our laws do not recognise the fact that black women can be discriminated against because they are both black and a woman or a woman being discriminated against because of her age and gender or disability and gender.”Labour want to change that and amend section 14 of the Equality Act, “so people can bring forward cases on multiple grounds of discrimination”, she told the conference."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63beca449c6db725027bf7334a55a37daba30ba1/0_142_3437_2062/master/3437.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45f68e2028cda95a68afb39b56b38cd3","title":"jeremy corbyn young labour activists party conference corbynista brexit","story":"Young members back the leader, but Brexit is a faultlineFive young Labour activists – all of whom voted for Jeremy Corbyn and back the grassroots revival – talk about the party, their politics and why they joined. But after a summer of rows over Brexit and antisemitism, is their support for their\u0026nbspleader and would-be prime minister still solid?It was the former Labour leader Ed Miliband’s 2013 conference speech that inspired Dillon, then 18, to join the party, but it is the consistent swerve “back to the left, to what the party first stood for” that has the founder of Skipton Young Labour hooked.Now studying history and politics at the University of Hull, Dillon has seen himself go from “a curiosity” at local branch meetings, where he was always the youngest person in the room, to being part of a passionate, lively movement. “We knocked on doors and campaigned so hard in 2014, that we achieved our first Labour councillor in Craven district council in 20 years,” he says, proudly. “I was at the count and it was a fantastic night, it put that flame, that spark of hope that you can change things.”Dillon, whose dad works as an immigration officer and whose mum is a domestic cleaner, travelled to the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in central London to see Corbyn elected Labour leader in 2015.The charges of antisemitism within the party have been upsetting, he says. “We have a proud tradition of solidarity and standing up to racism and there is no room for antisemitism.” It is essential that the party “are actively rooting out and expelling those iniduals”, but he finds it “a disgrace that nothing at all has happened about the Tories’ Islamophobia”.Khan has already worked on two general election campaigns, been a local councillor representing his home ward in Kirklees, and spent nine months in Brussels working on education policy with trade unions across Europe. The late MP Jo Cox was his mentor. “She was really welcoming and invited me to a campaign session to learn the ropes and encouraged me to get involved with the trade union movement,” he says. Khan chats to me over the phone from his bedroom in Manchester, where he is studying politics and modern history. He grew up in Liversedge, West Yorkshire, on the same street – “just two doors down” – from where his mum, a teaching assistant, was born.“My family have always voted Labour but they weren’t massively involved.” Khan is a GMB trade union rep, a communications officer and an activist for Batley Labour. For him, like many of his peers, “Corbyn is a breath of fresh air because he’s shown the country that it doesn’t have to be the way it is.”Khan believes wholeheartedly in Corbyn’s politics. “He has bold economic policies, he has made a different political environment and he listens to people – see him in PMQs when he asks questions people have raised with him.”Khan is keen to see how the question of a second referendum will play out at party conference. “I’m a trade unionist and our line is that a final Brexit deal should be put to the public.”He plays down the isions within the party that are blamed on Corbyn. As for Momentum, he is impressed but hasn’t joined. “They’re doing a good job of mobilising and creating a mass movement. Their events – such as taking a festival approach at a traditional party conference – are a really good thing.”Khan wants his party “to keep making a difference to working people’s lives”. So, what now? “Focus on taking the Tories to task on a daily basis. Believe in the vision Corbyn puts forward for Britain.”Growing up as a Tumblr teen, many of the theories that shaped Mirwitch’s ideas on race, feminism and class came from essays and memes shared on an idiosyncratic corner of the internet. She is articulate, thoughtful and passionate as the chair of London Young Labour and a proud Jewish socialist.“I’m not a Corbynite,” she says, near apologetic. “I’m a Labourite, I don’t believe in factions. I didn’t back Corbyn originally because I thought he lacked credibility and was on a different page to where the public was.” She laughs. “I’m proud to have been proved wrong. Jeremy speaks really well and he’s straight-talking. Politically, I agree with his policies and so much of what he says and the 2017 general election proved people really believed in his vision.” What initially put her off? “Everything I was reading. The headlines – what people were saying about us being out of government for 1,000 years.”Mirwitch joined the Labour party at 16, after the coalition government came in, angry and frustrated at increases in tuition fees and cuts to the education maintenance allowance. Born in west London to a midwife and postman, now both retired, she went to the London School of Economics to read social policy and promptly got involved in student activism. “I really enjoyed it it changed my view of how we can organise and campaign. Knocking on people’s doors and seeing how you could change people’s minds was really inspiring.”What has she made of the party’s antisemitism crisis? “I don’t think Corbyn handled it wrongly,” she says, “but things could have been dealt with quicker. It’s always been an issue but it is a positive that people are talking about it and seem to care in a way they didn’t when Ken Livingstone repeatedly made his comments.” Sadiq Khan, she thinks, “is a fantastic example of how to rebuild the trust with the Jewish community”.For Mirwitch, the future is undoubtedly a socialist, Corbyn-led Labour. “It’s difficult as a young person in Britain today to be a Tory,” she says. “You look at the housing market we see the degradation of all our services, the effects of cuts… How can you support a leader like Theresa May or Boris Johnson running around being so awful unless you come from huge privilege?”Milligan is furious with the Labour leadership. The acting student and activist joined the party when she was in sixth form, initially inspired by Corbyn. “The default laziness was that I knew I would always vote Labour,” she says. Milligan stops to explain that she comes from “a long line of lefties”. Both her parents, who “met in communist Prague”, work for trade unions and both of her late grandfathers were former trade union general secretaries.“I didn’t think I needed to join Labour as a member, but actually, when Jeremy became leader, I felt really represented. The ideas he was talking about, like his view on using quantitative easing to fund public services, on nationalising the railways, they were economically transformative – but yes, I am disillusioned now,” she says, sighing. “I don’t feel represented any more.”Milligan says her friends from home often tell her to shut up when she talks about Brexit, but notes: “Even they’ve started talking about it when they found out Wetherspoons weren’t going to sell Jägermeister any more.”To her it’s clear that Corbyn and McDonnell “need to stop looking back at the EU as it was perceived in the Tony Benn years as a club for fat cats. They need to realise the Labour movement has made the EU work for us, we have turned it round and made it the bedrock of rights that no UK government can overturn on its own.”Little seemed more difficult to Cobb than getting her dissertation done. But as she worked in the university library through the night of the 2015 general election, something snapped. “I felt so frustrated watching the live coverage and knew I wanted to make a difference there and then.” She joined the Labour party – “I literally had to Google how to do it” – and has since become an active member of young Labour in Stourbridge, in the West Midlands, galvanised in large part by Corbyn.Has her support for Corbyn ever wavered? “No, not at all. He’s human! Look at him and his politics and what he says. Anyone who thinks the Labour party as a whole is antisemitic or that Jeremy is racist …” she pauses, exasperated. “It’s unfounded.”Cobb has made many new friends since she became politically active. “I didn’t know much before,” she admits, “but I’m also a Momentum member now as well and their meetings are really informative and you get a range of people from throughout the borough.”Some 15 to 20 members get together every month and Cobb has become a campaigner on everything from animal welfare to school cuts. “We had a lot of interest leafleting outside different schools,” she says. “We put together numbers on all the funding cuts affecting inidual schools and a lot of concerned parents got in touch.” For her, the future of the party lies in grassroots activism because “it engages local communities. Issues like homelessness, which is huge, need to be addressed by government but by us on the ground, too.” As for the party’s near future, Cobb is certain: “I can see Jeremy becoming the next prime minister.”• Additional reporting by Lindsay Riley"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/5/1399294269797/Libby-Brooks.jpg?width=140\u0026amp;height=140\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c24da21f9bbc736be7bad58838a7214d\" alt=\"Libby Brooks","title":"theresa may makes statement outside no 10","story":"Prime minister says UK needs to hear from EU on what real alternatives areThat’s all from the blog today, thanks so much for your comments. You can read the full story here:Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon has described May’s statement as “dreadful” and her tactics “hugely damaging”.“The Prime Minister’s statement was dreadful. The EU’s view of the Chequers plan was bluntly and clearly expressed in Salzburg yesterday, but should not have come as a surprise to the UK Government, given that it was not a new position.“Clearly, the Prime Minister has not been listening – Chequers is a dead duck but if her tactic now is to try and double down on those proposals and then seek to blame the EU for a no-deal outcome, then she will do huge damage to all of those she is supposed to serve.“It would be an abdication of responsibility of huge and historic proportions and an approach for which Theresa May and the Tory party would pay a very heavy political price, especially in Scotland, which overwhelmingly rejected Brexit and whose interests in this process have been ignored at every turn by the UK Government.“What the latest development shows more clearly than ever is that the only remotely workable way for Brexit to happen is for the UK to stay in the single market and customs union. If the Prime Minister is not prepared to do that, then Brexit shouldn’t happen. A ‘No deal’ or ‘no detail‘ Brexit are simply not acceptable – particularly for Scotland, where we did not vote for any of this.”Yesterday, Sturgeon wrote to the leaders of the UK’s opposition parties asking them to join her in pressing for an extension to next March’s deadline for leaving the EU to avoid “an economic cliff edge”.Cabinet ministers have been responding on Twitter, including some warning the EU in stronger terms.The Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who has been an advocate for a soft Brexit, said she has spoken to May this afternoon and been reassured of her commitment to get a negotiated deal.Business leaders have reacted with some alarm to the comments by the prime minister on the distance between the two sides.CBI director Carolyn Fairbairn said negotiators on both sides must change tack. “Rejection of Chequers helps nobody,” she said. “Pragmatism must come before politics. Every day lost in rhetoric is lost investment and lost jobs.”Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), also reproached both sides for the impasse. “While the Prime Minister’s determination to reach a deal is appreciated, businesses tell us over and over that the time for posturing from both sides is over,” he said. “Many firms are hugely worried about a messy and disorderly outcome, and the potential impact on their ability to trade and grow. Others could be caught flat-footed. Both sides must make every effort to avoid this scenario.”Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the European Reform Group of hard Brexit Tories, said the summit was a “failure” and that the EU was not acting in good faith. However, he praised the prime minister, saying she had showed “steely resolve.”He said it was time to admit the Chequers plan would not work for both the EU and the UK and start making plans for a Canada-style free trade deal. May made it clear in her speech that the EU has said it cannot countenance such a deal without Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union to prevent customs checks on the border.“It is time for the government to start putting forward as its plan a Canada-style free trade agreement for the whole of the UK. This is the most realistic approach and similar to the EU’s proposal,” he said. “Moreover, as every vote in parliament has so far shown, it is the one way which could command a majority in the House of Commons.“On the matter of the UK’s border with Ireland, the EU can have the solutions proposed by the ERG that respect the integrity of the Single Market and which have been supported by the DUP,” he said.“The Prime Minister has shown steely resolve at the eleventh hour and is standing up to the EU bullies. The next step is to say to the EU £40 billion and free trade or World Trade terms.”The pound is on course for its biggest one-day drop in 2018 against the dollar, after Theresa May said Brexit negotiations with the EU had reached an “impasse”.Traders took fright as May’s comments were taken as a sign that a no deal Brexit is an increasingly likely outcome of talks, creating uncertainty which unsettles traders.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said that “no deal is not an option” and slammed the government’s negotiating tactics. However, his response does not include a demand that May drop her current plans and, interestingly, also calls on the EU to end the “political games.”Theresa May’s Brexit negotiating strategy has been a disaster. The Tories have spent more time arguing among themselves than negotiating with the EU.From day one, the Prime Minister has looked incapable of delivering a good Brexit deal for Britain. The political games from both the EU and our Government need to end because no deal is not an option.EU sources were relaxed about May’s speech. They see it as as a “positioning” ahead of the Tory party conference after what they see as a self-inflicted wound in Salzburg.May’s demands that the EU come up with alternative proposals are seen as domestic politicking as the EU’s position in Brexit has been clear from the outset.While May’s failure to come with a proposal on the Irish border nine months after agreeing to one incensed EU leaders, it is said that it was Downing Street’s briefing to British journalists that some member states were being more sympathetic to the UK than others that prompted Macron to intervene. Nigel Dodds, deputy leader of the DUP who back up May’s minority government, said there was “utter inflexibility and bullying tactics” from the EU. He said the EU was not negotiating in good faith or within the parameters of the Belfast agreement. “It seems to be their way or no way,” he told the BBC. He said there would be no regulatory barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK that the DUP could accept.Dodds said the issue of Northern Ireland had been “abused” by remainers and EU leaders. “The border issue has been elevated to a far greater extent than it should,” he said. The Lib Dems are the first out of the traps to comment on the prime minister’s statement. The party’s Brexit spokesman Tom Brake says May should recall parliament, an idea unlikely to be popular with Labour who have their party conference next week.Two years down the line and the only consensus the PM has made across Parliament and the EU is that Chequers is unworkable,” he said. Instead of pontificating to television cameras, May must now recall Parliament to explain how she got the country into this terrible mess, what her plan is to get us out of it, and when we can have a people’s vote and an exit from Brexit.Here’s some more of the reaction:From the New Statesman’s Stephen BushFrom the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg:From the ’s Jennifer Rankin:From the WSJ’s Bojan Pancevski:Here are some of the key quotes from May’s statement in Downing Street. On the progress of the negotiations:I have always said that these negotiations would be tough - and they were always bound to be toughest in the final straight. While both sides want a deal, we have to face up to the fact that - despite the progress we have made - there are two big issues where we remain a long way apart. In plain English, this would mean we’d still have to abide by all the EU rules, uncontrolled immigration from the EU would continue and we couldn’t do the trade deals we want with other countries. That would make a mockery of the referendum we had two years ago. On a Canada-style free trade deal and a customs border down the Irish Sea: It is something I will never agree to - indeed, in my judgement it is something no British Prime Minister would ever agree to. If the EU believe I will, they are making a fundamental mistake.On the Irish backstop:The EU is proposing to achieve this by effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the Customs Union. As I have already said, that is unacceptable. We will never agree to it. It would mean breaking up our country. We will set out our alternative that preserves the integrity of the UK. On red lines in the negotiations:As I told EU leaders, neither side should demand the unacceptable of the other. We cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of our union, just as they cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of theirs. We cannot accept anything that does not respect the result of the referendum, just as they cannot accept anything that is not in the interest of their citizens.On her treatment in SalzburgThroughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same. A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.At this late stage in the negotiations, it is not acceptable to simply reject the other side’s proposals without a detailed explanation and counter proposals.On the referendum result: The referendum was the largest democratic exercise this country has ever undergone. To deny its legitimacy or frustrate its result threatens public trust in our democracy. That is why for over two years I have worked day and night to deliver a deal that sees the UK leave the EU. I have worked to bring people with me even when that has not always seemed possible.On the prospect of no deal:No one wants a good deal more than me. But the EU should be clear: I will not overturn the result of the referendum. Nor will I break up my country. We need serious engagement on resolving the two big problems in the negotiations. We stand ready.

As the club’s fly-half Danny Cipriani ponders his latest omission from an England squad before a confrontation on Sunday at Allianz Park with Saracens and Owen Farrell, one of the players preferred to him, he can reflect on what the letter B stands for: belong.The 30-year-old has spent most of his international career as an outside-half on the outside. He has started only one match for England since 2008, the final Test against South Africa this summer when he helped secure victory with a typically sublime moment of skill, an act that a number of former internationals assumed would cement his place in the squad. But Cipriani will not be at England’s training camp in Bristol this coming week.Eddie Jones will be in Bristol, preparing for the camp, rather than at Saracens for a contest between two of the three unbeaten teams in the Premiership after the first three rounds. Unusually for England’s head coach, his replies were opaque when he was asked why he had left out Cipriani.The Australian cited club form as a factor but Cipriani’s range of passing and ability to scent openings have been vital in Gloucester’s two victories and a draw in the first three Premiership rounds. Jones also said that limited time in training meant it would be unproductive to have more than two fly-halves, but he has chosen three scrum-halves and that there was no legacy from the South Africa tour – but the two tighthead props who played in the Tests there have been preferred to the experienced Dan Cole.“I have told Danny what he needs to work on and that conversation will remain private,” said Jones before supplying a clue as to why George Ford and Farrell were contesting the No 10 jersey. “I watch three club games a weekend. There are things you do not see on television.”Jones was referring to the contribution of players throughout the 80 minutes rather than one brilliant and conspicuous moment, such as Cipriani’s pass to Charlie Sharples on the opening weekend against Northampton and his kick for Jonny May in Cape Town in June that ensured a run of five successive defeats ended.Cipriani is not competing with Farrell for a place in the squad. Jones’s Plan A is to have Ford at 10 and Farrell at 12. Plan B sees Farrell move to 10 with a more muscular presence outside him, such as Ben Te’o or the fit again Manu Tuilagi. The choice is between Ford, virtually a fixture in the side since Jones’s arrival, or Cipriani.Both thrive on quick ball but, while Ford likes to be constantly involved, Cipriani prefers to time his interventions, sometimes not touching the ball for a number of phases, materialising when the gainline has been breached: rugby’s Mesut Özil. Jones judges players not on a moment, such as that under-pressure kick for May in Cape Town, but on overall contribution to a match.“England are fortunate to have three outside-halves of such quality,” says the Gloucester head coach, Johan Ackermann, whose club does not have a player in Jones’s 36-strong squad. “Danny is still learning the way we want to play and knowing what he can do excites me. You want to have him in a team because of his ability as well as his passion for the game and commitment. He is a team man who has bought into our values and culture.”Ackermann is a close friend of England’s new defence coach, John Mitchell, after their time together with the Lions in South Africa. For all Mitchell’s reputation as a disciplinarian, his New Zealand side in the 2003 World Cup had a maverick at fly-half, Carlos Spencer. Before they met Australia in the semi-final Jones, then the Wallabies’ head coach, predicted Spencer would crack under pressure, which he did when throwing a pass that was intercepted by Stirling Mortlock and converted into a try. Mitchell’s response was that he did not want a machine at fly-half.Cipriani yearns to play in a World Cup and probably has one chance left. It is his desire that keeps the dream alive, even if the dream is currently in intensive care. At his first media conference after taking charge of England, Jones said he expected players to be desperate to play for their country and he picked Cipriani in the summer after the player turned down a payday in France to remain in the Premiership and in contention.His last game for Wasps was at Saracens last May in the play‑offs. The home side won 57-33, having scored 62 points against Gloucester the week before. “It will be a measure of how far we have come since then,” says Ackermann. “We let ourselves down that day and there will be no excuses this time. It will be a great test and we have to make sure we get good ball to allow Danny to flourish.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac72ac7122193ff2772e20c6ba66cd9aaaa11e68/0_36_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0ea19e5565ae0517611f4f363d21680","title":"tiger woods tour championship justin rose rory mcilroy","story":"• Woods takes three-shot lead into Tour Championship finale• Rose and McIlroy leading the charge from the 30-man fieldThe moment the golf world has been waiting for – not long after it collectively doubted it could ever happen – is tantalisingly close. Tiger Woods, seeking a first win for five years after waves of personal and professional turmoil, will take a three-shot lead into the final round of the Tour Championship at East Lake. Woods’s 80th PGA Tour success, if it comes, will unquestionably be his most significant.Woods’s 12-under-par aggregate sees Justin Rose and a resurgent Rory McIlroy as his closest challengers. A Saturday 65 for Woods was the lowest in the 30-man field. More significant is his position at the head of affairs history tells us Woods does not slip up from here. In the present, however, he has the pressure attached to looking to secure such a long-awaited success.Day three saw traces of vintage Woods. Starting in a share of the lead with Rose, the 14-times major champion rattled home birdie putts in six of his first seven holes. His advantage stretched to five before a loose tee shot at the par-three 9th triggered a bogey. Rose, who made a bogey at the opening hole as Woods converted from 30ft for a birdie, was amongst those battered by a Tiger tsunami. Woods’s putting was imperious, his driving – such a problem earlier in this comeback run – wonderfully accurate.Rose’s bogey at the 14th as Woods tapped in for par afforded the 42-year-old a lead of five. There was woe for Woods two holes later after an approach shot missed the green to the right and a subsequent flop shot failed to reach the putting surface. Woods departed the 16th green having taken a bogey five, in itself a consequence of an outstanding second chip. Rose’s birdie ensured a two-shot swing. Woods, though, was to earn himself more breathing space before stepping from the final green.McIlroy’s 66 was his best round of the week. It affords him a Sunday tee time with Woods for only the second time. On the occasion of the first, at the 2015 Masters, neither player was in contention to win. McIlroy is a threat to Woods, all right the Northern Irishman prevailed at East Lake in 2016. “All I can do is worry about myself,” said McIlroy. “It doesn’t matter who it is I’m playing with. It’s obviously exciting for the golf tournament. It’s exciting for golf in general that he’s up there. But for me, all I can do is concentrate on myself.”Rose has wider reason to keep Woods within view. The Englishman, recently installed as the world No 1, retains a live chance of winning the FedEx Cup and associated $10m bonus even if he falls short at the Tour Championship."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1038456ae07419fc28a1a184546363f9db9921c/0_113_4530_2717/master/4530.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e6ff3e92bb04fc115c3a02ade08e261","title":"anthony joshua knocks out alexander povetkin in pictures","story":"Anthony Joshua beats Alexander Povetkin in seven rounds to retain his IBF, WBA Super, WBO \u0026amp IBO heavyweight titles"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99e7e7cadd650c8ebdcc55942269da790c57fba4/1143_1513_2646_1587/master/2646.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81e8734b23096a4fa533bf37baa12b75","title":"range rover velar suv feels like the flagship model review martin love","story":"Designed to fill the space between the Evoque and and the larger Range Rover Sport, the exceptional Velar comfortably exceeds its briefNorfolk is proud of its big beaches and bigger skies. Walk out towards the sea along any of the cockle paths that zigzag across the marshes and you feel yourself dwarfed in an immense world. The scale is dizzying. It’s beautiful. It’s also odd as almost everything else in Norfolk is tiny. We rented a titchy cottage, ate in dinky cafés, drank in one-room pubs, even travelled on a model train. This might explain why someone took exception to the car we were driving. Returning to the beach car park one evening someone had used a wet finger to write in the dust on its grey flank: “You are too big! 4 x 4 F-off!” It says a lot about the good people of Norfolk that they were too polite to spell out the rude word.They had a point. The car park was filled with large SUVs, all of them over-engineered for the menial task at hand. They faced nothing more arduous than a pothole or two and a grassy track. But still, the demand for SUVs in the UK soars. They are what Brits love to drive. So it’s with regret that this review is only going to make the situation worse by placing more temptation in your way.The car that had been scrawled on was the new Range Rover Velar. It’s a peculiar name, but it isn’t the result of a few glasses of wine and a bag of fridge-magnet letters – there is some history to it. When Land Rover developed the original Range Rover in the 1960s, it wanted to conceal its identity. The project was named Velar from the Latin word “velare”, meaning to cover or hide. Half a century later, this Range Rover Velar is a graceful, glamorous, debonair five-door SUV with absolutely nothing to hide. It’s been designed to sit between the entry-level Evoque and the posher Range Rover Sport. But it’s so well designed that you wonder if there has been some dim-witted admin blunder and that the car should in fact be the luxury brand’s new flagship.The Velar is the most road-biased Range Rover yet. It has a four-wheel drive system but mostly it’s a rear-wheel drive vehicle that brings in the front when needed. There’s no low-ratio gearbox. On the road, which is where most Velars will spend their working lives, it cruises rather than drives. It’s hard not to feel cocooned from your cares and woes. The styling is sleek and futuristic. It has super-slim Matrix Laser-LED headlights and flush deployable door handles which ease out to greet you as you approach. Both are hallmarks of Range Rover’s reductionist design philosophy. The clutter-free dashboard is fully digital, with two large touchscreen panels. It is available with a choice of six engines, ranging from the responsive 180PS 2-litre Ingenium diesel to the potent 380PS supercharged 3-litre V6 petrol engine. I drove the 2-litre version and managed more than 40 miles per gallon which, in a loaded car, was the one piece of good news my wallet received that week.The Velar is designed, engineered and manufactured in the UK. Sorry Norfolk, it’s also going to be an SUV that will sell very well in the UK, too.Email Martin at\u0026nbspmartin.love@observer\u0026nbspor follow him on Twitter\u0026nbsp@MartinLove166"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0412ad915a2ed0f8db2b357385abf3d17805b35/0_218_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64c09f0bea182fef25b07a9246ec39ac","title":"beto orourke ted cruz debate texas senate democrat republican","story":"Turning the Lone Star state blue is a Democratic dream. And so, on Friday night in Dallas, the Republican came out fightingIt underlines America’s strange and turbulent political moment that the highest-profile and most intriguing battle in November’s midterm elections is in one of the most predictably Republican states.“We have a real race in the state of Texas,” the Republican senator Ted Cruz said during a bruising debate with Beto O’Rourke on Friday. “The hard left is energised, they are angry, many of them are filled with hatred for President Trump.”Less than three years ago, before Donald Trump surged clear, Cruz was arguably the favourite for the Republican presidential nomination. Now he faces a scrap to keep his Senate seat amid swelling Democratic optimism that a “blue wave” can gain a majority in the House of Representatives and perhaps even the Senate.Democrats need to pick up two seats to take the Senate, though the House is a more realistic target. Winning back either chamber would help them stymie Trump’s agenda and show they are in a strong position to win the White House in 2020.Challenging Cruz is O’Rourke, a charismatic politician from the border city of El Paso who was a virtual unknown a year ago. Cruz is the frontrunner but O’Rourke has the momentum and attention.Recent polls range from a nine-point Cruz lead to a two-point O’Rourke edge. On Friday, a few hours before the pair’s hour-long head-to-head in Dallas, the respected Cook Political Report newsletter shifted the race from “lean Republican” to “toss-up”.A US congressman of Irish heritage who is giving up a safe House seat, O’Rourke is a tall, trim, handsome figure whose appearance is often compared with Robert Kennedy. Arrested in his 20s for burglary and driving while intoxicated (though not convicted), he played guitar in a punk band and ran an internet business before turning to politics.The 45-year-old has become the political equivalent of a rock star, holding standing room-only rallies attended by thousands, inspiring fawning profiles and being feted by left-leaning celebrities in Hollywood and New York.The Texas GOP looked fusty when they mocked O’Rourke for skateboarding in the car park of a Whataburger fast-food restaurant last month. And his cool credentials were boosted when Willie Nelson, the venerable Texan country music legend, revealed plans to headline a pro-O’Rourke gig in Austin.The race is one of several surprisingly tight contests in Texas this year as the increasingly erse demographics of urban areas mix with determined resistance to Trumpism and the concerns of some moderate Republicans.Texas’ four biggest cities, Houston, San Antonio, Dallas and Austin, all voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. But suburban and rural areas remained firmly Republican, handing Trump a nine-point victory.Texas is the second-most populous state behind solidly-blue California: flipping it is a Democrat’s dream. Republicans have been so dominant – a Democrat last won a statewide race in 1994 – that Democrats have struggled to find talented and well-funded candidates. Yet despite pledging to take only small contributions from iniduals, O’Rourke has out-raised Cruz, netting an impressive $24m.“It’s clear that O’Rourke is a unique figure and has a presence that has stimulated Democrats,” said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston. “I also think it does suggest that there is a rising tide of dissatisfaction with Republicans and some of the policies, especially with Donald Trump.“The importance of the race is that as more Democrats begin to awaken you may see Texas drifting towards competitive in a presidential race which will lock the Democrats at the presidential level for a long time. In short, if Texas goes blue, no Republican can ever win the presidency until there’s some other major change.”In a sign of his concern, Cruz – who called Trump “utterly amoral”, a “pathological liar” and a “sniveling coward” not long before endorsing him for president – has invited Trump to ride to the rescue with a rally next month. In 2016, Trump baselessly linked Cruz’s father to the assassination of John F Kennedy and retweeted an unflattering photo of Cruz’s wife, Heidi, with an image of his own wife, Melania, a former model.“I’m picking the biggest stadium in Texas we can find,” Trump tweeted in August. “Ted has my complete and total Endorsement. His opponent is a disaster for Texas.”During campaign stops typically conducted at calorific barbecue joints, Cruz has depicted O’Rourke as a radical Bernie Sanders-style socialist who wants to introduce deranged policies such as healthcare for all, banning the sale of military-style rifles, combating climate change, not cutting taxes for rich people and reforming the immigration system to make it more humane.O’Rourke has largely avoided talking about Cruz and Trump, preferring to preach a gospel of inclusivity and consensus. On Friday, that strategy took a battering.While O’Rourke backed a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, Cruz enthused over Trump’s planned border wall. As O’Rourke advocated background checks for gun buyers, Cruz insisted school shootings are caused not by guns but by “removing God from the public square”.O’Rourke backed the right of American football players to protest police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem. As for the recent fatal shooting of an unarmed black man in Dallas by a white officer who claimed she mistook his apartment for her own and thought he was a burglar?When each man was asked at the end to offer something positive about his opponent, O’Rourke praised Cruz’s commitment to public service and empathised with the toll that travel and long hours take on family life. Cruz replied in the same vein before inserting a backhanded compliment.“I think you are absolutely sincere, like Bernie, that you believe in expanding government and higher taxes and I commend you for fighting for what you believe in.”“True to form,” O’Rourke muttered darkly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8b751bc95cfd9ab9d699a11a0defc98a0044637/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65ef4a5eebcbf265f03db77dbba69bd5","title":"what masculinity means when youre gay bi or trans ","story":"We’re in the middle of a ‘genderquake’ where the qualities traditionally associated with men are changing daily. So how do three LGBT guys define manliness in 2018?Here, three men – one gay, one bisexual and one trans – reveal what modern masculinity means to them.Throughout my school years I felt that I couldn’t do anything right. I was always a very dainty child, and growing up on a council estate I felt like an alien who’d been dropped down from outer space. I had a girlie voice and feminine mannerisms, and everything I did was jumped on.When I went to university, I started to get good-looking girlfriends, and people left me alone, but I was still repressing myself. Being with women didn’t feel quite right I just didn’t want to be gay.Eventually, at 24, I came out and life began. But even though I’d started to care less about conforming, I still battled with a lot of internalised homophobia. In the gay community, masculine men are seen as more attractive, so again I ended up compromising myself.I still have days where I’m conscious of my behaviour being “too” effeminate, especially when I’m in a professional capacity or meeting someone for the first time, but I’ve become more accepting of myself with time. Sometimes I feel sorry for straight men who can cry at a football match but would feel embarrassed and unmanly telling their partner they love them – I think that’s really sad.In a way it’s quite freeing that it’s generally OK for a gay man to be seen as emotional, and that it isn’t seen as a sign of weakness. I think straight people can benefit from having an LGBT friend, because we have a different perspective, informed by our experiences. In a way, I’m glad that I haven’t necessarily had the easiest ride, because it’s made me a more rounded person.When I was single and using dating apps, I found that things would be going well until I mentioned that I dated both men and women – then women would stop replying or suddenly realise that they weren’t over their ex.My girlfriend gets strange comments, like, “Are you the one dating a gay guy?”, and my masculinity has definitely felt under attack at times. I’ve found myself wondering whether I’m manly enough – I think those are feelings that a lot of men struggle with, whether gay, straight or bi.We’re all supposed to aspire to being super macho, but I hope we’re starting to realise that there’s more than one way of being a man. In fact, my girlfriend would say that dating a bisexual man is better, because I have a more flexible mindset. I don’t assume that she’ll do the washing up because she’s a woman, or that I’ll do the DIY because I’m a man. She tells me I’m one of the manliest people she knows, not because I have the deepest voice or the broadest shoulders, but because I know who I am, and I never feel the need to pretend to be anyone else.For as long as I can remember, I’ve felt male. Even when I was four years old, my mum remembers me crying and telling her I felt like a boy trapped in a girl’s body. Then, when I was eight, I played on a boys’ basketball team and nobody thought to question it.It was only when I started high school that things got weird. I tried to fit in because I didn’t want to get teased, but I’d overhear people asking, “Is that a boy in a skirt?” My mum would help with my makeup and take me shopping, but it felt like I was doing drag. Coming from a small town, I didn’t even know what it meant to be trans all I knew was how I felt.Then, once I started to transition, I made a lot of effort to be ultra masculine, spending lots of time in the gym so that I’d “pass” as a man. These days, I’m much more comfortable with myself and I’m not afraid of my feminine side, because I know it doesn’t stop me being male.People sometimes think I’m gay, because I can be a bit camp, and I’m OK with that. I do comedy videos online, and, funnily enough, most of the characters I’m known for are women. Some people don’t realise I’m trans and post comments saying, “If you like being women so much why don’t you just become one?” I think: “Been there, done that!”Photography: Dan Wilton for Do what feels right with Philips: whether that’s being true to yourself or a finding grooming routine that works for you.

Coveney said: “We cannot allow one party in Northern Ireland to veto any proposals.”He told RTÉ’s Marian Finucane radio show: “The British government has a confidence and supply arrangement with the DUP, but we don’t have a confidence and supply agreement with any one party in Northern Ireland.”Speculation is growing that the EU and the British government are working on a “backstop to a backstop” to resolve the impasse in Brexit negotiations over the Irish border.On Friday, May revealed she would be setting out the UK’s alternative, which would involve an element of decision-making power being wielded by Belfast.“It will be in line with the commitments we made back in December – including the commitment that no new regulatory barriers should be created between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK unless the Northern Ireland executive and assembly agree,” she said in her statement.The assembly has not been functioning since power-sharing collapsed in Northern Ireland almost two years ago because of a dispute between the DUP and Sinn Féin. It is highly unlikely that Stormont will be restored to full operation before a Brexit deal is sealed.May rejected the EU’s proposed wording for the backstop proposal in February because it would require the region to stay in the EU system even if the UK crashed out with no deal.Coveney told RTÉ there was “no question of a border down the Irish Sea”, but he was keen to ensure that minimal checks were required on goods. “There are practical realities of trade, and we are trying to do that in a way that doesn’t undermine the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom in a way that is threatening to unionism, but that can protect the concerns of both unionists and nationalists, neither of whom want a border re-emerging on the island of Ireland.”He said he believed the DUP recognised that Northern Ireland was not the same “as Kent or a borough in London” and it had many differences from other parts of the UK.The Daily  reported on Saturday that the “third option” for Northern Ireland would focus on extending the current regulatory checks on animals to other sectors. To protect the island of Ireland from outbreaks of disease, such as TB or mad cow disease, routine checks are done on livestock being imported from Britain, north and south of the border.The DUP has accepted that these “sanitary checks” are in place but are opposed to extending this to non-agricultural goods.Ireland’s taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, confirmed in Salzburg that the EU was reworking the backstop proposal to say that agriculture and phyto-sanitary checks would be the only physical controls that needed to take place between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.In this scenario, customs declaration forms would be filed to tax authorities electronically, and the separate customs checks needed to prevent tax evasion and smuggling would continue.It is argued that these checks are usually intelligence-led, based on tips-offs to the Police Service of Northern Ireland or Garda Síochána, and are part of the existing cooperation arrangements."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1eb3ddee02acbe8ee2240cec095d9fe4569acd1e/0_180_5411_3246/master/5411.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dcb48912070fe74f09741f7979f57bc","title":"matera italy capital of culture 2019 unbuilt roads and venues","story":"Roads and venues remain unbuilt as the southern Italian city struggles to be the 2019 capital of cultureWhen the southern Italian city of Matera found out it had been selected as the 2019 European capital of culture, its ancient streets echoed with cheers. Thousands gathered in October 2014 to watch the announcement live from Brussels in a central piazza. “It reminded me of the day when Napoli announced it had acquired Diego Maradona,” said Daniele Kihlgren, an Italian-Swedish businessman who has invested in a hotel in Matera. “The same uproar was heard throughout the town.”But the euphoria was quickly replaced by a sense of anxiety. “After the celebrations,” said Eustachio Nicoletti, Matera’s secretary for Italy’s largest labour union, the CGIL, “people began to wonder, ‘and what the hell are we going to do now?’”Today, with little over three months remaining until 2019, that concern has become a real fear that the city’s big opportunity could instead be a colossal failure. Local organisations and business owners are warning that the city will simply not be ready. Rome and Brussels secured €400m (£360m) to organise the year’s events, money that was supposed to pay for restoring buildings and repairing streets in a place famed for its stunning but dilapidated beauty and history of dire poverty.But, according to the unions, most of the money is still trapped in the labyrinth of Italian bureaucracy and has not yet been spent.“Of the seven buildings that should have housed the cultural events, at least five will not be ready in time for 2019,” said Nicoletti.Concern also surrounds accessibility: half of the funding, about €200m, had been allocated for the construction of a new railway line. The station is there – it was built in 1986 – but there is no railway. Matera can still be reached only by a slow, secondary rail line from Bari, which takes nearly two hours to cover 60km, while work to complete the Bradanica highway, connecting the city with the north of the Basilicata region, began almost 40 years ago and has yet to be completed.“The truth is that the disregard for not meeting deadlines was already well known in 2014,” said Enzo Acito, former director of tourism for Matera. “Everyone knew that with the snail’s pace of Italian bureaucracy and the typical waiting times for the construction industry in Italy, the facilities would never be completed by 2019.”Matera was the first southern Italian city to be recognised as a European capital of culture. But, like many towns across the region, it bears the wounds of structural deficiencies, such as high youth unemployment, alleged corruption and obscure political manoeuvrings. In July the president of the Basilicata region, Marcello Pittella, was placed under house arrest by prosecutors in Matera for alleged involvement in rigging healthcare contracts. He denies all the accusations against him.Such problems, often chronic in the south of Italy, are exacerbated by historic and deeply rooted difficulties in a town which was virtually abandoned for more than 40 years after the second world war. Cut off from the modern economy, Matera was one of Europe’s poorest cities, where families lived in grottoes, the “Sassi” (literally stones) carved out of the limestone that dated back to Matera’s prehistoric era.The extent of the squalid conditions in the Sassi only came to international attention when writer Carlo Levi was exiled by Benito Mussolini’s fascist regime to a town close to Matera in 1935. In his book, Christ Stopped at Eboli, published in 1945, Levi described the horror he witnessed – the paltry furniture, children either naked or in rags, bodies ravaged by disease – and concluded: “I have never seen in all my life such a picture of poverty.”In 1952 Italy’s prime minister, Alcide De Gasperi proclaimed a state of emergency in Matera, described by Rome as “a national disgrace”. The inhabitants of the Sassi were eventually evacuated and relocated a few kilometres away. Matera would remain deserted and silent until 1993 when Unesco declared the Sassi, once a source of national shame and a symbol of poverty and disease, a world heritage site, following a long list of achievements that eventually led to its selection, along with Plov in Bulgaria, as a 2019 European capital of culture.But Matera’s fate after next year is an open question. “It’s the fear that we all share at this time,” said Nicoletti. “When it’s all over – the firework display, the cultural events and the attention – what will be Matera’s fate?”Paolo Verri, director of the Matera-Basilicata 2019 Foundation in charge of the organisation of the cultural events, shrugs off any blame and insists the year of culture will go ahead. “We will carry out the events as we have planned,” he said. “We can’t control infrastructure. It’s not our responsibility. What I can say is that in the past few years we have quadrupled the number of visitors in Matera and, at the end of the event, it will always be in the spotlight.”Nicoletti has a different view. In 2017, the CGIL published a report – entitled Matera 2019: missed opportunity? – in which researchers tried to analyse the city’s future after the event. The conclusions seem anything but rosy.“The risk is that the facilities slated for completion by 2019 won’t even be ready by 2020,” said Nicoletti. “The risk is that the city will have lost an opportunity to create jobs for its people, who each year emigrate toward northern Italy. The risk is to have missed a train that won’t be coming back.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/628d357d6a2272d2268adc9432792f6a794e7083/0_163_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ee06f1ba003fbc7c6c97d142426515e","title":"vatican pope francis agreement with china nominating bishops","story":"The Vatican and China said yesterday they had signed a historic agreement on the appointment of Roman Catholic bishops, a breakthrough on an issue that for decades fuelled tensions between the Holy See and Beijing and thwarted efforts toward diplomatic relations.The provisional agreement, which was signed in Beijing by deputy foreign ministers from both sides, was described by the Vatican as “the fruit of a gradual and reciprocal rapprochement”, following a long process of careful negotiation, and subject to periodic review.“It concerns the nomination of bishops, a question of great importance for the life of the church, and creates the conditions for greater collaboration,” the Vatican said.In Beijing, the foreign ministry put out a statement saying: “China and the Vatican will continue to maintain communications and push forward the process of improving relations between the two sides.”“The consequences will be tragic and long lasting, not only for the church in China but for the whole church because it damages the credibility,” he added.The Vatican said that, as part of the deal, the pope would recognise seven Chinese bishops who were appointed by Beijing without the Vatican’s approval, and were excommunicated as illegitimate. Sources told Reuters the accord gave the Vatican a say in the naming of bishops and granted the pope veto power over candidates. China’s Catholics are split between an underground church swearing loyalty to the Vatican, and the state-supervised Catholic Patriotic Association (CPA).The possibility of such a deal has ided Catholics across China, some of whom fear greater suppression should the Vatican cede more control to Beijing. Others want to see rapprochement and avoid a potential schism.Greg Burke, director of the Holy See press office, acknowledged there was work to be done to reassure those who have opposed the agreement. “This is not the end of a process. It’s the beginning. This has been about dialogue, patient listening on both sides even when people come from very different standpoints. The objective of the accord is not political but pastoral, allowing the faithful to have bishops who are in communion with Rome but, at the same time, recognised by Chinese authorities.”The deal has been done amid a crackdown by the Chinese regime on Christians and followers of other faiths in recent years. Churches have been closed down crosses and other religious symbols have been removed.President Xi Jinping introduced a programme to “Sinicise” all religious practice, insisting that it must be “Chinese in orientation”. The government must “provide active guidance to religions so that they can adapt themselves to socialist society”, he said.The explosion of Christianity in the country has mainly been seen in Protestant evangelical churches. Catholicism is a relatively minor religion, with an estimated 10-12 million adherents.They are supposed to worship only in churches approved by the CPA, a state-controlled body. But many attend unregistered churches under the authority of bishops who are not recognised by the Chinese authorities.The Vatican has been keen to re-create ties with Beijing ever since the Communist authorities broke off diplomatic relations in 1951. Pope Francis has vigorously pursued rapprochement with the rising superpower.He has sent gifts to Xi, his homilies have been translated into Chinese, and last year the Vatican dispatched 40 artworks to Beijing in a cultural exchange which, according to a senior Chinese official, signalled the “strong commitment for the development of civil relations” between the two.Theodore McCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington who resigned as a cardinal in July after facing allegations of sexual abuse, has been a regular envoy from the Vatican to Beijing, according to the Catholic News Agency.A sign of Francis’s eagerness to curry favour with the Chinese has been his refusal to meet the Dalai Lama, knowing such an encounter would anger Beijing. The thaw between the two powers has come under fire from some in the church. Two years ago, Cardinal Zen said a rapprochement would be “betraying Jesus Christ” and a “surrender”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a2f612d0d9aba19232f83feb72988eeec1e68f2/0_266_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1060f1bd31e7d775f13029640d95684a","title":"the displaced indigenous communities of colombia in pictures","story":"Cocaine trafficking and the battle to control land in the country’s Valle del Cauca department are forcing indigenous and Afro-Colombian people to flee their homes"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3638491.1537619477!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit dup cannot be allowed to veto deal says coveney","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste  Simon Coveney  speaking in Government Buildings on Thursday about Brexit preparedness. Photo: Julien BehalThe Democratic Unionist Party cannot be allowed to veto a Brexit deal on the Border, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.Mr Coveney said the issue of the backstop agreement, that would ensure no hard border in a no-deal Brexit scenario, had turned into a “green and orange issue”. However, the Government did not want to “undermine or threaten the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom in Brexit negotiations”, Mr Coveney said.“That is not what this is about and unfortunately some people have turned the mechanism to get this famous backstop agreed as that kind of agenda which it isn’t,” he added.Mr Coveney said he is hopeful for significant progress by October despite a week that saw British prime minister Theresa May accuse EU leaders of driving Brexit negotiations into an impasse after they rejected her Chequers plan for Brexit.“The really sticky issue at the moment is can we find a solution on the backstop. I believe we can,” Mr Coveney told the Marian Finucane show on RTÉ radio. “Hopefully we will make significant progress on it by the leaders’ summit in October, to be concluded in November.“The British government has committed in the last 48 hours to producing new text on that in terms of their approach and what’s needed is an intensification of engagement in the negotiation teams,” he added.He said he believed the the DUP would accept that Northern Ireland “is not the same as Kent or a borough in London” and it has “so many differences “ to other parts of the UK. He said, for example if a person is born in Northern Ireland they have a birth right to Irish or British citizenship or both.He said there was “no question of a border down the Irish sea. What we are trying to ensure is that there are minimal checks required. If the United Kingdom is outside the customs union and single market and if goods travel from one customs union into another or from one single market into another there has to be some checking system.“These are practical realities of trade and we are trying to do that in a way that doesn’t undermine the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom in a way that is threatening to unionism but in a way that can protect the concerns of both unionists and nationalists neither of whom want a border re-emerging on the island of Ireland.”Mr Coveney told the programme he believed Britain and the EU would be weakened by Brexit and that Ireland would also be damaged because it is “caught in the middle”.When asked if he had spoken to the DUP about the issues at hand he said they had and with other parties, adding: “ We cannot allow one party in Northern Ireland to veto any proposals.“The British government has a confidence and supply arrangement with the DUP but we don’t have a confidence and supply agreement with any one party in Northern Ireland.”On Friday, in a seven-minute televised address from Downing Street, the British prime minister said the EU should treat Britain with more respect and that its proposal to avoid a hard Border in Ireland would break up the UK.“The EU is proposing to achieve this by effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the customs union. As I have already said, that is unacceptable. We will never agree to it. It would mean breaking up our country,” she said.Ms May said Britain would set out its own backstop proposal, adding that it would include a commitment that there would be no new regulatory barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK unless the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly, which are currently suspended, agree.The prime minister’s defiant statement followed an informal meeting of EU leaders in the Austrian city of Salzburg which left her humiliated when European Council president Donald Tusk and other leaders dismissed the economic proposals in her Chequers plan.After the meeting, French president Emmanuel Macron, one of the fiercest critics of the Chequers plan, admonished Brexiteers that the Leave vote had been “pushed by those who predicted easy solutions,” adding: “Those people are liars.”Mr Tusk, after a difficult closing meeting with May, did not help relations by posting a photograph on Instagram of him offering May a cake with the caption: “A piece of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries” – a reference to the EU’s oft-stated refusal to allow the UK “cherry-pick” EU rules that it likes.On Saturday, the UK’s foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt has urged EU leaders to “step back from the abyss” of a no-deal Brexit and to engage with Theresa May’s plan, so called because it was agreed in the PM’s country house in Chequers.Following the angry clashes of the Salzburg summit, Mr Hunt said it was “counterproductive” to “insult” Britain’s referendum vote and to say the only way the UK could legally leave was by “breaking up your country”.“What we need to be doing in a situation like this is bringing people together,” he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.“This is a time for people in the EU to step back from the abyss, to sit down and to talk to us about how we can make these sensible, concrete proposals actually work.”Mr Hunt warned there would be “disruption” on both sides of the Channel in the event of a disorderly Brexit, with one estimate suggesting a million jobs could be lost across the EU.“What Theresa May is saying is ‘Don’t mistake British politeness for weakness. If you put us in a difficult corner we will stand our ground. That is the kind of country we are,‘” he told the Today programme.“Insulting her on social media, getting to these stand-offs where you are calling people liars and so on is not the way we are going to get a solution to this difficult situation.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Jack TaylorAFPGetty ImagesSo, any progress this week on progress towards a deal on Brexit?Eh, no. In fact, the stalemate in the negotiations has become even more stale.The EU and UK are no closer to a deal and only got each other’s backs up after a disastrous EU summit in Salzburg as both sides dig in on their positions and the rhetoric becomes even more tetchy.Where do both sides stand now?EU leaders categorically rejected Theresa May’s Chequers plan that would create an EU-UK free trade area covering industrial goods and agricultural products after the Brexit in March 2019.European Council president Donald Tusk said the plan “will not work” and gave her four weeks to rescue the Brexit talks, describing the next EU summit on October 18th as “a moment of truth” to provide a solution to avoid a hard Border in Ireland before any final Brexit treaty could be agreed.May dug in, saying that her proposal was the “only plan on the table” and the only “serious and credible” plan to create frictionless EU-UK trade that could maintain an open Irish Border.She went further in a televised statement from Downing Street on Friday, saying that there was no “credible alternative” from the EU and that rejecting Chequers plan without an alternative at this “late stage” was “not acceptable”. She called on the EU to treat the UK with “respect”.The EU has proposed that Northern Ireland effectively stay in the customs union and the single market when the rest of the UK leaves. May strongly dismissed this as it would “dislocate” the UK.She also ruled out a re-run of the Brexit referendum, as some European leaders hope. “I will not overturn the result of the referendum nor will I break up my country,” she said in a pugnacious address.How have things become so acrimonious?Hopes of progress in Salzburg or at least warm words about a potential compromise to avoid a no-deal Brexit were dashed as the EU ramped up pressure on May to propose something more acceptable to Brussels, either close alignment to the single market and customs union for all of the UK or a text around a legally binding “backstop” agreement to avoid physical infrastructure on the EU-UK border in Ireland.What was expected to be an informal summit in Austria this week exposed the gulf between the sides and the EU dismissed the UK with some harsh words and in a humiliating way.EU leaders were annoyed at what they saw as further attempts by the UK to rattle European solidarity on Brexit and undermine the European Commission’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.They were also not impressed with May rehashing the UK’s “red line” conditions and needlessly setting new ones, by effectively saying it was Chequers or nothing and calling on the EU in a German newspaper article on the eve of the summit not to demand something “unacceptable”.Afterwards, French president Emmanuel Macron, one of the fiercest critics of the Chequers plan, admonished Brexiteers that the Leave vote had been “pushed by those who predicted easy solutions,” adding: “Those people are liars.”Tusk, after a difficult closing meeting with May, did not help relations by posting a photograph on Instagram of him offering May a cake with the caption: “A piece of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries” – a reference to the EU’s oft-stated refusal to allow the UK “cherry-pick” EU rules that it likes.What does May want now?She has called on the EU to table new proposals so they can discuss them. “It is not acceptable to simply reject the other side’s proposals without a detailed explanation and counter proposals,” she said.And what do the Irish want?Dublin is seeking an intensification of the negotiations and a proposed text from the UK on the backstop. The Government is supportive of Barnier’s attempts (since July) to “de-dramatise” this option.What does this mean? EU negotiators are essentially arguing that the backstop might not mean new checks on the Border between Britain and Northern Ireland given that there are already inspections on animal health and food safety and that any new checks could take place away from the ports and airports, at farms and factories.Are there any other ideas being floated?Yes, one proposal involves a “backstop to a backstop”.Yes, to complicate things further, this is one solution being worked by EU negotiators, with support from Dublin. Given the problem around sequencing – a future trade deal could solve the Border issue but cannot be agreed until the Border issue is resolved – the EU would offer flexibility by proposing to negotiate a better version of backstop if the trade talks solve most but not all of the Border issue.So what to watch for next?The Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, starting on September 30th, will test May’s resolve to stick with her Chequers plan and confidence in her leadership that she can deliver Brexit in the face of hardline opposition from within a bitterly ided party.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Cyril ByrneThe So many came that Lahart abandoned a summer break in west Kerry and drove home to cope with the concerns from local residents fearful that their route would be impacted.He was not alone. Noel Rock, a Fine Gael TD for Dublin North West, who yesterday called on the National Transport Authority to extend the public consultation period for the plan, was erecting posters in his own constituency\u0026nbspadvertising a public meeting on the bus plan, when the scale of public concern became evident to him.TDs often organise public meetings just to have a handy excuse to hang posters outside of election time – such advertisements are permitted – but never expect significant turnout at the subsequent event. It was different this time.“Back in July I was putting up posters and two people stopped me in this street and asked if they could invite their neighbours to the meeting,” says Rock. “Having expected 30 people, we got 100.”That was just the start. Lahart estimates that about 1,200 people attended meetings he organised in his Dublin South West constituency over a 2½-week period.Thousands more have attended meetings organised by inidual politicians and the National Transport Authority (NTA), which is responsible for the €2 billion upgrade.The BusConnects project is a key part of the Government’s Project Ireland 2040 plan, and it is also envisaged that it will be extended to Cork and Galway, once Dublin is under way.It has two major elements in Dublin. The first is the redesign of the bus network, which would see the existing system replaced with new routes built around seven cross-city, high-frequency spines.New orbital routes will also be introduced around the city, and measures such as a single ticket charge for one 90-minute journey across bus, rail and Luas have been widely welcomed.However, the most contentious elements include some areas of greater Dublin being left without a direct link to the city centre, and concern that increased transfers between services will affect the elderly and disabled as well as causing greater worry for parents who send their children to school on public transport.The re-routing of services has also led to concern, and a debate on a Fianna Fáil motion on BusConnects in the Dáil this week was almost a roll call of every route in the capital, and how certain areas would be affected.One example was Aengus Ó Snodaigh, the Sinn Féin TD for Dublin South Central, who says that “under BusConnects no buses will go through the heart of Drimnagh”.The NTA opened a public consultation process on the network redesign in July, which led to the huge public interest. It closes next week and an updated plan will be published in the new year, and will then be opened for further consultation.Consultation on the second aspect, which will see infrastructure upgrades on 16 key routes, begins next month. This envisages the compulsory purchase of some private gardens to widen roads for buses and cyclists.It is widely agreed that the bus system in Dublin needs improvement to meet current and future demand, and those outside the political sphere suspect BusConnects is being used as a platform for candidates ahead of local elections, and possibly a general election, within the next year.David O’Connor, a senior lecturer in transport planning at the Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT), says there are some public representatives trying to make BusConnects work, but others “getting on the bandwagon and rattling the cage”.“There are representatives out there who are possibly getting a lot of political gain for it. They are calling meetings and the meetings are stuffed. That is a problem for people who are trying to get the project through.”However, O’Connor says there is a case for introducing community bus services alongside BusConnects to ensure that those who need to go, for example, to hospitals are still able to do so.Rock says it is not the case that BusConnects provides a platform for political promotion, and says there is a “proper, legitimate grassroots type of support against this”.“I think there is a way of improving the bus network without upending the existing network,” he says, adding that the envisaged method of hopping between buses to get to your destination will double the chances of people getting stuck on their commute.During the Dáil debate, Fianna Fáil – via both veiled and blunt criticism – was mentioned by other deputies as using the issue to promote its candidates. Green Party leader Eamon Ryan accused Fianna Fáil of wanting to throw out BusConnects, then “reverse and start all over again”. Minister for Transport Shane Ross accused Lahart and Fianna Fáil of being in favour of the proposal initially.Lahart rejects such charges and says BusConnects would be more acceptable if the infrastructural upgrades to bus lanes around Dublin were in place first, rather than the current plan of changing the network first. He says his party is in favour of most of the plan, and describes the proposed high-frequency spines as “great”.“The attempt to connect people is disconnecting people and there is just no argument about that. It isn’t about an unwillingness of people to make connections. You’d sell it much easier, if you said the seamless, fully segregated corridor to the city is in place, it’s in place, it is already there.”In response to numerous questions in the Dáil, Ross also insists BusConnects is not preparing for further privatisation.The issue was also a matter of debate at the Fine Gael parliamentary party this week, with almost all Dublin representatives speaking.Fine Gael Dublin Bay South TD Kate O’Connell has accused Minister for Transport Shane Ross of being “disinterested”.O’Connell also claims the plan is lacking in local knowledge, citing the fact that buses will no longer go down Bushy Park Road in Terenure, where Multiple Sclerosis Ireland has its national care centre.“I don’t see any evidence of any sort of local knowledge of consideration of local issues, like those things I pointed out. As public reps, when we see obvious omissions or things that weren’t considered, I get concerned about the whole plan.“Because it is so complicated and you have to know the buses, it is a bullshitter’s paradise as well. Because the maps are so complicated, it is easy to whip up fear.”In a hyper local electoral system, such local concerns will always draw the attention of politicians. A discussion at Cabinet this week on the Fianna Fáil motion also saw some Ministers hold forth on services and routes in their constituencies.There are different views on how dangerous it is for Government politicians. One Opposition TD, who has been outspoken on BusConnects, says, politically, it is not “catastrophically big”.“It can be managed, but Fine Gael just shit themselves and are over-sensitive.”Yet politicians will never look at an issue that attracts thousands of people to usually poorly attended meetings in the draughty corners of community halls and not see electoral gold, or catastrophe.“With the local elections in six months’ time, in each of the estates in every constituency, you can feel 200, 300 votes leaking through your hands,” says one TD. “It is the guts of a ‘keep our buses’ candidate in every ward in Dublin and could cost you in a general election, if it is marginal.”"},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may we stand ready to make brexit deal","story":"  September 21, 2018Donald Tusk says UK stance at summit was \u0026lsquosurprisingly tough and uncompromising\u0026rsquo   September 21, 2018Analysis: PM\u0026rsquos Downing Street fighting talk likely to play well at Tory party conference   September 22, 2018Little progress made, but acrimony grows and there\u0026rsquos even talk of backstop to a backstop   September 21, 2018Labour attacks PM\u0026rsquos negotiating strategy as Rees-Mogg supports her \u0026lsquostrong\u0026rsquo stance   September 22, 2018Prime minister says EU should treat UK with respect and stop making \u0026lsquounacceptable\u0026rsquo demands "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3638466.1537604962!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk foreign secretary says eu needs to step back from the abyss","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was “counterproductive” to “insult” Britain’s referendum vote talks.

That is the kind of country we are,‘” he told the Today programme. “Insulting her on social media, getting to these stand-offs where you are calling people liars and so on is not the way we are going to get a solution to this difficult situation.” Mr Hunt refused to rule out the prospect that the Government could now seek a simple, Canada-style free trade agreement — as many Tory MPs want rather than the more ambitious Chequers plan. “I am not dismissing anything,” he said. “We think these proposals are better than the Canada proposals because they work better on the Northern Irish border.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Jessie had that week received good results in a college assessment, and was looking forward to the visit of a penfriend from Australia. She told her mother she would be home on Friday.On Friday night there was no sign of Jessie. ‘We thought she must have missed the last train,’ her mother Valerie says. ‘But in the morning there was still no phone call.

Oliver has been the most popular boys\u0027 name since 2013 while Olivia replaced Amelia in top place in 2016.Olivia was the most popular name for baby girls in each of the nine English regions in 2017 as well as in Wales, with Amelia the second favourite everywhere except the South West of England where Isla was in second.Although Oliver did rank top nationally, unlike Olivia, it was not universally popular. Muhammad was the top boys\u0027 name in London, Yorkshire and the Humber and the West Midlands while Harry was top in the North East for boys for the second year running.There was relatively little movement in the top 10 spots for both boys and girls. Lily replaced Poppy in the top 10 girls’ names for England and Wales in 2017, compared with 2015. Leo replaced Thomas in the top 10 for boys’ names for England and Wales in 2017, compared with 2016.The statistics, compiled by the ONS, are derived from the names as they appear on the birth certificate of the child and, as such, don\u0027t factor in differing or similar pronunciations.

Brand new entries into the top 100 for girls include the names Aurora and HallieThere were only two new entries into the top 100 most popular boys’ names in 2017 for England and Wales: Hunter and Ralph replaced Aaron and Jasper, which were in the top 100 in 2016.There were six new entries in the top 100 most popular girls’ names in 2017 in England and Wales: Aurora, Orla, Edith, Bonnie, Lyla and Hallie replaced Lexi, Zoe, Maddison, Sarah, Felicity and Lydia.The influence of popular culture continues to seemingly provide inspiration for new parents.

north korean officials having hands pockets","story":"The two-part documentary, \u0026#39Michael Palin in North Korea\u0026#39, will air on Channel 5 on Thursday 20 September at 9pm.Michael Palin had to reshoot scenes for his North Korea documentary because he had his hands in his pockets, which was seen as “disrespectful”.The Monty Python star irked officials during the first day of filming Michael Palin in North Korea when his hands became obscured as he spoke to camera in front of two statues of the country\u0027s former leaders.Palin said the production crew was ordered by guides to do a retake of the scene because the act is considered disrespectful by North Koreans in the presence of monuments.The 75-year-old was granted unprecedented access to explore the secretive nation, which is long known for its mistrust of the west, for the Channel 5 documentary.In an interview with the Radio Times, Palin said: Because we were in front of the monuments of the two great leaders and there are various rules there and the leaders have to be filmed in their entirety, and so you have to stand a long way back so you can film the full length of them.“And in the end they said no, no, no, You have got to do it again because you had your hand in your pocket and that is disrespectful, so that was interesting.”Palin and the production team  flew out just after a thawing in relations within the Korean peninsula.Palin also said minders had specified that any signs of litter and people in vest tops were to banned from the final cut.Despite the fact that the veteran traveller has roamed the world for more than 30 years, Palin admitted that he was still “very,very cautious” about visiting North Korea amid fears over its highly criticised nuclear weapons programme.He said he eventually decided to go ahead with the project following the historic handshake between North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un and South Korea\u0027s President Moon Jae-In in April ,which signalled the beginnings of a truce between the two nations.ITN had been in negotiations with North Korean officials for two years prior to filming and received help from British academic Nick Bonner, whose company Koryo Tours facilitates visitors to explore the country.Mr Bonner, who is credited as the documentary\u0027s associate producer, said travellers are advised on what actions could cause offence before stepping foot in North Korea.The Monty Python star was told off by officials who objected to him holding his hands in his pockets in front of statues of their former leaders.He said: “We give briefings to tourists before they go the country and as with any country you visit it is important not to show disrespect. If you dress badly and acted insensitively it is most likely you would be tolerated but your Korean guide would be made responsible for your behaviour.” Dr Robert Winstanley-Chesters, a lecturer in Korean Studies at the University of Leeds, explained tourists to North Korea are expected to show respect to all imagery concerning leadership.He said: “North Koreans are meant to be deeply committed to the ideology and historiography of the state and whether or not they actually believe this in their hearts and minds and expected to demonstrate this and will demonstrate this in their everyday lives.“North Korean\u0027s express great commitment, loyalty and love to the Great, Dear and Young Leaders and whole hearted belief in the \u0027fact\u0027 that North Korea is the greatest country on earth.”His advice to visiting Britons tourists is: “Be respectful to all images of the North Korean leadership, whether statues or images, only take photographs when you are told it is okay to take photographs and do not under any circumstances try to sneak photographs of things you aren\u0027t supposed to.”North Korea | How to avoid causing offenceChannel 5\u0027s Michael Palin in North Korea concludes on Thursday at 9pm.British ballerina moves to

Pupils and staff with pigeons at St Adrews School in OswaldtwistleSchools in Lancashire, Worcester and London have now installed pigeon lofts with hopes more could follow suit. Teaching staff have hailed the success of \u0027pigeon\u0027 education, which they said has helped youngsters learn traditional school subjects and feel more included in the classroom.Paul Burns, headteacher at St Andrews Primary School in Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, said: Having a pigeon loft helps the children in various different ways. When we were racing them in summer, we were doing lots of geography and maths work, for example calculating the distance they were travelling, their speed and velocity and following them on maps.The pigeons have been really beneficial for in promoting social interaction and responsibility. There is a big social aspect of it.Also, having ownership and being able to look after the pigeons, clean them out, feed them and train them is teaching the children responsibility. They are really getting something out of it.The school has announced plans to write to the Queen, herself a fan of pigeon racing after watching birds race at Sandringham, about their future endeavours. RPRA chief executive Ian Evans said pigeon racing had proved successful in offering children school inclusion and could now help the elderly against isolation.He said: We are currently exploring how pigeon racing can help the younger generations. But also, as the government are very focused on social inclusion at the moment, we also want to help the older generations. For example, people who have retired and are experiencing loneliness.According to the RPRA, Britain\u0027s first pigeon races were held over short distances until the creation of the railways paved the way for long-distance contests.The sport is said to have peaked at the end of the Second World War where pigeons were used extensively as messengers by both armies.Famous pigeon fanciers include former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson, Elvis Presley and Marlon Brando.British ballerina moves to Bavarian State Ballet for \u0026#39more exciting\u0026#39 repertoireChechnya cracks down on \u0026#39child terrorism\u0026#39 after attack involving 11-year-old who pledged allegiance to IsilHealth Secretary: The NHS needs to radically change the way it helps doctors and nurses who experience trauma in their daily workSchools should keep checking up on former students when they are at university, leading headmaster saysGive children the same protection online as they get offline, says information commissionerComment: Whatever happens, a friend will be there for youDuchess of Sussex reveals her wedding day ‘something blue’ was taken from her first date with the DukeDuchess of Sussex reveals her wedding day ‘something blue’ was taken from her first date with the DukeRival rail firms should run trains on the same lines, say MPsScottish rower attempting to cross the Atlantic in homemade boat rescued off Land\u0026#39s EndInside the spy hiring centre where Britain\u0026#39s brightest minds are challenged to hack banksTrump administration moves to restrict immigrants who use public benefitsTeenager shot dead in east LondonStrictly Come Dancing 2018, first live show: Ashley Roberts and Faye Tozer tied at top, Susannah Constantine stranded at bottomKilling Eve, episode two, review: this blend of comedy and thrills proved irresistibleComment: Theresa May should tear up a £39 billion cheque at the Tory conferenceLabour plans holiday home tax raid and the return of council rates Holocaust campaigner files complaint claiming Labour Party is hostile to Jews Tory donor threatens to fund breakaway Brexit party to \u0026#39deliver\u0026#39 on EU referendumComment: Leave voters are being heated up slowly like laboratory frogsComment: It would be fatal for British politics if we left the EU as a rule takerWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/16/09/rupert-murdoch.jpg","title":"rupert murdoch sky takeover auction comcast 21st century fox","story":"Created with Sketch.The media tycoon\u0027s first swoop for Sky in 2011 was derailed by the phone hacking scandalClick to followThe IndependentRupert Murdoch\u0027s company had valued Sky at £18bn back in 2016Rupert Murdoch has failed to gain full control of Sky after Comcast beat Fox with a £30bn bid for the broadcaster.The US telecommunications giant won out in a day-long auction overseen by Britain\u0027s Takeover Panel on Saturday.After the maximum three rounds of bidding, Comcast\u0026nbspoffered £17.28 per share compared to 21st\u0026nbspCentury Fox\u0027s £15.67 per share for the 61 per cent of the company it does not already own.Comcast owns NBC Universal and is the largest cable operator in the US.Rupert Murdoch\u0027s News Corp reports global net loss of $1.4bnRupert Murdoch given government clearance for Sky takeoverMurdoch takeover of Sky \u0027not in the public interest\u0027, watchdog findsWith the Sky takeover, Comcast will become the biggest pay TV provider in the world, with around 52 million customers after adding Sky\u0027s 23 million subscribers.Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive of Comcast, said: This is a great day for Comcast.Sky is a wonderful company with a great platform, tremendous brand and accomplished management team.This acquisition will allow us to quickly, efficiently and meaningfully increase our customer base and expand internationally.We couldn\u0027t be more excited by the opportunities in front of us.

But they come at a cost, and one that is not easy to swallow.And from Friday the Xs and Xs Max have gone on sale in the UK and around the world, meaning UK networks are battling to offer customers the best deals on the new iPhones.(The iPhone Xr, which might offer considerably better value for money, is not going to be released until October.

So it can be worth going through your network, and paying upfront for the phone with them while still committing to a phone plan.If you\u0027re on the other side of that situation – you don\u0027t want to pay upfront at all, and offset the cost through the length of the plan – then there are plenty of ways to do that. Obviously, you will pay for it in that the price over the two years will add up to significantly more, but you\u0027ll also have the benefit of never having to make such a significant outlay.There are plenty of networks offering limited upfront payments, such as Virgin Mobile, which claims to have the cheapest deal with no upfront costs. You can get the Xs for £41 per month without any initial payment, and pay an extra £9 for a full 50GB per month.The least painful way to get the iPhone Xs or Xs Max is probably to go somewhere in between. Which is best will depend on how much you want to pay upfront and what sort of allowances you want, of course, but the networks are falling over themselves to offer you deals on the new phone.Three, for instance, is asking for £59 for all you can eat data with a £99 payment at the beginning. It\u0027s not the cheapest deal, but unlimited data is rare, and it is decent.The Max is £5 more from Three. And you can add another £6 on top per month to get some AirPods, too.If you\u0027re concerned about committing for two years – especially when next year\u0027s iPhone is likely to offer more spectacular upgrades than the Xs – then you might want to consider Sky Mobile, which allows people to upgrade every year with its Swap12 plan.\u0026nbspThe Xs starts at £59 per month on that plan, with a £99 upfront payment.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/22/15/corbyn918.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1667  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/22/15/corbyn918.jpg","title":"jeremy corbyn brexit second referendum peoples vote final say","story":"Created with Sketch.Click to followThe IndependentJeremy Corbyn has said he will back giving people a final say on Brexit if Labour conference votes for itJeremy Corbyn has said he will back giving the British people a final say on\u0026nbspBrexit in a new referendum if party members vote for it at Labour’s conference\u0026nbspthis week.The Labour leader said that while he had not called for it up to now he had been elected to “empower” members and would not “walk away from it” if they demanded a new vote.Mr Corbyn also said he would join forces with rebel Tories to vote down Theresa May’s Brexit plans in parliament if they did not meet Labour’s tests, with The Independent reporting on Saturday that the party would then maximise pressure on the prime minister by\u0026nbspseeking a motion of no confidence in the government if her proposals fell.The Labour leader’s new comments on a People’s Vote Brexit referendum come as a new YouGov poll showed his party’s members overwhelmingly back one, while more than 100 motions relating to a new vote have been proposed for\u0026nbspthe conference in Liverpool.\u0026nbspHe said: “What comes out of conference I will adhere to.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”We both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in picturesPope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social

reasonable,” said Mr Ashley, who also owns Newcastle United.“Those landlords whom we have been unable to agree terms with include, but are not limited to, the following: Parabola Hope Street LLP,

to thank those landlords who have helped us to rescue approximately 3,500 jobs at the stores we have saved to date.“I am calling on everybody to pull together, including landlords and local authorities in order to help to save as many House of Fraser stores and jobs as possible on the great British high street.”Birkenhead\u0026nbspMP Frank Field said it was “tremendous” that the

How many people have you said you can’t have any status off the back of this helpline, and what’s happened to them?In his\u0026nbspupdate to the Home Affairs Select Committee, Mr Javid also announced that 2,121 people had successfully applied to become British nationals since the\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbspScheme was established at the end of May, with 2,398 also able to secure documentation confirming their right to be in the UK.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UKThe ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

That’s the main reason we came up with them.”The deal agreed between Canada and the EU covers free trade but is significantly less comprehensive than the arrangement Britain is seeking with the EU.A Canada-style deal is favoured by some Brexiteers because it would not keep Britain so closely aligned with the EU.Mr Hunt attacked European leaders for the “inherent unreasonableness” of their negotiating position, saying it was “unacceptable” and a “parody” of an institution that claimed to respect democracy.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchBut despite talks being deadlocked, he said he had received messages from two EU foreign ministers following the Salzburg summit earlier this week saying they believed a deal was still possible, and that Mr Tusk had expressed the same view.He said: “What we need to be doing in a situation like this is bringing people together.“This is a time for people in the EU to step back from the abyss, to sit down and to talk to us about how we can make these sensible, concrete proposals actually work.”On Friday, Ms May warned EU leaders she would not accept any solution that would create a new customs border in the Irish Sea.She said the EU plan was “something I will never agree to” and something “no British prime minister would ever agree to”.Saying she had always treated the UK with respect, she said the “UK expects the same” and called on EU leaders to explain “what the real issues are and what their alternative is so that we can discuss them”.May labels EU conduct ‘unacceptable’ and demands respect for UKPound sterling slumps as Theresa May admits Brexit ‘impasse’ All the times the EU has said ‘no’ to Theresa May’s Brexit planBrexit: Labour could surge towards power backing new vote, polls findShe was speaking after Mr Tusk poked fun at the prime minister by tweeting a photo of him offering her cake, alongside the caption: “A piece of cake, perhaps?

The truth is that waiting for the government to foul up is no strategy at all. The country desperately needs a strong government but it also need a strong opposition.“Labour’s tragedy over 20 years – and I include my own period in this – is that there was almost a complacency about Europe. The Tory tragedy was to be obsessed about Europe and the Labour tragedy was to be complacent about Europe.”He added: “Finally the complacency is breaking, at least at the constituency level of the Labour Party, but it’s an absolute dereliction of duty for the Labour Party leadership not to embrace the fundamental principle that since the Brexit that people were sold two years ago is not available, it’s essential that the Brexit deal the prime minister does is put to people.“The most corrosive thing in the long term will be a Brexit on terms that were missold.”People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchMr Miliband predicted Ms May would “eke out” a “paper-thin deal” with Brussels and then “use the threat of no deal and the disaster that represents to try to bludgeon people to support it”.He said: “No-deal is obviously a terrible disaster for the country.“Theresa May has painted herself and painted the country into a corner.

However, this list must itself be agreed by the EU before the withdrawal date if it is to be copied into UK law.A vote on this list is expected in the coming months, and given this an HSE spokesperson said “chemicals deemed unacceptable to the UK before we leave the EU would not be allowed to enter the UK once we have left”.In response, Ms Ferns said: “Staff at HSE are working incredibly hard to prepare the UK for Brexit, but the simple truth is that the arbitrary timetable set out by the government puts them at the mercy of events in the EU.“Having contributed so much to chemical regulation in the EU it is deeply frustrating that the government are pulling us out of collaborative structures, such as the unacceptable co-formulants regulations, that help to protect people and the environment from dangerous chemicals.All the times the EU has said ‘no’ to Theresa May’s Brexit planWhere you live could decide your post-Brexit financial situation“If this vote does not take place before we leave the EU then we need a guarantee that the UK will adopt the full list of banned substances that we have helped to build.”Rachael Maskell, Labour MP for York Central, where many HSE employees are based, said people in the chemicals sector “clearly don’t know what their future is going to be after 29\u0026nbspMarch”.Jobs for specialist and technical staff may be at risk if the UK loses its leading role in Europe, but Ms Maskell said that this is an issue that affects everyone.“This will be about what is in our food chain, it has catastrophic consequences to get this wrong and yet the attention to detail that this government has failed to bring… is quite astounding,” she said.“This just highlights the complexity of Brexit which the government neither prepared for or has focused on since the vote.”The Independent approached the\u0026nbspDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for comment but had not heard back at the time of publication.The Independent has

with Sketch.Exclusive: Party chiefs believe a collapse in Brexit talks would be a moment of maximum weakness for the prime ministerClick to followIndy PoliticsJeremy Corbyn and his allies have made no

May’s Brexit deal is defeated in parliamentLabour will launch a plan to force an election by seeking a motion of no confidence in the government within days if Theresa May’s Brexit deal is defeated in parliament,\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsphas learnt.Jeremy Corbyn and his top team will launch an attempt to force the Conservative administration to go to the people at what they believe will be a moment of maximum weakness for the prime minister.Multiple sources confirmed party chiefs have game-planned their approach if Ms May’s beleaguered proposals are vetoed in a crucial commons vote or if she fails to get a deal in Europe, which looks increasingly likely after EU leaders torpedoed them earlier this week.A motion of no confidence would need some support from Conservative MPs to pass, but either way would act to severely destabilise the prime minister as internal pressure for her to quit peaked.The moment could also prove critical for Labour’s own approach to Brexit, with the party having stated its preference for an election while signalling that if one is not possible it could back a new referendum.It comes as Labour starts its 2018 conference in Liverpool, with Brexit and the party’s approach to holding a fresh public vote on the outcome of negotiations set to dominate the agenda.Mr Corbyn and his allies have up to now made no secret of their desire for a new election, but it is the first time that those in the shadow cabinet have set out how they would begin to push for an election immediately if a major Brexit crisis engulfs Ms May.A senior Labour source said: “If Theresa May’s deal is voted down in parliament, then expect to see Labour come forward with a vote of no confidence within days.“The party has always been clear that an election is needed, and we would push for that hard and immediately.”If Theresa May’s deal is voted down in parliament, then expect to see Labour come forward with a vote of no confidence within daysUnder the Fixed-term Parliaments Act passed during the coalition years, there are only two routes to securing an election outside of the allotted date every five years.The first is if a motion for an early general election is agreed either by at least two-thirds of the whole House of Commons or passed without disagreement. The second, said to be favoured by Labour strategists, is the motion of no confidence.The wording of the motion is set out in the 2011 legislation, meaning MPs would simply be asked to vote that “this house has no confidence in Her Majesty’s government”.PMQs: Jeremy Corbyn accuses the government of being ‘too busy fighting with each other’ to negotiate BrexitIf it the motion passes by a simple majority, then a 14-day countdown would begin during which there is a window for another government to be formed.If one can be, it would need approval from the Commons\u0026nbspbut if one cannot, then an election takes place.Jeremy Hunt hints UK could accept Canada-style trade dealDavid Miliband accuses Labour of ‘dereliction of duty’ over BrexitEuropean Court should say if UK can stop Brexit, Scottish judges ruleMay labels EU conduct ‘unacceptable’ and demands respect for UKTheresa May’s Brexit speech in fullPM demands new ideas from Brussels after EU rejects her plan- LIVEA member of the shadow cabinet told\u0026nbspThe Independent: “There are two things that you have to separate out:\u0026nbspMay’s position and that of the government.“If her deal is voted down or there is no deal, then May could go, but the government may try to continue on, but I think that’s going to be very difficult for them. Pressure for an election would mount.“So it is true to say that we would act very quickly as an opposition in trying to bring forward a motion no confidence, and that only requires a simple majority.”A source in Mr Corbyn’s leadership team confirmed that bringing a quick motion of no confidence was a plan the party was looking at, but said there were other options to try and force an election as well.\u0026nbspPeople\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchIf a motion is to succeed it would need some support from Tory MPs, which is a stumbling block given many Conservatives are fearful of losing their seats and allowing Mr Corbyn the opportunity to take power.But the move would be a clear signal of intent from the opposition and would, following a collapse in Brexit talks, come at time when the number of Conservative MPs exasperated with Ms May could easily outnumber her majority. \u0026nbspA Tory rebel move to replace Ms May with a new leader without holding an election, meanwhile, could prove electorally toxic for an incoming Tory leader.Polls show a majority – some 51 per cent of the public – wanting a new election if Ms May is replaced in a Conservative coup. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShadow chancellor John McDonnell confirmed earlier this week that if the party cannot get an election then backing a second referendum would be an option for the party.He said in a webchat with users of the Mumsnet website: “Our position is that any Brexit deal negotiated has to protect our economy and jobs.“My view, then, is that we should have a general election because, in a general election, people can not only debate the range of issues in full, they can also select the team that will then negotiate our future position. If we can’t get a general election, we are keeping the option of another vote – a people’s vote – on the table.”At the conference this week more than 100 constituency Labour branches have submitted motions calling for the party to back a referendum on any final Brexit deal, with some kind of motion likely to be voted on.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/02/28/12/ruth-bader-ginsburg.jpg  width= 1024  height= 683  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/02/28/12/ruth-bader-ginsburg.jpg","title":"abraham lincoln rbg joke ralph norman kavanaugh republican south carolina","story":"Created with Sketch.The South Carolina Democratic Party chairman says the joke shows Ralph Norman \u0027doesn\u0027t have any class\u0027Click to followThe Independent USA Republican congressman in South Carolina has sparked controversy after making a joke about Ruth Bader Ginsburg being \u0027groped\u0027 by Abraham Lincoln in an attempt to mock sexual assault allegations against Brett KavanaughRepublican makes \u0027disgusting\u0027 joke about Abraham Lincoln groping Ruth Bader Ginsburg at debateA South Carolina Republican has been branded disgusting after he kicked-off an election debate with a joke that mocked sexual assault allegations brought against Brett Kavanaugh.\u0026nbsp“Did y’all hear this latest late-breaking news on the Kavanaugh hearings?” Ralph Norman asked the crowd at a Thursday night debate in Rock Hill, South Carolina. “Ruth Bader Ginsburg came out saying she was groped by Abraham Lincoln.”\u0026nbspThe controversial remarks arrived as the Senate Judiciary Committee prepares to hear allegations Christine Blasey Ford has brought against Mr Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee she says sexually assaulted her while the two were teenagers.\u0026nbspThe South Carolina Democratic Party rebuked the comments while slamming the congressman, who is running for re-election against Archie Parnell, a Democrat he defeated in a close race during last year’s special elections.In a tweet, the state Democratic Party’s chairman Trav Robertson said the joke showed Mr Norman “doesn’t have any class”.\u0026nbspInappropriate doesn’t describe his remarks, he wrote.\u0026nbspThe party’s official Twitter account also wrote, This is disgusting.

Everything was ready, except a small but important detail: Jennyfer’s passport.It is now five months since Jennyfer Avero applied for her travel document. But, until today, the 23-year-old craftswoman from Caracas hasn’t anything about the state of her request.\u0026nbspLast month, her boyfriend Javier left for\u0026nbspEcuador, becoming part of one of the biggest exoduses in Latin American history. And in the meantime, Jennyfer continues to wait, hoping she will join him soon.“I have no alternative,” she says. “I wouldn’t like to leave without a passport.”Venezuela’s intensifying economic and political crisis has pushed hundreds of thousands to flee the country. They are in search of food, security, medicine and jobs.But not everyone\u0026nbspthat makes the decision to leave has a valid passport. Venezuelans face multiple difficulties when trying to obtain this document. Some people can wait months, or even years, to get it. The process can be complicated, expensive and sometimes illegal.Day after day crowds queue up outside the headquarters of the passport agency, known as Saime, in Caracas.Saime has more than 200 offices nationwide, however many people come to the headquarters in Caracas hoping to get a passport. Here the possibilities are greater, users say.Everyone is here – women, children, couples and elderly people. Some arrived before dawn\u0026nbspothers, those who came from afar, spent the night here. Much of them share the desire to leave the country for good.“This is the fourth time in three months I’ve come here,” says Jose Di Marco, while standing in line.Di Marco travelled 713km by bus from the town of Puerto Ordaz to Caracas. For the second consecutive day, the 20-year-old student has been sleeping at a nearby square to avoid losing his spot in the queue.He should be travelling to Ecuador at the end of the month. He has been awarded a full scholarship to study performing arts, but if he doesn’t arrive in time it will be taken away.Without answers about the status of his application, which he has been processing since 2016, he’s starting to feel desperate.“I’ve thought about leaving without a passport, I can’t waste more time,” he says.AFPGetty Images)The passport system began to fail two years ago. In theory, the process is easy. It’s done through a web page in which the citizen requests an appointment, attends the appointment and is given the passport within a couple of weeks. But often, users say, the website crashes and the appointment gets cancelled or people’s data just disappears from the system.“It’s as if I had never attended the appointment,” says Delia Cabral, 52, whose data disappeared from the website after she went to her meeting.The accountant has been waiting since May for her passport. Her daughter is waiting for her in Spain.It’s as if I had never attended the appointment\u0026nbspExperts say that Caracas’s telecommunication infrastructure is one of the weakest in the region, so it is not surprising that high-traffic websites collapse.In July, a new head of Saime was named. He promised a complete renovation of the website, as well as a profound restructuring of the organisation. However, the system still seems to be failing.The passport agency has blamed shortages of materials, like paper and plastic, for the delays.Venezuela has been suffering from shortages of food, medicines and other basic goods for many years now. The lack of passports is just one of them.The legal price of a passport in Venezuela is 18 bolivars, or $0.30 (£0.23) at the black market exchange rate. However, tired of waiting, some Venezuelans choose to pay for the service of officials who can speed up the process for $1,000, at the very least. A prohibitively expensive amount for most Venezuelans,given the monthly minimum wage is $18.Maduro urges Venezuelan migrants to return home from ‘economic slavery’ in other countriesThis is an illegal practice for which several Saime officials have been arrested in recent months. The institution also blames those members of the “mafia”\u0026nbspinside the passport agency for the delays.The economic and social crisis has become so unbearable that hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans consider escaping the country to be their only option – a feeling that has only increased over the past few months.President Nicolas Maduro denies the existence of a migration crisis and blames his critics for inflating the numbers.The government typically does not publish data, but the UN estimates that 2.3 million Venezuelans have fled the country since 2015, especially to neighbouring countries like Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil. In August, the UN warned the migration exodus was reaching a “crisis moment”,\u0026nbspakin to the situation in Mediterranean.\u0026nbspLast month, Ecuador and Peru tightened their migration controls for Venezuelans, requiring them to show valid passports at the border. That decision left many Venezuelans who had been travelling without passports in limbo.The measure was later overturned. Over recent weeks, 11 Latin American countries agreed to allow Venezuelans to enter their countries even if their passports have expired.While this is a relief for those who haven’t been able to renew their travel documents, nothing changes for those who have never had a passport, like Jennyfer.“It makes no difference for me,” she says “I’m still stuck in here.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/08/muslims-china.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1875  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/08/muslims-china.jpg","title":"china uighurs human rights muslims orphanages xinjiang province reeducation","story":"Created with Sketch.‘It’s like my kids are in jail,’\u0026nbspsays 29-year-old mother living in exileStaff and agenciesClick to followThe IndependentChina is putting Uighur children in \u0027orphanages\u0027 even if their parents are aliveChinese authorities are putting the children of Uighurs and other ethnic minority groups into dozens of state-run orphanages across the western Xinjiang region even if their parents are not dead, as some 1 million adults in their families are sent to internment camps.The orphanages are the most recent manifestation of Beijing’s efforts to systematically distance young Muslims in Xinjiang from their families and culture. Uighurs fear such efforts are erasing their ethnic identity, one child at a time.\u0026nbspIn Istanbul,\u0026nbspa dozen Uighur families spoke to reporters during the Muslim holy festival Eid al-Adha, which comes with large family reunions. Tables in every home were resplendent with traditional Xinjiang dishes like homemade noodles, freshly butchered lamb and crispy naan.\u0026nbspBut the Uighurs who fled China to avoid detention described the\u0026nbsppainful absence of the children they left behind – who they believe are now in the hands of the very government tearing their families apart.\u0026nbspSome did not want their full names used for fear of retribution against relatives still in Xinjiang.Every morning, Meripet wakes up to her nightmare: the Chinese government has turned four of her children into orphans, even though she and their father are alive.\u0026nbspMeripet and her husband left the kids with their grandmother at home in China when they went to nurse Meripet’s sick father in Turkey. But after Chinese authorities started locking up thousands of their fellow ethnic Uighurs for alleged subversive crimes such as travel abroad, that\u0026nbspvisit became exile.\u0026nbspThen\u0026nbspher mother-in-law was also taken prisoner, and Meripet learned from a friend that her offspring, aged between three and eight,\u0026nbsphad been placed in a de facto orphanage in the Xinjiang region\u0026nbspunder the care of the state that broke up her family.\u0026nbsp“It’s like my kids are in jail,” Meripet said, her voice cracking. “My four children are separated from me and living like orphans.”\u0026nbspMeripet’s family is among tens of thousands swept up by President Xi Jinping‘s campaign to subdue a sometimes restive region, including the internment of more than 1 million Uighurs and other Muslim minorities that has alarmed a United Nations panel and the US\u0026nbspgovernment. The UK Foreign Office also believes Beijing has “introduced intrusive security and surveillance measures and cultural restrictions” aimed at the Uighur people, including “re-education camps”.Now there is evidence that the government is placing the children of detainees and exiles into dozens of orphanages across Xinjiang.\u0026nbspThe institutions are the latest example of how China is systematically distancing young Muslims in Xinjiang from their families and culture,\u0026nbspinterviews with more than a dozen people and a review of procurement documents suggest. The government has been building thousands of so-called “bilingual” schools, where minority children are taught in Mandarin and penalised for speaking in their native tongues. Some of these are boarding schools, which Uighurs say can be mandatory for children and, in one Kazakh family’s case, start from the age of five.\u0026nbspBut Uighurs fear that these measures are essentially wiping out their ethnic identity, one child at a time. Experts say what China is doing echoes how white colonialists in the US, Canada and Australia treated indigenous children – policies that have left generations traumatised.\u0026nbsp“This is an ethnic group whose knowledge base is being erased,” said Darren Byler, a researcher of Uighur culture at University of Washington. “What we’re looking at is something like a settler colonial situation where an entire generation is lost.”\u0026nbspFor Meripet, the loss is agony it is the absence of her children and the knowledge they are in state custody. A year and a half after leaving home, the 29-year-old mother looked at a photo of a brightly painted building surrounded by barbed wire where her children are believed to be held. She fell silent. And then she wept.\u0026nbsp“When I finally see them again, will they even recognise me?” she asked. “Will I recognise them?”\u0026nbspWhen Mr Xi came to power in 2012, an early challenge to his rule was a surge in violent attacks that killed several hundred people and which Beijing pinned on Uighur separatists. Since then, he\u0026nbsphas overseen the most extensive effort in recent years to quell Xinjiang, appointing in 2016 the former Tibet party boss Chen Quanguo to lead the troubled region bordering Afghanistan.\u0026nbspChen rolled out unprecedented security measures such as the internment camps that hold Muslims without trial and force them to renounce their faith and swear loyalty to the ruling Communist Party. China has described religious extremism as an illness that needs to be cured through what it calls “transformation through education”. Former detainees say one can be thrown into a camp for praying regularly, reading the Quran, going abroad or even speaking to someone overseas.\u0026nbspThe camps are among the most troubling aspects of Mr Xi’s campaign to assert the party’s dominance over all aspects of Chinese life, which has drawn comparisons with Mao Zedong. Authorities heeding Mr Xi’s call to “Sinicise” religion across the country have shut underground churches, burnt\u0026nbspBibles, replaced pictures of Jesus with ones of the president, and toppled crescents from mosques. The party also has beefed up its ability to track the movements of its 1.4 billion people, with Xinjiang serving as an important testing ground.\u0026nbspIn Xinjiang, detention has left countless children without their parents. Most of these families in China cannot be reached by journalists. However, reporters interviewed 14 Uighur families living in Turkey and one Kazakh man in Almaty with a total of 56 children who remain in China.\u0026nbspThe families say that among these children, 14 are known to be in state-run orphanages and boarding schools. The whereabouts of the rest are unknown because most of their adult relatives in Xinjiang have been detained.\u0026nbspSome interviewees, like Meripet, requested that they be identified only by their first names because they feared official retaliation against their relatives. Others insisted their full names be used despite the risks, saying they were desperate for their stories to be heard. They pleaded with reporters to track down their families in Xinjiang, and one interviewee pressed a piece of paper into a reporter’s hand with a Chinese address scribbled on it.\u0026nbspThe regional government appears to be moving quickly to build centres to house the children of these exiles and of detainees. A review of procurement notices in Xinjiang has found that since the start of last year, the government has budgeted more than $30m\u0026nbsp(200 million Chinese yuan, £22.7m) to build or expand at least 45 orphanages, known variously as “welfare centres” and “protection centres”, with enough beds to house about 5,000 children.\u0026nbspIn July and August alone, the government invited bids for the construction of at least nine centres for the “protection of disadvantaged children” in the Xinjiang city of Hotan and several counties in Kashgar, Aksu and Kizilsu prefectures, inhabited primarily by ethnic minority groups. Most orphanages have a minimum of 100 beds mandated by the government, and some are much larger. One notice called for an orphanage in Moyu county with four four-story dormitories, coming to 22,776 sq\u0026nbspmetres in size – bigger than three\u0026nbspfootball pitches.\u0026nbspThese numbers do not include kindergartens and other schools where some children of Uighur detainees are being housed. It’s impossible to tell how many children of detainees end up at these schools because they also serve other children.\u0026nbspShi Yuqing, a Kashgar civil affairs official, said that “authorities provide aid and support to everyone in need, whether they’re the children of convicted criminals or people killed in traffic accidents”. But such services may not be welcome. A government report from Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture in June last year acknowledged that relatives were resistant to “handing over” their extended families’ kids to the orphanages because they “lack trust or confidence” in the centres.\u0026nbspA friend told Meripet last November her four children were living in the Hotan City Kindness Kindergarten in southern Xinjiang. The friend said Meripet’s sister-in-law had visited her children and was permitted to take them home for one night only.\u0026nbspThe school looks like a house-sized castle, with a bright marigold facade, orange turrets and blue rooftops. Its entrance is blocked by an iron gate and a walled enclosure lined with barbed wire. “We Are Happy and Grateful to the Motherland”, say the red characters emblazoned on one fence.\u0026nbspThe principal, who gave only her last name, Ai, told reporters that the institution was “just a normal kindergarten”. But the authorities’ anxiety was clear: armed police officers surrounded the reporters’ car minutes after their arrival at the school and ordered them to delete any photos.\u0026nbspGu Li, a propaganda official for Hotan who also immediately appeared on the scene, added: “There are really young kids here – some of them may even be orphans whose parents have died.”\u0026nbspHotan City Kindness Kindergarten (AP)A report published this February in the Xinjiang Daily, a party newspaper, called Hotan City Kindness Kindergarten a “free, full-time” kindergarten for children aged six and younger that provides accommodations and clothing to those whose “parents cannot care for them for a variety of reasons”.\u0026nbsp“Soon after many of the kids arrived at the school, they grew taller and got fatter, and quickly started using Mandarin to communicate,” the article said. Another state media report in January said $1.24m had been invested in the kindergarten.\u0026nbspSatellite imagery shows that the kindergarten had been constructed less than three years ago, just as an initiative was launched to strengthen “bilingual” education in Xinjiang. More than 4,300 bilingual kindergartens were built or renovated last year, according to the government. A report on the project in a state-run regional newspaper said such kindergartens taught children “civilised living habits”.\u0026nbsp“The children started educating their parents: your hands are too dirty, your clothes are too dirty, you haven’t brushed your teeth,” the report quoted Achilem Abduwayit, a deputy chief of the Hotan city education bureau, as saying.\u0026nbspLife in an orphanage could have a lasting psychological and cultural impact on children, said James Leibold, an expert on Chinese ethnic policy at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia.\u0026nbsp“You grow up as a ward of the state,” he said. “They’re told to be patriotic citizens, told that the identity and religion of their parents was abnormal, if not radical, and thus needs to be eradicated.”\u0026nbspMeripet has at least an inkling of where her children are. Her brother, a 37-year-old doctor named Aziz, has not heard any news of his three youngest children since his wife was taken to a re-education centre in June 2017.\u0026nbspAziz fled to Turkey more than a year ago after he received a call from his local police station ordering him to report to authorities immediately. More than half his neighbours had already been taken away to re-education centres or prison, he said.\u0026nbspNow the young doctor is often shaken awake by a nightmare in which his kids are huddling at the bottom of a cliff, their faces smudged with dirt, calling to him to hoist them up. Aziz walks for what feels like hours but cannot reach them. He awakens with their cries ringing in his ears.\u0026nbsp“If I could, I would choose not to have been born as a Uighur, to not have been born in Xinjiang,” Aziz said. “We are the most unfortunate ethnic group in the world.”\u0026nbspWorld news in picturesA boat has capsized killing at 136 people in Lake Victoria, Tanzania.

The Venezuelan Information Minister, Jorge Rodriguez, confirmed that President Nicolas Maduro was the victim of an attack with \u0027drone-type flying devices that contained an explosive charge\u0027, and that he escaped unharmed from the incident, which occurred during a military ceremony in CaracasPeople in Mbare celebrate after officials announced the re-election of President Emmerson Mnangagwa of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) in Harare, Zimbabwe. The election was the first since Robert Mugabe was ousted in a military coup last year, and featured a close race between Mnangagwa and opposition candidate Nelson Chamisa of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC Alliance). Deadly clashes broke out earlier in the week following the release of parliamentary election results, amid allegations of fraud by Chamisa and MDC supportersThe Chinese government says all 2.9 million students attending compulsory elementary and junior high school in Xinjiang will receive Mandarin instruction by this month, up from just 39 per cent in 2016.\u0026nbspEven preschoolers are steeped in the language. A former teacher at a “bilingual” kindergarten outside Kashgar said all lessons were given in Mandarin and the entirely Uighur student body was banned from speaking Uighur at school. A colleague who used Uighur to explain concepts to students was fired, according to the teacher, who lives in Turkey but asked for anonymity because she fears retribution against family in China.\u0026nbspLike all schools in China, this one immersed children in patriotic education. Kindergarten textbooks were filled with songs like “Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China”, the teacher said.\u0026nbspDilnur, a 35-year-old business student in exile in Istanbul, said officials regularly visited her children’s kindergarten in Kashgar and asked the students if their parents read religious verses at home or participated in other faith-based activities. The questions effectively forced children to spy on their own families. A man was taken away by police after his grandson said in class that he had made a pilgrimage to Mecca, she said.\u0026nbspHer seven-year-old daughter once complained that her throat was sore from chanting party slogans. “Mama, what does it mean to love the motherland?” she asked.\u0026nbspSome bilingual schools are boarding schools, which are not uncommon in China. Xinjiang has long provided voluntary boarding school programmes that are seen as coveted opportunities for the best minority students. But several Uighurs asserted that in many cases boarding school was now mandatory for minority children, even though Han Chinese children could choose to continue living at home.\u0026nbspThe Xinjiang government did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The government has said the tuition-free boarding schools relieve parents of education and living expenses and help raise Mandarin standards, which will make their children more employable.\u0026nbspBut Uighurs say they do not want their culture erased.\u0026nbspGulzar Seley, who was detained in China along with her newborn son, is placed on a table in the home of her husband Halmurat Idris in Istanbul (AP)“If the kids are forced to speak Mandarin and live like Han Chinese every day, I’m afraid they won’t be like us anymore,” said Meriyem Yusup, whose extended family has four children sent to state-run orphanages in Xinjiang.\u0026nbspAdil Dalelkhan, an ethnic Kazakh sock merchant in exile in Almaty, said that even though his then five-year-old son could live with relatives, he was forced to stay at his preschool Monday\u0026nbspthrough Friday instead. The father called the policy a “terrifying” step towards extinguishing Kazakh culture.\u0026nbspA Uighur businessman in Istanbul, also named Adil, told a similar story. Adil’s son was nine\u0026nbspyears old when the school system automatically transferred him to a boarding school. All children of a certain age in their Uighur district were obliged to attend boarding school, Adil said. His son was only permitted to come home on weekends and holidays.\u0026nbsp“There were iron bars like we saw in a zoo in Kashgar,” Adil recalled.\u0026nbspDilnur said her neighbours too were only allowed to visit their kids at boarding school on Wednesday nights, and even then they had to hand them sweets through a fence.\u0026nbsp“The educational goals are secondary to the political goals,” said Timothy Grose, a professor at Indiana’s Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology who has done research on Xinjiang boarding schools. “They aim to dissolve loyalties to ethnic identity ... toward a national identity.”\u0026nbspA government notice posted in February in Kashgar states that children in the fourth grade and above with parents in detention must be sent to boarding school immediately – even if one parent is still at home. Students must be instilled with socialist values, the notice said, and be taught to “be grateful for education and love and repay the motherland”, and avoid the “75 types of behaviour that show religious extremism”. Such behaviour ranges from calling for “holy war” to growing beards and quitting smoking and drinking for religious reasons, the government says.\u0026nbspChina insists it guarantees\u0026nbspfreedom of religion, but Uighurs view the Chinese education system as a threat to it. In schools, children are taught to respect teachers more than their parents and may begin to criticise their parents’ Islamic faith, according to Byler.\u0026nbsp“The students, children, might question them and say, you know, this is backward, this is extremist,” he said.\u0026nbspThe Kashgar notice also said schools being modified to house students should place no more than 24 beds in one room – an indication of the programme’s size. In 2015, a sprawling new boarding school complex was completed on the outskirts of Kashgar, with the capacity to house 23,400 students and teachers, according to the state-run China Daily.\u0026nbspAbdurehim Imin, a writer from Kashgar, said a friend told him his 14-year-old daughter had been sent to a bilingual school in 2015 after his wife was arrested, ostensibly for receiving a gift of olive oil he sent her. When reporters visited what appeared to be his daughter’s school, Peyzawat County No 4 High School, a local plainclothes officer who identified herself as Gu Li said it was a bilingual boarding school. She said that while Uighur students had to study Mandarin, there were also Han Chinese students studying Uighur.\u0026nbspYet the exterior of the school bore bright red lettering that said: “Please speak Mandarin upon entering the schoolyard”. Barbed wire around the campus extended for miles, with rows of tall apartment buildings marked as dormitories.\u0026nbspA historian at the University of Sydney, David Brophy, said the move towards boarding schools brought to mind Aboriginal children in Australia who were forcibly separated from their families in the 1900s and placed into state-run institutions that discouraged indigenous identity.\u0026nbsp“Should China’s policies continue in this direction, we may be talking about a Chinese version of the Stolen Generation,” he said.Since coming to Istanbul by himself in 2014, 42-year-old Imin, the writer, has led a solitary existence in a dimly lit apartment with bare walls and stacks of writings. For the first year, he avoided looking at photos of his children.\u0026nbsp“We are dying every day,” Imin said. “We cannot see our kids, we cannot see our parents. This is an eternal torture.”\u0026nbspIn December, he was sent a photo of his daughter wearing a traditional Chinese “qipao”. He deleted the picture because he could not bear to look at it, he said, and could not sleep for nearly a month.\u0026nbspImin also has four other children in Xinjiang. Last summer, a friend who had visited his home in Kashgar told Imin that two of them had been killed in a traffic accident while his wife was in prison. He does not know where the other two are.\u0026nbspFeeling helpless, he wrote verse after verse in mourning:\u0026nbsp“I will go... to tear down your dark, endless night ...\u0026nbspI will go, to embrace again my hometown ...\u0026nbspI will go, bearing my sorrow to your tomb.”\u0026nbspElsewhere in Istanbul, Meripet’s house was quiet during Eid al-Adha, a Muslim holy festival heralded by large family reunions. In a room at the end of the hall, there rose the distant laughter of relatives’ children.\u0026nbspShe flipped through the photographs she keeps in her purse: Abdurahman, the oldest Adile, her only daughter and her two younger sons, Muhemmed and Abdulla. Meripet has a fifth child, a son named Abduweli who was born in Turkey. She calls him “my only light”.\u0026nbsp“Sometimes I wonder if I will go crazy from this pain,” she says. “I have only been able to keep living because I know there is hope – I know one day I will see my children again.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/22/18/imran-khan-saudi.jpg","title":"pakistan saudi arabia imran khan china belt road infrastructure project","story":"Created with Sketch.Click to followThe IndependentSaudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud receives Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan in JeddahIslamabad has invited Saudi Arabia to become the third partner in the Beijing-funded Belt and Road corridor of major infrastructure projects inside Pakistan.The announcement comes on the back of a two-day trip to Saudi Arabia by new prime minister Imran Khan, who had been expected to push for financial assistance from Islamabad\u0027s ally to help Pakistan deal with a brewing currency crisis.Information minister Fawad Chaudhry did not reveal if Saudi Arabia would be loaning money to Pakistan to help top up its dwindling foreign currency reserves, but said he expected Saudi Arabia to invest in Pakistan in a major way.Saudi Arabia is the first country whom we have invited as third country partner in CPEC, Chaudhry said, referring to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the Pakistan leg of China\u0027s vast Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.Beijing has pledged $60bn\u0026nbspto build power stations, major highways, new and upgraded railways and higher capacity ports, to help turn Pakistan into a major overland route linking western China to the world.Mr Chaudhry said a Saudi delegation will be coming to Pakistan in the first week of October, including the Saudi minister for finance and energy, and that should lay down a foundation for a very big partnership.God willing, very big investments will be coming to Pakistan from Saudi Arabia this way, he added.Mr Khan\u0027s term began with new doubt over the CPEC projects, when his commerce minister was quoted as saying Pakistan would suspend them for a year and review them. The minister later said his comments were taken out of context, and Pakistani officials reassured Beijing there would be no delay.World news in picturesA boat has capsized killing at 136 people in Lake Victoria, Tanzania.

A vexed issue. Complain about it and people will call you a racist.That’s a popular way of shutting down debate these days. Just screech “raaacisst” at someone.I’d go so far as to say it’s one of the reasons Leave won the referendum — because ordinary people were sick of being called racist when they simply worried about the millions of people who have arrived here in the past ten years.About seven million, in fact. An astonishing number.The Prime Minister is about to draw up her plans for immigration post-Brexit.She will be taking advice from the Migration Advisory Committee . It has suggested we allow in skilled workers who might be vital to our economy.It has also suggested we clamp down on low-skilled migrants.This seems to me a perfectly sensible argument. We should not entirely close ourselves off from the world. And there are foreign nationals here who do excellent work for our country. And pay good taxes.At the same time, the vast influx of low-skilled workers has had a terrible effect upon our country.Some towns — such as Boston in Lincolnshire — have been effectively taken over.And as the MAC found, the vast reservoir of labour has depressed the wages of British people at the lowest end of the scale. It has hurt the poorest of us.But it doesn’t only hurt us. You’ll have seen the squalid conditions in which a lot of these low-paid foreign workers live. This is exploitation, on a massive scale.How any leftie can support it absolutely befoggles me.Living below the minimum wage, crammed into rotten accommodation — all so companies such as Amazon can make a bigger profit.No wonder the big companies were the first to complain. Listen: Pay your workers a decent, living wage in future and shut up, huh?But this is an overcrowded country. It is ludicrous to suggest that the millions we have allowed in have not had a massive effect on our infrastructure.It’s why we need to pave over more and more of the countryside to build homes, for example. The MAC suggested house prices had risen as a consequence — and our homes already cost too much.There’s pressure on our schools, our hospitals and our transport networks.Well, with any luck this will all come to an end. Perhaps the Government might also abide by its pledge to get yearly immigration levels down to the tens of thousands, rather than the hundreds of thousands as it is at the moment.But at the same time we should look after the EU migrants we have already let in, and ensure they feel secure and safe living in Britain.Do all that and I’ll be a happy man. Even  the lefties still shriek “raaacisst” every few seconds.GIRLS – looking for something to wear for a night out? You’ll find it in a drawer in your kitchen.They come in rolls for about £1.50 from Asda. Yep, it’s the black bin liner, as sported here by Megan Barton Hanson.I have no idea, incidentally, who Megan Barton Hanson is, still less her boyfriend called “Wes”.BBC Radio 6 presenter Cerys Matthews says she refuses to play music made by people who went to private school.OK, Cerys. That means your entire back catalogue is banned, seeing as you were educated at the expensive St Michael’s School in Llanelli.A few weeks ago a BBC executive said he wouldn’t be commissioning comedies from public schoolboys .Spouting every right-on opinion that suddenly swings into fashion?Here’s a tip, Cerys.

Was it a fly agaric? That’s the one with a big red head covered in white spots. If so, Donald ought to get himself to a doctor.Or maybe it’s that one with a thin stalk and a big yellow head the size of a dinner plate.If so, Stormy had better get herself to a doctor.A “RELATIONSHIP expert” has warned us all about dodgy body language  we’re out on a date.Tracey Cox says we shouldn’t fidget, for a start. What, even  we’ve taken her to a ballet?Also, don’t wring your hands or sit in a slumped manner, and so on.Hmm. As a “relationship expert” I offer the following advice to blokes out on a first date in a restaurant.2. Don’t pass wind then waft the air saying “Mmmmm, Bisto!”3. When they bring the black pepper, don’t sneeze on her pasta.4. If you do sneeze on her pasta, stir it around a bit when she’s not looking.5. Don’t use a bread stick to excavate the contents of your ear.6. Don’t keep checking the football scores on your phone. And shouting loudly: “Lee Gregory! 85th minute! Get IN you f***er!”7. Don’t ask the lady at the next table  she’s up for a threesome.Follow that stuff and you can fidget away to your heart’s delight. You’ll be OK.THERE’S a crisis in our wildle. Some of our favourite species of birds or mammals are on the brink of extinction.The corn bunting, for example, and the hedgehog.As TV wildle campaigner Chris Packham rightly says, this is because we have paved over the countryside to build ever more homes.And because of the intensive farming methods – which have seen the eradication of farmland birds.Packham has drawn up a “People’s Manesto for Wildle” which includes stuff like twinning city schools with farms, so that kids grow up with an understanding of nature.There’s also a demo at Hyde Park in London on Saturday. I’ll be there. Don’t forget – as Joni Mitchell once sang, you don’t know what you’ve got ’til its gone.SO, it looks very much as  the old Irish border problem is going to be solved very quickly after all.We’re close to agreeing a deal with the European Union which will enable Northern Ireland to retain its “soft border”.The Remainers said it couldn’t be done.

The annual ­target for new homes is 300,000 — and we doubt even that would lower prices enough for young people to afford to buy in London and the South East.In fairness, the total HAS risen to 217,000 a year, the most since 2007. But it’s still way short — and the Government’s remedies are woefully timid.Sajid Javid promised a huge shake-up when he ran housing. He was knocked back by the negativity from Philip Hammond’s Treasury. Then he moved on.We need to slash planning restrictions and defy obstructive NIMBYs.

Two Cabinet figures have quit already. She must insist it’s take it or leave it.Only Britain has made genuine compromises in this negotiation, as despondent Brexiteers know only too well.It’s the EU’s turn.FROM child abuse images to terrorism, Facebook is a platform for evil it seems unable or unwilling to prevent.Now it is hosting ads for people- smuggling gangs luring children to their doom in the Mediterranean.A new low, even for a tech giant with apparently no moral compass.Since Facebook now admits it is a publisher, why isn’t it regulated as one?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This lot are more Bugsy Malone than Al Capone.Yesterday the leaders of the undemocratic European Union showed their true colours.This isn’t some grand project, designed to bring the peoples of Europe together in one happy union. It’s a protection racket.But even before the Prime Minister had been the subject of calculated attempts to humiliate her, we saw just how detached from reality Europe’s leaders have become.Maltese and Czech leaders told Britain to hold a second referendum, employing the same tactic that the EU has used in Ireland and Denmark before.This isn’t based on the half-baked “democratic” argument clung to by never-were and past-it grandees at home, such as Andrew Adonis and Lord Heseltine.They just want us to be given the chance to vote the “right” way. Fat chance of that. Throughout this process, the European Union has shown time and time again why more than 17 million people voted to leave.They have refused to negotiate in good faith. They have refused to compromise, even while Britain has worked day-in, day-out to find agreement.They have insulted the Prime Minister, ignored their own citizens, and are willing to accept a massive economic hit for the sake of flexing their muscles.Like all good gangsters, they’re trying to rule by fear. That’s the only weapon in their arsenal on the Continent, where more and more voters are turning against an outfit that increasingly looks more at home in Sicily than Strasbourg.All they have is the chance to punish us, and prove to the rest of the continent that it isn’t worth leaving.The message they want to send? You won’t get away with it.Well, Mrs May is right to say that we’ve nothing to be scared of.Yes, it is without doubt that we need to pick up the pace on preparations for a clean-break Brexit.It is vital we show the European Union, who still seem to think we’ll roll over when it really matters, that we are ready for a new future free of their cold, dead hands.And despite no-marks such as Donald Tusk trolling the PM on Instagram, and the puffed-up pomposity of France’s Emmanuel Macron and Ireland’s Leo Varadkar, we haven’t entirely given up hope that sensible forces within the EU might find their voice in the crucial months to come — and work with the UK, not against it.The Government should be all ears  Brussels makes us an offer that works for both sides.But after yesterday’s performance, we don’t hold out much hope.Brussels has made us an offer it thinks we can’t refuse.Today we join the Prime Minister in saying no.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He sets the timetable and makes decisions over which engines should be scrapped. The problem with today’s railway ­system is that there is nobody who takes on the role.That was made clear in the report by Professor Stephen Glaister, the chairman of the Office Of Rail And Road, into the chaos that paralysed the railways in May following an extensive timetable change.In a logical world, you might think, dear rail passenger, that Chris Grayling, the Secretary Of State For Transport, is the man in charge. After all, he is the one who pops up on TV when there is good news to announce, such as the opening of a refurbished ­station or the introduction of new trains, but you would be wrong.Grayling refuses to take responsibility, recently telling a Parliamentary committee that “I don’t run the railways”. Yet his civil servants in the Department interfere with the railways all the time. They make decisions over what ­services should be run, the fares to be charged, what new trains should be bought and which private company should operate them.Prof Glaister’s report makes clear that Grayling was deeply involved in making the decision to go ahead with the timetable changes, even though the ­industry was not prepared for them. If Grayling was not in charge, then he should have made sure that someone else was — but failed to do so.It’s clear from the report no one has overall responsibility for the ­railways, and that’s why they are in such a mess.Prof Glaister’s report highlights the fact that the railways were simply not ready to cope with the wholesale ­timetable changes, which were focused around ­services through London on the Thameslink lines and across the North, and ­overall affected nearly half — 46 per cent — of trains on the whole network.The report shows that the railway ­simply could not cope. The changes brought the service to its knees, resulting in thousands of services being ­cancelled and countless others delayed. Many passengers in May were left standing at stations for hours as ­successive trains failed to turn up.On one branch line in the Lake District, services were cancelled entirely and temporarily replaced by a diesel-hauled heritage train — which proved to be more popular than the usual service, especially as it was free.The introduction of the timetable resulted in the worst performance of the railways in more than a decade, with one in eight trains running late during this period. The after-effects are still being felt today, with daily cancellations and delays, and it will be several months before things are back to normal.Prof Glaister does not mince his words and found every part of the industry wanting. Network Rail, which is responsible for drawing up the timetable, “did not take any action” back in the autumn when it was clear there would be trouble ­implementing the new schedules.Two train operators, Govia Thameslink and Northern, “were not sufficiently aware” of the problems and failed to inform passengers when disruption ­occurred, while the Department For Transport and the Office Of Rail And Road itself watched these events unfold without doing anything or questioning whether the introduction of the timetable should be postponed.The irony is that the timetable changes were introduced to increase the number of trains available to commuters. In ­particular, in the North, the opening of the new Ordsall Chord linking ­Manchester’s two main railway stations was designed to improve services in the region.However, because Network Rail failed to ensure that more platforms were built at the biggest station, Piccadilly, rather than improvements for local passengers the result has been longer delays and ­numerous cancellations.That is precisely the sort of lack of co-ordination which happens because ­British Rail was broken up on its privatisation in the 1990s into more than 100 companies. Passengers are paying the price for that mistake today.The biggest error was to separate the services, run by companies including ­Virgin and Arriva, from the infrastructure, which is in the hands of Network Rail , when, in fact, the railways run much better as a single entity.Ironically, the Prime Minister at the time, John Major, had wanted the railway to be sold off as just four or five large companies that ran services and were responsible for the tracks and stations, but he was overruled by the Treasury, which wanted competition between ­companies — something that has simply not happened.As a result of the timetable chaos and other recent problems on the railways, such as the failure of the East Coast franchise and overspending on ­electrication schemes by Network Rail, Grayling has launched an inquiry into the state of the railways. It is the fourth such inquiry in the past decade and the others have largely been ignored.This time there is an obvious and clear solution. Create an organisation ­independent of the duffers in Whitehall who keep on interfering with the railways, and make sure it is headed by a Fat ­Controller who has power to make ­decisions over the whole railway, ­including the timetable, investment plans and ­services.Inevitably, this will at first have to be a publicly-owned body, since Network Rail is currently owned by the Government.But to appease any Tories opposed to renationalisation, Grayling could say that eventually it might be privatised — though given the experience of the crisis-ridden past 20 years, that day may well be a long time off.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Then we’re just organising a failure for November.”On Mrs May’s humiliating day, they added: “There was no ambush. There was a mismanagement of expectations on the UK side about what would happen.”Recent briefings by Number 10 about splits in the EU, plus warm overtones towards the UK from Poland and Hungary, hardened leaders’ resolve.The 27 leaders had arrived in Salzburg originally wanting to help Mrs May by choreographing a soft landing for a Brexit deal.An EU official added: “It’s true there was an expectation of de-dramatisation going into this summit and we saw that with Barnier offering a new version of a backstop beforehand.“That got offered to de-dramatise but that was undermined by the op-ed Theresa May published, and to an EU audience as well, where she completely dismissed the proposed Irish backstop and put things back into the sovereignty narrative.“We are concerned a little bit that the British game plan here is to push the backstop to the very end.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The EU know this Government didn’t start properly planning for no deal until this summer.Senior figures there believe the UK will back down rather than go down a route it is so ill-prepared for.So Mrs May is trying to, publicly, burn her boats on the beach.To show that she can’t accept membership of the European Economic Area and the customs union, which would leave the UK as essentially a non-voting member of the EU, or the current Irish backstop, which would see Northern Ireland kept in the EU’s customs union even as the rest of the UK leaves it.One Downing Street source tells me all European leaders say they want an agreement.But a deal isn’t compatible with their Irish backstop proposal. So they’ll have to choose.If the EU doesn’t show any sign of moving in the next fortnight, Mrs May will come under real pressure to change tack from Chequers from her own Cabinet.“The problem is the Cabinet ministers who backed it on the grounds that it was doable,” one Secretary of State tells me. .A growing number of Cabinet ministers think that with the EU rejecting Chequers, Mrs May should turn to a more Canada-style approach — pushing for the free trade deal the EU has repeatedly said is on offer.“There’s an opportunity amid the embarrassment,” one member of this group tells me.No10 rejects this argument, saying a Canada-style deal doesn’t solve the Irish backstop problem.But these ministers think by moving away from Chequers, the UK could create the space for a compromise on the Irish border.Another problem is how blindsided No10 was by the Salzburg snub.This will make it harder for Downing Street to persuade ministers to trust its judgment on what compromises need to be made to get a deal.For instance, Olly Robbins, the PM’s chief Europe adviser, wants us to commit to matching EU social and environmental regulations as well as product regulations.This is meant to deal with one of the EU’s objections to Chequers, that the UK could gain a competitive advantage by not following every new EU rule in these fields.But several key ministers have objections to this.They are now less likely to accept this compromise because they are far more sceptical of Robbins’ reading of the state of the negotiations.In the coming weeks, the Cabinet will become more and more assertive.They won’t all be pushing for the same thing — there are those who would prefer a customs union to a Canada-style deal — but they will demand greater input.For they nearly all worry about no deal.One Government source tells me: “We all know what no deal looks like, you can’t blunder into that.”What Mrs May must do in the coming weeks is give herself room for manoeuvre between no deal and signing up to a customs union.She is trying to do that by shocking the EU into engaging with Chequers.But  the EU won’t, then several key Cabinet ministers will push for a new approach ahead of the October EU Council.THERESA MAY has set up a small, kitchen Cabinet to consult on Brexit policy.It met in the first week of September and again on Tuesday this week.This new Cabinet grouping essentially replaces the Brexit inner Cabinet.Mrs May cooled on this Brexit inner Cabinet, which was designed to be balanced between those who campaigned for Brexit and those who had backed Remain, after it objected to her preferred customs plan.I understand that Philip Hammond forcibly made the point that such a balanced committee constrained her options.Those attending this meeting include the increasingly influential David Lidington, Chancellor Philip Hammond, the Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, Michael Gove, the chief whip Julian Smith and the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, who has taken charge of the mission of selling Chequers.In Whitehall, this new group has been dubbed “The Chequers Defence Committee” because of how much of its time is taken up with working out how to sell the Prime Minister’s Brexit proposals.The first meeting included a discussion of whether, and how, ministers should respond to Boris Johnson’s broadsides against Mrs May’s plan.The discussions have also revealed something about Mrs May’s relationship with her own MPs.It was agreed that the PM would meet with a series of Labour Brexiteers – Gisela Stuart, Frank Field and Kate Hoey – in the hope that they might be able to persuade some of her MPs to back her approach.This is quite extraordinary: A PM trying to get opposition figures to persuade her own party to back her plans.CABINET will meet on Monday to discuss Britain’s post-Brexit immigration policy.This is one of the most important decisions this Government will take.So it is absurd that, on Friday lunchtime, ministers still did not have the papers for the meeting.I understand, though, that the Government’s intention is to come up with a system that does not discriminate between EU nationals and those from the rest of the world.However, the UK will be prepared to discuss immigration as part of a trade deal. But this arrangement will not be free movement.Earlier this month, Mrs May told her closest Cabinet colleagues that this is one of the issues she is determined not to compromise on.What is required is an immigration system that encourages the best and the brightest to come here and ensures this country has the workers it needs.I UNDERSTAND there was a plan for Jeremy Corbyn to attend today’s Liverpool match against Southampton ahead of Labour’s conference in the city.But the club didn’t want him on the pitch, so Corbyn won’t get to score at the Kop end.Labour deny that there was any plan for Corbyn to go on to the pitch.IF No10 didn’t have enough to worry about ahead of Tory conference, there is the issue of Theresa May’s voice.She can ill afford a repeat of last year, when it kept giving out during the speech.In an attempt to prevent this from happening, her schedule will be pared right back. Mrs May will do some events designed to encourage more women into politics.But Cabinet Ministers will fill in for her at the ious regional receptions to try to save her voice.Mrs May’s voice isn’t No10’s only concern.One Cabinet minister tells me: “They are completely paranoid she is going to get slow hand-clapped.”This fear strikes me as misplaced.Activists who remember the agony of last year’s conference speech will give her credit for standing up and doing it all over again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s not a negotiation.So, as Mrs May says, it’s stalemate. If, as The Sun expects, their response is more of the same, she should tell them this: “Here’s one final offer... not Chequers, but a simple free trade deal, plus security co-operation, that respects our referendum and your principles.“And since Michel Barnier now accepts that technology CAN police borders, let’s use it between Northern Ireland and Ireland.” If they spurn that, we’ll know they aren’t serious.We can leave with no deal, bank our £39billion orce payment and mitigate short-term damage by slashing taxes.We will lure businesses and talent from the continent and embrace those already here, as Mrs May has promised.And we will be free from the clutches of the Brussels club and the posturing pygmies running it.IS anyone more delusional or dishonest than the laughably-named People’s Vote campaign?These Remainiac losers pretend a second referendum is in the nation’s interests when it plainly only serves theirs.To get their way they would risk hideous disorder and the annihilation of trust in democracy. And they are utterly deluded about their chances of victory.Almost all Leavers would vote the same way, alongside many ex-Remainers who know the first vote must be honoured and now see the EU for what it truly is, especially after Thursday.But even  Remain won, why should anyone respect THEIR victory?It would never be sustainable.

Was she peaceful? Was she pregnant?’”, he said.“I always made sure I never said anything — in all the cases of public interest I was involved with — that hadnt already appeared in the press.“Pathologically there was no evidence that Princess Diana was pregnant, but some women say they know theyre pregnant from the moment of conception.

Gone,  was the mantra that there is no alternative to the Chequers proposal, which so angered all of us who have campaigned for Brexit.Yet instead, two things emerged. The first that the Prime Minister was clearly angered by their treatment of her.Regardless of their views on Chequers, she has the right to believe that as the UK has always treated the EU with respect, so EU leaders should show the UK the same respect in .Second is what I and others have been saying, that the best and most workable relationship after we leave is one based on a comprehensive free trade agreement between the UK and the EU.However,  we are to reach such an agreement, the EU must recognise that they will have to get rid of the demands for a Northern Irish border backstop, which blocks such a deal.The EU demand that either the UK as a whole stay in the Customs Union or that Northern Ireland is separated from the UK by a customs border is unacceptable and would harm our Union.In fact, a recent publication by two ex-Secretaries of State for Northern Ireland shows that there does not need to be a “hard” border with checkpoints or gates, and instead we could have a practical solution where goods flow freely between Ireland and Northern Ireland.In fact, such a system should be employed at all our borders around the UK, as this would greatly reduce the likelihood of customs problems at ports from Zeebrugge to Calais.So after months of manoeuvring, and poor advice from advisers in No10, now the choice is at least — and at last — crystal clear.The UK wants a comprehensive trade deal with the EU but they need to cease demands about the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.Failing that, the UK will leave under terms which govern trade between nations around the world.No trade deal is better than a bad trade deal, so the ball is firmly in the EU’s court.By Priti Patel, Tory former Cabinet ministerOUTRAGEOUS, insulting and immature sums up the EU’s appalling behaviour to the UK and to our Prime Minister.These shenanigans from an out-of-touch EU elite serve to demonstrate why Britain was right to vote leave.Who wants to remain in a club where its senior unelected figures mock our great and proud country and shamefully ambush our PM?Not only has Britain bankrolled the EU for the past 45 years, the freedoms and liberties enjoyed by the Continent have been secured by our Armed Forces and the sacrices Britain made in two world wars.While we want to maintain strong, friendly and cordial relations with our friends and partners in Europe, Donald Tusk belittles the PM on social media and President Macron brands those who back Brexit as “liars”.Macron’s undiplomatic comments are an insult not only to the 17.4million people who backed Brexit but to the entire country.Their aim is simple. To reverse the result of the referendum and put Brussels back in charge.The British people deserve better than the EU humiliating and insulting us.We are a proud nation and will not stand for a Government that surrenders to unreasonable demands from Europe’s unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats. This Government has already gone too far, with Chequers offering the EU control over large parts of our law-making.The sad fact about the position the Government is now in is that it was advised to “chuck Chequers” and pursue an alternative course of free and open trade.However, this is not the moment to cower and compromise further.Salzburg should mark the moment when we decide as a country to press ahead with taking back full control over our destiny.Our generous overtures of a £40billion orce payment, remaining an EU rule taker and compromise have been spurned and the EU is resorting to insults.So it’s time the Government realised this and “got real” on Brexit.Britain must take back control of these negotiations and send the EU a signal it will understand loud and clear.We must take the £40billion off the table and remind the EU there are serious consequences to their appalling behaviour and this will hit them hard.If they want to negotiate then we should offer them a take-it-or-leave-it, Canada-plus-style free trade deal, which is an economic prize for the UK and our trading partners.We leave the EU in six months and instead of wasting time accommodating its belligerent attitude, now is the time to unite the nation, believe in Britain and let the EU know that Brexit really does mean Brexit. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I felt like I was being treated like a criminal.I wanted to resubmit my application and take the test but with them holding my passport I wasnt able to. I was trapped.Stacey added: I honestly dont think I have slept since this started. The emotional stress that it has caused is so upsetting.It could tear our family apart and we have set up a le here.The Home Office have now said his passport will be ed, but he will still need to resubmit an application and complete the A1 English Language test.The couple have set up a petition to make other people aware of the rule change.A Home Office spokesman said: We have spoken to Mr Magnus to apologise for the delay in ing his passport.His passport will be ed as a matter of urgency."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000436032388-e1537654497467.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"chinese companies knives uk streets","story":"What witnesses said began as an argument between a group of men over a mobile phone was settled with a 2ft blade.After rushing to the victim’s aid in Tufnell Park, North London, on Tuesday, ex-soldier Brett Thompson, 63, said: “We tried desperately to save him by putting towels and T-shirts around the wound.“But from my military medical training, I knew it was no good.”It was another grim and needless tragedy in a nation that has seen kne crime hit a seven-year high, with 40,147 offences in the year to March.As the Government desperately attempts to stem the blade carnage, The Sun on Sunday today reveals a trail of blood that leads from UK streets to the factories of “kne city” — Yangjiang in China.Unscrupulous companies there are packaging killer blades as “garden tools” or “cake tools”, then posting them to UK buyers after wrapping them in silver foil in an attempt to cheat X-ray machines when they arrive here.Carer Lynne Baird, 61, whose son Daniel, 26, died from multiple stab wounds outside a Birmingham pub last year, said: “This trade must be stopped.“They are making money out of knives that kill people. I can’t understand why anyone would do that.”At Royal Mail’s vast Heathrow Worldwide Distribution Centre in Langley, Berks, eagle-eyed Border Force officers scan packages that have just arrived from abroad.Ridwan Koodruth, 28, a Border Force senior officer, told us: “If you worked here for a week you would pretty much see every type of weapon there is.“We get swords, 2ft zombie knives, throwing stars and stun guns. It’s incredible what people think they can get away with sending in the post.”When a small parcel labelled “garden tool” was opened, it revealed an illegal butterfly kne wrapped in foil.Costing just £3.82, the blade was being sent to an address in Newcastle upon Tyne.The packaging revealed it had originated in Yangjiang.Styling itself as the “Capital Of Knives And Scissors”, the city with a population of 2.4million is a mass of factories hugging the country’s south coast. It accounts for 85 per cent of China’s global kne and scissors exports.Companies legally tout wholesale bulk orders for machetes and hunting knives on the internet.Ridwan said: “Everything posted into the country comes through our hubs, without exception. We get packages from all over the world.“But it is fair to say a lot does come from China and we can only assume this is because things can be made cheaply there. It’s an e-commerce issue.”A second package from Yangjiang was opened.Labelled “tools”, it contained a 4in banned flick kne for which a buyer in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, had paid £4.59.All 11 knives seized by Border Force while The Sun on Sunday watched originated in China. Some had come via the Netherlands.Destination addresses included the Scottish Borders, Cardf, Norwich and South London.There were two flick knives shaped like AK-47 assault rles at £7.69 for the pair. They were heading for an address in Morecambe, Lancs, before being intercepted.A parcel labelled “kitchen tool ” actually contained a 7in kne, costing £7.65. It too was wrapped in foil.The number of knives detected at Britain’s ports and airports is also soaring — yet until early next year, when it becomes law to collect such packages in person, there is little that can be done to stop those ordering them.Border Force seized 10,935 offensive weapons, excluding guns, in the year 2016/17. That was up from 5,419 in 2013/14.Ridwan said: “We can see that efforts have been made to conceal these weapons. It just doesn’t work and people doing this should know all of these illegal imports are referred to the police.”Yet the grim death toll continues, with at least 59 people murdered with a kne in London alone this year. Earlier this month 12 people were stabbed in Birmingham in just one week.So what is the Government doing about the carnage?Hours before Tuesday’s murder in Tufnell Park, an elite Met Police unit gathered at dawn on an estate in Park Royal, a 30-minute drive away.Soon the North West London street echoed to the sound of splintered glass as the Violent Crime Task Force crowbarred its way into a suspected drug dealer’s home looking for knives.A detachment of British Transport Police officers first smashed through a ground-floor window before charging into the property. The raid followed a tip-off that an alleged gang member based there possessed an arsenal of knives. Weapons, including three blades, were gathered from the lair.One of the officers on the raid, which was witnessed by The Sun on Sunday, described the knives as “something you might see in a Bruce Lee movie”.Inspector Paul Trice told us: “Those weapons will be taken away for forensic examination to see  we can link them to any crime.”He added: “We have a great relationship with the postal services when items come into this country and a lot of work goes into picking those up.”The suspected dealer was not at home. Outside the new-build property three motorscooters were searched and a large quantity of cannabis discovered.The dawn raid — also watched by Crime Minister Victoria Atkins — was part of Operation Sceptre, a fresh Government drive to get knives off the streets.Chief Superintendent Ade Adelekan, 51, head of the Violent Crime Task Force, which has recovered at least 234 knives this year, said: “This is not a gimmick. This is what we do in response to kne crime across the country.”Home Office minister Victoria, 42, praised The Sun on Sunday’s anti-kne Beat The Blades campaign.Gesturing at the kne cache, she added: “They could do a great deal of harm. I hope this neighbourhood will be a bit safer after this raid.”She believes the Offensive Weapons Bill, currently before Parliament, will help stem the bloody kne violence.It will stop knives being sent to residential addresses after they are bought online.It will also create a new criminal offence aimed at firms that deliver a kne on behalf of a seller outside the UK to a person under 18.The minister said: “We’re tackling the online sale of knives because we know the vast majority of shop-keepers obey the law by not selling knives to under-18s.This is about giving the police what they need.”Back at the Royal Mail Heathrow depot, Border Force’s Ridwan said: “The new law will mean people ordering these weapons will have to pick them up in person.“They need to have a think about that. It will be a game-changer.”Grieving mum Lynne Baird hopes Ridwan is right. After son Daniel’s death last year, her family started the Stop Kne Crime — All Lives Matter campaign. A man has been charged with his murder.The mum of eight said: “Losing Dan has completely ruined our lives. The grief is there every day.“If this law change saves even one le and stops another family going through the pain we’ve been through, then it will be worth it.Great strides have been made since June, when we set up a task force to come up with a plan to rid our streets of bloodshed.Home Secretary Sajid Javid praised our campaign this month after 4,100 knives were seized in just one week.He also doubled the Early Intervention Youth Fund – a Home Office scheme aimed at preventing serious violence – to £22million.Colin James, a member of our panel and youth worker at the Gangs Unite action group, believes more can be done.He said: “If young people don’t have access to these weapons, they can’t use them.“Whoever is making these weapons – and making them available to young people – should be charged alongside any would-be killer.“They are just as guilty.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are running out of options.And according to the Sunday Times, a senior Tory strategist was overheard telling a colleague: What are you doing in November - because I think we are going to need an election.The soft-Brexit blueprint thrashed out by Mrs May and her ministers at her country retreat was last week ripped up by her EU counterparts.It prompted the PM to deliver a scathing address on Friday in which she blasted Euro bullies for not paying the UK enough respect to negotiate fairly.A member of Mrs Mays inner circle also claimed to Cabinet colleagues she is preparing to step down next summer — to fend off a leadership election until after Brexit.Stewart Jackson, former chief of staff to David Davis, the ex-Brexit Secretary who quit of the Chequers proposals, said the PM had 10 days to save her premiership.He told the Times: She needs to use her conference speech to show she can think imaginatively on Brexit, otherwise she will be facing a leadership challenge very soon.Reports also claim that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab was told by  EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier that the UK could only choose off-the-peg arrangements with Europe post Brexit.These could mirror the models used by Norway, Canada, Ukraine or Switzerland — and the EU would do the UK a political favour by selling the deal to the public as bespoke to Britain.But the reported offer was said to have been turned down as it would fool no one.Norway: Has access to the Single Market but agrees to rules like Freedom of Movement.

And the Labour leader will reluctantly back a second EU referendum  his party conference calls for it. In his only newspaper interview as delegates gathered in Liverpool, Mr Corbyn said: “If this Government can’t deliver Brexit then it must move over and have a General Election.” To do this Mr Corbyn’s MPs and Tories from Jacob Rees-Mogg’s \u0026shyEuropean Research Group of \u0026shyBrexiteers would vote together against Mrs May’s Chequers plan. Labour set six tests for any final deal including a strong relationship with Europe, the same rights, protections and benefits we have now and fair migration to boost Britain’s economy.  Mr Corbyn said: “Chequers does not meet them. We are not happy with it and we would vote against it. “That could trigger a General \u0026shyElection and we’re ready for it.” Mrs May has agreed to give Parliament a vote on a final Brexit deal. That was due next month but is likely now to slip into November. With 40 Tory MPs signalling they will vote against any deal based on Chequers that means the PM is left with nothing. Technically she has 21 days to find an alternative.  But Mrs May is clear it’s Chequers or no deal. And losing a Commons vote she has staked her premiership on could mean going back to the polls for the third time in three years. She won plaudits for Friday’s tough-talking No10 statement following EU leaders ambushing her at their Salzburg Brexit summit when they tried to torpedo Chequers. The PM demanded Europe shows Britain respect and gives ground. Mr Corbyn says that was ill-advised. He added: “Clearly negotiations didn’t go well in Salzburg but condemning everyone else in the room isn’t very helpful. “Of course everyone should show respect for each other, including the EU for Britain. But we’re 26 months in from the referendum and we’re still at base camp. It’s extremely serious.”  Mrs May is still grappling with major issues like the customs union and the Irish border. But Mr Corbyn is also under pressure – to agree to a second referendum on either a final deal or whether to stay in the EU  there is no deal. He has been reluctant to commit himself. A poll by People’s Vote campaigners showed nearly 90 per cent of Labour Party members back another \u0026shyreferendum.  Three-quarters would like to see a commitment in Labour’s manesto. And 93 per cent would vote to stay in the EU  they were given a chance. Mr Corbyn remains unconvinced of the wisdom of a second vote, but he faces a conference motion this week which could force his hand.  He said: “What comes out of conference I will adhere to. But I’m not calling for a second referendum. I hope we will agree that the best way of resolving this is a General Election. “But I was elected to empower the members of the party. So  conference makes a decision I will not walk away from it and I will act accordingly.” Mrs May said: “Advocating a second referendum and extending article 50 to delay Brexit is sending us right back to square one. “Many in Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP are trying to thwart Brexit at every step.”  Mr Corbyn has had a bruising summer beset by accusations of anti-semitism against both the party and him personally. And the row has not gone away with a survey published today by the Campaign Against Antisemitism, which shows four in 10 British Jews would consider emigrating, up from 31 per cent last year.  Nine in 10 of those considering leaving say they believe Labour harbours anti-Semites – more than twice as many who said the same of UKIP. Mr Corbyn said of the allegations made against him personally: “I found it very hurtful. I’ve spent my le campaigning against racism. “I campaigned against apartheid. So any allegation like that is personally hurtful.  “But I do recognise that the rise in anti-Semitism across Europe is awful, frightening and dangerous. We have to be resolute that we will not tolerate anti-Semitism or any other form of racism – and I won’t.” Before meeting Mr Corbyn I asked Abdul Abouker, 30, one of his bodyguards in Liverpool, what I should ask the Labour leader. He replied: “How does he deal with all the stress?” So I do... and Mr Corbyn tells me he runs, exercises, reads and tends his allotment. What to do  Chequers is chucked? Theresa May’s so-called Chequers plan got short shrt in Salzburg – but what are the alternatives which EU leaders insist we choose from?  There’s the Norway model which means membership of the European Economic Area and access to the EU’s single market. The downside is we would still contribute billions into the EU and have to accept freedom of movement. Our borders would not be our own. There’s the Swiss model which means membership of the European Free Trade Association but not of the EEA. It pays a smaller amount into Brussels than Norway but must accept free movement. And it does not have single market access for banking and services, which make up 80 per cent of the UK ecomony.

Local members will find it much easier to force a full open selection process against their MPs  the changes are passed by 1,600 delegates at the party conference on Sunday. But the NEC stopped well short of backing a full system of mandatory reselection for every MP - which was demanded by many backers of Jeremy Corbyn . The compromise is part of a package of reforms agreed tonight after y debate by Labour\u0027s 41-member ruling NEC. The body also backed having a second deputy leader of the Labour Party , elected and on equal terms with Tom Watson, who will be guaranteed to be female. And it backed making it tougher - not easier - for an MP to get on the Labour leadership ballot, in a move that will infuriate the pro-Corbyn group Momentum.  Currently sitting Labour MPs face a trigger ballot where each local branch, union branch and affiliated society branch in their constituency gets a single block vote per branch on whether to keep them before a general election. Only  they lose more than 50% of the total branch votes do they face a full-scale selection, pitted against rival candidates. Now the threshold will be reduced to 33%. And a reselection can be triggered by either a third of union affiliate branches, or a third of party branches. Corbyn-backing group Momentum wanted to go further, and change to a full system of open selections - where every sitting MP faces a full reselection before each general election, even  they\u0027ve served for decades. More than 20,000 people signed a Momentum petition calling for such a system. Meanwhile a Momentum-backed bid to make it easier for MPs to stand for leader did not succeed.  Currently any MP must get the backing of 10% of their fellow MPs before they can stand for leader. Corbyn backers wanted a package of measures that would lower this to 5% but also involve unions and local parties. Instead the threshold will stay at 10% of MPs - AND add 5% of local parties or 5% of union affiliate members. The latter must be across three trade unions or affiliates, at least two of which must be trade unions. It comes after a string of other measures were agreed at at NEC meeting on Tuesday. A Labour Party spokesperson said: Following the Democracy Review, the NEC has agreed rule changes to put to a vote at Party Conference to remove barriers to political participation and help transform our Party into a mass movement for the many, not the few. “The Democracy Review is one of the biggest democratic exercises undertaken by any political party, with over 11,000 submissions and hundreds of consultation meetings held across the country.”  It comes almost a year after Labour launched a \u0027democracy review\u0027 led by a close Corbyn aide with the aim of rebalancing power in the party away from the executive, and towards the members. Many proposals in the review - which does not cover all of tonight\u0027s developments - could not be agreed amid bitter in fighting. The Mirror understands Momentum founder Jon Lansman, who sits on the NEC, pushed for a full system of mandatory reselection - in a debate which is separate to the democracy review. A Momentum source said: The result of tonight’s NEC shows the power of grassroots campaigning. Thousands of members lobbied their NEC representatives, Momentum petitions gathered 50,000 signatures and while the members haven’t got everything they wanted, these proposals are a signicant improvement on what was being discussed earlier in the week. The changes in selections rules will give members far more say in who represents them and result in more open selections. And while the slight increase in the  threshold is deeply disappointing, we managed to avert disaster and avoid a dramatic increase to the leadership threshold which would have stopped a socialist candidate getting on the ballot in a future leadership contest.

Some 13,000 people are set to descend on Liverpool from Saturday to Wednesday for what organisers claim will be their biggest annual bash in recent memory. That includes more than 5,000 members and 1,650 voting delegates from their local parties. It\u0027s those delegates who will make the news. They could pass sweeping changes to Labour\u0027s rulebook and force a change of policy on major issues like Brexit. Also making the news, of course, will be Jeremy Corbyn. Since 2015 conference has been transformed into a gathering of his most loyal supporters.  They haven\u0027t managed to eliminate his critics quite yet, of course. But deputy leader Tom Watson will be missing from the main stage after a row about his speaking slot, and some \u0027centrist\u0027 MPs will reportedly be staying away. So what\u0027s going on at conference and what should you look out for? Find out with our handy guide: What is the Labour conference for? Among many, it has four big purposes.  First, it\u0027s for the big names in the party to set out their stall on the issues of the day. Expect new announcements and policies from the likes of Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell and other frontbenchers. Second, it\u0027s for members to debate and vote on changes to Labour\u0027s policy. Much more than Tory conference - which is basically a hit parade of ministerial speeches - Labour conference has a heavy emphasis on democracy within the party. Corbyn-backers have been trying to increase this bit and reduce the number of MP speeches.  Third, it\u0027s attended by pressure groups, charities and private firms who want to mingle and leave their mark on the people who might form the government. And lastly, it\u0027s a massive social event. It\u0027s where members and political geeks get together to let their hair down and let off steam - which is probably why it creates so much news. What will be the main issues at conference? It\u0027s looking like there will be two big flashpoints this year - party rules and Brexit. There will be a string of votes on both Sunday and Tuesday about shaking up the party to give left-wingers a tighter grip on power.  These rule changes are massively complicated so we\u0027ve written a separate piece explaining them here. On Brexit, delegates - including, importantly, backers of the Corbyn-supporting group Momentum - are pushing for the party to back a second EU referendum. After more than 100 pleas to debate Brexit from local parties, this so-called People\u0027s Vote will almost certainly face a vote during the conference - after being blocked a year ago.  But what that vote will actually achieve will only be announced on Sunday once conference is under way. That\u0027s because an obscure body called the Conference Arrangements Committee has to boil down all those local party motions into something people can vote on. It may be that, in the sausage factory, a binding vote committing Labour to a second referendum turns into a mere vague expression of support. What\u0027s on the main stage? SATURDAY: National Women\u0027s Conference SUNDAY: Conference Arrangements Committee will announce what issues will be debated throughout the conference. 11am - General Secretary of the Labour Party Jennie Formby speech 11.20am - Chairman of the Labour Party Ian Lavery speech  12.45pm Policy seminar on Brexit - open to all members 5.25pm Votes on party democracy and campaigning MONDAY: 10.05am - Shadow Housing Secretary John Healey speech 12.15pm Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell Speech 5pm Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner speech  TUESDAY: 9.30 NEC and CLP constitutional amendments – votes at 12.40 WEDNESDAY: 9.30am Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth speech 12.15 Jeremy Corbyn speech  What\u0027s the pick of the fringe? Aside from the main stage where the big speeches happen and delegates vote on motions there are hundreds of meetings taking place throughout conference. All of the dferent interest groups are represented like Labour Friends of the Countryside, the Fabians, the Unions, Progress and many many groups you probably didn\u0027t know existed. SATURDAY 5.45pm Corbyn rally. Pier Head, Liverpool, L3 1BY Kick off conference in style by hearing from the man himself.

What is The World Transformed? The World Transformed is an alternative conference taking place a short walk away from the main hall. It has an absolutely rammed programme with everything from decolonising yoga to collaborative drawing it shows that sitting in a hall listening to a speech is not the only way to do politics. And what\u0027s more there\u0027s something for all from Teenager question time and workshops on how to change the world for kids to screen printing political posters.  The event, which was started by the campaign group Momentum as an alternative to a conference they saw as controlled by the old guard, it now has something and someone appearing from every wing of the party. While there are plenty of so-called far left activists anyone who\u0027s anyone in the Labour family will be making an appearance from councillors to campaigners and even Ed Miliband. Look out for shadow chancellor John McDonnell who seems to be listed for at least five events. SATURDAY 11am – Opening Session: Making the Case for Political Education, Black-E Main Space, with John McDonnell We hope John McDonnell\u0027s had his weetabix before conference as he\u0027ll be appearing at around 10 events not forgetting his turn on the main stage. He helps TWT kick off their programme by discussing the importance of educating people about politics so they can get involved in campaigning for the things they care about.  1pm - Building Community Wealth in our Towns and Cities, Hinterlands Theatre, Democracy Collaborative The town of Preston has been held up as a beacon of hope for Labour-run councils battling just to do the minimum after years of cruel cuts, never mind bringing services back in house and investing in the things their constituents need.

The leader of Preston City Council will be explaining how the Preston model for deindustrialisation works and its lessons for the rest of the UK. 3pm Ash Sarkar \u0026amp Richard Burgon on ‘Britain\u0027s New Far Right’, Hinterlands Main Space, TWT  You might recognise Ash as the woman who told Piers Morgan I\u0027m a Communist you idiot on GMB. She\u0027s also a journalist with Noa Media and will appear alongside Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon. SUNDAY 11am - Black Women Transforming Politics with Diane Abbott MP, Constellations Event Space  Given the continued hostility faced by black women MPs online and in the press, this panel of black women inside and outside of Labour will explore the historic role of race and gender in the labour movement and wider issues of representation. 5.30pm Jeremy Corbyn star turn, Hinterlands Main Space  The Labour leader will be joined by leading activists to discuss the way in which people are rising up and demanding change. Building on the results of the 2017 General Election Jeremy Corbyn will tell the conference how he believes people can work together to change the world.

But, as he says himself, there are a number of reasons behind its growth. Police numbers in London have dipped below 30,000 for the first time since 2003. Falling morale and terrible pay and \u0026shyconditions, are forcing officers to quit. And the Government still insists on cutting. The Met has been forced to cut \u0026pound1bn from its budget since the 2010. And that, of course, has an effect. Mr Khan has tried to pump money in from City Hall to cover the shortfall. But the \u0026pound140m he’s invested is barely a sticking plaster. This week though, Mr Khan \u0026shyannounced a radical plan to tackle the problem. London will adopt a scheme that transformed the culture of violence that had taken hold in Glasgow. A report in 2005 showed Scots were three times more likely to be murdered than people in England. And Glasgow was the centre of it – the murder capital of Europe. Murders were recorded almost every weekend, victims of kne and gun crime swamped hospitals. So authorities \u0026shydecided to set up a scheme that \u0026shyinvolved prevention of violent crimes instead of solving them. Violence was treated as a public health issue – like a disease. And it worked. The trends reversed. The murder rate has almost halved. Kne crime fell drastically. And – in a wider turnaround – 2015 saw Scotland’s lowest crime rate for 40 years.

Facing an unpaid rent bill the 27-year old, from Windsor, Berkshire, was prepared to try a new career. She had discovered a friend was working as a \u0027cam girl\u0027 and, encouraged by her sister, decided to give it go and hasn\u0027t looked back. She has now been a cam girl for several months and earns hundreds of pounds each day for a few hours\u0027 work talking online to men about their sexual fantasies and sometimes taking her clothes off or using sex toys.  She said: “I used to have low self-confidence and body insecurities but since taking up camming my self-esteem has rocketed. “What I used to see as imperfections are loved by my viewers. I believe that women should be entitled to do exactly as they please with their bodies without having to fear criticism. “My job is a bit like being a therapist and while sexual fantasies are a big part of camming I can spend hours simply discussing their day.”  Lola took time out to answer some of the Mirror\u0027s questions about her le as a camgirl.  What does a cam girl do? A cam girl will be online and visible to others through a webcam that also has a chat room to communicate via typing or audio. You will be able to chat in a group session with the cam girl, or you can go to a private room where it will be one-to-one. You will be charged per minute to chat - talking in private costs more. I charge \u0026pound2 a minute to chat to me in a group where men or women can see me fully-dressed  and I charge \u0026pound3 a minute to talk to me on a one-to-one basis. The cam girl is there for you to talk to... whether it be about your day at work, your plans at the weekend... or you could talk about your deepest fantasies and then it goes from there. A cam girl will also have a profile which will tell you all about them, you can gauge what experience you will have from this profile.  Is it just talk or is there a physical element? Do you stay fully clothed? In private I do take my clothes off, or I may be dressed in a requested outfit... PVC is the most popular and usually requested by someone who likes domination or humiliation. It\u0027s something I had to get used to as I\u0027m a super nice person. Being mean to someone because they enjoy it is a hard one to crack. I own several outfits and several toys that I use during private shows. A guy tends to spend an hour on average in private chat and we talk about all the things they would like to do. Public sex is the most common, getting up to no good in bars etc. I usually listen to them and then, to put it crudely, act out what they are telling me to do to myself. Are there any extreme behaviours you have witnessed? I have chatted to men who think it\u0027s okay to be extremely demanding, rude and, perhaps some would say, aggressive in the chat. I politely tell them that I will not tolerate it and I kick them out so they cannot  to the cam. They will often email through the website begging to be allowed back into the chat. I think they believe we NEED their business... there are plenty of respectable guys and girls looking to cam. Us cam girls can be very choosy and you have to be strong in this job, you do not have to do anything you feel uncomfortable with. You are your own boss. What is your average day? My average day will consist of me logging on for 9-10am. I will update my profile, keeping it relevant, and I will make sure it\u0027s visible on the front page of the website. I am a performer, it\u0027s my job to provide a sensual virtual experience to who I\u0027m talking to. I want the person to connect with me and feel as  they are in the room. I will spend the day logged on answering calls from ious people with ious desires. I usually clock off when I\u0027ve hit my goal  around 4pm when I resume my usual day. I like to keep my alter ego separate from real le. She\u0027s feisty, sexy and seductive whereas I\u0027m bubbly, laid back and enjoy slobbing on the sofa watching box sets.  How did you get into being a cam girl? I was first introduced to webcam when me and a friend stumbled across an older friend\u0027s social media which showed she was openly caming. I never dreamt that I would have the guts to start it myself. However after a work-related breakdown and being diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression, which meant leaving my job, I thought: \u0027what\u0027s a girl to lose\u0027. I hadn\u0027t worked in seven months and my rent was due. I came across On The Record models on Instagram and within 24 hours my profile was live. What did you do before? I have worked in healthcare for 10 years and my last role was a Recruitment Co-Ordinator How much do you earn? On my first day I made \u0026pound1,700 and on a good day I can make \u0026pound700 in around 4 hours... I aim to make around \u0026pound150k in a year. Do you only work late at night? No, actually I have recently slipped into working 9-5. Perhaps it\u0027s embedded in me from my years of working in an office! If I make plans in the day, I will come home and work at night. However, early mornings are usually very busy. Most of the guys I speak to work from home, or are uni students or are on dferent time zones.. I\u0027ve been invited all over the world. I have a few regulars who cam with me from their office while they are \u0027working\u0027.  What do friends and family think of your job? My friends find what I do refreshing. They will ask me about my day at work with genuine interest. My family completely support me, it was in fact my sister who encouraged me to start camming as she thought I\u0027d be great at it. How does it affect your relationships? I am single at the moment. However, the last guy I was seeing did know about camming. He said that he was fine with it but we broke up shortly after I told him. I do believe he had an issue with it. We had a fun relationship before he knew. I would send him racy pictures and he would love it. After he found out, he would brush them off as  to say... it\u0027s not all for me. What has the money allowed you to do? The earning power is unlimited. I spent Christmas at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York and am able to holiday when I like. I\u0027m going to Amsterdam next month and for some winter sun. I have now paid my rent up front for the next year as well as saving for a mortgage for my own place. I do enjoy trips to London to stock up on designer clothes too.  How do you keep yourself in shape and looking good? I\u0027m successful on cam thanks to my curves. I used to feel conscious that I wasn\u0027t a size 8. I\u0027ve been dieting all my le... now I make money from being a size 12-14 and men go weak for my curves. It\u0027s allowed me to accept myself but I eat well and I walk everywhere. What kinds of fans do you have and what kind of things do you get asked? I talk to so many dferent kinds of people. I speak to a famous Rugby player regularly, business men, extremely attractive young men and older women who are into domination. The most common thing I have been asked is  I will go on a date with the person I am talking to. I keep it strictly work. I\u0027ve had two men tell me they love me – interestingly both were married.  Do you have any “red lines” when it comes to private chat? Have you had to end calls or break off? There are standard red tape rules - no talk of under age sex, rape or animals. I have one guy say he enjoyed role play and asked me to be \u0027younger\u0027 but didn\u0027t state how young. I didn\u0027t get a good vibe from his so I cut the chat. Looking at it now I should have asked more. If he is in his 50s then being younger could be 20 plus. I\u0027ve had a chat in role play who was very aggressive to women and wanted to talk about the violent acts he would do to me. Again, I stopped the chat. Are you ever recognised? Do you have to be careful about personal details you give out? I\u0027ve been recognised once! A guy who worked behind a bar in a restaurant in Surrey was trying to work out where he knew me from. He went bright red and we both realised but did say anything else about it. What has it taught you about men? I believe that the men I speak to come to me because they either long for intimacy or they desire a more personal sexual experience than from, say, porn. I do speak to a lot of married men and I respect that they are not cheating on their wives. I do also speak to a lot of married men who are persistent in trying to meet me, a regular of mine has actually mentioned “love” and leaving his we, we speak around five hours and he\u0027s developed feelings. This does put me off being in a relationship. I think we all have desires that we need to meet, I\u0027m all for it as long as no one is hurt in the process.  Has it led to other opportunities? I\u0027ve been invited to very exclusive places through camming and I have been asked to model away from cam. There was a chap on cam who was 78 years old, he emailed me to ask  he could pay me \u0026pound3,000 a week  I would join him for dinner twice a week at his stately home. I did decline, I keep it strictly cam. Are you friends with other cam girls/boys?  I am indeed.  Off the Record  has an amazing group of women and men. We all chat in our WhatsApp group.  One of the girls and I are planning a cheeky week in the sun this October.

Credit Union worker Peter Hartley was sacked three months ago after 86-year-old John Carter’s grieving partner Yvonne Cass, 80, found the money was missing. Hartley, 60, had befriended the pair after helping stroke victim John join the local community bank. But statements the stunned family handed to the Credit Union following John’s death in March showed his savings were regularly being moved into another account. The union’s bosses investigated the case, ed the money through insurance and passed its evidence to police. But three months on, nothing has happened.  Yvonne’s grandson Michael Burton stormed: “They don’t seem to care. It’s a disgrace.” Emails between Michael and a Credit Union director Lucy Freeman, shown to the Sunday Mirror, reveal the bank is also baffled by “unacceptable” lack of police action. Alarm bells rang for plumber Michael, 34, after Hartley suggested retired engineer John open an account in Walthamstow, East London, in 2014. The volunteer cashier then started helping the couple with chores at home and even went on holiday with them. A snap shows topless Hartley with an Always Look On The Bright Side Of Le T-shirt on a sofa with them. “My mum and I thought it was weird,” said Michael. “We warned them, but nan would say, ‘He’s a lovely bloke’.

And one of these was Princess Diana\u0027s. Dr Shepherd, now 65, re-examined the princess\u0027s body for the official inquiry into her death in a Paris car crash two decades ago. Diana, 36, and her lover Dodi Fayed, 42, were killed when their Mercedes crashed in an underpass in the French capital in August 1997. And after conducting a second autopsy on the late princess\u0027s body, Dr Shepherd was asked some bizarre questions about her appearance.  Other people questioned whether she had been pregnant. People asked: \u0027Was she beautul?\u0027 \u0027Was she peaceful?\u0027 \u0027Was she pregnant?\u0027, the dad, whose new memoir has just been published, told the Daily Mail. I always made sure I never said anything — in all the cases of public interest I was involved with — that hadn\u0027t already appeared in the Press. He continued: Pathologically there was no evidence that Princess Diana was pregnant, but some women say they know they\u0027re pregnant from the moment of conception. Was she one of those?  The pathologist also claimed that Diana would have been here for Prince Harry\u0027s wedding to Meghan Markle in May  she had worn her seatbelt. If she had taken this step, he believes she would have survived the tragedy in the Pont de l\u0027Alma road tunnel with a black eye or maybe a broken arm. Driver Henri Paul, said to have been twice the British drink-drive limit, also died in the horric smash. The only survivor was bodyguard Trevor Rees. A string of official enquiries later ruled Diana and Dodi died in an accident when their French driver crashed their car while drunk in the tunnel. The jury at the princess\u0027s inquest found the pair had been unlawfully killed and their deaths were the result of “gross negligence” on the part of Henri and paparazzi who were following the vehicle on motorbikes.

The labrador’s reactions as she detects cocaine are unmistakable and her efforts have helped put Border Force teams on course for a record haul. In 2016-17 they nabbed more than 4,500 kilos of the Class A drug with a street value of \u0026pound450million. That was up 28 per cent on 2015-16. But a string of major busts has already seen 4,000 kilos seized since April. The figures emerged as the Sunday Mirror went behind the scenes at Gatwick Airport, where cute and sweet-natured Honey strikes terror into the hearts of drug smugglers.  A whf of a Class A substance and she is on it in a flash. She also mingles with passengers at luggage carousels to unsettle what Border Force Assistant Director Chris Capel calls the “wrong ’uns”. Officers monitor the reaction of passengers and pounce on those who look suspicious when they try to clear customs. It could be tell-tale perspiration on an upper lip or something as innocent as scuffed shoes which look out of place with an immaculate suit.  Chris says: “Roving officers are looking for behaviour indicators to see who needs further examination. If Honey makes someone nervous or uncomfortable, we take a proper look.” Biggest seizure of the year so far was two tonnes of cocaine found when a yacht was intercepted off the Cornish coast in July by Border Force cutter HMC Vigilant. Two men stand trial next year.  That month Border Force officers at Gatwick also found 15 kilos of cocaine worth \u0026pound1.5million hidden in two cases – and 1.5 kilos on another passenger. A further 8.5 kilos came in on a flight from Barbados this month – hidden in boxes marked “Rum”. Honey’s job is to snf out cocaine, crack, heroin and tobacco. Even four cartons of smuggled cigs will lose the Treasury \u0026pound200 in revenue.  Handler Liz Martinez, 33, says: “When Honey gets it right she gets a treat. When she gets it wrong she gets told off.” Smugglers who swallow cocaine – “stuffers” as Border Force call them – can be detected by X-ray but offer a dferent challenge. They can hide \u0026pound100,000-worth of drugs in 60 plastic pellets which won’t burst. And it takes a time-consuming three bowel movements before the “cargo” is offloaded. The really big finds come in ingenious hiding places in cargo shipments. Border Force was created in 2012 by then Home Secretary Theresa May to combine the roles of customs, immigration and passport control.  But it is not just drugs that come under the Border Force’s gaze in the cargo examination area – where tax avoiders and dodgy dealers are rumbled. Senior officer Rob Chapman, 39, slices open one of 12 boxes from the Far East and listed as “multi-media players and screen parts” worth \u0026pound3,500. But he finds six \u0026pound500 iPhones in each box – so \u0026pound36,000-worth in all. They will be auctioned and the proceeds go to Chancellor Philip Hammond. A pile of boxes of “photography accessories” actually holds \u0026pound800 Canon cameras. A haul of 5,200 fake football shirts might have earned counterfeiters \u0026pound50 a go.

Lumox Lewis\u0027, le was completely shattered when his dad died three years ago, which led to him attempting to take his own le .  On April 14 this year he cuddled his two children, Brandan and Alfie, goodbye, told his we Sammy he was going for a walk, and then jumped off the clfs near his home in Perranporth in Cornwall.  Lumox, 34, who works as a panel beater and sprayer told Cornwall Live : I remember it as clear as day.  I was sat on the sofa and I just felt worthless. I put on a happy front but I felt so lonely inside. Empty. From the outside I had everything - a beautul we, two beautul children, cars, a job. But inside I had nothing. It didn\u0027t matter how hard I worked, I felt like there was nothing worth staying around for. I said to my we, \u0027I\u0027m going for a walk darling\u0027 and that was it - I jumped off a clf.  But he survived. The keen surfer and ex-rugby player woke up in hospital with only bruises. Incredibly his instincts kicked in when he hit the water. In a complete blur, he managed to swim to safety, staying clear of the rocks and out of trouble. But this wasn\u0027t it for him. He was going to try again. After being sectioned for three days in hospital, Lumox was discharged and the first thing he did was attempt to finish what he hadn\u0027t achieved the first time round. It wouldn\u0027t happpen though. When he got off the bus from the hospital, a friend, who Lumox knew, but not very well, happened to be passing. And it was that chance conversation that changed everything. Recalling how these events unfolded, Lumox said: I remember sitting in my hospital bed and thinking, \u0027I can\u0027t even get that right, I can\u0027t even kill mysellf\u0027. I planned to do it all again, but then I bumped into Dale [Smith], who had no clue what was going on, or what I was planning to do. He asked  I was alright, and said he was going to the gym. He said it was time I got back to the gym too. We just stood there talking. Now I can\u0027t thank him enough. After that chance conversation, Lumox signed up to the Kernow\u0027s Strongest Man competition. He began a vigorous training regime and completely changed his diet.  He had a focus. He began opening up about his mental health. Now his le has direction. A meaning. If I didn\u0027t train my mind would wander elsewhere, he said. I still get days where I wake up and wonder why I am here. But I turn those negative thoughts into positivity, and it\u0027s a lot easier to do that now. Lumox has gone from being 17-and-a-half stone to weighing 22 st 5 lbs. He\u0027s gone from eating 2,500 calories a day to eating 5,5000. He also trains up to, and sometimes more than, six hours a day in the gym. He has completed three strongest man competitions and got second place in a national competition. Now he wants to go pro. I want to be the strongest man in the UK, he said. He added: From that day to now, my le has made a total U-turn. I\u0027m not completely out of the woods, but I have my trophies to look at and a sign above my door with a quote from Winston Churchill saying, \u0027If you\u0027re going through hell, keep going\u0027. I look at that door, and I keep going. But the biggest factor for me was opening up and talking about it. It\u0027s OK not to be OK.

While some of us often think about what the wonderful things we would do  we won the lottery , for actual winners it can send le off the rails in spectacular fashion.  There are a number of National Lottery winners who have scooped millions of pounds in the jackpot - but have ended up spending the lot with little or nothing to show for it. Here\u0027s how it all went wrong for these unlucky lotto winners...   John McGuinness - \u0026pound10 million       The  Scottish hospital porter won \u0026pound10million on the National Lottery in 1997.  Back then, he earned only \u0026pound150 a week and still stayed at his mum and dad\u0027s house. However, he was quick to splurge after sharing \u0026pound3 million among his family and \u0026pound750,000 to his ex-we Cars, holidays and a \u0026pound200,000 wedding to his second we were also included in his spending spree. But it was his \u0026pound4 million investment in Livingston Football Club that saw his downfall after the club later went into administration, as McGuinness had used his wealth to guarantee the club’s loans and was liable for its debts. He claims that he was misled about his football club investment and following a lost legal battle he was forced to sell property to cover his costs. By 2009, McGuinness was a virtual recluse with hardly enough cash to afford food.  Pete Kyle - \u0026pound5.1 million    When Pete Kyle won a \u0026pound5.1million jackpot on the National Lottery , he said it was like a dream.  Stunned, the retired Royal Artillery gunner vowed the money was going to change his family\u0027s le. And for a while, it did. He took his relatives on lavish holidays, bought cars and boats and swapped his home for a luxury five-bedroom mansion boasting a steam room, a bar and a pool. But just three years later, Pete was reportedly broke and on benefits.  He had squandered an eye-watering \u0026pound4,600 a day, the Plymouth Herald reports.  He is said to have poured his money away on the top-of-the-range cars, his expensive house with extensions and building works, the pricey holidays, and cash handouts to his kids.  Lottery winner Edward Putman charged with fraud accused of faking his \u0026pound2.5m ticket   John Roberts - \u0026pound3.1million    National Lottery prizes increased by Camelot with five numbers plus bonus ball now worth \u0026pound1million  In 1998, former security guard John Roberts won \u0026pound3.1million in 1998. However he managed to lose it all in record breaking speed. The debt-ridden lotto winner blames his friends for convincing him to make some poor investments. This included buying a pub however it was later revealed that Roberts\u0027 name was never on the deeds. He now lives in a caravan and is around \u0026pound20,000 in debt.  Callie Rogers - \u0026pound1.8 million    The UK\u0027s youngest lottery winner has called for age limit to be raised after she revealed how she blew her \u0026pound1.8m jackpot on drugs, partying and boob jobs.  Callie Rogers, 31, admitted she struggled with fame and fortune that the win brought her. She was just 16, the minimum age for the game, when she collected her cheque in 2003. She blew \u0026pound18,000 on breast surgery, another \u0026pound300,000 on clothes and gave away \u0026pound500,000 to friends and family. Her one big regret is that the money isn’t here for her son Blake.

Frank Springett, 91, could be split from his beloved we Mary, 86, in a move which would “devastate” the couple, their family say. Their case offers a snapshot into the crisis facing adult care in the UK which faces a \u0026pound2 billion black hole due to Tory cuts. Both Frank and Mary suffer serious health problems, but their family say they are still happily living together in a care home which caters for their every need. The couple even renewed their wedding vows in May — on the day of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding — with a cake, photographer and vicar performing the ceremony. Mary suffers from severe Alzheimer’s, while Frank has artritis, the muscle stfness condition polymyalgia rheumatica and is almost totally deaf. The family is keeping the funding row secret from Frank and they fear the stress of being separated from his we could kill him. The couple sold their \u0026pound156,000 home in Henley in Arden earlier this year to help fund their \u0026pound8,000-a-month care bills.  But now their cash is running low and in a few months time they face the prospect of being separated from each other for the first time in seven decades. Daughter Joanne Downes, 57, said social services told them her parents would be split up and moved to dferent homes. She said: “It would devastate my mother  my father was not with her, and vice versa. “They are a couple who have been together 70 years, married for 67 years and never, ever spent time apart. “I cannot and will not accept that they cannot be together.” Barbara Keeley, Labour’s Shadow Cabinet Minister for Social Care, said: “This is the shocking extent of the Tory Government’s social care crisis: a devoted older couple threatened with separation because of the funding black hole facing councils. “More and more older people face the uncertainty of how to pay for care because of the Tories’ shameful cuts to council budgets and their failure to fix a care crisis they have created. “Labour in Government will finally end the Tory social care crisis: we will start to bring stability to the social care system by immediately investing an additional \u0026pound8 billion and place a letime cap on care costs so no one faces losing everything as they do now. Experts say Britain’s beleaguered care system is underfunded by \u0026pound2 billion with growing numbers of pensioners have been forced to pay soaring care home bills.  A soaring number of care home closures – more than 12 each month last year – has added to the problem. Recent research by the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services found care for vulnerable adults are on the verge of collapse in some areas of England, despite the provision of extra government funding. They said: “The overall picture is of a sector struggling to meet need and maintain quality in the context of rising costs, increasingly complex care needs, a fragile provider market and pressures from an NHS which itself is in critical need of more funding.” The report revealed English councils plan to push through social care cuts of \u0026pound700m in 2018-19, equivalent to nearly 5% of the total \u0026pound14.5bn budget. Since 2010, social care spending in England has shrunk by \u0026pound7bn. The government say they have provided an extra \u0026pound9.4bn over three years to help deal with the pressure. Frank and Mary’s family claim the loving couple face being split because of a row with Solihull Council, in the West Midlands, over the provision of care. Mary suffers from severe Alzheimer’s which has been getting progressively worse. She had been wandering out of their old home and needed to be helped back home by neighbours and on one occasion the postman. She is also incapable of holding a conversation.  Frank also has his health problems and needs a walking frame to get around. His hands are swollen due to arthritis, he needs help with the toilet and is almost totally deaf. They lived independently in their own home until March this year when their family took the decision to move them into a care home due to their failing health. The couple are currently still together in the Cedar Lodge Care Home, close to their family. But they face being split as the council has offered to pay costs towards Mary’s care - but they say retired factory worker Frank is able to look after himself. Their children, Roderick and Joanne, are battling to keep them together. A third child, Gerald, tragically died of a brain tumour in 2005. The family has made three appeals to social services which have all concluded they should be separated. They are now taking their case to the ombudsman. Joanne said because her parents owned their own home they were not eligible for any help paying care home fees. They sold the house for \u0026pound156,000 and the proceeds are currently paying \u0026pound975-per-week for Mary’s care and \u0026pound925-per-week for Frank. Planning ahead the family contacted Solihull social services to ask about their future options when the money runs out. She said: “To date we’ve had no funding from social services at all, which we understand because we have money to pay.  “They’ve said they’ll pay \u0026pound500 per week towards my mom’s care - but that the family will need to pay a top-up fee of \u0026pound475 a week. “But they won’t pay anything for my dad’s fees because they say he can look after himself. They say he can live in a flat in the community with carers coming into him.” She added: “The money is running out. I have constantly been in touch with Solihull council but they never answered my emails or phone calls. The council failed to provide the care promised leaving us no choice. “We have now been through three stressful appeals and they maintain they should be split.” Joanne said both her mum and dad needed the round-the-clock care Cedar Lodge provided. She said: “Initially when Mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2014 Dad was quite mobile and Mom was still ing quite well, so they ticked along as a team.” This was when social services first became involved with the couple as Mary was also suffering from Nodular Porigo - a nasty type of eczema - and needed to undergo sunlight treatment at the hospital. Joanne said: “As time passed mom’s Alzheimer’s was getting worse and she was becoming more and more forgetful. My father was insistent at this time that he could cope. “He is a very proud man and did not want anybody doing anything for him. This was a really hard time for us as a family because they clearly needed help.” She said they started to realise Frank was struggling to cope: “He is not a moaner and that is part of the problem, he will never admit he is in pain. “His deafness made communication really dficult when he was having problems with Mom, because he couldn’t ring me to tell me, as he couldn’t hear me. “We got to a point last year when mom was escaping out of the house and the neighbours were bringing her back. “When my Mom’s condition deteriorated she would be extremely emotional, she would lie on the floor and refuse to get up. “My dad would get very upset about this and he would call me at work and I would have to come over in my lunch hour to try and calm things down. “I knew that this could not carry on.” In October last year they requested a further assessment from Social Service to get some more help. She said: “At this point my dad was still adamant that he could care for my mom, although it was becoming obvious he couldn’t.” Over Christmas Frank finally recognised he was struggling: “By Christmas I was exhausted and so was Dad. Dad’s mobility was extremely bad, he also had bad psoriasis, I think due to stress, and he was becoming prone to water infections.  “My mom was oblivious to the situation, obviously due to the illness. Over Christmas my brother and I spoke with our father and he finally agreed that he was not coping at all. He understood that he could not look after mom or himself at home any more. “This was a big admission by Dad, he had always remained insistent that he was fine and he could cope, so I know it took a lot for him to admit that he couldn’t.” But she claimed they then struggled to get the help they needed from social services. “Social services told us we then had to make a fresh application for Dad as only mom was under their care. “I didn’t realise this, I thought they were both in the system to be looked after. Anyway, they came out and assessed dad and mom again.” The couple were given a care package - but Joanne said they had repeated problems when the carers failed to arrive at their home. “I voiced my concerns about the failure to turn up by the carers which was happening regularly. I was told they would get something sorted. However, it was no better. We had days when no one showed up.” Frustrated by the lack of support the family took the decision to put Frank and Mary in the care home, using their own cash to pay. “After long discussions we all agreed that their house would be sold and we would use the money to self-fund them both in a care home. “We found Cedar Lodge, a lovely home. We decided we would move them in to the home as the situation at home was untenable, mom had got out of the house on a number of occasions and dad had had a fall on the drive trying to get her back in. “We both knew that this could not carry on.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle reveals secret memento","story":"NewsMeghan Markle reveals secret memento from first date with Prince Harry was hidden inside her wedding dressThe Duchess of Sussex shows her \u0027something blue\u0027 along with other dress secrets in new TV documentaryShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByJanine Yaqoob20:37, 22 SEP 2018Updated22:03, 22 SEP 2018NewsMeghan reveals the secrets of her wedding dress\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeghan Markle has revealed how a memento from her first date with Prince Harry was hidden in the veil of her wedding dress.

And it was her idea to do wild flowers, which I think ended up being a really beautul way to embody the feeling of it.”  Meghan said she kept the touching tribute to his family a secret from Harry until the big day in May. “It was important for me, especially now being a part of the Royal Family, to have all 53 of the Commonwealth countries incorporated,” she says. “I knew that it would be a fun surprise as well for my now husband, who didn’t know, and he was really over the moon to find out that I would make this choice for our day. “And I think the other members of the family had a similar reaction.” "},{"url":null,"title":"sky winning bid comcast fox","story":"NewsSky auction: Comcast beats Rupert Murdoch\u0027s Fox with £30 billion bidIt effectively means Murdoch has failed for a second time to gain full control of the pay-TV giantShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByRavender Sembhy21:27, 22 SEP 2018Updated21:31, 22 SEP 2018NewsRupert Murdoch was bidding to control Sky \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailComcast has won the long-running battle for control of Sky after beating Fox with a \u0026pound30 billion bid for the broadcaster. In a dramatic end to one of the City\u0027s most complex and convoluted takeover sagas in recent memory, Comcast won out in a day-long auction overseen by Britain\u0027s Takeover Panel today. Comcast\u0027s bid was \u0026pound17.28 per share, beating 21st Century Fox\u0027s \u0026pound15.67 per share, after the auction went to the maximum three rounds. Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive of Comcast, said: This is a great day for Comcast. Sky is a wonderful company with a great platform, tremendous brand and accomplished management team. This acquisition will allow us to quickly, efficiently and meaningfully increase our customer base and expand internationally. We couldn\u0027t be more excited by the opportunities in front of us. We now encourage Sky shareholders to accept our offer, which we look forward to completing before the end of October 2018.  Sky\u0027s independent directors have recommend Comcast\u0027s bid to shareholders, urging them to accept the offer immediately. It effectively means Rupert Murdoch has failed for a second time to gain full control of the pay-TV giant. US firm Comcast had originally tabled a \u0026pound26 billion, \u0026pound14.75 a share bid for Sky, while Fox\u0027s offer for the 61% of the UK broadcaster it does not already own valued it at \u0026pound24.5 billion at \u0026pound14 a share. But Comcast\u0027s final winning bid on Saturday - which gives Sky an enterprise value of over \u0026pound30 billion - dwarfed Fox\u0027s. Fox and Comcast were only allowed to make fixed-price cash bids in sterling. Comcast owns NBC Universal and is the largest cable operator in the US. With the Sky takeover, Comcast will become the biggest pay TV provider in the world, with around 52 million customers after adding Sky\u0027s 23 million subscribers. Winning Sky will also aid Comcast in its fight against the rise of Netflix and Amazon. Ben Barringer, equity analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said: We can see why Comcast is attracted to Sky. The predominantly US business is in decline - Sky offers it the opportunity to ersy outside of America. The acquisition means that it can expand its customer base in the UK, Italy and Germany. Furthermore, Comcast\u0027s current viewership is in decline. Consumers are no longer buying whole cable packages but are rather going for \u0027skinny bundles\u0027 with SVODs  such as Netflix, which offer content at a lower price point acquiring Sky means that Comcast can also ersy its route to market.

A yellow warning for wind and rain covers the far south-east of England on Sunday, bringing with it the potential for flooding and transport disruption. It says there is a danger to le as a result of flying debris. The wind and rain are likely to cause chaos on roads and rail networks, and homes and businesses will be at risk of flooding. The warning is in place between 6am and midnight on Sunday, during which time up to 50mm of rain could fall in some areas.  A Met Office statement said: During Sunday there is the potential for a developing weather system to track across southern UK, which is likely to bring a swathe of persistent and at times heavy rain, as well the potential for strong winds. Whilst there remains some uncertainty in the precise track and intensity of the system, and thus the location of the heaviest, most persistent rainfall, many places could see 20-30mm, with up to 50mm possible in some isolated spots. With strong winds also forecast in places, and recent heavy rain, drains and culverts blocked by debris could mean impacts in places which would not normally be affected by these rainfall amounts. And it added: There is a small chance of injuries and danger to le from flying debris.  Heavy rain - up to 30mm - is forecast for parts of southern and south-east England, followed by strong winds of up to 45mph inland and as high as 60mph along the coast. But the fallout from storms Ali and Bronagh, which saw widespread disruption, including fallen trees and flooded, blocked roads, is unlikely to be repeated, the Met Office said. Meteorologist Helen Roberts said it is very unlikely at this stage that Sunday will bring the third named storm of the season. She said: It will be a wet and windy day across all southern parts, so southern counties of England and possibly South Wales as well, but nothing like what we\u0027ve seen with the storms earlier in the week, so just a fairly typical autumnal cloudy, wet day.  Northern Ireland, Scotland and northern England can expect a fairly chilly day with bright, sunny spells and showers, she added. Temperatures will remain in the low teens, with a high of 15C expected in the south east of England. Conditions are expected to settle for a time next week, with the possibility of 20C in the south of England by Friday.

The man, who says his name is Anwar Miah, is said to have been apprehended by Kurdish forces a month ago near Hajin in Deir ez-Zur, a province on the Iraq border.  Footage showing him being questioned by his captors has now emerged on social media. In the clip a blindfolded balding man with a British accent says his name is Anwar Miah, from Birmingham, and explains that he has been in the country for just under four years.  Asked  he is a member of IS, he replies: I\u0027m a doctor. I\u0027m a qualied pharmacist from the UK. I studied medicine and pharmacy. When asked to explain why he is in the area he replies: I came here to work with the general people and to help people work in their general hospitals. I\u0027ve been working in the hospitals since I came.  Asked again  he was with IS, or Daesh , he says: The areas that I worked in were controlled by Daesh, but I work with the general people I work in the general hospitals.  I mean I don\u0027t... I mean they were controlled by Daesh, I mean I can\u0027t do anything about that. All my work was with the public. His detention comes after two Britons suspected of being members of an IS execution group dubbed The Beatles were captured in Syria in February. Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh fell into the hands of Kurdish militia fighters in January.

Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah was in command when the Malaysian Airlines flight carrying 238 other passengers and crew vanished mid-flight in 2014. Hundreds of theories have been put forward for the Boeing 777\u0027s sudden disappearance, but new evidence could point the finger of blame towards Shah, after the discovery of his social media activity suggested a man with \u0027self-destructive\u0027 tendencies.  In the year leading up the MH370 mystery, Shah used Facebook to pursue Malaysian twin-sister models 34 years younger than him, leaving sexually suggestive comments on numerous occasions.   The 26-year-old sisters, Lan Qi Hui and Qi Min Lan, received more than 97 messages from Shah during 2013 - most of which were ignored. Shah persistently urged the twins to visit Kuala Lumpar - where he lived with his we - and responded to one photo of Qi Min Lan in a bathrobe, asking \u0027Just shower?\u0027 On top of his obsessive messages to the girls, Zaharie frequently publicly criticised the Malaysian government, despite working for a state-owned airline.   MH370\u0027s final message revealed as frantic air traffic controllers desperately tried to make contact with the plane  In April 2013, leading up to the election of then-prime minister Najib Razak, Shah posted 119 times about Razak, before responding to his appointment with: \u0027There is a rebel in each and every one of us. Let it out!\u0027 He later went on to describe Razak as a \u0027moron\u0027. Aviation expert and editor-in-chief of airlineratings, Geoffrey Thomas, said it was alarming for a senior pilot to make political comments at all.  Thomas said: It should have raised serious alarm bells with the airline that you have someone flying who has such strong anti-government views. If a Qantas pilot did something like that, he would be spoken to and grounded. UK-based psychologist, Paul Dickens said: I think what you’re seeing is a degree of obsessional behaviour mixed with recklessness, which is unusual for a pilot.

We have been forced to change the defence with Murdoch out with a knee injury.“In the first 20 minutes, with Rachid Bouhenna starting, maybe not everyone was comfortable.“Afterwards we grew into the game and I don’t think that we made any mistakes.”Excuses, perhaps, but valid ones? Probably. Further to his points, when King, Paul McMullan and Fyvie, in particular, came on United kicked into gear.Ahead of Saturday’s trip to Falkirk, for the first time in a few weeks, Csaba will have options to consider from a squad he has, for all his critics, united behind one cause.Stanton is expected back in training while the trio aforementioned will have played themselves into the gaffer’s thoughts.Arabs heading through on Saturday will be looking for three points after draws against Alloa and Morton in their last two league matches.And rightly so, to push themselves back into promotion contention they will have to pick up three points with more regularity.However, Csaba has defended their record so far which sees them lie in fth position – just three points behind leaders Inverness Caley Thistle, saying: “We have had four games in a row without losing – two wins and two draws – so psychologically the team are showing spirit which is good.“They  have stuck with us for three years, this is the third year in the Scottish Championship and I think, not just the fans, but everybody is hoping we can go up.“This is a normal reaction, I understand them but they also must understand that we are also human and are trying to do the best for the club.“The fans have to appreciate the work that has been put in, the season is just beginning and it is only five games.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee boss neil mccann has three games to save his job","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPatience is wearing thin with the Dundee hierarchy and manager Neil McCann has just three matches to save his job.The Tele understands the Dark Blues boss has until the next international break to turn his side’s fortunes around.However, a heavy loss to Hibs today followed by defeat to Hamilton next week could accelerate that process.The Tele also believes there is appetite for change at Dens and owner Tim Keyes and managing director John Nelms have been urged to sound out potential successors to McCann.However, the key decision-makers at the club are prepared to give the current gaffer more time to get the results that could kickstart the Dark Blues’ season.That patience will only last so long, though.Next week’s trip to Hamilton is followed by a home game against Steve Clarke’s Kilmarnock before the Premiership takes another break with international football taking over.By then, results are a must  Neil is continue in his role as manager.Meanwhile, the Dens gaffer will be hoping for a midfield boost today against Hibs.Glen Kamara has missed almost the entire season, starting just the opening Betfred Cup group stage win over Stirling Albion and the 1-0 defeat at St Johnstone three weeks ago.The Finnish international injured his ankle after that victory in Stirling and has struggled on with it since.He suffered a recurrence a fortnight ago as he prepared to travel to join up with his national side and then missed last week’s trip to Ibrox.He has, though, ed to training this week and is hoping to be fit enough to play a part against the Hibees at Dens today.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5ba4c39847e8e.jpg ","title":"dundee council urged to speed up land sales after just 62 affordable homes built in a year","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCouncil bosses have been urged to speed up the sale of land for new homes to be built on across Dundee – after falling behind on their housebuilding targets.Just 62 affordable homes – offering low rent to people on modest incomes – were built in 2017-18, short of the 200 the council had planned.

The problem we’ve got is the council is unable to progress with the sale of sites in Whitfield for us to develop.“We could be building 120 more houses there but we can’t because they can’t sell the land.“The council own all of the land there and  they were able to progress with that quicker then we would be able to get houses built there. We are building four-in-a-block-type houses and semi-detached-style properties which are hugely popular and we get bombarded with applications for them.”The council insists it is making progress, with 527 units under construction.Kevin Cordell, convener of neighbourhood services – which includes housing – said: “We recognise the need for new affordable housing, that’s why we have committed to building 1,000 affordable new homes.“In Mill o’ Mains, Whitfield, Lochee and Hilltown, we have already built more than 200.“We are getting to grips with the problem of supply and demand by rebalancing the amount and type of housing on offer to the people of Dundee.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundees paul mcgowan weve not been good enough and need to change that against hibernian","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor Dundee’s players, it’s time to produce the goods today at home to Hibs  they are to finally get some Premiership points on the board, according to midfield man Paul McGowan.In his usual no-nonsense fashion, McGowan admits the Dark Blues “haven’t been good enough” this season.That’s left them rooted to the foot of the table with no points to their name.The 30-year-old, though, is adamant Dundee have the ability to get themselves out of the trouble they find themselves in.He said: “A bit of luck is just missing for us right now but we need to make our own luck.“We need to start finishing the chances we are creating and we’re not keeping clean sheets.“That doesn’t bode well for trying to get the three points but we need to stick together, start from a clean sheet and then, hopefully, finish off a chance.“Listen, I could sit here and go through all sorts of stuff but it’s time to man up now and be counted.“It will be hard out there, the crowd will be on us a wee bit and rightly so with the way we have started but we need to overcome that and, hopefully, get them onside by putting in a performance.“We need to give them something to shout about because they haven’t had that.”And McGowan says he has no problem with having to deal with a bit of stick from the stands.“The fans have paid money so they’re entitled to have a moan because we’ve not been playing that well,” he added.“We accept that, we’re grown men and  you can’t take criticism then you shouldn’t be in this game.”After a 4-0 tanking at Ibrox last week where the Dark Blues were blown away in the early stages, trailing 2-0 within 15 minutes, McGowan has urged his team-mates to be more streetwise going forward.“You’ve got to weather that first 10, 15 minutes or so and we didn’t.“We gted them two goals and you can’t do that at Ibrox – you can’t do that against any team in this league.“We need to be more streetwise with how the game is going,  we’re under it a bit, just sit in and soak up the pressure until the game settles down a bit. We need to learn that.“Inidual mistakes are costing us and we’re getting punished for them all.“It’s amazing how quickly football can change. At the start of the season we had the chance to go 2-1 up at St Mirren but missed the penalty and then we conceded a freak goal.“Things like that can just turn and luck starts going against you but, listen, we haven’t been good enough.“I’m not going to make excuses or any rubbish like that – we haven’t been good enough and that’s down to the players.“We need to stand up and be counted and start showing how good a football team we are. We need to produce, starting today.“I believe in every one of us that we are good enough to get out of the situation we’re in.“It’s only five games into the season, a couple of wins gets us right up there.“I know we are a good footballing side, it’s the other side we need, being hard to beat and getting clean sheets.”The Dens men come up against a formidable attacking outfit when Neil Lennon’s Hibs come to town – McGowan, though, is certain Dundee can cause some problems of their own.He added: “Hibs are good going forward but they can be got at at the back. They are expansive, have a go, that’s the way Lenny like’s it but he’ll have them well-drilled and well up for it.“It’ll be a big ask for us to get the three points but I’m pretty sure we can.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united boss csaba pleased to have more options for falkirk clash","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United manager Csaba Laszlo admits he is relieved to, finally, have close to a full squad to choose from.Csaba will have more at his disposal for the clash at Championship bottom side Falkirk today and could hand starts to key men Fraser Fyvie and Billy King.Both are rated touch and go while Sam Stanton, Nicky Clark and Stewart Murdoch are working their way back to full training.Csaba said: “We have spoken with Fraser and he still hasn’t decided but he is not far enough along psychologically but I think, definitely, he will be part of the squad.“We are looking to protect the player in the long term, not just one game.“It will be a decision between him and me.

I am not a player made for playing without any pressure because then I wouldn’t be playing well.“I need pressure to thrive and it’s a big club – it should be in the Premiership.“It’s about how we deal with the pressure and Dundee United is probably the team with the most pressure on it in this league.“You feel like the fans definitely want to get out of the Championship. I want to get out of the Championship as well.“I’m not coming here to play my two seasons on my contract in the Championship.“It’s going to be a tough game and, in this league, every game is tough. It’s not because they are bottom of the league that we should underestimate them.“They have a new coach and they showed last week they played very good in the first half and the thing is they have nothing to lose, we have everything to lose.“You see in this league there is not one game you can predict. Everybody can beat each other.”After disappointing draws against Alloa and Morton in recent weeks, Frans knows there can be no more excuses.He has captained the side in the absence of the likes of Fraser Fyvie and Stewart Murdoch and feels they are now more equipped, with their ‘leaders’ coming back to the squad, to go on a winning run.“If you look at the way we played last weekend, we had 11 players starting who weren’t here last year but still we produce some good stuff,” he added.“We need to be more efficient. We missed a few chances but also we concede every game.“I do think we defend well but somehow we concede a penalty and the week before it was a free-kick against Alloa.“It is not because of bad defending, just small things, and we need to get better at them.“I think you see every week we are improving but, OK, there comes a time you need to put it in results and start to go on a run.“You see Fraser Fyvie coming back, Billy King, Sam Stanton is still injured, Murdoch is out.“These are players who would walk into a lot of Championship teams and be the leaders.“There are positive things to look forward to.”United will go toe-to-toe with pointless bottom side Falkirk today on an articial surface.However, Frans says they will not be using that or the ongoing stormy weather as excuses for another disappointing display.“I don’t like to talk about the pitch because I don’t want to have any excuses. Whatever pitch it is we should play well.“We went to Queen of the South and I think the first half we produced one of the best performances since I’ve been here.“You come up against dferent circumstances and maybe it’s going to be 100mph wind.“Every week it’s something so  you think too much about circumstances you are not focused.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"falkirk boss ray mckinnon looks ahead to clash with old club dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRay McKinnon accepts there will be an added dimension to this weekend’s game against old club Dundee United because he is only “human”.However, the Falkirk manager is adamant his sole focus will be on trying to land a first league win of the season for his new team.McKinnon will be facing United for the first time since being sacked by the Tangerines in October last year.He was axed just 10 games into the season with the Tannadice outfit in fourth place and just five points off the top of the Championship.He said: “I’m treating it just as another game but I am human, so I am naturally going to look at all the scenarios.“However, the focus will definitely be just on us and making sure we are set up properly.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5ba365a0ced19-846x564.jpg ","title":"neil mccann urges his dundee players to be more decisive in front of goal","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee boss Neil McCann has urged his players to be more decisive in front of goal against Hibs this weekend to finally get some Premiership points on the board.The Dark Blues host Neil Lennon’s men this Saturday still in search of their first positive result of the season and languishing at the foot of the table.With time marching on and teams above them picking up results, pressure is building at Dens Park on the management team.A wee bit of composure in front of goal, however, would be the perfect tonic to lt the spirits at Dens Park against the Hibees, according to gaffer Neil.That would have helped at Ibrox had Elton Ngwatala kept his cool in front of goal, despite being on his weaker side, as he raced beyond the Rangers defence with the score at 2-0.Kenny Miller played in the Frenchman in the 36th minute but Ngwatala dallied on the ball and didn’t even manage to get a shot off despite having just keeper Allan McGregor to beat.Had Dundee made that count, Neil insists the outcome of the match would’ve been dferent.He said: “Elton took an extra touch and I don’t think he needed to.“It was a blistering counter-attack, it was a lovely ball, and he should just take it early but his extra touch allows the defender to recover and doesn’t even make the keeper save.“I definitely believe it would have changed the outcome of the whole match but it’s been the story of our season where we don’t take chances or choose the right decision in the final third.”Poor decision-making has also cost the team dear in defence, with Ngwatala’s missed opportunity compounded shortly afterwards as Darren O’Dea brought Alfredo Morelos down for a penalty moments before half-time to end the match as any kind of contest.Neil added: “I felt we had enough of the game in between the second and third goal.“Darren gets injured and then makes a poor decision in the end because he was struggling.“I had no complaints about the penalty but it was a sore one because we were going in at 2-0 with us well in the game.”More frustration would follow for the Dark Blues as key man Kenny Miller saw red for a rash challenge while already on a yellow card.Referee Kevin Clancy brandished a straight red card for the tackle on Gers full-back Borna Barisic.The former Celtic, Wolves and Rangers striker will miss Saturday’s clash with another of his old clubs Hibs and the following trip to Hamilton after the club’s appeal against the decision was unsuccessful.And Miller says he’s “disappointed” to be missing out when his new club is desperate to turn their dreadful opening to the campaign around.Miller said: “Anyone who knows me knows I am not a dirty player.“My eyes were firmly on the ball throughout.“I went wholeheartedly to win the ball. I did win the ball but on the follow-through there is always going to be contact.“We have watched it back and I am actually pulling my leg away as soon as I touched the ball to try to minimise the contact.“I never went in to harm anybody and I think the red was brandished too quickly.“I have been in the game a long time but I have never gone in to hurt anybody.“It was an honest, genuine attempt to play the ball which I did.“So it is disappointing I am going to miss two games after just going to a new club.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/41-Voyage-of-Discovery_maggies_penguin_parade_.jpg ","title":"this weekend farewell parade for maggies penguins in dundee ahead of auction","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNow really is your chance to p-p-p-pick up a penguin – for a great cause.Fans are preparing to say goodbye to the massively successful Maggie’s Penguin Parade this weekend before all 80 giant sculptures are auctioned at V\u0026ampA Dundee on Monday at 6.30pm.The full-size statues, plus 100 “baby” penguins, will be showcased at a farewell parade in the city’s Slessor Gardens today and Sunday.Each penguin has its own design – from Bonnie Dundee to Mr Sofishticated, Penguinstein and Hell’s Penguin.The project – which aims to raise half a million pounds for Maggie’s Dundee – challenged people to find all 80 penguin sculptures dotted throughout Dundee, Angus, Perthshire and Fe.All proceeds from the ticket-only Farewell Parade, which runs from 10am-5pm on both days, will also go to Maggie’s.Tickets are available from Dundee Box Office, by phone, online or in person on the day.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"                          POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"owen-mcintosh-celtic-fans-horrified-as-coach-driver-pulls-bus-over-and-batters-fellow-motorist","story":"                          A BUS driver faces being sacked by Glasgow City Council after pulling over a coach load of Celtic fans to attack a rival motorist."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"                          AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged \u0026pound490 million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"country-legend-shania-twain-kicks-off-tour-in-glasgow-and-talks-storm-ali","story":"                          GLASGOW witnessed the spectacle of a letime with the arrival of country legend Shania Twain\u0027 highly-anticipated tour."},{"url":null,"title":"call-for-sturgeon-to-step-in-to-help-save-sauchiehall-street-after-blaze","story":"                          NICOLA Sturgeon has been asked to lead a national recovery plan for Sauchiehall Street as businesses fear they could go bust following the school of Art fire."},{"url":null,"title":"paisley-museum-says-goodbye-to-public-as-works-get-underway-on-42m-revamp","story":"                          THE doors of Paisley Museum were locked for the last time yesterday as work gets underway on a \u0026pound42 million revamp of the historic visitor attraction."},{"url":null,"title":"sfa-and-diageo-team-up-to-promote-responsible-drinking","story":"                          The Scottish Football Association and drinks company Diageo have launched a campaign to promote responsible drinking."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-dad-stephen-kinnaird-says-he-struggled-to-access-support-after-the-sudden-loss-of-his-partner","story":"                          A DAD has told of the \u0026ldquoheart wrenching moment he had to tell his young daughters that their mum and the love of his le was not going to survive after she had a major stroke at just 46."},{"url":null,"title":"graeme-mcgarry-can-leigh-griffiths-get-stuttering-celtic-firing-on-all-cylinders-again","story":"                          IT used to be said that at the Old Firm, you were never more than a defeat away from a crisis.

The developer, Dutch property firm Vastint Hospitality, could not be contacted.A y Inverness debate ended on Tuesday with an 8-7 vote to refuse the application despite Ness-side SNP councillor Ron MacWilliam\u0027 insistence that the vision was that of \"a grand building, that you\u0026rsquod expect to see in a serious city centre\".Inverness Central ward party colleague Richard Laird, however, successfully argued that it \"failed to make a positive contribution to the city\u0027 architecture,\" and therefore contravened the local plan.He described the design as \"absolutely bogging\" and \"exactly the same as some of those we\u0026rsquore so desperate to tear down in the middle of Inverness\".He and several committee colleagues were also concerned about the potential impact of future traffic movement in Waterloo Place and Glebe Street as a result of the proposed development.There was general support for a hotel to be built at the location but Cllr Laird said the drawing board proposition \"looks exactly the same as some of those we\u0026rsquore so desperate to teardown in the middle of Inverness\" \u0026ndash a reference to the council\u0027 recent approval for bulldozing and replacing the \u0026lsquo60s-built Bridge Street \"blots on the landscape\".Committee colleague Bill Lobban considered the hotel design \"hideous\".He said: \"It\u0027 the most visible site in the whole of Inverness.

first","story":"\u0026nbspA DOCTOR and a former detective have joined forces to launch Scotland\u0027 first absinthe blanche using ingredients hand-picked from around their 500-year-old ancestral home by the shores of Loch Ness.The couple, Lorien and Kevin Cameron-Ross, creators of the award-winning Loch Ness Gin, developed the recipe for Loch Ness Absinthe, both distilled at their home on the banks of the loch, following a trip to the birthplace of the spirit, Val-de-Travers in Switzerland.It was there Lorien learned to fine-tune the craft of making absinthe which was first used as a medicinal remedy by a French doctor living in the country, Pierre Ordinaire around the 1790s.Although best known as absinthe verte, the notorious \"green drink\", popular in the late 19th and early 20th century among artists and writers in Paris, with Vincent Van Gogh and Ernest Hemmingway among its devotees, the couple decided to create their own Scottish blanche recipe.Blanche absinthe dates back to 1910 following the ban of green absinthe in ious countries \u0026ndash although not in the UK \u0026ndash due to unproven fears it had hallucinogenic properties resulting from the use of thujone, a component of wormwood.This led to the illegal production of clear absinthe in Switzerland, making it harder for the authorities to identy.Lorien said: \"We are really proud of our latest product, Loch Ness Absinthe, boasting our very own homegrown botanicals including wormwood mixed with nearby fresh water which flows into the famous loch.\"We felt there was gap in the market for an absinthe blanche in Scotland, a drink I really enjoy, so decided to put the wheels in motion last year and began to research its history and fully understand the craft of creating and distilling it.\"Loch Ness Absinthe, with a ABV of 53 per cent, is less potent that absinthe verte, which is usually around 72 per cent.The couple, who are firm believers in mindful drinking where you drink less and enjoy yourself more, recommend that Loch Ness Absinthe should be enjoyed slowly as an aperit, ideally in a mix of one-part absinthe to three parts iced water, poured over a sugar cube on the glass\u0027 rim.Lorien continued: \"I\u0026rsquove worked really hard to get the recipe for our latest product, Loch Ness Absinthe exactly the way I wanted and in the process perfected the art of distilling it to get the exact results I was looking for.\"With the help and support of Kevin, I\u0026rsquove created a drink that I\u0026rsquom really pleased with, which has already received fantastic feedback, leading to us driving our plans forward to launch even more products in the near future that will continue to be inspired by the loch and the land around us.\"Sunday 23 Sep 2018

They have since gathered more than 14,500 signatures.And the march looks set to go ahead as planned after Highland Council revealed that the objections made in the original petition \"are not sufficient reason\" to refuse it. The local authority said objections on moral grounds were not a material matter when its licensing department decides whether to approve the temporary traffic restrictions that allow marches to proceed.It added that the petition against the march is \"being considered separately\" through its regular petitions procedures by its legal service team.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Highland Council, Licensing has received a request for a parade on October 6 in Inverness.\"This is currently being considered under consultation with Police Scotland and the council\u0027 roads team.\"A decision on the parade will be made [this] week and a Temporary Traffic Restriction Order would be required for the march.\" They added: \"The matters raised in the petition are not sufficient reason for the council to refuse permission for the parade, and the petition is being considered separately.\"Meanwhile, Mr Morrison has accused Highland Council of \u0026lsquomoving the goalposts\u0026rsquo after claiming it had shted a deadline for views on the march to be submitted.He said his petition was submitted on September 7 \u0026ndash which he argued was the last date for comments \u0026ndash and that he had since heard the deadline had moved back to September 21.\"One cannot help but wonder whether the circulation of two online petitions, in favour of the Proud Ness march, both created within 24 hours on and around 11 September, prompted Highland Council to review and then quickly change their date, so as to accommodate the cravings of these petitioners,\" he said.\"Everyone can clearly see that the subtle and suspicious date change is most conspicuous, just as it is deeply alarming.\"Surely it is wholly inappropriate for... Highland Council to act in a manner, that very much appears to be deceptive and gives the impression of being supportive of these counter online petitions.\"Following the council\u0027 insistence that the petition\u0027 objection is not a material licensing matter, it is not clear what dference a later deadline would have made over any decision. It is also not uncommon for councils to push consultation dates back in order for extra views to be aired.Meanwhile, the creator of one of the petitions in favour of the march has spoken of her delight at the amount of support they have received.Alice Masheter said the response had been \"fantastic\" and that, even though she is not a member of the LGBT+ community, she had felt compelled to set a petition up in solidarity to show that everyone is \"accepted and welcomed up here\".She said the pro-march petitions show that the LGBT+ community \"do have a huge amount of support\" and anti-march views are \"in the minority\".Sunday 23 Sep 2018 8:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116850.jpg","title":"New social enterprise cafe set for grand opening","story":"\u0026nbspA QUIRKY caf\u0026eacute that could be run by former prisoners in an attempt to reduce re-offending rates is opening in Inverness this week.The venue at 86 Church Street called Ar n-\u0026Agraveite, which translates to Our Place, will be officially opened by Inverness MP Drew Hendry at noon on Thursday.It aims to \u0026lsquorebuild\u0026rsquo people\u0027 lives after jail, giving them work and a chance to be a part of society.More than 50 volunteers are needed in the first year to run the venture and make it financially viable.Andrew Fowler, from the charity Signpost, which is spearheading the caf\u0026eacute scheme, said: \"We genuinely believe that we will be preparing people for work.

The handicaps are as tricky as juggling with hedgehogs  The novices keep you on your toes while the listed and the Group races have you tearing your hair out with the temptation to rip into the jolly regardless. Mind you, with just two favourites since 1980 winning the big race, perhaps we should be more confident. The Ayr Gold Cup is run over six furlongs and is open to horses aged three years or older with a maximum field size of 25. For those who like to follow trainers Richard Fahey and Andrew Balding have an excellent record in the race. They have, however, some way to go to match Yorkshire-based Irish man Kevin Ryan who has saddled four winners in the last 10 years. The pick of his entries  is MAJOR JUMBO 16/1. He comes good in September and the fast finishing second to KIMBERELLA last time out in a listed race at Chester is decent form. The current favourite has been punted hard having started the week at 8/1, and SON OF REST is now as short as 5s.  He put up his best performance yet when beaten a 1/2  by HAVANA GREY on Sunday at the Curragh. There is no guarantee that just six days on he can repeat the feat. I’m against him. Second favourite GROWL , in his career to date, has done all his winning earlier in the season and while soft ground would not be a hindrance most of his winning has come on faster turf. He’s not for me. Horses aged between four and fivr have an excellent record, but fillies and mares have yet to land a blow in the previous 16 renewals. The average winning starting price in that time was 15/1. Be bold, be brave you might say. A high draw is a bonus for this cavalry charge and with our selection MAJOR JUMBO drawn in stall 9 it should certainly not hinder this front runners chances. With 22 races under his belt, the horse has won five and been placed in 12 of the others. Those victories have come in a lower grade but MAJOR JUMBO 16/1 has acquitted himself well in Class 2 company. Apprentice jockey Finley Marsh claims a valuable 5lbs and though he is having only his second ride for trainer Ryan he is no stranger to the winners enclosure.

The boss saw his side blitz Falkirk with a second half super show on Saturday. And he insists inspiration was drawn not from his words – but the famous Somerset Road End. McCall admitted: “People are giving me credit for some kind of masterful team talk. “But the reality is our fans were dferent class and played a huge part in getting us back into that game. “At times it felt like the Somerset Road End was pulling the ball into the net. “That’s what makes this such a dficult place for opposition teams to come and we need to make the most of it. “I honestly don’t think our fans realise just how important they are to the team. “Saturday was proof of the key part they can play so let’s hope there’s a lot more to come.” United boast a 100 per cent record on home turf this season and McCall is determined that Somerset will become a fortress again. He said: “You look at the league and would maybe say Ross County have that class edge because of the money they’ve spent. “They have a Premier League squad. “But as for everyone else...there’s no reason why we can’t hold our own.  “Nobody is going to get an easy game at our place and we’re proving we can live with the other sides in this ision. “Had we kept 11 men on the park at Inverness we’d have won there and would be sitting top of the league right now. “So we know  we play at our best we’re a match for anyone.” Ayr will head for old rivals Alloa tomorrow knowing they have a chance to hit top spot should results go their way. Jamie Adams will be rested from the articial surface while Daniel Harvie completes his two match suspension.

Eyewitnesses described a noise like an earthquake as the roof came crashing to the ground in Ayr\u0027s Phillips Square. Cars, including a Subaru Imprezza, were crushed underneath as the effect of Storm Ali was felt in full force. The impact of the storm blew the top of the flats off at around 1pm today. Resident David Hose, who stays on the top floor of the block, described the horrying moment.  David, 28, told the Ayrshire Post: It sounded like a mini earthquake, it was a bang like I\u0027d never heard before. I looked outside and couldn\u0027t believe what I was seeing. The roof was lying on the ground on top of cars and not far from the school playground. It\u0027s a miracle it didn\u0027t kill anyone. Gordon Baillie, 36, a night porter at Ayr\u0027s Mercure Hotel, added: I was sitting on the couch watching telly and heard a big bang. I went to the window and saw my neighbour looking at his car as his Subaru was stuck underneath it. They\u0027ve taped everything off and we\u0027re blocked inside. My partner is still at work so he\u0027ll get a fright when he comes home. Emergency services have now shut off the road in a bid to clear the scene. Police wearing hard hats are on site with loose debris currently blowing around the affected area. It comes as a number of roads have been blocked due to falling trees and debris across Ayrshire.

Two more goals from Lawrence Shankland helped the Honest Men to victory at Alloa, putting them in prime shape for Wednesday\u0027s Betfred Cup trip to Ibrox. So what did we learn from this afternoon\u0027s display?   1. Shank You Very Much   Ayr fans are running out of superlatives for their star man and he delivered once again here. Lawrence Shankland arrived at Somerset Park 12 months ago with a reputation of unfulfilled talent - but it\u0027s safe to say he has long since put that record straight. Shankland is much more than a penalty box striker and he proved it again here with an all action display, leading from the front. His first goal - a clinical finish - underlined the class dference between these sides and Ayr rarely looked back. Most pleasing for United fans was the sight of Shankland berating teammates for a couple of loose passes as the clock ticked down in its final seconds. His desire and drive to raise standards is proving an example to all and with Shankland in their ranks, the sky could be the limit for Ayr.   2. Liam\u0027s A Touch Of Class   He was talked up as a quality signing and Liam Smith is proving the real deal. The Scotland under-21 full back has been deployed on the left during Daniel Harvie\u0027s suspension and, even though not his natural position, has looked a standout. Once again he offered Ayr real thrust here and was involved in most of their positive play. Boss Ian McCall has said he expects Smith to slot in at right back in the long term, but with such competition for places it is a nice problem to have.    3. Could Ayr Really Stun Rangers?   This was a workmanlike performance from United and they will need to raise their game signicantly to trouble Steven Gerrard\u0027s men on Wednesday night. But Ayr will rarely have the chance to go to Ibrox in better heart and in Shankland they have a genuine match winner who would not look out of place at the top of Scotland\u0027s Premiership. If they can hold their nerve and service the 15-goal striker, they may just cause a shock.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterRangers NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Rangers newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrScotland U21s football teamAyr United FCAlloa Athletic FCRangers FC"},{"url":null,"title":"sheriff-orders-gala-woman-to-hand-over-car-keys","story":"A GALASHIELS woman has been ordered to give up her car keys after being accused of two drink driving offences in the space of two months.\nJune McKain has been told she cannot drive a vehicle until the outcome of her trial in November.\nThe 58-year-old of Ladhope Crescent, appeared from custody at Selkirk Sherf Court where she pleaded not guilty to a charge of driving with a breath/alcohol count of 42 microgrammes -

Struthers\u0026#8217 exhibition in Campbeltown Library features a trove of items belonging to the late Major Jim Struthers, formerly of Ardmaddy Estate, near Oban.The items, including a dummy shell, gas goggles, badges and medals, a unorm and original airship banners and propellers, were collated, over the course of a year, by Eleanor McKay, bibliographic and local studies librarian at Live Argyll, after a conversation with Major Struthers\u0026#8217 son Charles.\u0026#8216He said he had \u0026#8216one or two things\u0026#8217 belonging to his late father,\u0026#8217 Eleanor explained. \u0026#8216It turned out to be eight boxes full of artefacts that we\u0026#8217re still going through now.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s one of the best collections from the First World War that we have seen.\u0026#8217There are parts of shot-down airships, a parachute, fragments of a radiator from a zeppelin and much more.Accompanying the artefacts, are photographs, many taken by Major Struthers himself, documenting his personal le and military career, as well as the history of airships.Major Struthers, who was mentioned in dispatches, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, with two bars later added, for his missions with the Royal Naval Air Service, which amalgamated with the British Army\u0026#8217s Royal Flying Core to become the Royal Air Force in 1918.Major Struthers was recognised for flying more hours than any other airship pilot during the war.Aged 52 by the time the Second World War broke out, Major Struthers was too old to serve but he was in the Royal Observer Corps, his patch stretching from Sutherland to Machrihanish.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s local to Oban but it\u0026#8217s an Argyll story,\u0026#8217 said Eleanor. \u0026#8216Major Struthers was actually based in Cornwall during the war.\u0026#8217Diana Manning, from Drumlemble but originally from Cornwall, attended the exhibition\u0026#8217s Campbeltown opening to find out more about the Cornish history, and found it \u0026#8216fascinating\u0026#8217.During her opening speech, Eleanor said: \u0026#8216I think this is an area of World War One that people don\u0026#8217t really think about.\u0026#8216They think about later aircraft, especially in World War Two, but I don\u0026#8217t think they know the role they had in World War One.\u0026#8217Councillor Donald Kelly, who attended the opening, said he thought it was essential to engage with local school children: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s important that youngsters today know what went on in the past \u0026#8211 especially

the HMS Platypus Cup became the club\u0026#8217s mixed doubles championship\u0026#8217s coveted trophy and names began to be inscribed.As with any weather dependent sport there were years when the championship was not played, or perhaps there were not enough ladies and gents to run a mixed doubles competition.If the teams were always picked from a hat, the method used currently, it would explain why partnerships did not endure, unless by luck, though one strong player may win successively.The cup\u0026#8217s first winners in 1919 were: Mrs Chapman and Mr R. Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a dferent pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang ed, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

The cake was 3ft4in\u0026nbspwide, and 8in\u0026nbsphigh, and is an exact replica of the building near Tranent High Street.  Using vanilla sponge sandwiched with buttercream, former architect Michelle carved the cake into shape before covering it in a sugar paste fondant.

Each family member will don a special t-shirt as they do their bit for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and The Butterfly Trust.  Amelia\u0026rsquos mum Kathryn Tait is one of those who will be climbing the 86 steps inside the lighthouse before slowing making a 121ft descent back to solid ground on Saturday, September 22.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt was Amelia\u0026rsquos gran, Shirley Dinning, who had the idea.  \u0026ldquoShe wanted to do the abseil from the Forth Bridge but they already had their charities and so she could not do it for the cystic fibrosis charities. That is why she decided to do it at the lighthouse.  \u0026ldquoI have never done anything like this.  \u0026ldquoI would not say I am looking forward to it but I am looking forward to raising money for the charities.  \u0026ldquoAmelia is going to need help the rest of her le and it is nice to give something back.  The youngster, who turned one last month, was born three weeks early at the Birth Centre in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh .  It was three weeks later, following a routine heel prick, that it was discovered she had cystic fibrosis.  The genetic condition affects more than 10,400 people in the UK.  People with cystic fibrosis experience a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing a wide range of challenging symptoms affecting the entire body.  Kathryn said: \u0026ldquoShe had her heel prick test at five days old and then everything was fine.  \u0026ldquoThen, when she was three weeks old, we got a call from the Edinburgh Sick Kids Hospital to say we needed to go up because they had to discuss her results with us.  \u0026ldquoI phoned Amelia\u0026rsquos dad, Darren, at his work and said we needed to go there.  \u0026ldquoThey said she had cystic fibrosis and explained all about it \u0026ndash all about the genes, why she had it and that sort of stuff obviously it was a lot to take in.  Kathryn, who previously worked at Leuchie House, near North Berwick, as a care assistant, told the Courier she had heard of the condition but did not know a lot about it until speaking to the doctors.  Since the diagnosis, Amelia, who Kathryn described as \u0026ldquoalways smiling and [who] loves attention, has had regular trips to the Sick Kids to be checked over by doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and dieticians.  Kathryn, 23, of Dovecot Way, Haddington, said: \u0026ldquoAmelia has twice daily physio which she does not enjoy.  \u0026ldquoLuckily her pancreas is sufficient and she does not have to take enzymes to help her digest food.  \u0026ldquoWhen she does have an infection, it is quite an intensive course of antibiotics, three or four times a day.  \u0026ldquoIt is just the little things we have to watch for, like spraying deodorant because, obviously, you do not want her breathing that in and dust and things.  Now friends and family members, including Amelia\u0026rsquos older sisters Laura and Abby, are getting ready to give back to the two charities.  The Butterfly Trust, based in Edinburgh, offers support to families and people affected by the condition, while the Cystic Fibrosis Trust is heavily involved in research.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.

Just two weeks before he died, Mr Lindgren was moved to Herdmanflat Hospital in Haddington until a permanent home could be found but he passed away on July 18.  Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.

The restricted service was only for general advice, which makes up about a quarter of the total bureau work, but paid staff were still available for case work and outreach services as normal.  Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.

The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.

It is set amongst the fields which surround this old former mining village. The graveyard is reached taking a short walk which follows an old rail line. The surviving gravestones are not so old, yet I felt an immediate aura of antiquity as I entered the place.  As I wandered there I knew nothing of its past. I had stumbled upon it during a short walk from the village. I always explore when I get the chance, never knowing what I might find. It seemed neglected and strangely positioned, away from the village and no evidence of a kirk nearby. I assumed it to be connected to nearby Elphinstone Tower.  Yet soon afterwards I discovered that on the north-west of the graveyard there had indeed been a kirk a medieval pre-reformation chapel no less. Its foundations remain buried under the surface, its stones yet to tell its stories.  However, that is just one layer of this graveyard\u0026rsquos history, for it is described as overlying a prehistoric site of \u0026ldquonational importance by Ancient Monuments UK. I had been walking within an ancient fort, possibly as early as the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. While visible evidence of this is now all gone, I can testy to the aura of antiquity which hangs there. Historic sites are often not just what you can see, but what you can sense and feel.  But the graveyard was not why I was in Elphinstone that day. I had taken a trip to this village to visit Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. It\u0026rsquos a \u0026lsquobullet stone\u0026rsquo set in the village.  There is more than one story about this stone. One tale tells us that an elf is trapped within it. According to this story the elf was a servant of an Elphinstone witch called Meg.  One day the witch travelled in her carriage to a nearby burn and there had eaten food, refusing to share it with her elves. While she was having a post-scoff snooze, an elf snuck into her carriage and took the leftovers. The angry witch incarcerated the elf within the stone as a punishment.  The primary school have a version of this story painted in the playground and the children there are best to tell that tale! It\u0026rsquos a story which suggests a reason for the village name: \u0026lsquoElf in Stone\u0026rsquo!  But as is often the case, there is also an older folk tale about the stone, mentioned well over 100 years ago by P M\u0026rsquoNeill in his fascinating book of the traditions of the area. In this tale Meg is also the main character. Here is my re-telling of this old story:  The stone which now stands in Elphinstone village once stood by the smiddy. It was owned by a well-kent witch of the village called Meg. She was not the only witch in the area, for she had many friends who were also witches. They were all married women, with heavy domestic duties to perform and little time for themselves during the day.  However, as night fell and their \u0026ldquoauld gude men lay soond asleep at hame, this happy group of witches would meet up at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, a short distance from the village but far enough away to be out of earshot of a sleeping husband.  Here the sisterhood would have witchy fun and play games. Meg would bring the bullet stone for a game of chuck , a game in which four stones are laid on a surface while one is thrown in the air. The player must pick up all the four stones, then catch the thrown stone as it falls back to the ground.  Perhaps this huge stone was actually the one thrown into the air. After all, they were witches and so a normal game of chuckie would have been a bit mundane. I do not know exactly how heavy it is but it would defeat anyone trying to lt it without magic or machinery.  In fact it would have been a fair challenge to carry from the village to the burn, even for a witch. And that is why Meg didn\u0026rsquot carry it to her liaisons. She used magic, of course. As her husband snored in the house she would creep out to the stone and turn it into a horse. I can visualise her mounting this confused beast in the light of the moon, then riding speedily with joyful laughter towards Harry\u0026rsquos Burn to meet her friends and enjoy the short time of freedom from domestic duties.  There at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn she would dismount and greet her friends. No doubt they all had dferent and novel methods of travel to get to their location: a flying sieve, riding a wolf, even a husband changed into a horse are all possibilities according to the beliefs of the time!  Upon her arrival Meg would lead the horse to the burn to drink. As soon as it had quenched its thirst, Meg changed it back to a stone. And so the heavy stone was successfully transported so the witches could play their game.  Then, when the fun was over, Meg turned the stone back into a horse for the  journey, carefully dismounting at the end of her journey on the same spot by the smiddy, and then transforming the poor creature back into stone.  And so the bullet stone remains in the village after Meg\u0026rsquos final journey. It can be found opposite the primary school and is called Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. As far as I know it hasn\u0026rsquot been a horse since the last time Meg changed it into one, so it will be desperate for some exercise by now.  There is no reason not to believe that Meg also trapped an elf within the stone, as the later tale suggests. She was, after all, a witch with powerful magic.  So  you sit on it, be careful about the words you mutter. You might just accidentally say the spell that transforms it into a horse, and then you\u0026rsquoll be off on a terryingly wild ride to Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, possibly in the company of a hyperactive and by now very hungry elf.  Or maybe that would be fun! I wonder what the spell was. Maybe the children in the school have an idea?"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube-and-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-event-for-preston-tower","story":"  Dig It!

One of the two reactors at the power station, to the east of the town, is being taken offline.  The programme means hundreds of extra workers will join the 750-strong regular workforce for the maintenance period, known as a \u0026ldquostatutory outage.  Robert Gunn, station director, said: \u0026ldquoIt is Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos 30th birthday this year and this is the 22nd statutory outage we have carried out at the station.  \u0026ldquoWe are very well practised at them and over the years we have built great relationships with the extra workers who come and support us during the outages.  \u0026ldquoThese workers will be staying in local hotels and B\u0026ampBs, eating in the area\u0026rsquos restaurants and using taxi firms.  \u0026ldquoIt is great that our investment in the power station can also benefit our local community just as the peak tourist season is coming to an end.  \u0026ldquoWe carry out maintenance and inspections on the units that generate the electricity all-year-round but a statutory outage gives us the chance to carry out pieces of work that are not possible when the reactor is operating.  Philip Mellor, chairman of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association  and owner of the Dunmuir Hotel, was delighted with the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is very positive news.  \u0026ldquoI am delighted to welcome people to Dunbar and certainly as we move into the quieter season, as the holidaymakers have left, it is the ideal time for EDF to run this type of project.  \u0026ldquoIt will massively benefit the community as a whole.  EDF Energy carries out a statutory outage on each of its reactors once every three years.  These are planned in advance with the National Grid to ensure that there is no impact on the national electricity supply.  The other reactor at Torness is due to continue operating normally throughout the period.  During the outage workers will carry out more than 12,000 separate pieces of work \u0026ndash each carefully planned during the last two years of preparation.  The biggest projects include fitting of additional reactor gas temperature instrumentation, exchange of the turbine intermediate and low-pressure rotors, and replacement of auxiliary cooling water pipework systems.  Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos two nuclear reactors generate enough electricity to power more than two million homes and started operating in 1988.  The station employs more than 500 full-time staff and about 250 full-time contract partners.

Lewis, of Dalkeith, is the current WTKA Scottish Champion, Sandee Open Intercontinental British Champion, Yokkao Open British Champion and SUSU Fighting Championship Champion. As a result, he is also British No. 1 and No. 2 in two weight isions.  Faith, of Tranent, is current Yokkao Scottish Champion, WTKA British Champion, Yokkao Open British K1 Champion, and Celtic Nations Champion and is ranked No. 2 in the UK.  In Italy, the duo will be competing to become both WTKA Muay Thai and K1 world champions.  Scott Hendry founded the club with friend Charles Cameron in 2014, and currently trains both Lewis and Faith.  \"Definitely, we could have two world champions coming back in November,\" he told the Courier.  \"They could come back with both titles which would be a tremendous achievement.\"  Faith\u0027s exploits are all the more impressive considering she has only been in the sport since May 2017.  \"Faith has been pretty remarkable,\" Scott said. \"She\u0027s had eleven fights in the space of a year.  \"She\u0027s won four titles and she\u0027s ranked number two in the UK.  \"She\u0027s fought the girl who is ranked number one four times and beat her three times.  \"I\u0027ve calculated it and she should move to number one by the end of the year.\"  The club, who train in the Bronx Boxing Gym in Tranent, will hold a fundraiser on Sunday.  He said: \"We\u0027re actually going to be fundraising in the gym.  \"We\u0027re inviting gyms from all over Scotland to come in and spar in the ring and it\u0027ll be \u0026pound3/4 on the door to come in.  \"All proceeds from that will go to the trip.

The sport can then apply to become part of the Olympic games sports programme after three years.  Speaking about the championship and Olympic approval, Scott said: \"I think its good for the whole of the sport to be honest.  \"That\u0027s a huge thing for the sport, it should open up other avenues for the sport in terms of funding, as well as increase the profile of the sport.\"  There\u0027s definite potential for both Lewis and Faith to become Olympic athletes but Scott knows there is a long road ahead  both want to go pro.  \"Lewis is in a predicament because he\u0027s really good at football as well. He goes across to train in Glasgow every two weeks with the Scotland Youth Development squad.  \"So, there\u0027s a chance Lewis could go into pro football, teams have spoken to him. He\u0027s going to have a choice to make at some point.  \"With Faith, I think  it\u0027s done right she could make a career out of it.  \"There\u0027s avenues she could look at going down, but she\u0027s only 12 so there\u0027s a long way to go just yet.\"  The club has also recently been nominated three times in the Celebrating Sports Awards, held by East Lothian Council.

Jackie Gentil, who is principal teacher at Macmerry Primary School, was crowned the winner alongside her dance partner Jane Libberton.  Mairi O\u0026rsquoKeefe, Leuchie House CEO, said: \u0026ldquoWe are thrilled that Strictly Leuchie has raised so much for our charity again this year.  \u0026ldquoIt was a wonderful night and the dancers were incredible. To go from never having danced in public before to performing so well in front of a huge audience after only 10 weeks takes loads of hard work and commitment.  Joining Jackie on the dancefloor were Ali Wood , Alex Cunningham , Zoe Keddie-Dixon , Becky Everett , Callum Mark , Carol Fish , Joyce Lukkes-Presley  and Nicola Collin , along with seven professional dancers.  Each pair had a dferent dance style \u0026ndash such as the jive, pasodoble, samba, cha cha cha, Bollywood and Irish dance \u0026ndash to learn. After each couple had performed their routine, the audience voted for their three favourites.  Alex Cunningham and his partner Leigh Morrison, who performed a fast-paced Bollywood routine, which brought a touch of India to the Corn Exchange and Ali Wood, along with his partner Heather Antonelli, who did a salsa show dance to the soundtrack from The Greatest Showman, were announced as finalists alongside Jackie and Jane.  The audience then voted for a second time and chose Jackie and Jane and their high-kicking Irish dance as their winner.  Jackie, 46, who lives in Haddington with her husband and three sons, said she entered the competition after having a childhood desire to be in Pan\u0026rsquos People!  Her dance partner Jane is a mum-of-four from Dunbar. As well as working as a post lady for Royal Mail, she teaches Irish dancing at the Aine Hay Academy of Irish Dance. She devised and choreographed the winning dance routine to the song The Irish Rover.  This is the 11th year a Strictly-themed competition has been organised for charity by Bett Morrison, from Gford.  Tibor Poc and Hilary Mouat, the Scottish amateur ballroom and Latin American champions, performed two Latin American demonstration dances, with the Aine Hay Irish Academy and Dunbar School of Dance also entertaining.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"nearly-30000-people-visit-the-va-dundee-in-its-first-week","story":"  Including the audience for the 3D festival, which signalled the opening of the museum, more than 50,000 people took part in the first week of the new \u0026pound80m museum.  Around 6,000 people attended the opening weekend of the Kengo Kuma-designed design museum, and from last Saturday to Friday, 27,201 people visited in total.  On the eve of the museum\u0026rsquos official opening 10,000 people gathered to enjoy headliners Primal Scream and a special light and sound installation, and on Saturday 15 September, the 3D Festival continued and was attended by another 12,600 people.  The plan for the museum expects that 500,000 people will visit in the first year, a number which will reduce to around 300,000 in the following years: so those far the attendance figures have got off to a good start.  The latter total would put it on a par with the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh or the People\u0027s Palace in Glasgow, according to figures from the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions.  V\u0026ampA Dundee, with an annual budget of \u0026pound4.5m, will stage large scale exhibitions from the V\u0026ampA in London as well as design museums from across the world.  It has a permanent and free Scottish Design Gallery, as well as a large exhibition space for paid-for shows, the first being Ocean Liners.  Philip Long, director of V\u0026ampA Dundee, said: \"V\u0026ampA Dundee officially opened its doors last Saturday and since then more than 27,000 people have explored this wonderful building and its fantastic galleries.  \"Kengo Kuma, the architect who designed V\u0026ampA Dundee, wanted the museum to become a new living room for the city and it\u0026rsquos been a joy to watch people from Dundee and further afield make themselves at home.  \"As well as museum visitors, we have also celebrated the opening of V\u0026ampA Dundee with the 22,600 people who joined us for the 3D Festival.\"  He added: \"It\u0026rsquos been a very busy week, and I\u0026rsquod like to thank everybody who has helped us celebrate this historic moment and all those who came to V\u0026ampA Dundee during our opening week.  \"We\u0026rsquore very much looking forward to welcoming even more visitors to the museum.\"  As well as the official visitors after its opening, last Friday, more than 2000 people had a \"sneak peek\" tour, including school children, teachers, those who had taken part in V\u0026ampA Dundee pre-opening learning projects and members of local community groups.  The two press preview days held in the lead up to the museum opening were attended by around 300 journalists from across the world.  V\u0026ampA Dundee is free to enter and is now open daily.  At the opening of the museum, Mr Long said that the expectations for visitors had been planned \"prudently\".  He added: \"What is very clear to us, is that this is a project that needs to work locally, it needs to work nationally, and we want to bring an international audience.  \"Within a 60 to 90 minute drive there are 750,000 people, and  you go beyond that, then it quickly goes over one million people.  \"There is a particular asset that we have - our relationship with the V\u0026ampA in Dundee.  \"That means we can continue to bring great exhibitions.

The shadow chancellor also\u0026nbspsuggested the rail industry could be renationalised within five years under a Labour government.  He told BBC Radio 4\u0026rsquos Today programme it would be \u0026ldquopossible to bring all franchises back under public control during a single term in office, amid reports he is planning a\u0026nbspPublic Ownership Unit within the Treasury to deal with renationalisations.  Labour has promised to put equality centre stage at its Women\u0026rsquos Conference, taking place on Saturday a day ahead of the main gathering in Liverpool.  Shadow women and equalities secretary Dawn Butler has unveiled plans to establish a standalone department for women and equalities with a minister at the Cabinet table in a future Labour government.  But the main conference is expected to be dominated by squabbles over Brexit and the future of the party.  More than 100 constituency parties and trade union branches have submitted bids for the referendum issue to be put to a vote in Liverpool.  And MPs and senior trade unionists are set to join a People\u0026rsquos Vote march in the city on Sunday.  So far Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has resisted such calls, preferring to press for a general election  \u0026ndash as many MPs expect \u0026ndash Theresa May is unable to get a Brexit deal through Parliament.  And Mr McDonnell signalled the party\u0026rsquos position in that event would be unchanged from last year\u0026rsquos snap election.  \u0026ldquoWe would be in the same situation there, where we would be saying we\u0026rsquore accepting that original vote, this is the sort of deal that we want, \u0026nbsphe told .  \u0026ldquoThe debate around the next manesto will go on, but I really worry about another referendum.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom desperately trying to avoid any rise of xenophobia that happened last time around, I\u0026rsquom desperately trying to avoid giving any opportunity to Ukip or the far right. I think there\u0026rsquos the real risk of that.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore not ruling out a people\u0026rsquos vote, but there\u0026rsquos a real risk, and I think people need to take that into account when we\u0026rsquore arguing for one.  Mr Corbyn hopes to use the conference, held under the slogan \u0026ldquoRebuilding Britain, for the many, not the few, to put behind him a dficult summer dominated by a bitter row over anti-Semitism.  But while the leadership aims to sht the focus on to expected high-profile policy announcements on issues like housing and business, Brexit and party infighting are likely to make the headlines.  The party\u0026rsquos National Executive Committee  will meet on Saturday to discuss changes to leadership election rules, which left-wing activists claim could keep supporters of Mr\u0026nbspCorbyn\u0026nbspoff the ballot.  At the same time, the activist group Momentum which helped propel Mr Corbyn to the leadership is pushing for another rule change which could make it easier to de-select sitting MPs.  It is likely to revive fears among critics of Mr Corbyn of a left-wing purge of the moderates \u0026ndash including some of his fiercest critics in the row over anti-Semitism.  At the Labour Women\u0026rsquos Conference, Ms Butler will say equality should no longer be considered an \u0026ldquoafterthought.  She will say: \u0026ldquoSo far we have seen seven dferent ministers for equality tagged on to four dferent departments and a budget that\u0026rsquos nearly been halved.  \u0026ldquoThis proves the Tories are not taking equalities seriously. By establishing a Department for Women and Equalities, Labour will ensure equalities is the common thread running through its government.  \u0026ldquoThe next Labour government will put equality centre stage.  She will also announce plans to introduce a requirement for all employers to have a domestic abuse policy and provide 10 days\u0026rsquo paid leave for victims,  Labour win power.  \u0026ldquoEmployers have a duty of care to employees experiencing domestic abuse and should put in place a range of workplace policies to help victims, Ms Butler is expected to say.  \u0026ldquoThis crucial time will allow women to leave their abusive partners safely, get the help, protection and support they need, knowing their livelihood is secure.  \u0026ldquoThese 10 days could literally help save the lives of those women.  And Ms Butler will call for a \u0026ldquolocalised approach to tackling domestic abuse, with a \u0026ldquonational oversight mechanism to set quality standards for refuge provision and support."},{"url":null,"title":"hundreds-of-peace-campaigners-stage-rally-at-nuclear-submarine-base","story":"  Around 600 demonstrators holding banners and waving CND flags and Saltires walked from the peace camp at Faslane in Argyll and Bute to the gates of HMNB Clyde, where the country\u0026rsquos nuclear submarines are based.

In 2017, the Wings Over Scotland blog - run by Stuart Campbell, who is popular among the crankier elements of the pro-independence community - tweeted an objectionable comment which mentioned gay Tory MP David Mundell.  Kezia Dugdale, at that point the leader of Scottish Labour, used her column in the Daily Record to accuse the blogger of \u0026ldquohomophobic tweets. Wings is suing the MSP for \u0026pound25,000 in damages.  CATCH UP: Labour MSPs urged to help Dugdale with legal costs  UK Labour agreed to meet her legal costs - over \u0026pound90,000 so far - and instructed lawyers to contest the action. Out of the blue, new party general secretary Jennie Formby is said to have changed her mind and Ms Dugdale has been abandoned. Scottish Labour members are furious.  It is hard to find anyone in the party who does not sympathise with Ms Dugdale, particularly given who is she up against. Fans of Bath-based Wings believe he exposes unionist untruths and calls out the so-called \"mainstream media\". He tries to take apart negative stories on the SNP and rarely criticises the Nationalist administration in Edinburgh.  The pro-Government blogger is, without doubt, Somerset\u0026rsquos most influential voice on Scottish politics and has raised over \u0026pound500,000 from his devotees. But he is loathed by opponents who believe he has lowered the tone of politics. For the average Scottish Labour activist, the court case is about more than the rights and wrongs of a tweet.  It is also true that Ms Dugdale, through her own actions, does not have much credit left in the Corbyn favour bank. She has positioned herself as a critic of the UK leader and has not been noticeably supportive of her successor, Richard Leonard. That Ms Formby felt able to cut her loose was telling.  Ms Dugdale is also regarded as self-centred. She may have misgivings about the Corbynista takeover of her party, but the only reason Mr Leonard is leader is because she bailed out after two years. Her former allies share the same view: she left her party, and her staff, in the lurch. The only thing she gave Labour was its worst ever election results.  Her post-leadership decisions have also irked colleagues. When at the helm, Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos party promised a crackdown on second jobs by MSPs. After her resignation, she jetted off to Australia to appear on a third-rate celebrity TV show, for which she was paid \u0026pound70,000. It is little wonder that some in the party believe she, not them, should pay her legal fees.  But internal party gripes should play no part in assessing the UK Labour decision, which even Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos critics believe is as unfathomable as it is unjust.  It is not just the shaky morality of withdrawing legal support half way through a court case that rankles with Labour members. Or the insensitive way it was carried out, which appears to confirm the perception of Scottish Labour as little more than a branch office. Or the certainty that Labour would bankroll Mr Corbyn\u0026rsquos costs  he ever faced a similar problem.  Imagine how this could play out. Ms Dugdale limps along, sustained by a patchwork of crowdfunded donations and hand outs from colleagues, and loses the case. She then has to pay damages and Wings\u0026rsquo legal fees. She could face bankruptcy.  Mr Campbell, who is never slow to wind up his Unionist opponents, would no doubt see it as a victory over Labour, not just Ms Dugdale. He would be emboldened and bullet proof. And all this would have been aided by the UK party.  If you are a Labour supporter, Dugdale on a bad day is surely better than Wings over Scotland on any day. If Leonard wants to assert his authority as leader, perhaps he should call Formby again and remind her of the meaning of solidarity."},{"url":null,"title":"first-ministers-advisers-blamed-for-her-caution-on-backing-final-brexit-referendum","story":"  The insider, speaking on condition of anonymity, said key members of Sturgeon\u0026rsquos top team were worried about the impact a new vote would have on another independence referendum.  Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie, who last week urged the SNP leader to back a \u0026ldquopeople\u0026rsquos vote on Brexit, said: \u0026ldquoHer special advisers seem to have a vice-like grip on the First Minister.  \"It would be wise for Nicola Sturgeon to talk to others and to open her mind to the best way of keeping our country in the EU.  Sturgeon has delayed revealing her intentions for a second independence referendum due to what she regards as a lack of detail on the UK\u0026rsquos future relationship with the EU.  The First Minister is expected to provide an update once a fuller picture emerges from the negotiations between Prime Minister Theresa May and EU representatives.  However, a number of senior SNP figures believe a second independence referendum will not occur before 2021 because May will refuse to sanction another vote. These figures want Sturgeon to instead throw her weight behind the cross-party campaign for a referendum on Brexit.  Senior nationalists believe backing this short-term move would put the SNP on the side of the majority of Scots, while also reaching out to Remainers who are hostile to independence.  Advocates of this approach also believe that, by shting her constitutional position in this way, Sturgeon would give herself breathing room on independence and space to reboot the case for independence.  It is understood Cabinet Secretary Michael Russell, as well as SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford, are open to another Brexit referendum, while Sturgeon herself is said to interested, but she has only offered qualied support.  A senior source close to the Government said the First Minister\u0026rsquos special advisers \u0026ndash the political appointees who work for ministers \u0026ndash are sceptical and Sturgeon is being \u0026ldquoheld back.  The insider said two of her most influential \u0026ldquospads \u0026ndash chief of staff Liz Lloyd and constitutional adviser Ewan Crawford \u0026ndash are not convinced by the policy.  Some doubters are said to be worried that backing another Brexit vote would create a precedent for a \u0026ldquodouble referendum on independence: one on the principle, and another on a final deal.  However, SNP supporters of another Brexit vote point to a recent report by the Constitution Unit which they believe should allay these concerns.  The report recommended that, in cases where a Government produced a White Paper outlining a change to be offered in a referendum, a further plebiscite would only be triggered  there was a \u0026ldquomaterial departure from the original prospectus.  Asked by Rennie last week about a final vote on Brexit, Sturgeon said: \u0026ldquoIf Willie Rennie wants me to be an enthusiastic advocate of such a vote, let him explain to me how it would guarantee that we will not simply find ourselves in the same position we found ourselves in June 2016, when Scotland voted to remain in the EU but the rest of the United Kingdom voted to leave.  \u0026ldquoIf he can explain right now how Scotland is guaranteed that it will not find itself in that position, I am happy to talk to him further about the matter.  She added: \u0026ldquoIf I am to get enthusiastically behind the campaign for another EU vote, surely it is not unreasonable to ask for a guarantee that Scotland would not find itself in that position all over again.  \u0026ldquoThe fact of the matter is that Willie Rennie and others campaigning for a people\u0026rsquos vote are unable to give that guarantee.  \u0026ldquoIf they are prepared to give such a guarantee, I am happy to get behind the campaign.  A spokesperson for the First Minister said: \u0026ldquoAs the First Minister has repeatedly made clear, the SNP will not stand in the way of a second EU referendum \u0026ndash but those advocating it need to explain how they would guarantee that we will not simply find ourselves in the same position we found ourselves in June 2016, when Scotland voted to remain in the EU but the rest of the United Kingdom voted to leave.  \u0026ldquoWe are open to discussions with the campaign on any suggestions they may have to address that flaw in their current proposals.\"  The spokesperson added: \u0026ldquoWith it now looking increasingly likely that the choice facing the UK will be between a no-deal Brexit or a blind Brexit, an extension to the Article 50 negotiation period must be on the table as the only way to avoid an economic clf edge \u0026ndash and allow all alternative options to be considered."},{"url":null,"title":"tribute-journey-to-saviour-of-the-flying-scotsman","story":"  The Flying Scotsman epitomises the golden age of steam, a remarkable combination of grace and power, the first locomotive to break the 100mph speed barrier and, precisely 90 years ago this year, the first to charge non-stop between London and Edinburgh.  That impressive city-to-city journey of 1928 would be revisited 50 years ago this year, in 1968, by the man who rescued her from the scrapyard a charismatic, mutton-chopped maverick who had fallen headfirst into a lelong love affair with Britain\u0026rsquos most famous locomotive when he was just four years old.  Alan Pegler \u0026ndash who called the Flying Scotsman his \u0026lsquoold girl\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash died in 2012. Having invested a fortune in the love of his le, he ended up bankrupt, his beautul machine tottering once again on the brink of being smashed to pieces, only this time in America.  Of course, the story would have a happy ending \u0026ndash today the Flying Scotsman is a national treasure.  And soon, this spectacular coal-powered titan of the train tracks will set off on another remarkable journey, one that bring Pegler\u0026rsquos love affair with her to a conclusion and pay the greatest of respects to the man whose lelong devotion helped save her for generations to come.  On Saturday, October 13, the Flying Scotsman will set off from London Kings Cross bound for York, with hundreds of passengers who have paid between \u0026pound150 and \u0026pound330 for the  journey.  Moments after she has conquered the steep incline of Stoke Bank near Grantham, in Lincolinshire, just at the point where in 1934 she hit 100mph and made history, Pegler\u0026rsquos ashes will be respectfully tipped into the engine\u0026rsquos firebox.  Saviour and the queen of steam will become one \u0026ndash just as he wanted.  It will be a poignant and fitting tribute to a remarkable man whose passion for the elegant lines and powerful heart of the Sir Nigel Gresley designed Pacic LNER A-3 class locomotive ensured one of the world\u0026rsquos best-known steam engines would not be allowed to die.  Pegler first set eyes on her at the British Empire Exhibition in 1924, when he was a wide-eyed boy. Apple green, 70ft long and weighing 97 tonnes, her curves and imposing presence made an impression that lasted his entire le.  \u0026ldquoHe loved the Flying Scotsman, says his daughter Penny. \u0026ldquoShe was standing there, gleaming and beautully clean. He was lted up to the cab this tiny little child and this wonderful engine.  \u0026ldquoThat was the spark.  Built in Doncaster two years earlier at a cost of under \u0026pound8000, she ploughed the line between Edinburgh Waverley and London King\u0026rsquos Cross that was first established in 1862 as the \u0026lsquoSpecial Scotch Express\u0026rsquo route.  Already a crowd-pleaser thanks to Gresley\u0026rsquos genius design, the Flying Scotsman entered the record books in May 1928 when a new type of tender fitted with a corridor allowed a replacement crew to take over without having to stop \u0026ndash enabling the first ever non-stop London to Edinburgh service.  Six years later she clocked 100mph. Never mind that No.3440 City of Truro probably did it before her, the Flying Scotsman\u0026rsquos run was official.  A string of shrewd marketing ideas placed her at the cutting edge of technology. In 1929 she starred in British cinema\u0026rsquos first talkie called, naturally, The Flying Scotsman.  In 1932 her crew spoke by telephone to the pilot of an Imperial Airways Heracles as it flew overhead, plane and locomotive powering north at 90 mph.  And the following year she raced along a two-mile track beside the river Ouse in Cambridgeshire, as a speedboat and plane attempted to outrun her. Naturally, she won.  She became a World War Two workhorse, her livery painted matt black in defiance of the Nazi threat.  But by 1963 and with diesel now replacing steam power, she was deemed surplus to requirements.  Pegler, a Nottinghamshire-born war-time bomber pilot and heir to an industrial fortune, was among the many who felt she deserved to be saved.  And a conversation in Leith, Edinburgh would give him the push to do it.  \u0026ldquoThe Flying Scotsman was a bit of a faded star by this time, says Bob Gwynne, associate curator at the National Railway Museum in York. \u0026ldquoAnd she wasn\u0026rsquot on the list of engines which the state wanted to preserve.  \u0026ldquoRamsay Ferguson, joint secretary of the Save our Steam group and Gressley A3 Preservation Society was living in Edinburgh, and met Pegler at Trinity House in Leith.  \u0026ldquoHe wanted to save her, and must have told him that they didn\u0026rsquot have the money to buy the Flying Scotsman. But, of course, he did.  Pegler, who had already saved the doomed Ffestiniog Railways in Wales \u0026ndash now a major tourist attraction \u0026ndash spent \u0026pound3000 to buy the locomotive he\u0026rsquod loved since a boy, then ploughed in thousands more for restoration work.  Proud of his new toy, he organised a patriotic tour of the United States to show her off which included a Sir Winston Churchill lookalike, tartan miniskirt clad models and actors dressed in Shakespearean garb. It boosted the locomotive\u0026rsquos profile even further and celebrated British engineering at a time when America was sending men to the moon.  It was such a success, that despite no longer having UK government support, Pegler decided to stage a second tour.  \u0026ldquoIt was like the best gap year, recalls Penny, who was 17 at the time, and joined the Flying Scotsman as she powered through the Rockies, from eastern Canada to San Francisco. \u0026ldquoHe was having a great time.  But it was expensive fun. And by the time they reached Calornia, her father was bankrupt. Cleverly, he arranged for the Flying Scotsman to be stored within a US Army compound, guaranteeing creditors couldn\u0026rsquot claim her for scrap.  Pegler\u0026rsquos grand affair was heading for orce. Back in the UK, Scots construction firm boss Sir William McAlpine stepped in with \u0026pound25,000 to save her for a second time, and shipped her home via the Panama Canal.  Penny recalls crowds gathering to cheer her on as she arrived in Liverpool and steamed her way to Derby, just a few scratches to her famous livery to show for her trauma.  But by the early 2000s, she again required major attention. Sir William had teamed up with fellow steam enthusiast and record producer Pete Waterman, but costs spiralled and she was sold for \u0026pound1.5m to Derbyshire businessman and scientist Tony Marchington.  His plans to create a Flying Scotsman Village in Edinburgh, met with a giant \u0026lsquothumbs down\u0026rsquo from councillors and his finances took a hit. With her again fate in the balance, a National Lottery grant and donation from Sir Richard Branson saved her for the nation.  As for her saviour Pegler, four times married and his fortune blown on his love of steam, he performed songs and talks for his passage back from America and went on to work on the Orient Express and InterCity\u0027s land cruises. He was made an OBE in 2006, and died six years later, aged 91.  Next month\u0026rsquos Alan Pegler Farewell outing will see his family join steam enthusiasts in plush carriages pulled by the locomotive he adored, for a final journey which he meticulously planned \u0026ndash even down to the exact spot at which his ashes are to become one with his beloved \u0026lsquoold girl\u0026rsquo.  The ups and downs of pursuing his great love held no regrets, recalls Penny. \u0026ldquoIt was a dream for him.  \u0026ldquoTo really live your dreams is a wonderful thing, she says. \u0026ldquoSo many of us have dreams but do nothing about it, my dad did.  Adds Gwynne: \u0026ldquoHe was effectively seduced by this engine and by the experiences he was having.  \u0026ldquoHe had the time of his le."},{"url":null,"title":"how-jfks-speech-in-the-beresford-in-glasgow-delayed-the-us-involvement-in-wwii","story":"  But when John F Kennedy got up to speak, it wasn\u0027t within the ivy-clad walls of Hard, or a community hall in Massachusetts, but the ballroom of a hotel in Glasgow.

It was 79 years ago this month that the young Kennedy, then aged 22, made his way to Scotland at the behest of his father, Joseph Kennedy, then the US Ambassador to Great Britain.  War had just broken out with Nazi Germany, and the young Kennedy was dispatched on a special diplomatic mission to ensure there was no fallout after a U-boat torpedoed the Govan-built passenger liner Athenia as it sailed Glasgow to Montreal on 3 September 1939.

Ambassador Joseph Kennedy, an American isolationist, was determined this would not happen and sent his son to turn on the charm and sooth the nerves of traumatised survivors who had been brought to the Art Deco Beresford Hotel in Glasgow\u0027s Sauchiehall Street as part of the relief effort..  Phillips O\u0027Brien, Professor of Strategic Studies at St Andrews University said: \"The Athenia was one of the first ships sunk at the outbreak of the war and the shock would have been immense.  \"It was very early on, during the phoney war, and Joseph Kennedy, the American ambassador, would have wanted to act quickly to show to the US citizens caught up in the sinking that their government was looking out for them.  \"Joseph Kennedy was a colourful character and was isolationist towards American involvement in the war. He wanted to act quickly to make things were smoothed over.\"  Many of the 1400 Athenia passengers, which included hundreds of women and children, were rescued from the sea off Northern Ireland.  Patrick Dollan, Glasgow\u0027s Lord Provost at the time organised the relief effort personally and even launched a special fund for the survivors, which raised more than \u0026pound3500.  In a telegram to the US President Franklin D Roosevelt sent on 5 September, he assured that \"Glasgow will look after American and other survivors of [the] Athenia disaster who have arrived in our city.\"  This prompted President Roosevelt to write to Provost Dollan in response on 11 September, saying: \"I wish you to know how deeply I and the American people appreciate the efficient, generous and humane manner in which Glasgow and its citizens came to the help of our fellow countrymen and women in their need.  \"I express to you my heartfelt thanks and assure you that Glasgow\u0027s gesture will not be forgotten.\"  When the young JFK arrived in Scotland, he also quickly showed his appreciation of Provost Dollan\u0027s efforts, accompanying him to a meeting in the City Chambers and visiting survivors in hospital.  Kennedy said at the time: \u0026ldquoI have never seen people more grateful for all that has been done for them by Glasgow than those to whom I have spoken today.  \u0026ldquoI have told Lord Provost Dollan that it is the desire of the American government to undertake complete responsibility for the care of our nationals but he has insisted that Glasgow regards it as its privilege to undertake this responsibility. That is a very generous gesture indeed and it will be fully appreciated by my countrymen.  \u0026ldquoI will go back and tell my father how kind you have been to our people.  But when Kennedy was taken to the the Beresford Hotel to meet with around 150 American survivors, some of them wounded, the mood turned ugly.  Demands were made for protection from the US navy for any further crossings of the Atlantic, with many people fearing further German attacks.  A newspaper report from 8 September said: \u0026ldquoSeveral women shouted \u0026ldquoWe must have a convoy, we are not going in a small freighter without a convoy. You can\u0026rsquot trust the Germans now\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoWe want an armed escort,\u0026rsquo shouted another woman who had a bandage around her head. Mr Kennedy, obviously taken aback by the display of feeling in the meeting said he would report to his father on a suggestion of a convoy,  There was also said to be anger at the arrival of the ambassador\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash dubbed the \u0026ldquoschoolboy diplomat \u0026ndash whose fresh-faced looks made him seem even younger and more inexperienced than his 22 years.  But he was able to remain calm and reassured them that they would be safe and ultimately persuading them to travel.  With the crowd mollied and less likely to voice their outrage over the attack when they ed home, the sinking of the Athenia did not prove to be the catalyst which drove the US to war.  Conversely, it was to prove a rallying cry in Canada, which also lost a number of its citizens, spurring many men to enlist.  Among the casualties of the sinking was 10-year-old Canadian girl Margaret Hayworth, whose fate was widely covered by the newspapers, setting their tone for the rest of the war. One thousand people met the train that brought her body back to Hamilton, Ontario.  However, the truth about the sinking was obscured in Germany, where Hitler decided to dampen down publicity to avoid stoking American outrage.  Officially, it was denied that the Athenia had been torpedoed by a German U-Boat, and records were altered to cover up the incident with the truth only emerging during the Nuremberg trials.  JFK ed to Hard and would later enlist in the US Navy, serving on a torpedo boat in the Pacic.  He was injured when the boat was rammed and sunk by a Japanese destroyer, and had to survive for several days behind enemy lines.  After the war he became active in politics, entering the House of Representatives in 1947 and advancing to the US Senate in 1953. He was elected President in 1961, and assassinated two years later in Texas.  The Beresford Hotel, which opened in 1938, was turned into an office block after the war, and later bought by the University of Strathclyde for student accommodation in 1964, renaming it Baird Hall.  It was sold in 2003 and work began on its re-conversion into private apartments.  Prof O\u0027Brien, said that the JFK\u0027s trip there would have been part of his father\u0027s efforts to limit the damage to America\u0027s interests caused by the sinking of the Athenia, giving the young JFK an introduction to the world of poltical spin.  He said: \"John Kennedy - JFK - was the second son and it was his older brother Joe who was being groomed to be president. But Joe died during the war undertaking a very dangerous bombing mission, and John was next in line.  \"Their father was politically driven to his finger tips and wanted to get someone up to Glasgow to ensure there was no bad press and that the American government came out of it ok.  \"As John was in London at the time, he would have been used to make the diplomatic point that the US government was on top of things.\""},{"url":null,"title":"why-google-is-a-modern-mans-god","story":"  THE REPUBLIC OF GOOGLE  LARRY Page wants to live forever. Such an ambition should come as no surprise.  This is the man, after all, who, aged just 23, woke up from a dream that he could \"download the whole web\" and then went on to found Google, a company which celebrates its 20th birthday this week and is seen by many as more of a modern-day god than a corporation.  Jonathan Taplin, author of Move Fast And Break Things, a book which charts the power of the world\u0026rsquos biggest tech giants, including Google, says Page is truly in \u0026ldquopursuit of everlasting le.  Taplin adds: \u0026ldquoObviously the treatment would be extremely expensive and only available for the very rich. For the whole of history, the less well-off have at least comforted themselves with the thought that death was even handed \u0026ndash even John D Rockefeller was not going to be able to buy off the Grim Reaper.  Aside from extending the span of human existence, Page\u0026rsquos other dreams are pretty god-like too: one of his goals is to develop a miniature smartphone that hooks directly into your brain, another is to mine asteroids, and a third is to create flying cars \u0026ndash he\u0026rsquos already invested hundreds of millions in the idea.  His biggest dream, however, might give more pause for thought than such sci-fi fantasies, because Page also wants to change the very nature of democracy and government.  Balaji Srinivasan, a powerful venture capitalist following in Page\u0026rsquos slipstream, has spoken gleefully of Silicon Valley \u0026ndash where the giant tech companies are based in Calornia \u0026ndash outstripping Washington when it comes to raw power.  \u0026ldquoWe want to show what a society run by Silicon Valley would look like, Srinivasan is quoted as saying in Taplin\u0026rsquos book. \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos where \u0026lsquoexit\u0026rsquo comes in \u0026hellip It basically means building an opt-in society, ultimately outside the US, run by technology \u0026hellip Larry Page, for example, wants to set aside a part of the world for unregulated experimentation.  Some think this vision means Google, and corporations like it, becoming effective nations with their own laws. Page, according to Taplin, \u0026ldquohas financed extensive research on privately owned city-states.  Page, then, is a man who wants to build his own nation \u0026hellip and live forever. What kind of man has these dreams? Well, one unhindered by wealth for a start. He\u0026rsquos one of the richest people on Earth with a net-worth of 56 billion \u0026ndash and his company is so cash-rich it literally can\u0026rsquot spend the money it makes.  He and his we  have a 7 million compound at Palo Alto in the Valley, as well as an eco-mansion.  Page also owns Senses \u0026ndash a 194ft super yacht capable of deep sea exploration, complete with helipad.  But what lies under the wealth? The answer is \"a Burner\". Burners are devotees of the Burning Man festival in Nevada. The weekender is the very definition of radical chic \u0026ndash libertarian hippiedom that turns its back on the conventions and values of the rest of society.  Page and his fellow Google co-founder Sergey Brin both identy as avid Burners. The first-ever Google Doodle \u0026ndash the animation on Google\u0026rsquos homepage celebrating special events \u0026ndash was created as an \"out of office\" to let the world know the two were off to Burning Man.  But these two Burners, it\u0026rsquos been said, need a lot of \u0026ldquoadult supervision. Court documents relating to a lawsuit over the pair\u0026rsquos Boeing 767 corporate jet \u0026ndash fitted with hammocks and a cocktail bar and known as \"the party plane\" \u0026ndash reveal that the pair lost it with each other over what type of bed should go in it. Google CEO Eric Schmidt \u0026ndash appointed by Page and Brin because he too is a Burner \u0026ndash had to step in.  \u0026ldquoSergey, you can have whatever bed you want in your room Larry, you can have whatever kind of bed you want in your bedroom. Let\u0026rsquos move on, Schmidt told the pair. Page, Brin and Schmidt have eight private jets between them, incidentally.  Bow down and worship  GOOGLE has already changed the world \u0026ndash and your le with it. Professor Scott Galloway of New York University\u0026rsquos business school, a serial tech entrepreneur and author of The Four: The Hidden DNA Of Amazon, Apple, Facebook And Google, says: \u0026ldquoGoogle is modern man\u0026rsquos god \u0026hellip About one in six queries posed to the search engine have never been asked before. What rabbi, priest, scholar or coach has so much gravitas?  The prayers of the world are being uttered up to Google \u0026ndash then scraped for data and sold on to ad agencies, making the company not just one of the most powerful and richest corporations ever seen on Earth, but an organisation which knows you probably better than you know yourself.  It certainly knows you better than your partner, or parents, or children \u0026ndash would you tell them the things you tell Google? Would you let them see all your searches? Your fears and secrets, your darkest and most vulnerable thoughts?  In fact, some speculate Google might soon be able to guess your thoughts before you think them. Galloway calls this \"precog\" \u0026ndash for precognition. \u0026ldquoThis will come, he says, \u0026ldquowhen a thin layer of AI [articial intelligence] on top of search queries and a few other data streams, including our movements, are used effectively to predict crime, disease and stock prices.  Think of what Google knows about you \u0026ndash it knows your location, your search history, your email, your interests, your friends and family. \u0026ldquoThe temptation to create predictive links between intention and action will be irresistible to governments, hackers and rogue employers, says Galloway.  The creepy line  NATIONAL Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden horried the world when he revealed the NSA was spying on citizens. It later turned out Google, Apple and Facebook had given spooks access to their worldwide networks. Cue outrage.  The anger is ironic, though, for as Taplin points out: \u0026ldquoThe average citizen has voluntarily  turned over to Google and Facebook far more personal information than the government will ever have.  Google\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoprimary business, Taplin says, is \u0026ldquosurveillance marketing \u0026ndash selling our personal information to advertisers for billions of dollars.  The company\u0027s Schmidt once said that it was company policy to \u0026ldquoget right up to the creepy line and not cross it.  In 2014, a study by psychologists at the American Institute for Behavioural Research looked at how Google search rankings for political candidates influence voters. The researchers estimated that \u0026ldquoGoogle could determine the outcome of upwards of 25 per cent of all national elections.  Schmidt once commented: \u0026ldquoWe don\u0026rsquot need you to type at all. We know where you are are. We know where you\u0026rsquove been. We can more or less know what you\u0026rsquore thinking about.  What was it he was saying about crossing the \"creepy line\"?  The new robber barons  PEOPLE think of Google as a search engine company \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos not, it\u0026rsquos a media company. It makes its money selling ads and crushing the opposition.  Apart from state-run broadcasters like the BBC, nearly all other forms of media on the planet depend on ad revenue. Newspapers need ads to hire journalists and print papers, TV stations need ads to make shows and hire staff.  Google took the output of these \"old media\" companies and plundered it \u0026ndash which is why many critics call the Big Tech giants \u0026ldquothe new robber barons.  Who makes more money from a newspaper story online \u0026ndash the newspaper or Google? The answer is Google. Prof Scott Galloway, who was on the board of the New York Times, says that Google and Facebook do a \u0026ldquobetter job extracting value from Times journalists than the management of the Times.  Google destroys old media, says Galloway. \u0026ldquoGoogle not only was crawling content for free, it was also slicing and dicing that content for its users. When people were looking for a hotel in Paris, for example, Google would link to a New York Times travel article on Paris.  \u0026ldquoBut at the top of the page it would place Google\u0026rsquos own ad for the Four Seasons Hotel \u0026hellip Google was also learning \u0026ndash better than the Times itself \u0026ndash exactly what the paper\u0026rsquos readers wanted and were likely to want in the future.  And that meant Google could target those Times readers with far greater precision and make more money from each ad. As much as 10 times more. That meant we were exchanging dollars for dimes.  The parable of the New York Times and Google is replicated across the media. Google cannibalises the old media and monetises it \u0026ndash leaving empty newsrooms and creaking TV stations behind it. This is all before we come to what Google does to art and culture.  Think of YouTube, owned by Google, and all those free movies and documentaries and songs up there \u0026ndash do you think many of the actors or singers or directors get a penny from that? Without culture being paid for there will be no culture.  Giant Monopoly  ITS power has made Google an effective \"public utility\", Galloway says \u0026ndash like the water system or the road network or the electrical grid. It\u0026rsquos also a monopoly, but only Europe has taken this seriously, accusing the company of unfair advantage \u0026ndash perhaps, understandably, given that Google has a 90 per cent share of all EU searches.  Globally, Google has a 92 per cent share of the market, worth 92.4bn. Internet searching on Google is now a bigger business than paper and forestry , construction and engineering , real estate  and gas .  \u0026ldquoHow would we feel  one company controlled 92 per cent of the global construction and engineering trade? Galloway asks. \u0026ldquoWould we worry that their power and influence had breached the reasonable threshold or would we just think they were awesome innovators as we do with Google?  YouTube, owned by Google, uploads 400 hours of video every minute, giving it more video content than any other company on Earth. \u0026ldquoIt also controls the operating system on two billion Android devices, says Galloway.  When the EU finally caught up with Google and fined it 2.7bn for anti-competitive practices, the penalty amounted to just \u0026ldquothree per cent of its cash on hand, says Galloway. Part of Google\u0026rsquos power lies in the fact that it is a \u0026ldquoBenjamin Button company \u0026ndash the more you drive your car, the less valuable it becomes, but with Google, the more people use it the more valuable it becomes, because the more data it has gathered to be sold.  That power breeds power. With Google and Facebook controlling 51 per cent of the global mobile ad spend, few can dare to not do business with them \u0026ndash even though trust in the companies has been shattered by tax avoidance and the spreading of fake news.  \u0026ldquoAdvertisers have just two platforms to market their products online, says Galloway. Advertisers need Google and Facebook more than the tech giants need them. Galloway says  Ford decided it was so concerned about fake news that it pulled advertising the company \u0026ldquowould be commended for their actions in the media, and the market would promptly cut 10 per cent off their share price.  Google versus you  BIG Tech is also ganging up on consumers. Galloway says we should think of Google as like the shop window of a huge department store on Christmas Eve \u0026ndash only it\u0026rsquos the size of Everest.  \u0026ldquoAnyone can purchase a place in that window and land at the top of Google search, he says. \u0026ldquoWhen someone types \u0026lsquoStar Wars action figures\u0026rsquo, the retailer that has bid the most is going to top the paid listings. Amazon regularly buys that number one spot, because it has the money to do so.  The game is being played \u0026ldquoby a dferent set of rules and with a dferent deck of cards. Not only does Google destroy jobs, crush culture, and avoid taxes \u0026ndash but they\u0026rsquove been weaponised by some of the most dangerous people on Earth. Russian military intelligence has used the big media platforms online to disrupt Western democracies.  Google\u0026rsquos AdSense system \u0026ndash which pays per click \u0026ndash \u0026ldquoprovided much of the revenue to Eastern European teams that were flooding the web with fake news, says Taplin. In November 2017, the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Richard Burr begged Google, Facebook and Twitter, saying: \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot let nation-states disrupt our future. You\u0026rsquore the frontline of defence for it.  Tech-watchers like Galloway have nothing but scorn for such special pleading. \u0026ldquoThey should be our frontline against our enemies? Yeah, f*** that.  Fightback  THERE is a bubbling current of anger now growing against Google. So is it time to do what has been done to monopolies in the past and break up Google?  \u0026ldquoThe last 10 years, says Taplin, \u0026ldquohave seen the wholesale destruction of the creative economy \u0026ndash journalists, musicians, authors and film-makers \u0026ndash wrought by three tech monopolies, Google, Facebook and Amazon. Their dominance in Articial Intelligence will extend this \u0026lsquocreative destruction\u0026rsquo to much of the service industry, including transportation, medicine and retail.  As a final warning, he adds: \u0026ldquoWhen the flood of unemployment brought about by the AI revolution is upon us, we will not be ready.

Mark Hogarth, 42, textile designer  Why? He is the Harris Tweed guru  When, earlier this year, Scotland was rebranded for the world, in the \u0026pound6 million Scotland Is Now campaign, it included a short film with Mark Hogarth, creative director of Harris Tweed Hebrides. There is good reason for this, for the former male model, who grew up on a dairy farm in Ardrossan, is widely credited with having made Harris Tweed cool again. Ten years ago, the company of which he is creative director took over a derelict mill at Shawbost, Harris. Now Harris Tweed Hebrides has an annual turnover of \u0026pound10million and employs 250 mill-workers and weavers. These days Harris Tweed has a host of celebrity fans, from Gwyneth Paltrow through to Madonna. Hogarth is at the heart of an incredible revival story. In his Scotland Is Now film, Hogarth observes, \u0026ldquoFor me the key word is pioneering \u0026ndash because the word fashion is almost synonymous with the word \u0026lsquonew\u0026rsquo. You\u0026rsquove got to captivate what is new, but not at the expense of your own tradition.  19. Mary Moriarty, 79, former pub landlady  Why? She\u0026rsquos a legend  At nearly 80 years old \u0026ndash her birthday, which she shares with her twin, is just around the corner \u0026ndash Mary Moriarty, former landlady of the Port O\u0026rsquo Leith, is still one of the coolest, most glamorous people you\u0026rsquore likely to come across in increasingly hipsterised Leith. She even has an entry on the Advanced Style website, a blog-appreciation of the fashion sense of older women by New Yorker Ari Seth Cohen. But, more crucially, she is also one of those local legends who is always out there doing her bit for the community, whether it\u0026rsquos putting her energies into the Leith Festival, or hands-on picking up litter in the park whenever there\u0026rsquos a big event. The Port O\u0026rsquo Leith, when she ran it, was one of Scotland\u0026rsquos most iconic boozers \u0026ndash a place where the clientele used to dance on the bar and it felt as  almost anything might happen. Formerly frequented by sailors, who gave it its nautical d\u0026eacutecor, it had working-class edginess. A year or so ago it refurbished and gone the way of most hipster pubs \u0026ndash but Moriarty still pops in very occasionally, for some of the old regulars are still there.  18. Mido Soliman, 42, drinks industry entrepreneur  Why? He\u0026rsquos bringing back the old-fashioned pub, with new-fangled drinks  Pubs can change an area. They can make a community. Mido Soliman had been living and working in Kinning Park for a while when he heard that the Old Toll bar was closing down. \u0026ldquoI went down to see it, he says, \u0026ldquoand it was like walking into a time machine. Beautul. It was an old pub that had just been misused. There were lots of screens and plasma screens. Soliman had long had a love of old pubs. He had grown up in West London, Ladbroke Grove, and as a child he\u0026rsquod always loved the magic of Victorian bars. \u0026ldquoIt always looked like there was a lot of fun and laughter and joyous times coming from inside. So that was what he tried to recreate. He stripped back the d\u0026eacutecor and turned it, as he puts it, into \u0026ldquoa pub that\u0026rsquos part of the community. No screens, no fruit machines, just craft beers, great drinks and knowledgeable bartenders. What brought him to Glasgow in the first place? \u0026ldquoA girl I was dating many years ago. She was from Scotland and moving back up. I thought it was a good opportunity. That relationship didn\u0026rsquot last too long but Glasgow was such a dynamic, cosmopolitan place I thought I\u0026rsquod stay. I love the city, I love the people. And now it\u0026rsquos home.  17. Karen Gillan, 30, Actor  Why? Because she\u0026rsquos putting the sass into superhero movies  You could argue that Gerard Butler is Scotland\u0026rsquos biggest Hollywood star these days. And I guess  you like meathead melodrama  that\u0026rsquos fine. But really, the clever money is on Karen Gillan these days.  She\u0026rsquos already got two  of the Galaxy movies and one Avengers movie on her Imdb listing  and she\u0026rsquos working on a sequel to Jumanji in which she will hopefully once again have the chance to show off her comic chops.  Fact is, ever since she turned up as Amy Pond in Doctor Who, dressed in a short skirt and a fancy dress version of a police unorm, Gillan has been a red-haired tonic smart, funny, ambitious and not embarrassed to be.  She\u0026rsquos conquered British TV, carved out a career for herself in the United States and even turned her hand to directing .  Now all she needs a modern-day Nora Ephron to realise that she is clearly a Meg Ryan or Julia Roberts in waiting.  16. Phil MacHugh, 31, PR guru  Why? If there\u0026rsquos a cool party he\u0026rsquos probably there \u0026ndash or running it.  MacHugh is the PR behind some of the most current brands, hotels and restaurants. If there\u0026rsquos a swanky party or opening event happening, he\u0026rsquoll probably be there, possibly dressed in a dapper pink suit and with a hairdo that looks as  it was created under zero gravity conditions. He\u0026rsquos there on the front row at many a Paris or London fashion week show. Among the many big bashes this \u0026ldquoMan about Town \u0026ndash as his column in The Scottish Sun is titled \u0026ndash has been to, was Pharrell Williams\u0026rsquo 40th birthday, where, MacHugh recalls, \u0026ldquoHe had Alicia Keys pop out a cake and sing him Happy Birthday.  But MacHugh isn\u0026rsquot just about the style and the partying \u0026ndash he\u0026rsquos a television presenter and Gaelic speaker, who values his cultural heritage and believes that is cool. In the run up to the Independence referendum, he was a PR and events manager for the Yes campaign. Glasgow-raised and from a Barra family, he\u0026rsquos even a nty Highland dancer, and counts Simple Mind\u0026rsquos Mick MacNeil as a relative. What next for the PR? His agency, SKAPA, is, he says about to bring a new hotel brand to Scotland \u0026ndash Moxy hotels. Big parties are promised, naturally.  15. Kimberly Benson, 27, wrestler  Why? She rocks the wrestling ring.  You only have to watch footage of Kimberly Benson slamming an opponent to the floor to know she is on this cool list. Known by her stage name, Viper, \u0026ldquothe vixen of violence, she\u0026rsquos a star of World Of Sport wrestling and pioneer female in her sport. Benson is big in Japan, where she has a huge following, and was the first Scottish wrestler to main-event the famous Korakuen Hall. She has even been the subject of a BBC documentary, Fight Like A Girl, and is one of the key stars lined-up for World of Sport\u0026rsquos much-anticipated live tour of the UK starting in January next year.  She\u0026rsquos a charismatic, pantomime figure who swaggers across the ring in her trademark costume of leotard and fishnet tights. Part of the appeal of wrestling is, she says, \u0026ldquothe rebellion of it all. \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always been one of those punk-rock kids that just wanted to cheat the system in some ways. I love watching larger than le characters rebel against conformity. That\u0026rsquos why she chose the name Viper, in tribute to Stone Cold Steve Austin, the Texas Rattlesnake, one of the biggest wrestling rebels of them all.  Benson\u0026rsquos le mainly revolves around her sport, though she does still work in her father\u0026rsquos coach business in Ayrshire. As well as wrestling opponents, she has also fought off, and floored, stigma around her body shape. \u0026ldquoPeople, she has said, \u0026ldquowrote me off because of my size and what I look like and thought I was some stupid, blonde girl who was never going to amount to anything.  14. John Byrne, 78, artist and playwright  Why? You don\u0026rsquot get more dapper.  Earlier this year, when John Byrne, was named Scotland\u0026rsquos most stylish man, the artist and playwright\u0026rsquos response, it seems, was astonishment. \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom surprised I\u0026rsquove lived to the age of 78, never mind being a trend-setter, he said. \u0026ldquo\u0026ldquoHalf the time I dress like a tramp. There\u0026rsquos a lot of days where I go out to the post office and I just throw anything on. I\u0026rsquom often a sight so folk steer clear of me, holding their nose.\u0026rsquo. Somehow this comment just made the artist seem even cooler. For, in his Tweed suits, cravats and brogues he has a dapper elegance. In fact, no matter what Byrne says or does, he\u0026rsquoll always be an icon of sorts. Part of it is his art, part of it his personal style, and some of it is the way he has lived his le. Byrne isn\u0026rsquot afraid to do or talk about things that are shocking to some. His marriage to Tilda Swinton, with whom he had two children, was unconventional. Recently, he revealed, he understood that he was the child of an incestuous relationship between his mother and his grandfather.  13. Hayley Scanlan, 35, fashion designer  If there\u0026rsquos one designer in Scotland who is really making a mark on pop music and popular culture it\u0026rsquos Dundee\u0026rsquos Hayley Scanlan. Her designs are so of-the-moment, that they are frequently copied by fast fashion stores \u0026ndash and what makes her all the more cool is that Scanlan is not having it. Frequently she calls them out. \u0026ldquoI just think they\u0026rsquore so brazen about it, she says. \u0026ldquoIt happens so much now and it\u0026rsquos like the norm. You\u0026rsquove got to accept it, which is not right. Why not call it out?  Twice-winner of Young Designer of the Year, Scanlan is the go-to vision for many a band \u0026ndash from Little Mix through to Jessie J. Her big influences also come from the music she grew up with: Debbie Harry, Madonna and Michael Jackson. \u0026ldquoMy aunties and my mum and dad all played the Thriller album, she recalls. \u0026ldquoI remember I used to have a Michael Jackson doll and I always used to point to the TV and say he\u0026rsquos my boyfriend.  Impressively, she managed to star up her own business round the time of the birth of her twin sons. \u0026ldquoThey were six months old and it was a bit wild and I don\u0026rsquot actually know how I\u0026rsquove managed to do it. I became a single mum, so I kind of had no choice but to work. Right now, she says, she\u0026rsquos working on a top-secret project, creating designs for a band whose name she will not ulge. She is also working on \u0026ldquoa project involving bagpipes. The coolest thing she\u0026rsquos ever done? \u0026ldquoMaking clothes for the Little Mix video last year. Even my sons think it\u0026rsquos cool because they\u0026rsquore at school and all the little girls are like Little Mix obsessed.  12. Andy Murray, 31, social media star  Why? He\u0026rsquos a master of the Instagram volley  Who cares  it\u0026rsquos not a big winning, or even playing, year for our Andy \u0026ndash he\u0026rsquos done enough of that to give him cool points to last a letime. Right now what makes him cool is not the tennis, but the social media entertainment he\u0026rsquos bringing us. It\u0026rsquos tweets like the one he did last autumn, parodying Donald Trump\u0026rsquos tweet about Time Magazine person of the year. It\u0026rsquos his banter with rival Nick Kyrgios. It\u0026rsquos pictures like the one he posted of his nose bloodied by a run in with his daughter. It\u0026rsquos the surreal Instagram Q\u0026ampA he did earlier in the year. Game, set and Instagram match to Murray.  11. Nikita Scott, 31, surfer and environmentalist  Why? She\u0026rsquos an eco-warrior of the waves  The best campaigners for the ocean are those who know it well \u0026ndash surfers, yachters, ers. One of them is Nikita Scott, born and raised in Tillicoultry, now resident in New York, where she heads up the city\u0026rsquos chapter of the eco-warrior organisation, Surfrider. Not only she leading a fight against the Donald Trump administration\u0026rsquos plans to expand off-shore drilling, but she already has one campaign success under her belt. She and her chapter fought a successful two-year campaign to stop the building of a liquefied gas port off Long Island.  Scott has been surfing since she was in her third year at the University of Glasgow and she decided to try a new club, found herself on a trip to Tiree, and was hooked. For her, part of the attraction, was \u0026ldquobeing in touch with the ocean \u0026ndash there\u0026rsquos a connection to nature that I don\u0026rsquot really get in any other situation.  What really ignited her environmental conscience, though, was some of the things she saw when she spend a year, post-university, travelling the world, working and seeking out that perfect wave. One of those things was the destruction already well under way of the Great Barrier Reef, and the other was the waves of plastic she saw when she was in Bali. The best wave she\u0026rsquos ever ridden? \u0026ldquoOne in Portugal \u0026ndash it was incredible.  10. Connor Newall  Connor Newall, 19, model  The features of Govan model Connor Newall, angular, low-browed and chiselled, have graced many a high-profile fashion campaign and magazine cover. They were there on the big Tom Ford 2018 summer campaign, and there too in a Pharrell Williams\u0026rsquo Raw brand shoot. But Newall is more than just a striking face. He is a story too. Four years ago, he was spotted, while rushing to class in Trinity High school, by a casting director Renfrew, who invited him to an audition for a short awareness film about kne crime. Newall played the lead role, but the film also had a personal relevance. His own cousin had been victim of a fatal kne crime, and, when newspapers and magazines featured his tale and he became a figurehead for the awareness campaign.  Three years later and he is one of the world\u0026rsquos iconic male models. His fashion impact is global. When we talk he\u0026rsquos preparing to go to Barcelona and shoot for GQ China, weeks ago he had been in a Vogue Homme film. What he wants now is to go back to the medium in which he made his first break, and forge a career in acting. Earlier this year, he appeared in a short film, titled Bunny, which is he says about \u0026ldquomental health awareness. He hopes this will be the start of a new career. But, he points out, global success hasn\u0026rsquot changed him too much. When he\u0026rsquos home he likes to hang out with his mum and his girlfriend. And, he says, his personal look hasn\u0026rsquot changed. \u0026ldquoI still don\u0026rsquot see what people see in me, he says. \u0026ldquoI still dress a wee bit like a Ned. It\u0026rsquos all good.  9. Marie Macklin, entrepreneur  Why? She\u0026rsquos making the regeneration happen.  When, nine years ago, in Kilmarnock, 20,000 people marched to save the Johnnie Walker plant, Marie Macklin was at the head of that crowd. This was her community, where she had grown up and gone to school \u0026ndash where her father had run a construction business. It was also a place that even during her childhood, she had seen economically decline.  But Macklin didn\u0026rsquot just stop at marching. Her experience in the financial industry in London meant she had the knowledge to take that energy and make something of it, and she did. \u0026ldquoThat day, she recalls, \u0026ldquowas the catalyst for me to create the HALO brand which will provide young people and the local community with sustainable long-term economic and social benefits.  Macklin, whose coolness extends to the bling of her flamboyant personal style, has countless awards to her name, including Female Business Leader of the Year 2017. Her aim is to bring economic le back, not only to Kilmarnock, but to other sites across the UK. It begins at the site of the former Johnnie Walker bottling plant, where their first project will be an urban park. \u0026ldquoThe HALO, she says, \u0026ldquois about being disruptive and rocking the economy to create practical advantages for local communities. We like to think and act as pioneers. It also involves forging ties with partners like Scottish Power, which she says \u0026ldquois committed to playing a key role in creating the HALO\u0026rsquos cyber and digital training and learning facility which will be at the forefront of the \u0026lsquoFourth Industrial Revolution\u0026rsquo  8. Iain Stirling, 30, comedian  Why? He is the voice of the Love Island generation  When, this year, the whole of the UK, including George Osborne, seemed to drop everything to watch Love Island, one of the chief draws of it was the man who brought the pantomime wit, irony and geekish megalomania to its voiceover. That man was Scottish comedian Iain Stirling. Back in 2017, NME had declared him the \u0026ldquoreal champion of the show. This year, it seemed he was shaping up as a cultural figure in his own right \u0026ndash bringing a show to the Edinburgh fringe, publishing a book, Not Ready To Adult Yet, at, and getting spotted at Wimbledon cosying up to his girlfriend, fellow presenter, Laura Whitmore.  But Edinburgh-born and raised Stirling was initially sceptical about doing the show that has made his name. It as only after he was invited to do the very middle-class Latitude music festival because of his part in the show that he began to realise it might be a cult hit. His theories about its success? \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos about relationships. We talk about relationships essentially throughout the entire programme and there\u0026rsquos very little deviation from that \u0026ndash and relationships are the one thing that everyone wants to gossip about most of the time. It\u0026rsquos like Love Island went, \u0026lsquoDo you want to know about that stuff? Well, here\u0026rsquos a show that\u0026rsquos an hour of it every day.\u0026rsquo  7. Jamie Genevieve, 25, make-up vlogger  Why? She\u0026rsquos Scotland\u0026rsquos biggest social media star \u0026ndash and she\u0026rsquos for real  When fans turned out to meet make-up vlogger Jamie Genevieve on her recent tour promoting her first lipstick, frequently they would weep. The social media star has over 700,000 YouTube followers, and many of them feel almost as  she were their friend or big sister. Her fans, particularly those in Scotland, feel they know her, and even are supported by her. What marks Genevieve out from other make-up tutorial influencers, is how real and relatable she seems. As she said to us herself, part of her appeal, is that she is \u0026ldquoquite daft. \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot edit myself loads. If things go wrong I keep it in. If I look rubbish in one frame, I keep it in. It doesn\u0026rsquot bother me. I think everyone\u0026rsquos a bit weird and I\u0026rsquom not scared of being bit of a weirdo.  The Glasgow-based vlogger is also refreshingly honest about her looks. \u0026ldquoI think the most honest picture of me ever, she says, \u0026ldquois a picture of me jetlagged, on my couch, with a plate of dinner on my chest. Someone turned it into a meme and it went totally viral, and I was, like, \u0026lsquoBrilliant.\u0026rsquo  But Genevieve\u0026rsquos le, of course, is quite dferent from her fans. Through her weekly vlogs, they get to see her jetting across the world \u0026ndash on safari in Kenya, partying in Ibiza and staying at swanky hotels - as well as getting her lip fillers done in her local beauty clinic. She, her fiance, Jack McCann and their dog, Drogba, are probably the closest we, in Scotland, have to to our very own Kardashians.  6. Josh Littlejohn, 31, social entrepreneur  Why? He got thousands of us to sleep in the park  Josh Littlejohn has changed our perceptions of how to tackle homelessness. With his charity, Social Bite, he has gone from selling sandwiches to building a village for the homeless, and, this year, a huge project to get 800 rough sleepers off the streets of our cities.  He\u0026rsquos the man who somehow managed to lure George Clooney and Leonardo Dicaprio to his little sandwich shop on Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Rose Street, and who, last year, persuaded 8000 of us to sleep out in Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Princes Street Gardens to raise money for his Social Bite village of houses for the homeless. This year, 12,000 people will sleep out in parks in four dferent cities to fundraise for a project which he hopes will transform our approach to homelessness and get those 800 people off the streets.  Littlejohn is a trailblazer. He has a principle of not paying himself more than seven times the wage of his lowest paid member of staff. In the early days of Social Bite, he and his partner Alice Thompson, even had some of their homeless staff live in their one bedroom flat because they had nowhere else to stay.  What keeps him going? \u0026ldquoNot wanting to let down my teenage, idealistic self, he says Littlejohn\u0026rsquos own childhood in Blair Drummond was relatively affluent - his father was a successful restaurateur but he went to the local state school, marched for Make Poverty History, listened to Rage Against The Machine, and wanted to \u0026ldquochange the world.  5. Lauren Mayberry, 30, singer  Why? She\u0026rsquos our Joan of Arc  Fronting electro-pop maestros Chvrches, undeniably one of Scotland\u0026rsquos coolest bands, should be reason enough for the Stirlingshire-born singer\u0026rsquos place on The Cool List. But her contribution goes well beyond fashion and music: she has also shown herself to be an astute and unabashed contributor to discussions about sexual politics and gender issues.  Intelligent, witty and vocal, she has been trolled half to death over the years as a result, but as much as she\u0026rsquos a lightning rod for online haters so has she become a standard bearer of sorts for young feminists and gay rights activists. Earlier this year she talked about the rape threats she has had along the way, and observed that,  she had known this was what the career would be like, she might have, as a teenager thought, \u0026ldquoWhy the f--- would you want to do that?\u0026rsquo She has campaigned with Amy Poehler for girl\u0026rsquos empowerment. She wrote her master\u0026rsquos thesis on images of women in fashion magazines. Next year, she and Shirley Manson, will delver the keynote speech at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas \u0026ndash and it\u0026rsquos sure to be punchy.  As she told the Sunday Herald earlier this year, she isn\u0026rsquot afraid to call out \u0026ldquobullshit when she sees, hears or reads it. Not for nothing did The Eurythmics\u0026rsquos Dave Stewart dub her a \u0026ldquopunk rock Joan of Arc.  4. Darren McGarvey, 34, rapper and author  Why? He wrote the book of the year  Even before Darren McGarvey won the Orwell Prize for political writing earlier this year, people were saying he was the stand-out, authentic voice of a generation. His memoir Poverty Safari, originally published by Luath press, for which he won the prize, had been much-anticipated \u0026ndash for McGarvey, a rapper, who performs under the stage-name Loki, had already gathered a social media following as a smart commentator who knew first-hand what deprivation was.  Poverty Safari, with its subtitle, \u0026ldquounderstanding the anger of Britain\u0026rsquos underclass, was a savage exploration of poverty. Partly it told the story of McGarvey\u0026rsquos own dficult childhood. At one point he even describes how his mother, an alcoholic and drug addict who died from cirrhosis at 36, chased after him, aged just five years old, with a serrated bread kne. But it was also a razor-sharp polemic \u0026ndash one that declared war on the conditions that allow the cycles of abuse and addiction to continue.  The world is looking for eloquent voices like McGarvey\u0026rsquos to explain things. That\u0026rsquos why he was invited on to Question Time, where he shone. It\u0026rsquos why his Poverty Safari Live, at the Edinburgh Fringe was a hit. It\u0026rsquos also why earlier this year he clinched a two-book deal with Ebury, the non-fiction wing of Penguin. It\u0026rsquos why he is the person invited to read the bedtime story at the Glasgow Sleep In The Park. He stands out in an angry world. For what marks McGarvey out is not just his own perspective, but that he is open to others. He is, as he has said, in an often all-too tribal world, trying \u0026ldquoto find out what\u0026rsquos true, even  I don\u0026rsquot like it.  3 Rachel Maclean, 31, artist  Why? She makes our social media hell into fabulous art  There\u0026rsquos no artist quite like Rachel Maclean. She has created a mad, filmic vision of her own, through a process all of her own.  Most of the strange and grotesque characters in her films are her, in disguise, transformed with thick layers of garish make-up and digital effects. She is the one lip-syncing to found audio-tracks.  She is the figure transported via green screen into a bizarre universe \u0026ndash and it\u0026rsquos all magnicently out there.  Maclean is as brilliantly surreal as Bjork, but she is also a reminder of what art can do, that journalism or a TV documentary can\u0026rsquot.  She nails the nightmare that is our social media and fake news age. Spite Your Face, the film she presented last year at the Venice Biennale, turned the Pinocchio tale into a satire on the Trump era, and, over a year on, seems more relevant than ever.  She demonstrates, too, the extremes an artist may go to for their art. Maclean spent a month eating and sleeping in Birmingham\u0026rsquos Bullring shopping centre, dressed as a giant, grotesque bunny.  For her films, she says, \u0026ldquoI live inside the world of the film quite extensively for the few years it takes to make it. The time you\u0026rsquore in costume is maybe a day, but then there\u0026rsquos just all the living and thinking about the characters.  But, with Maclean, what makes her all the more cool is that she is now taking her vision to a wider audience. This autumn will see her much-hyped first feature film broadcast on the BBC.  Filmed in the derelict spaces of St Peter\u0026rsquos Seminary, it\u0026rsquos a feminist response to Kenneth Clark\u0026rsquos landmark cultural series Civilisation.  2 Gerry Cinnamon, 32, singer  Why? He\u0026rsquos a belter.  When, earlier this month, Gerry Cinnamon added a few extra dates to his tour, they sold out in three minutes. Last week footage of Irish dancers performing to his hit, She\u0026rsquos A Belter, went viral.  There are plenty of big names out there in Scottish music, but right now it\u0026rsquos Gerry Cinnamon\u0026rsquos moment.  Right now it\u0026rsquos his very Scottish version of cool \u0026ndash just a man on a stage with his guitar, singing out some great tunes, \u0026ndash that has got Scotland absolutely buzzing. What he did at TRNSMT earlier this year said everything about him.  Taking the mainstage after J Hus pulled out, he turned the audience into a great, huge belting choir, who even chanted out his name. \u0026ldquoSee when the crowd\u0026rsquos with you, he said, \u0026ldquosinging every word it\u0026rsquos a mad feeling. Beautul mayhem.  Geoff Ellis director of TRNSMT recognized how big he was. \u0026ldquoNot since Oasis have I seen someone go on such a rapid trajectory around here, he said.  \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos gone from playing to 50 people to a point where he could easily sell out the Hydro.  \u0026ldquoWe had to bring him back.  What makes him all the cooler, is that success didn\u0026rsquot come early. He was told along the way that he shouldn\u0026rsquot sing with a Scottish accent.  He had to crowd source the money for his first album which came out last year.  He remains an independent musician, unattached to any record company. He\u0026rsquos a belter, in other words, with attitude.  1 Aldo Kane, 40, adventurer  Why? He keeps his cool in extremes  Almost everything Aldo Kane does is so extreme or terrying it would make most of us melt into a puddle.  He is the kind of cool, in other words, that is good at keeping calm in a hairy situation \u0026ndash whether when working with gun-toting South American narcotics dealers for the documentary, The Real Narcos, or filming inside a volcano that unfortunately happens to start erupting.  He also has a beard that looks more cofed for climbing mountains than pulling pints in a trendy pub.  Anywhere you imagine you might be nervous of going, he\u0026rsquos been there: an Ebola treatment centre, water-flooded caves, rowing a boat across the Atlantic on a world-record breaking trip.  \u0026ldquoEverything, says Kane, \u0026ldquohas been in an extreme, or remote or hostile environment. It can be benign, in a cave or a bunker, or it can be full-on being chased by Mexican drug rings.  For years Kane was the safety and ropes guy behind many of TV\u0026rsquos extreme adventure or nature shows, taking presenters to breath-taking and risky locations, but not appearing much on screen. This year he has broken through as a star himself, with all of his work on screen, and a hectic schedule of trips for many of the major television channels.  He has been in Russia with speed-obsessed Guy Martin, done a survival race in Borneo with Ed Stafford, and been on countless trips with Steve Backshall with whom he is filming the ground-breaking BBC primetime Expedition series.  When we talked in July, he had just emerged, blinking, into the light after ten days\u0026rsquo solitary confinement in a nuclear bunker, and was about to fly to the 24 hour daylight of Greenland for an expedition with Backshall.  When, last week, we emailed him, he was in Suriname in South America, about to head down the river into unexplored jungle. Somehow, in the middle of this, he was also managing to hold down a relationship with a producer of nature documentaries.  The Kilwinning-raised son of two paramedics\u0026rsquo route to exploration came via the Scouts. From 12, he and twin Ross would camp on their own, in places like Glencoe. At 16, his eyes set on adventure, he joined the Royal Marines, where he became a sniper.  He says, \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove been spoiled by the attention and the slight risky lestyle and basically it\u0026rsquos very dficult and very addictive.  What, out of all his experiences, was his most petrying moment? \u0026ldquoThere are two in the last year. Being inside the volcano when it was erupting wasn\u0026rsquot cool. Then when I was working in south America with the cartel in The Real Narcos. All around the world I\u0026rsquove worked in hazardous environments, but the worst environment is people. It\u0026rsquos human beings. I was charged by a black rhino, but that wasn\u0026rsquot nearly as scary as dealing with a coked-up real-le Narco who is carrying a gun and he\u0026rsquos just done a job.

But this could be consigned to history under radical plans to transform Scotland\u0026rsquos ferry network which are detailed in a blueprint which will go before MSP\u0026rsquos this week.  Under the proposals, the current model of serving island communities will be ripped up and instead will be based on the Norwegian system of smaller ferries covering shorter routes.  The move aims to increase capacity with more ferries and in some cases journeys being broken up using islands as \"land bridges\" to reduce journey times.  It would see islanders in the Outer Hebrides able to do business on the mainland in a day and  home without an overnight stay.  According to the expert behind it, it would also help repopulate islands as crew would live on the islands they serve rather than on board and staffing costs would be reduced.  Perhaps crucially, it would also dramatically reduce the annual subsidy paid to ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne to run the service.  The blueprint for the future of the network will go before Holyrood this week and comes as CalMac has been heavily criticised after a summer of disruption across the network due to breakdowns of the ageing fleet.  Transport expert Roy Pedersen, who spent 30 years in Highlands and Islands development, has submitted evidence which he says would radically reform the network and save the taxpayer millions of pounds in subsidies paid to CalMac.  According to the proposal, the current level of investment is well in excess of other countries but productivity is \u0026ldquoextremely poor and deteriorating.  Under his plan, a new fleet of around 10 smaller, more efficient ferries would be built with the total bill of around \u0026pound280 million. Upgrades to the ports they would serve will cost another \u0026pound20m.  Pedersen points out that Andrew Banks, owner of Pentland Ferries, is awaiting delivery of a new 100-car capacity ferry at a cost of \u0026pound14m, compared with \u0026pound50m-plus for the new hybrid green ferry MV Glen Sannox currently being built at Ferguson\u0027s.  One of the main points in the paper is reducing the number of staff required for each journey and ending the practice of ferry staff staying on board which adds to the operating costs.  Ferries would be crewed by a staff of around 12 to 14 as opposed to the 30-plus currently used.  This would allow staff to work shts similar to other operators and in Norway, and enable more ferries to run during the day and extend the timetable with services starting earlier and finishing later.  Staff would also live in the communities they serve which, it is argued, would help boost the populations of remote island communities as the smaller ferries would be based in the island ports and not on the mainland.  Pedersen said: \u0026ldquoThe alternative of crew living ashore on island communities served would contribute to the government\u0026rsquos objective of boosting island economies and reduce ship capital and operating costs.  \u0026ldquoFor the larger CalMac vessels it takes nine personnel to berth and cast-off a ship, this is done in Norway with just one hand due to efficient \u0026ldquolock-on linkspan design.  \u0026ldquoThus,  more cost-effective policies and practices along Scandinavian lines were adopted, much improved and higher capacity services could be provided for less public money.  Lock-on linkspans are already used in Scotland at the ports served by Western Ferries at Hunter\u0026rsquos Quay, near Gourock and on Shetland\u0026rsquos inter-island ferries.  Western Ferries carry more passengers and vehicles than the CalMac competition on the routes but receives no public subsidy. Each lock-on linkspan would cost around \u0026pound1.5m to install at each of the 10 large ports that CalMac would serve with the new ferries.  But while the installation costs of around \u0026pound15m seems expensive, the cost of the vessels themselves add another \u0026pound280m.  However, two new hybrid ferries being built to ease pressure on the network, the MV Glen Sannox and its sister ship, cost nearly \u0026pound100m. But the bill is set to be much higher as both are currently delayed until next summer at the earliest after hitting design problems at the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow which has heaped more pressure on the ageing fleet.  The delays come amid concerns that a recent signicant increase in traffic is causing severe problems for island communities. Tourism bosses on the Outer Hebrides have already warned the disruption has cost them millions of pounds this year.  Now CalMac\u0026rsquos own community board has condemned delays in new ferries and is demanding action. It was formed as part of CalMac\u0026rsquos successful franchise bid for the Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Service in 2016.  At a recent meeting of the board in Mallaig, \u0026ldquodisappointment and frustration was reported from all parts of the network at the continuing delays in the delivery of the overdue vessels under construction, said chairman Angus Campbell.  He added: \u0026ldquoAt a meeting, also attended by CMAL and Transport Scotland, strong reservations were expressed at the apparent lack of a coherent long-term vessel replacement plan and the funding commitments necessary to provide both an improved fleet and the port improvements needed.  \u0026ldquoThe board feel they can work alongside the operator to help improve information quality and timing including maximising local knowledge.  \u0026ldquoThe communities board are keen to work positively with all parties to produce a more resilient and ambitious future for our ferry services resulting in better economic benefits for all that they serve but feel there is a real need for action now.  Critics say the current problems has been a generation in the making. Scotland\u0026rsquos islands are getting record numbers of visitors but the boats and port infrastructure carrying them are old and are struggling to cope.  The average age of a ship is 22 and in the early 1990s, the last time Scotland had a major burst of ferry-building with 7,000 tonnes worth in 1994 alone, the average age was just 12.  Between January and the end of July this year, 2,326 out of 79,203 CalMac scheduled sailings were cancelled. Of these, 327 were for mechanical reasons. Most of the rest were because of bad weather.  The figure for cancellations for problems with the ferries looks low, not least because CalMac will stress that it laid on more than 900 extra sailings to compensate for some of them.  But when a boat breaks down, a replacement has to come from somewhere else. Somebody always loses. CalMac does not have a spare vessel, crewed and fuelled ready to move in and act as relief.  Even  it did have a spare, CalMac could far from guarantee it could use it because every port is dferent, whether it be an ageing linkspan or unusual tide, making it dficult for ferries just to slot in.  However,  every port was fitted with the same locked-in linkspan and ferries were smaller and more versatile then they could be moved around the network more easily to cover any breakdowns, according to the blueprint.  The blueprint also outlines how routes could be shortened and slash journey times.  In Norway, ferries tend to travel between the shortest points across the water, with islands themselves being part of the journey.  Rather than go round the islands, ferries will dock at the nearest point, passengers will travel across the island by road, before picking up a ferry at the other side to continue the journey by sea.  Under the new proposal, Mull and Jura could play vital roles acting as these \u0026ldquoland bridges, slash journey times and increase service frequency to Islay and the Outer Hebrides.  Ferries would dock at Craignure on Mull as normal, but Barra passengers would travel on to Tobermory where they would pick up another ferry to continue the journey.  New terminals would also be built at Glendale on Skye to shorten the crossing to Lochmaddy on North Uist and another at Kilmoluaig to Tarbert on Harris.  Likewise, Islay passengers would get a ferry from Keills on the mainland and travel to Lagg on Jura, before crossing to Islay. One other advantage is that carbon emissions would be greatly reduced without the need for hybrid fuel ferries.  Pedersen added: \u0026ldquoBoth are much shorter than the current Kennacraig to Port Askaig/Port Ellen service on Islay and would allow up to ten daily crossings and the option of direct bus services between the islands and Glasgow.  Minister for Energy, Connectivity and the Islands, Paul Wheelhouse, said: \u0026ldquoWe are continuing to invest in new vessels and ferry infrastructure to renew the fleet in accordance with the published Vessel Replacement and Deployment Plan. Over \u0026pound1 billion has been invested in ferry services across the Clyde and Hebrides routes, since 2007.  \u0026ldquoWork is also already under way to appraise, and subsequently to deliver on, further improvements to the ferry services to the Western Isles.  The majority of all visitors to the Outer Hebrides travel through Stornoway harbour, emphasising the importance of the CalMac ferry service to both the town and the wider islands.  The M.V Loch Seaforth, the biggest vessel in the CalMac fleet, sails between Ullapool and Stornoway three times a day, bringing with it up to 700 passengers, 143 cars or 20 commercial vehicles each time it arrives in Lewis.  Some 280,000 ferry passengers, 95,000 cars and 13,000 commercial vehicles a year come to Stornoway via the ferry.  Weekend crossings operate at full capacity and strong growth in tourism means that there are severe capacity constraints during the summer months.  Stornoway Port Authority, which has ambitious plans to develop the harbour as part of a 20-year Master Plan, is developing proposals to ensure the Port is able to accommodate the freight ferry which will likely be deployed to the route over the next few years.  Alex Macleod, the authority\u0026rsquos chief executive, said: \u0026ldquoThe existing ferry provides a good service which is an absolute leline for the community. But the risks in being dependent on a single vessel underline the need for additional capacity to cope with existing requirements and future needs.  \u0026ldquoThe projects we are developing in the Master Plan will help stimulate further economic growth but capacity limitations on ferries could have an impact on that potential growth.  \u0026ldquoThere will always be dficulties with ferry traffic in such a weather-affected part of the world, and as we have done for over 140 years, we will continue to work very closely with Calmac ferries to assist with the delivery of a robust and flexible service. Liaising closely with Calmac Ferries we will work together to find solutions for the good of the islands and everyone who uses these essential ferry services.  HebCelt relies heavily on CalMac ferry services to bring thousands of music fans to Lewis each summer.  The event is a huge economic driver for the islands, generating more than \u0026pound2 million a year and filling hotels, guest houses and campsites. Half the festival audience comes from outside the islands and the ferry route from Ullapool to Stornoway is the main gateway to the Outer Hebrides for these visitors.  HebCelt is also a catalyst for many island-hopping holidays with festival-goers using it as the start of a tour of Lewis, Harris, the Uists and Barra which also depend on CalMac services.  Such is the demand during HebCelt that ferry services have been extended in recent years around festival time to ensure fans are able to get to and from the islands.  Festival director Caroline Maclennan said: \u0026ldquoWe have a really close relationship with CalMac and appreciate many of the dficulties and challenges it faces.  \u0026ldquoCalMac is doing its best with an ageing fleet. The real conversation taking place just now is the frustration over the lack of investment in our leline services by successive governments.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos easy to criticise the service when things go wrong, but there are many sides to it.  \u0026ldquoWe have a very constructive dialogue with the company which helps us effectively address issues, not just those directly affecting ferry services, but also travel to ports and connecting services which can affect both regular travellers and visitors."},{"url":null,"title":"david-pratt-looks-back-on-his-afghan-years","story":"  IT was one of those moments when all that matters is to go on despite one\u0026rsquos fear.  That\u0026rsquos how it was once upon a distant war many years ago, as I followed my guide along a dried-up river bed towards some foothills marking the Pakistan-Afghanistan frontier.  Sidestepping a small cluster of butterfly landmines on the track ahead of us, I pointed to the ground and asked a simple one-word question:\u0026ldquoAfghanistan?  My guide\u0026rsquos grin was all the reply I needed. I was finally in.  This was a war long before the current one in Afghanistan. It was the 1980s, the height of the Afghan mujahideen guerrilla war against the Soviet Red Army who had invaded their land. It was a war that would come to be known as \"Russia\u0026rsquos Vietnam\".  It\u0026rsquos a sobering thought that Afghanistan has now been at war in some shape or form for going on 40 years. It\u0026rsquos now 17 years almost to the day that the United States launched it own invasion, much as the Soviets did all those decades before while the West was preoccupied with Christmas back in 1979.  Throughout all those intervening years as a correspondent I\u0026rsquove followed the fortunes of Afghanistan and never ceased to be amazed by the fortitude of its people.  The Soviet war was the one in which I earned my spurs as a war reporter, doing so in a country that I grew to love and in which I experienced the best and worst of times. Over decades I would witness the Russians leave, watch the rise of the Taliban and see the British and Americans come and go again. But it\u0026rsquos those early years of the Soviet war that I will remember most.  Time and again I would go back and forward illegally across the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan in exotic disguises. Western reporters, after all, were not meant to be inside Afghanistan with the guerrillas and the penalties  caught by the Russians could be severe indeed. At best, imprisonment as a spy in Afghanistan\u0026rsquos most notorious prison Pul-Charkhi, east of Kabul, lay in store.  Pulling out all the stops to avoid such a fate, on one occasion I made the crossing dressed as a woman, wearing a burka complete with painted toenails and sandals.  On another I was swathed in bandages soaked in sheep blood and laid in a makesht coffin pretending to be a wounded guerrilla fighter to escape detection by the Pakistani border authorities.  Always though, once inside Afghanistan, the subsequent long march in-country with the guerrillas would follow a familiar pattern.  Each night our heavily-armed band of mujahideen would set off by starlight to avoid the Soviet helicopter gunships. Looking back now I can scarcely believe how gruelling those marches were, some often anything up to 20 hours or more.  As we marched through the mountains, explosions often growled and rumbled and the horizon flickered like a candlelit room from some far-off battle or bombardment.  At night, as fatigue set in, events would assume an almost surreal quality, as  a line from the Arabian Nights had come to le. But instead of the 40 thieves, other groups of footsore, hollow-eyed mujahideen would pass by, murmuring \u0026ldquoManda nabashi\u0026rsquo\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash \u0026ldquoMay you not be tired \u0026ndash to which the reply was \u0026ldquoZenda bashi \u0026ndash \u0026ldquoMay you live.  Fear was a constant companion, its reminders never far away. The threatening look of some rival mujahideen on a lonely mountain track, the silhouette of a distant helicopter gunship like some bloated dragonfly, or the bright magnesium flare spiralling above a Russian outpost as we slipped quietly by in the dark.  Documenting Afghan guerrilla operations was not for the faint-hearted or unfit.  Sometimes the long weeks in the mountains, forced marches and hiding in caves from Russian patrols would eventually take their toll.  I remember once, wracked with dysentery, finding myself talking to the two dead men that lay either side of me for three days on the floor of a battered bus crammed with casualties, as it crawled towards the Pakistan frontier.  While I was clearly delirious somehow it seemed natural, reassuring even. Death has two faces.  One is non-being the other is the material being that is the corpse. Sometimes though it was better not to think too much about the lives of the dead. Like the afternoon we overran a Russian hilltop post near the Afghan village of Sanglakh.  Days of heavy fighting had left only a batch of pulverised emplacements, the charred bodies of its young Russian defenders sticking out from the rubble surrounded by spent shell cases and empty ration tins of Bulgarian meat.  One of them lay face up, twisted under some wooden beams. I stood there staring at him, feeling a strange affinity.  Both of us were so far away from home. Like me, this young man had come to this unforgiving place: eating, sleeping, marching, feeding fleas and falling ill with dysentery and hepatitis.  Like me, he\u0026rsquod become tanned, thin, made friends and lost friends. Unlike me though, he had no choice. Now he wasn\u0026rsquot even a conscript, just a \u0026ldquozinky boy\u0026rsquo\u0026rsquo, as the Russians called those lucky enough to have their remains sent home in zinc-lined coffins.  Perhaps it was the stench, or the creeping sense of loneliness, but I started to turn away until a sudden shout stopped me in my tracks. At my feet a young Afghan guerrilla carefully traced a wire revealing a booby-trap grenade pegged into the ground at either end. I looked back at the young Russian. Only by chance had our common lot been deprived of its finale.  Years later, after the Russians had withdrawn from Afghanistan as Mikhail Gorbachev\u0026rsquos policies of \u0026ldquoglasnost and \u0026ldquoperestroika prevailed, the daily ritual of slaughter and survival was no longer against the Communists. Having routed the \"Reds\", Afghanistan\u0026rsquos holy warriors\u0026rsquo\u0026rsquo, now they turned on each other in a bitter factional struggle for control of the country\u0026rsquos capital Kabul.  Once, during the battle for a gutted bus station in the city, the group of fighters I was with was caught in the open by a mortar barrage. It was like some nightmarish Sam Peckinpah movie being rerun. All around in a maelstrom of noise and confusion, men were being hurled into the air and coming down in pieces.  I found myself cowering alongside a low wall in a puddle of blood and muck, next to a man trailing his left leg from a string of tendon, his eyes bulging like those of a dying hen, as he reached out his hand to me.  Before I could grasp it, another shell had me automatically on my feet, running, my chest heaving like a spent swimmer\u0026rsquos.  To stay there was to end up like him. War has its emptiness, its zero points during which men are simply glad about not being dead.  Some days later, while looking for a safe place to shit without being shot, I came across a severed human hand lying in the mud.  Something convinced me it was his, haunting me as revenge for my fear and indference that day.  During those dark days in the mid 1990s as warlords and factions struggled for control of Kabul, the city\u0026rsquos civilians diced daily with death.  Just taking to the streets then was to run the gauntlet of bullets, rockets and shells that were fired indiscriminately into neighbourhoods, schools and hospitals.  One day, because of the fighting, I was told that Kabul\u0026rsquos Marastoon mental asylum had been abandoned by its staff, and patients had been left to fend for themselves.  Expecting the worst, I arrived at the open gates and cautiously ventured inside to find myself confronted by an unexpected scene.  Inside, the blind, crippled and mentally ill patients had taken to running their own lives cooking, baking bread, helping each other to the filthy toilets and washrooms, or playing soothing and reassuring music on flutes and the traditional stringed tambur as the war around them raged. It was the sanest place in the city.  Ever resourceful, most Afghans got on with le the best they could. There might have been a little respite from the fighting but already yet more barbarians were massing at the gates of Kabul. Enter next the zealots of the Taliban and their overseas guests Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda.  Afghanistan\u0026rsquos wars up until then had always played out within its own land, but al-Qaeda had other ideas. With the September 11 attacks on the US it was only a matter of time before American military might and that of its allies was brought to bear.  As both the Americans and later the British bunkered in for the long war, I found myself on occasions embedded with their forces.  It was an odd feeling, totally the opposite of all those years before when I accompanied the guerrillas as they fought outside invaders.  Where once I had hidden in the mountains of the Hindu Kush, I now found myself sometimes flying across those same valleys and ridges in helicopters, much like the Russians I used to fear did in the past.  I recall once, while aboard a US Blackhawk Medevac helicopter, landing in a godforsaken seemingly forgotten outpost to pick up the wounded.  Clinging to a steep, craggy mountainside this American base had been attacked by the Taliban on numerous occasions.  Seconds later our patient\u0026rsquos stretcher was slid on board. He had been shot in the neck and stomach. Still conscious, his face was contorted with pain and his hair matted with blood. Over the clatter of the rotors I could hear nothing of his cries.  Only when we landed did the American crew chief tell me the wounded man was a suspected \u0026ldquobad guy, or Taliban. The US crew had risked their le to save him, not something I would have expected from my first Medevac mission.  Sometimes it was as  the war I was witnessing again now was just a continuation of those I had covered in Afghanistan in the past.  \u0026ldquoThis wound I got from the shuravi , a man called Haji Mohammed told me one morning, rolling up his sleeve to reveal a long scar below the elbow of his left arm.  His village was in Helmand\u0026rsquos upper Sangin Valley, a notorious Taliban stronghold.  As we talked, British Royal Marines from 45 Commando, who I was accompanying on a mission to destroy Taliban arms dumps, searched the man\u0026rsquos home and compound for the weapons intelligence had indicted in the vicinity.  Alongside Haji Mohammed stood some of his children, one of them a little girl who was barefoot and shivering in the bitter winter cold.  Poverty here is endemic and most people in rural Afghanistan, like Haji Mohammed\u0026rsquos family, have known nothing but war throughout most of their lives.  I asked him whether,  he were a young man today, he would fight the British and Americans the same way he had fought the Russians. \u0026ldquoMaybe yes, he replied with a mischievous grin.  It struck me that this was as close to an honest answer about what he thought of the Taliban as I was likely to get.  Forty years on from those days when Russian troops went to war in Afghanistan, the country still searches for an elusive peace.  Right now the Taliban are active in 70 per cent of the country and more civilians have been killed during the first half of this year than any other year since the UN started counting bodies in 2009.  Proud, tough as nails yet hospitable to the point of embarrassment, Afghans are overdue some respite. It hurts me to see them still suffering after all this time."},{"url":null,"title":"communist-sutherland-flag-could-be-scrapped","story":"  Critics of the standard \u0026ndash which was chosen by a selection panel following a competition run by the Lord Lieutenancy \u0026ndash have branded it \u0026ldquougly, \u0026ldquohideous, \u0026ldquocommunist and \u0026ldquoa budgie with a smirk.  The design features a swooping eagle with three stars \u0026ndash known as mullets \u0026ndash on a bright yellow and orange background. The colours have been associated with the Earls of Sutherland since the 12th Century.  The process to formally recognise the flag began in February and was put on hold in March after an online petition calling for a review of the design attracted more than 900 signatures.  Leslie Sharp, who is behind the petition, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s a hard thing to swallow that an unelected office has the authority to dictate the terms of selection let alone authorise the final selection. That type of dictatorial authority should be redundant in a democracy.  \u0026ldquoA county community should have the final say on what flag represents us, especially since it will be our first flag and it conceivably will be there for a long time.  \u0026ldquoI feel the people of Sutherland are being pushed around like a serf by an old and out of date authority. The people of the county Caithness got to vote on their flag so it\u0026rsquos a bit of a slap in the face that the people of Sutherland have as yet not had that same respect.  The Lord Lieutenant for Sutherland Dr Monica Main initially defended the process, insisting it was open, transparent and democratic.  And supporters of the design, which had been approved by the Lord Lyon, say that the petition signatories represented fewer than five per cent of Sutherland\u0027s population.  However, petitioners against the flag won the backing of Conservative MSP Edward Mountain. He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not a great fan of the design. I\u0026rsquom not sure it sends the vibrant image that I think that Sutherland should be sending. I would be keen for the whole design to be relooked at and for the people in Sutherland to participate in that and come up with a design that everyone would be happy with.  The Herald on Sunday has learned that the Lord Lieutenant will convene a meeting this week to rule on the flag. Dr Monica Main said: \u0026ldquoThe committee should have an announcement shortly.  Leslie Sharp, who lives in Rogart in Sutherland, said: \u0026ldquoI am of course pleased that after so much of a delay the committee will be meeting to address the proposed design.  \u0026ldquoWhat I would like to see is the people of Sutherland be given a choice. There can be one of two outcomes: either the design goes forward without the consent of the people of Sutherland or the people of Sutherland get to choose from multiple designs.  \u0026ldquoIf the present proposal goes forward then the people of Sutherland will have to reconcile themselves to the design."},{"url":null,"title":"ayrshires-dumfries-house-estate-hosts-first-fun-run","story":"  A ten-kilometre race and a two-kilometre fun run for children were the first of their kind to be held on the 2000-acre Ayrshire estate.

More than 100 constituency parties have submitted motions calling for the issue to be put to a vote.  Many activists believe that with Theresa May\u0026rsquos plans in disarray following the rejection of her Chequers proposals by EU leaders in Salzburg, the time is now right for Labour to call for a fresh ballot.

He also said the family were planning to take the case to the European Court of Justice when Alfie died.  Mr Evans said: \u0026ldquoSoon, we would like to open a foundation to honour his name. This will also be possible thanks to the precious collaboration we have with Steadfast with the aim to continue  fight against euthanasia.  \u0026ldquoIt is also in our plans to present a bill to the attention of the British Parliament to try to change the status quo.  \u0026ldquoWe will no longer allow what has happened to us to happen to others.

Lord Provost Crockett said: “It is an honour to welcome the Band of The Royal Regiment of Scotland to Aberdeen. “We are very fortunate that the Beach Ballroom has been chosen as one of the venues for the band to play on its seven-date centenary tour. “I would also like to take this opportunity to wish them well in meeting their fundraising targets for the very deserving Armed Forces charity Poppyscotland.”Starring in the Beach Ballroom show will be hometown heroes LCpl Mark Angus and LCpl Natalie Mair.                                                                                                         Both hail from Aberdeen originally, and the September concert will mark the first time either has performed during their military career in the Granite City.LCpl Angus, who has played the tuba in ious military bands during his 16-year Army career, said: “The last time I performed in Aberdeen was with the brass band at Cults Academy, so I’m really excited to be back home as part of the Walking with Heroes tour.”LCpl Mair added: “I’m looking forward to having my local fan club – well, my mum, sister and aunties! – coming along to show us their support. It’s going to be a very special night.” LCpl Mair plays the cornet and has recently ed from the Far East where she provided musical and ceremonial support in South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan and Indonesia.                                                                                                        To accompany the centenary tour, there is also a CD – Walking with Heroes – which will commemorate 100 years since the end of The Great War, and honour those that served our nation so valiantly. The programme includes works by such iconic composers as Holst, Shostakovich, John Williams and Karl Jenkins alongside new compositions and arrangements. These include traditional Scottish fayre and feature a whole host of soloists in particular the unmistakable skirl of the pipes.Gordon Michie, head of fundraising, said: “It is a privilege for Poppyscotland to be in partnership with such a talented group of musicians. “The tour is providing a great opportunity for music lovers across the country to experience the unmistakable and memorable sound of Scotland’s State Band.                                                                                                         “We urge the public to get their hands on tickets for the performance as soon as possible as they are already selling out fast.”As well as the tour itself, the band is undertaking another fundraising effort in the form of The 1918 Poppy Pledge. Not only is this a lasting tribute to those who fell in the First World War, but, importantly, will also allow the Poppyscotland to make a step change in the scale of support it is able to provide those in the Armed Forces community who rely on the charity’s support today.

He was aged only 29 but during his short le distinguished himself as one of the foremost archaeologists of his day.Alexander Henry Rhind was born in Wick on July 26, 1833. His parents, Josiah and Margaret , had lost 11 children in infancy.Josiah had two spells as provost of Wick and succeeded Robert Innes of Thrumster as agent for the Commercial Bank. He owned substantial property in the new and bustling Pulteneytown and settled himself in his property at Sibster where the young Alexander grew up.Alexander attended Pulteneytown Academy, going on to study natural history and natural philosophy at Edinburgh University.Following his work in 1851 on the cairns at Yarrows, he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries at 19 years of age. He argued for the inclusion of a broch as an example of native architecture as part of the Great Exhibition and wrote a paper advocating the extension of treasure trove to objects other than precious materials.His failing health took him to warmer climes, where he studied and published extensively.He bequeathed a number of legacies to his native Wick, including the establishment of an institute \"for the industrial training of young women\" at Rhind House, and provided for two scholarships at Edinburgh University.Sunday 23 Sep 2018 8:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Blackmail claims over mums to be","story":"A WHISTLEBLOWER at Raigmore Hospital has alleged that midwives were \u0026ldquoblackmailed into taking on patients from Elgin in order to prevent Caithness mums-to-be from travelling to Glasgow to give birth.The midwe, whose identity has been concealed on request as the person is contracted to NHS Highland, said that due to maternity services at Dr Gray\u0026rsquos Hospital in Elgin being downgraded, expectant mums in Moray had to travel to Inverness to give birth.A large percentage of women in Caithness also have to travel to Raigmore.The additional workload from Elgin has led to anger among midwery staff who are also aggrieved that pregnant Caithness women were allegedly used as a bargaining chip.The whistle-blower said: \u0026ldquoThe maternity services at Elgin were downgraded and that meant an influx of new patients on top of the ones we already have from Caithness.\u0026ldquoWe made it clear to management that we were overworked as it is and a new batch of expectant mums would increase that even further.\u0026ldquoWe asked  they could be erted to Aberdeen but we were told  we refused to take on Elgin patients then the Caithness ones would be removed from our workload.\u0026ldquoEssentially, that meant that women would have to travel all the way from Caithness to Glasgow in order to give birth.\u0026ldquoWe did not want that to happen and we reluctantly took on the extra workload.\u0026ldquoThis comes at a time of year when all the Christmas surprises come into the world. September has a high rate of babies being born.\u0026ldquoStaff morale is already at an all-time low. Several experienced midwives are either retiring or leaving because of the added workload and the burden it is causing.Bill Fernie of the pressure group Caithness Health Action Team said he was not surprised that a midwe felt compelled to speak out.He said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a terrible situation for the staff to find themselves in. They should be commended for all their efforts.\u0026ldquoTravelling to Raigmore places more than enough strain on the mums and their families so going to Glasgow would have added to that. I can fully understand why someone at Raigmore would want to whistle-blow as it appears to be a pretty fraught situation.An NHS Highland spokesman said: \u0026ldquoDue to the unpredictable nature of maternity activity, cases are assessed on an inidual basis and robust risk assessment and escalation plans are in place to ensure safe service provision.\u0026ldquoTo date, since accepting intrapartum transfers from Elgin, there has been no need for any Caithness woman to be erted from Raigmore Hospital to deliver elsewhere due to staffing levels or capacity, as is being suggested by the midwe whom you interviewed.Sunday 23 Sep 2018 8:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Bower author helping Norn become the norm","story":"COMMON words and phrases used by Caithnessians may be thought of by locals as slang terms \u0026ndash but, by using them, they may have been reviving a dead language.Bower author Elspeth Grace Hall is doing her bit to revive the language of Norn that was once widely spoken in Caithness.Norn was officially declared a \u0026ldquodead language by world heritage body the United Nations Educational, Scientic and Cultural Organization .However, Grace Hall has been bringing about a revival of the region\u0026rsquos native tongue by writing a series of children\u0026rsquos workbooks to teach kids how to read and write in Norn.If Elspeth is successful in helping to increase the numbers of Norn speakers in Caithness, UNESCO could reverse its death declaration.They had once delivered a similar verdict on Kernowek \u0026ndash the native language of south-west English county, Cornwall.But in 2010, UNESCO announced that its former classication of the language as \u0026ldquoextinct was \u0026ldquono longer accurate.Grace Hall said: \u0026ldquoIf you have ever sat \u0026lsquoO a benk\u0026rsquo, fed the \u0026lsquoscorries\u0026rsquo, told your \u0026lsquomannie\u0026rsquo off for being a \u0026lsquoloon\u0026rsquo or simply popped off \u0026lsquotill\u0026rsquo the shops you have been speaking a second language \u0026ndash one that officially doesn\u0026rsquot even exist.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always been intrigued by languages and the Caithness dialect is wonderfully rich.\u0026ldquoI started to investigate the etymology of words unique to Caithness and found that they weren\u0026rsquot part of Scots, English or Gaelic, they were in fact Norn.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash  it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him ing to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Aslearson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being kned in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area.

He was a third-year medical student who played rugby with the cycling trio and was also a talented musician. He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the y cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it. We had always seen Marcus as he was at rugby \u0026ndash a strong, witty and kind gentleman. After talking with more team-mates who have opened up and described their own experiences the horrying statistics become relatable.The cycling trio hope to be arriving at Land\u0026rsquos End in a fortnight\u0026rsquos time and are hoping to raise \u0026pound2000 for the Marcus in Mind fundraiser set up by his family.To make a donation, visit the website on: justgiving/crowdfunding/for-marcusSunday 23 Sep 2018 8:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117685.jpg","title":"Wind turbine blades hold up town traffic","story":"\u0026nbspMOTORISTS making their way through Wick faced a delay as an extra-long convoy of trucks set out for Bad a\u0027 Cheo wind farm on the Causewaymire.Three giant blades each measuring 45 metres were driven up from Wick harbour by lorries from Campbeltown-based McFadyens with an escort of the company\u0027s support vehicles. Because of the sharp turn from River Street up the Clf Road the lorries are required to reverse all the way up from Wick harbour after the blades are loaded on their trailers by crane. They then negotiate the turn up the Clf from River Street and can proceed as normal.All possible obstacles are temporarily repositioned and in the case of River Street this means folding over a hinged lamp-post so the blade tip doesn\u0027t hit it as the lorry turns.The three McFadyens trucks were monitored by the company\u0027s support vehicles and road policing officers.The Senvion MM92 turbine comes in eight pieces that the haulage company conveys to the site in convoys that never go beyond three lorries.Bad a\u0027 Cheo wind farm, which began construction in March 2017, will feature 13 of these 2.05MW turbines with a tip height of 112 metres.Sunday 23 Sep 2018 8:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"September 23, 2018 at 8:00 amScottish and Southern Electricity Networks  is set to hold six public consultation events across Orkney regarding the company’s transmission infrastructure project.

They worried that the business case for the cinema and hub was not sufficient and risked adding to the number of empty buildings in Cromarty.Others argued that the project would be out of keeping with Cromarty\u0026rsquos historic architecture.A report which went before this week\u0026rsquos committee said that Cromarty Community Council had taken a neutral stance over the proposals, but that a consultation it held with the public found that, out of 63 residents who responded, 37 supported the plans and 26 were opposed.Recommending approval council planners said existing paths through the site would be maintained and added that the location within an area that is already fenced off meant there was a \"perceptible distinction\" between the yard site and wider Links area.They added that the film society had looked at other existing venues for a possible cinema and found none were suitable, and added that Cromarty Estate had argued there was \"a demand from local groups and businesses for office space\".Voting unanimously in favour of the plans, a number of councillors on the committee said it was an exciting project but also acknowledged some of the local reservations over the business case.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Margaret Paterson said that while some in the community had doubts over the cinema\u0026rsquos financial viability, she stressed that \"the film society is active and forward-thinking and they will get the people\".Wick and East Caithness councillor Raymond Bremner also acknowledged local fears that the community might be left with \"dficult buildings\"  the development didn\u0026rsquot \"quite work\" but praised the application and gave his support to it.And Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Angela Maclean said she believed the hub and cinema was \"a venue that can be used by lots of dferent groups in the community\" and would boost the neighbouring Slaughterhouse Cafe.\"This is an exciting development for Cromarty \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos a cosmopolitan and very artistic community,\" she added.Sunday 23 Sep 2018 8:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

They\u0026rsquove travelled all over Scotland to skate parks elsewhere but there\u0026rsquos never been anything closer to home in Ullapool.\"Two years ago we got a loan of portable skate park equipment owned by Highland Council. It was located on the tennis court at Lochbroom Leisure Centre and was well-used but eventually it had to move on somewhere else.\"At the start of this year, there was an announcement that there would be a local discretionary fund to bid in to. That made me think it was worth trying to get something moving. Around 30 groups gave presentations. My son gave a presentation at the end of the day about the plans for equipment and we were successful getting the maximum \u0026pound2500 available.\"Ullapool Harbour trust also chipped in \u0026pound1000 to the cause.The group set itself an initial target of \u0026pound7000. It then submitted a bid for lottery funding of \u0026pound7500, which it has just been awarded.\u0026nbspIt\u0026rsquos hoped the new equipment could again be located in the tennis court for part of the year.Mr Crook said: \"It\u0026rsquos a facility that was well-received. The company that provides the equipment does a number of layouts so it\u0026rsquos a question of deciding what we can afford and then placing an order. It will, I\u0026rsquom sure, be very well used.\"Sunday 23 Sep 2018 8:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Part of the funding package for the deal is being provided by Stavanger-based private equity firm HitecVision which is the majority owner of Verus.Alan Curran, chief executive of Verus Petroleum, said the deal was in line with the company’s strategy to expand its production base and cash flow.He highlighted the Western Isles asset in particular for its long future and strong cash generation.The Western Isles development includes the Harris and Barra oil fields. Production has exceeded expectations since it started in November 2017 and is currently producing around 40,000 boepd, with an estimated field le of 15 years.“This transaction builds on our Boa oil field acquisition in 2017 and our acquisition of interests in the Alba oil field and the Babbage gas field earlier this year.

Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson.             Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone else.“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them.             “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have 30-odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.            “But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone else’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over 25 years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the 59-year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early 40 years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since 1979.“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in 1981 in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March 1987.The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further 20 novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than 30 million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into 36 dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November 2016. New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the 30th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in 2008 amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be 40 when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio 4’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in 2002 for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from 8-13 October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from 12-17 November www.aberdeenperformingarts.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802813.1537437079!/image/image.jpg","title":"massive tapestry depicting games of thrones goes on display in glasgow","story":"        A huge Game of Thrones embroidery commissioned by the producers of the series has gone on display at a university in Glasgow.

The move to put Holyrood’s Equality and Human Rights Committee in charge of examining the controversial proposal has angered those campaigning against the ban. The convener of the Equality Committee is the SNP MSP for Cunninghame South, Ruth Maguire, who happens to be the daughter of the Green MSP, John Finnie, who proposed the anti-smacking member’s bill.            The anti-ban group “Be Reasonable Scotland” has questioned how the committee can be “fair and reasonable” given at least five out of seven of the committee members co-signed Finnie’s bill, including his daughter.            The other co-signatories who sit on the committee are Maguire’s SNP colleagues Fulton MacGregor and Gail Ross, and Labour’s Mary Fee and Alex Cole-Hamilton of the Lib Dems. A Be Reasonable Scotland spokesman said: “This is a travesty of democracy. Three-quarters of the Scottish public oppose John Finnie’s bill to criminalise parents who smack their children, yet it has been assigned to a committee that is overwhelmingly stacked in its favour. “Five out of seven members of Holyrood’s Equality and Human Rights Committee co-signed Finnie’s bill, including the convener of the committee who is none other than Finnie’s daughter, Ruth Maguire MSP. It’s hard to see how this committee can possibly provide a fair and balanced assessment of the bill.”The spokesman said Finnie had admitted to smacking his own children, who had turned out to be “well-rounded”, adding: “This destroys the myth that ordinary smacking is so harmful that parents must be criminalised for it.”An Equalities Committee spokesman said scrutiny of the bill would begin shortly and the public would be asked to submit its views.Finnie said: “There are very clear parliamentary procedures for the scrutiny of legislation. There will be full transparency and it all takes place in the full glare of TV cameras and microphones. I have no doubt that the highest standards of scrutiny will be observed when it comes to this legislation.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4803790.1537562823!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit talks reach impasse as theresa may issues eu with ultimatum","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The prospect of Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal on trade or customs has intensied after Theresa May admitted yesterday that negotiations are at an \u0026#8220impasse\u0026#8221 and accused European leaders of a lack of respect.                In a bullish statement delivered the day after her humiliating rebuff from EU leaders in Salzburg, the Prime Minister warned that EU officials must now come forward with fresh proposals before any progress can resume.            After her address, the Conservative leader faced claims her negotiating strategy  was “collapsing around her” and that she was in denial over the shortcomings in her own so-called Chequers compromise deal.            Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned a no deal Brexit will mean “huge damage” for the UK and result in a “heavy political price” for the Tories north of the Border.But Mrs May insisted that EU proposals for a post-Brexit economic deal could lead to the “break up” of the UK and said this was “unacceptable” during the defiant seven-minute address. The Prime Minister cut a beleaguered figure after EU leaders  dismissed her “Chequers proposal” as unworkable at a flagship summit in Austria on Thursday. Yesterday Mrs May warned: “The EU should be clear: I will not overturn the result of the referendum - nor will I break up my country.”The pound plummeted following Mrs May’s speech, giving up four days of gains on the US dollar to shed 1.5 per cent and close at 1.30 in London. Versus the euro, the British currency was down over 1 per cent at 1.11.A no deal Brexit would mean costly tarfs on the import of goods to the EU and has prompted warnings that it could cost up to 80,000 jobs in Scotland alone and cost the economy billions of pounds.            But such a scenario seems increasingly likely as relations between the EU and UK appear to have hit rock bottom just six months ahead of the UK’s scheduled departure from the Brussels bloc next March. Mrs May dismissed EU suggestions that the onus is on Britain to sht its stance, insisting that the ball is now in the European Union’s court.The key barriers to a deal are the future economic arrangements and the Irish border problem. If the UK remains in the European Economic area , or single market, it loses the freedom to restrict immigration from the EU and to sign  global trade deals. Alternatively, a free trade deal outside the EEA would see an effective border created in the Irish Sea, effectively segregating the UK from Northern Ireland, according to Mrs May. “Neither side should demand the unacceptable of the other,” she warned.            “We cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of our union, just as they cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of theirs.“We cannot accept anything that does not respect the result of the referendum, just as they cannot accept anything that is not in the interest of their citizens. Throughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same.”The UK is ready to come forward with “new ideas” on unblocking the disagreement over future arrangements at the Irish border, Mrs May insisted.Her position was welcomed by Democratic Unionist Party  leader Arlene Foster, who said: “The Prime Minister is right to stand firm in the face of disrespectful, intransigent and disgraceful behaviour by the European Union. The United Kingdom will not be treated in such a manner.”But Sinn Fein President Mary-Lou McDonald said: “Rather than accepting that her so-called ‘Chequers Plan’ fails to resolve fundamental issues, Theresa May has engaged in deflection.            “Her focus has unfortunately remained on infighting within her own party and her pact with the DUP, instead of coming to an acceptable negotiating position.”European Council President Donald Tusk’s assertion last week that the Chequers plan “will not work” also met with a stinging rebuke from the UK Prime Minister.“At this late stage in the negotiations, it is not acceptable to simply reject the other side’s proposals without a detailed explanation and new proposals,” she said.“So we now need to hear from the European Union what the real issues are and what their proposals are so we can discuss them.“Until we do, we can’t make progress.”The UK government will now continue the work of “preparing ourselves for no deal,” The Prime Minister added.The three million EU citizens living in the UK will have their rights protected, Mrs May added, with a pledge that she will seek to avoid a  to a hard border in Ireland under such a scenario.But opponents insisted that Mrs May has placed too much faith in her own Chequers deal which sought to allow frictionless trade, but would leave Britain to have control over EU immigration and make its own laws.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4803826.1537597925!/image/image.jpg","title":"norwegian to scrap us budget flights from edinburgh","story":"        Three Edinburgh air routes including US axed by Norwegian                Budget airline Norwegian is to axe the last of its three US routes from Edinburgh which were launched only last year, The Scotsman can reveal.            The carrier is also scrapping two of its six other routes from the capital, to Barcelona and Tenere.            They will end next March.It is understood the airline is also closing its base at Edinburgh Airport.One crew member said: \"Closing Edinburgh base to all pilots and cabin crew.\": Inside Transport - Passengers hit by airline turbulenceNorwegian blamed the failure of the Scottish Government to halve air passenger duty  this year as ministers had pledged.The SNP has failed to secure opposition support and the plans have also been delayed by the need to win EU approval for retaining Inverness Airport\u0027s exemption from the tax.            It would have seen the charge reduced per passenger on flights to the US from £75 to around £37.50.APD is not charged on flights into the UK.\u2028The airline launched flights from Edinburgh to Stewart in New York State, Providence in Rhode Island and Bradley in Connecticut in June last year.But it announced in January that the Bradley service would end two months later, and in April that the Providence flights would be grounded in October.             The airline also flies to Copenhagen, Malaga, Oslo and Stockholm from Edinburgh.BACKGROUND: Norwegian to axe a US route from Edinburgh over tax cut delaysA Norwegian spokesman told The Scotsman: \"After careful consideration, we have decided to withdraw our transatlantic routes.\"Air passenger duty was the main factor, as it meant that fares were higher than we’d like them to be, which affected the profitability of these routes.\"When we compare it to performance on identical routes from Ireland , fares are lower, and profitability is higher in those markets compared to Scotland.\"Our Edinburgh routes to Spain will also be withdrawn from next summer.            \"None of these summer 2019 flights are currently on sale.\"The cuts are a reminder to everyone of what is at stake for Scotland’s connectivity  the APD issue isn’t tackled.\"BACKGROUND: Second US route from Edinburgh halted by Norwegian AirThe airline said its US routes had been launched \"with the prospect of a reduction in air passenger taxes that was unfortunately postponed by The Scottish Government and this has led us to fully withdraw our transatlantic services.\"It added: \"We continually monitor and evaluate routes across our network, and as such we have also decided to withdraw routes from Edinburgh to Barcelona and Tenere allowing us to focus on maintaining better-performing flights to Scandinavia.\"Edinburgh-based crew will be offered potential relocation to the airline\u0027s other bases.\"Three other airlines fly to New York from Edinburgh and Norwegian faced multiple airline competition on the other routes it is ending.A spokesman for Edinburgh Airport said: “This is a desperately disappointing decision, entirely caused by a complete failure of the Scottish Government to live up to its commitment to reduce the tax paid by Scots travellers. “This failure diminishes choice for passengers and is a shot in the arm for European cities already relishing Britain’s isolation from mainland Europe.“It is not too late to deliver on commitments made before Scotland loses out further, both in terms of jobs and tourism revenue.“The administrations in Holyrood and Westminster must come together now and focus not just on why things can’t be done, but on fixing this intolerable situation.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797314.1536524678!/image/image.jpg","title":"v a dundee boss especially proud of mackintosh oak room","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.  Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself ?  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday.

Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"spurs lose tight highland amateur cup final ","story":"Lerwick Spurs have narrowly lost the Highland Amateur Cup final after taking the tie to extra-time with a late equaliser.\nThe isles side had gone a goal down to Pentland United \u0026#8211 the competition\u0026#8217s most successful team \u0026#8211 in the 18th minute.\nPentland looked set to secure their eight Highland Amateur Cup trophy until a stoppage time equaliser from Spurs brought the game to extra-time.\nThe Lerwick side found themselves 2-1 down in the 6th minute of extra-time and were unfortunately unable to bag an equaliser.\nSpurs won five games on their way to the final including a quarter-final success against 2017 champions Avoch.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Signatures will be collected in the village for petitions \u0026ndash to present to Macdonalds at a later date \u0026ndash and at the resort which is currently staging the prestigious Europarc conference being attended by some 500 delegates.\nA key theme of the gathering is Scotland\u0027s Year of Young People 2018, It was highlighted at the meeting this was at odds with denying local tots, children and teens access to the pool.\nAfter the meeting, SOS 2018 coordinator Joe Kirby said: \"It was a really productive meeting with lots of great ideas coming forward from those there.\n\"There was a clear feeling within the room that we need to raise the campaign\u0027s profile and get both parties talking again so that the community can get back to using the pool.\n\"We will be starting with a peaceful show of support for affordable local swimming at the resort and in the wider Aviemore from early evening and there are plenty of more suggestions which we have taken on board and will be looking to develop over the coming days and weeks.\n\"Our sincere hope, however, is that both parties can reach an agreement very soon: that way everyone is a winner \u0026ndash Macdonald Hotels, Highland Council and the community.\"\nIt is understood to renew the High Le Highland deal the hotel giant had initially in the spring asked for \u0026pound200,000 in year one \u0026pound213,000 in year two and \u0026pound223,000 in the final year.\nEarlier this month a three-year deal agreement had been struck in principle via email exchanges only for the local authority to see that the hotel company did a U-turn.\nIt would have seen Highland Council pay \u0026pound180,000 with index linked increases either CPI or 2.5 per cent and HLH users pay \u0026pound1.50  or \u0026pound3 per family per visit over the three-year period\nThe council has said the deal will give Macdonald Aviemore Resort approximately \u0026pound220,000 per year \u0026ndash more than the hotel operator had been looking for at the outset.\nMacdonald\u0026nbspHotels\u0026nbspconfirmed they intend to reopen talks next week.\nA spokesman said: \"We remain keen to see this situation resolved, which would be in everyone\u0026rsquos interests \u0026ndash especially those local people who are unable to enjoy use of the pool.\n\"However, we\u0026rsquove been consistent in stressing that any compromise must be on the basis that the scheme is financially sustainable, taking into account the very signicant rises in costs we have had to meet.\n\"Over the past two years alone, the resort has seen staff costs rise by 20 per cent to \u0026pound4.6 million, a 22 per cent increase in energy costs to more than \u0026pound1 million and a 55 per cent jump in business rates, which are now over \u0026pound590,000 annually.\n\"In an attempt to overcome the impasse, we will be making contact with the council early next week to see whether we can resolve this unfortunate situation.\n\"But it\u0026rsquos clear that any reasonable, long-term solution needs to take these hard facts into account.\"\n\nSunday 23 Sep 2018 8:39 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117299.jpg","title":"Conservation hub set for expansion","story":"Iain Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nTHERE was a disappointing response to a recent six-week public consultation to gauge local thinking about a proposed extension of Grantown\u0027s conservation area.\nLess than one per cent of residents offered an opinion. Proposed change will bring a greater number of properties into the protected area and, therefore, under stricter planning controls.\nHowever, Andrew Puls, Highland Council\u0027s principal officer for building conservation and environment, told local councillors meeting in Grantown that from 732 local homes, and after a consultation event attended by 50 people, there were only 12 responses. Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval. If adopted, all properties within the conservation area will be notied by letter.\nSunday 23 Sep 2018 8:39 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbsp\n\nFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.\nIt is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.\nLaunched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.\nThe service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.\nFair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.\nThis means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.\nThe service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.\nDelivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.\nJamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the inidual.\n\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\n\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"\nOne of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .\nHe has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.\nAlan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

It was a bitter blow for a Lovat side striving to learn the lessons from defeat in last year’s final, when a slow start proved costly.\nGreg Matheson, the Kiltarlity side’s talisman, had the ball in the net but his effort was rightly ruled offside in what was a frustrating day for the Lovat attack.\nNewtonmore continued to make better use of the ball, and the wide spaces of the Mossfield pitch, and two goals on the stroke of half time all but settled the outcome.\nThe second goal summed up the gulf in quality over the 90 minutes. The danger came after Lovat’s Craig Mainland shanked a shy on the right touchline, handing Newtonmore’s Jamie Robinson the opportunity for a hit-in of his own. From there his long looping effort was flicked to Glen MacKintosh who fashioned just enough space to steer a low bouncing effort beyond the ing MacDonald.\nSeconds later Menzies drilled in the third – another daisy cutter which crept in at the near post.\nWhen Marc MacLachlan, who had looked Lovat’s most likely goal threat, limped off after twisting his knee early in the second half the game was up for the Kiltarlity side.\nNewtonmore’s defence, in which youngster Crag Ritchie excelled alongside Rory Kennedy, Andy MacKintosh and Norman Campbell, held firm and keeper Kenny Ross would enjoy a largely trouble-free afternoon in what, at the grand old age of 48, was his first final.\nMacDonald made a terric save to deny Menzies a hat-trick, but the striker’s day was complete when he was awarded the Albert Smith medal as man of the match.\nHe said: “Once we got our noses in front, with the defence we have we were always going to be tough to break down.\n“Hopefully there’s more to come – two points in the next game against Oban and we win the league, and that’s our target.”\nLovat manager Fraser Gallagher conceded his team had been second best.\n“We didn’t have enough aggression in our defending in the first half, and put ourselves under pressure,” he added. “If anyone is going to knock them off the top it’s not because Newtonmore slip-up.

Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!\n“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”\nCherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.\nHaving battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”\nDespite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of Lucky2Bhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like Lucky2Bhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be here  it wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”\n\nThree days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday 12th June, 52-year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.\n“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took 40 to 50 minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”\nAfter being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.\nHaving served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”\nDuring his 13 years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”\n\n\nOn Wednesday 13th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, 76-year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.\n“John hadn’t been 100 per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was 75 — to take it easy, so we came home\u0026#8230 We went to bed about 11 o’clock.”\n“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”\nCarol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled 999 and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.\n“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about 10 years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”\nJohn was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.\n“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”\nCarol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.\n“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”\nDr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by Lucky2Bhere is “truly le-saving”.\n“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every 90 seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by 10 per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.\n\u0026#8220The approach taken by Lucky2Bhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”\nEstablished in 2007, Lucky2Bhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in 2006 but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.\nIn view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – Lucky2Bhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across the  and breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.\nLast year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all 24 primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles.

However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon\u0026#8217s effort and with it seal his side\u0026#8217s playoff berth.\n\n\nAfter succumbing to a 3-0 defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting 2-0 win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts\u0026#8217 unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.\nIn stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before \u0026#8211 which saw him earn a red card \u0026#8211 Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.\n\nThe south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.\nKyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a platform to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.\n\nWith Mallaig having finished the season on 39 points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher\u0026#8217s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.\nWhat followed was a fine team performance by the 2017 winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson \u0026#8211 including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half.\n\n\n \u0026#8220I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.\u0026#8221\n\u0026#8220The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have only  one defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026nbsp\n\n \u0026#8220It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.\u0026#8221\nI don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig \u0026#8211 so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.\u0026#8221\n\n \u0026#8220This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We\u0026#8217re still learning and hopefully improving.\u0026#8221\n\n \u0026#8220It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people\u0026#8217s expectations of you.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026nbsp\n\n \u0026#8220I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.\u0026#8221\n \u0026#8220No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.\u0026#8221\n\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212-\n\n\nArticle by Adam Gordon\nAll images by Willie Urquhart.\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27468  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nThe proposal to retain the right of representation in the European Parliament for Irish citizens resident in the north is an attempt to hold the State to the values its constitution proclaims.  - independent legal report\nThe Irish government should create a new constituency and allocated its two additional European Parliament seats to the north to ensure the democratic rights of all Irish citizens are upheld, a newly published independent legal opinion has said. \nThe report, which was launched today by Sinn Féin MEP Martina Anderson was commissioned by the GUE/NGL group in the European Parliament and authored by barrister Mark Bassett. \nIt finds that continued representation in the European Parliament for Irish citizens in the north is legally and constitutionally possible and only requires the political will of the Irish government to make it happen. \nThe report was launched following Sinn Féin\u0027s strategy and planning days held in Cavan earlier this week. \nIn the legal opinion, barrister Mark Bassett writes that allocating the two additional seats the 26 Counties will receive post Brexit to the north is in line with the Irish constitution. \n\"The proposal to retain the right of representation in the European Parliament for Irish citizens resident in the north is an attempt to hold the State to the values its constitution proclaims,\" the report states. \nIt also says that to allow the denial of rights to Irish citizens would go against the fundamental views of the state. \n\"It is surely anathema to any form of republican democracy to leave fellow citizens without a voice in the decisions that affect them,\" it said. \n\nLaunching the report today, Sinn Féin MEP Martina Anderson said retaining a voice in the European Parliament is vital to the people of the north who will be worst hit by the Tory Brexit. \n\"Today we launched an independent legal opinion that demonstrates beyond a shadow of a doubt that this is both legally possible and permissible. The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government. This is the first real test of those words. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise. So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north. Brexit threatens many hard-won rights and protections that we in Sinn Féin will continue to fight to uphold. If the Irish government is serious about joining us in this fight, then they can allocate these two new seats to the north,\" she said. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27469  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nI am calling on the IFA to respect the rights of Palestinians by cancelling this match and sending out a strong signal that the slaughter of Palestinians in the open-air prison which is Gaza, is completely unacceptable.- Sinead Ennis\nThe Irish Football Association have come under increased pressure to cancel an international friendly with Israeli which is scheduled for Tuesday 11th, September. \nThousands of people have signed a petition set up BDS Ireland is calling on the IFA chief executive to cancel the fixture.\nSinn Féin MLA Sinéad Ennis said the IFA have made the ‘wrong decision’ by hosting the Israeli soccer team and called on them to respect the rights of the Palestinian people. \n“Over recent weeks and months, many sporting, cultural and music figures have heeded calls from the BDS movement, not to perform in Israel. \n“The Israeli government must feel the pressure of the international anger at their mass killings, human rights violations and flagrant violations of international law.

the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince 2010, must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.\nInitially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.\nFormany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.\nForthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.\nHowever, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.\nIt istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.\nIn parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity.\n Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.\n\nA GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.\nTheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.\nPoliticalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. \nToomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.\nSocietalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.\nDemographicshts in the north are irreversible.\nIt isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.\nSomevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.\nHowever,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.\nUnionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.\nNo onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.\nThe 20%which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.\nAminority should be cherished because it enriches society.\nDiversityshould be celebrated and respected.\nThispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.\nPoliticaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.\nRepublicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.\nThiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.\nTheopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.\nSinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.\nButfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.\nWhocould have imagined 30 years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.\n\nThemodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.\nMandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”\nIrishunity is both reasonable and achievable.\nIrelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.\nWe arestronger as a people for that.\nSinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.\nThereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.\nThis isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying:

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a dference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such le-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back. We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus       false     else         your_email.focus       false     else         friends_name.focus       false     else         friends_email.focus       false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random  false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVery Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field -

ni leisure show springs into action with fun fuelled launch","story":"\nLocal man Billy Nutt welcomed traders and exhibitors alike to the adrenaline-packed launch, which featured a spectacular parkour demonstration.\n\n                \nAnticipation is mounting ahead of this year’s second annual Calor NI Leisure Show, as dozens of exhibitors joined forces recently in an action-packed launch at Lisburn’s impressive Eikon Centre.\n\n   Load the IFrame Player API code asynchronously.   tag = document.createElement  tag.src = \"https:www.youtube/player_api\"   firstScriptTag =

and sponsors of the event alike, as he announced to a delighted crowd that due to the success of last year’s event the inaugural show which is running for the second year is set to open for one full additional day due to popular demand.\n\nLaunching over the weekend of November 2, 3 and 4, Nutt Promotions will once again highlight some of the finest caravans, motorhomes, boats, jet skis, tents, cycles, fishing and all things under the leisure banner that Northern Ireland has to offer, and this year it is set to be held across two jam-packed halls for the first time.\n\nFounder of Nutt Travel, Billy Nutt MBE, who has been involved in motorsport for over 40 years, explained: ‘‘On behalf of Nutt Promotions, we are delighted that, in 2018, the Eikon Exhibition Centre have now added a further larger hall, enabling us to continue with our planned expansion. We are absolutely delighted with the set-up here, and last year for us was just unbelievable. This has given us the space to not only expand the products which were on offer last year but to incorporate new leisure pursuits such as fishing. I’m sure the fishing lake will be a great attraction in the new hall this year with the opportunity for the public to try their hand at casting. We also have more boats, more cycles and more outdoor gear on display with both Decathlon and Go Outdoors coming onboard. The thing we love about the Leisure Show is that local businesses come together and work as a team - I think it is just brilliant.’’\n\nBilly also delightedly announced that renowned chef Paula McIntyre will be at the show for three days with three demonstrations per day.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nShow sponsors including Downtown Radio and main sponsor, Calor NI\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nPaula enthused: ‘‘I’m delighted to be involved. Confined cooking facilities needn’t be a barrier to delicious food. \n\n‘‘I’ll be using the best of local ingredients to cook up dishes that can be prepared on a couple of rings or butane camper stove, I have first-hand experience of cooking in a campervan so it’ll be great to be able to show what can be done to the wider audience!’’\n\nWith a launch which included an eye-popping somersaulting spectacle from the Go-Fyt Warriors, who will be hosting a fun-fuelled challenge on the day suitable for all ages, this year’s show promises to provide all-round entertainment for the entire family. Representative Kevin Howlette said: ‘‘We’re delighted to have Go-Fyt Warrior here in a series of races and challenges for you all to become NI Warriors. Once you enter our ninja challenge your le will never be the same again.’’\n\nThe family-friendly event, which this year will also host a new dog show, will also boast refreshments, entertainment and camping packages - and is offering trips to local shopping centres for those wanting to make the most out of their weekend. Billy added: ‘‘Last year we were happy to welcome members of the Caravan Club and Motorhome Owners Club to stay with us in Balmoral Park for the weekend.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that this year this arrangement will continue and will be extended to members of the Republic of Ireland branches of these clubs. We plan to have over 500 units camping with us over that weekend with something for all to see and do. For three nights stay plus three days admission, including a shuttle service into Lisburn city centre and Sprucefield on Friday and Saturday morning with entertainment on Saturday evening altogether for £20 / euros and £15 / euros for OAPs.’’ A free shuttle transfer service will also operate from Lisburn Railway Station to the show site at Balmoral Park.\n\nCalor’s Andrew Sands, Cylinder Sales Rep, added they can’t wait to : ‘‘Calor has been operating now for over 80 years across Northern and Republic of Ireland. When we exhibited at last year’s show, we were blown away by its success and the interest we received for Calor products.’’ Calor NI Leisure Show will run on Friday, November 2 from 2pm - 10pm and Saturday and Sunday, November 3 and 4 from 10am until 5pm.\n\n\nTickets and online\n\n\nVisit: \nnileisure\n and Like the NI Leisure Show Facebook page at: \nfacebook/N.I.LeisureShow\n for updates.\n

\n            \n\nLord Mayor, Cllr Julie Flaherty attended the launch adding: “The partnership with STA is a fantastic opportunity, and we are very excited to offer a fresh and innovative swim programme incorporating advanced swimming and Junior Leguard courses, as well as increasing grass roots level classes including baby, pre-school and beginner sessions,”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital le skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn. They have embraced this opportunity to enhance their swim scheme and we are delighted to be able to offer a current, cost-effective, quality programme that is appealing to learners of all ages and abilities. Together we can save lives through the teaching of swimming, first aid and lesaving. I look forward to working with the team to ensure their customers receive the highest quality lessons.”\n\nFor information on the getactiveabc Swim Academy, visit getactiveabc\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8633378.1536767392!/image/image.jpg","title":"international sheepdog trial was a tail wagging success","story":"\nThousands of local, national and international visitors descended on Dromore\u0026#8217s Gill Hall Estate for the International Sheepdog Trial 2018\n\n                \nMore than 600 dogs and 300 top handlers from the UK and Ireland went through their paces to secure a place for the competitive three-day event.

many women are being left traumatised by these implants","story":"\nA Banbridge woman who suffered 12 years of pain after having a vaginal mesh implant fitted is leading the fight for a moratorium on the use of the devices in Northern Ireland.\n\n                \nDrawing on her own painful experience, Jackie Harvey has set up an online support group to offer help and advice to local women about mesh implants, and raise awareness about the complications associated with them.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nJackie Harvey.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe implants are used by surgeons in an operation to treat pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence, which can be common after childbirth. But following reports of many women being left in agonising pain, there have been calls for the procedure to be banned, or at least suspended until the long-term safety of the implants can be evaluated.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAt the age of 36, a gynaecologist recommended that Jackie have a vaginal mesh implant fitted as a way of alleviating the urinary incontinence problem she’d been left with after having her second child.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nIn March 2005 she underwent surgery and it worked well. She recovered quickly, but unfortunately the plastic implant soon started to cause her problems.\n\n“After a year or two I noticed the tops of my legs were getting really painful and stf and I just thought I must be getting old, though I was only 38 at the time,” she explained.\n\n“I went to doctors ious times about the pain in my legs and got x-rays, but they didn’t really show anything. In 2009 I stopped doing any sort of impact exercise. I couldn’t run. I couldn’t really walk very far without getting pain in my legs, my feet and hips. I kept going back to the doctor and nothing was showing. In 2013 I was really struggling and I went to rheumatologist who told me that I didn’t have arthritis. I went to an orthopaedic consultant who told me he couldn’t see anything wrong with me. And then by 2015 I had seen an article online where a woman called Kath Sansom had started a campaign group called ‘Sling The Mesh’ and she was suffering from very similar complications to me, and it was just like a lightbulb going off in my head - this was 10 years after I’d had it put in.”\n\nJackie, who claims she wasn’t told about the risks so couldn’t make an informed decision about getting the implant, says the pain she suffered as a result of the device ruined 12 years of her le.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“It had a really detrimental impact on my le. I was struggling to walk and I was in pain and exhausted every single day of my le. I felt about 90. I was stf, sore and I just felt ill. For me to go to a doctor and my issues not to be recognised or accepted was just horrendous.” \n\nJackie was referred to a gynaecologist who told her the implant wasn’t causing her problems, but she refused to accept that was the case. She decided she had no other option but to challenge the doctor’s findings, and eventually had to pay for specialist treatment in England.\n\nThe 49-year-old office worker had a scan in London which showed that her implant was in the wrong place and was causing her pain. She finally underwent surgery at a hospital in Oxford in March this year to have her mesh removed.\n\n“As soon as I woke up the dference was amazing,” she said. “I’m still not perfect, but I’m an awful lot better than I was.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThrough the UK-wide ‘Sling The Mesh’ group, Jackie heard many stories of women from Northern Ireland who are suffering similar problems to those she experienced. So, in a bid to help them, she decided to set up her own local support group on Facebook, and it already has around 200 members.\n\n“This is a repeated story across the UK, not just in Northern Ireland,” she continued. “These ladies are going to their surgeons and they are being told ‘It’s not the mesh that’s causing your problems’, or ‘It’s all in your head’. It’s almost like they’re reading off a script.\n\n“These women are in pain, some of them are constantly getting infections, others are on antibiotics every day.\n\n“Their lives are a misery, they have no sex lives, their marriages have broken down, some have lost their jobs, they can’t enjoy their le, it’s just horrendous. That’s what spurred me on to push for some sort of recognition that there is an issue in Northern Ireland and something has to be done.”\n\nWhile the NHS says “the majority of women treated with mesh respond well to the treatment”, it acknowledges that “the Medicines \u0026amp Healthcare products Regulatory Agency  has received reports of complications associated with vaginal meshes - mostly regarding persistent pain, sexual problems, mesh exposure through vaginal tissues and occasionally injury to nearby organs, such as the bladder or bowel.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nJackie, who was the first woman to report her implant to the Northern Ireland Adverse Incident Centre at Stormont, is campaigning for the use of vaginal mesh implants to be suspended.\n\n“In Scotland there was a moratorium put on the use of mesh in 2014, by the Scottish government, and it doesn’t make sense that in the rest of the UK women aren’t afforded the same protection,” she said.\n\n“We want the use of mesh suspended whilst there is a review ongoing. We want the same protection that they have in Scotland. We also want a national register to register how many mesh complications there actually are.\n\n“So many women are being left traumatised by this. They are going to doctors for help and are just basically being fobbed off. It’s appalling. I hear the same story day in, day out from women looking for help and there’s nobody there to help them. Where do these women go for help?

He has two other units - one in Ballymena and another in Randalstown. \n\nThe singer and former Celebrity Masterchef contestant attended an event to celebrate his new venture at The Chelsea on the Lisburn Road.\n\nTalking to the Belfast , Shane, who opened his first Amen store last autumn, said: \"I didn\u0027t think the business would grow so fast but over the past 12 months but it has just taken off. I have good business partners from here so that\u0027s why I chose Northern Ireland as a location.\"\n\nSpeaking about his choice of sites, he added: \"I could\u0027ve opened in Belfast because it\u0027s the Mecca but I like to invest in smaller locations, and give back.\n\n\"I like Northern Ireland. I always find myself attracted to here and it\u0027s a great place to do business.\"\n\nShane, who is preparing for a final tour with Boyzone and will release, as part of the band, his last ever album, said his new store was ruffling the feathers of other footwear brands. \n\n\"I\u0027m already receiving phone calls about the cost of our products. Our shoes retail for around £39.99 and the industry standard for similar shoes also made of Italian leather would be £150. I\u0027m not going to sell them for that price when I know how much it costs to make them. \n\n\"For me it\u0027s about offering bargains. I never fell into that trap of buying designer clothing and I\u0027m not high fashion. Anything I create, I always try to be the best at it for the least.\"\n\nBoyzone\u0027s 25th Anniversary and Farewell Arena Tour commences in Belfast on January 23.\n\nAnd in November the band will release their last album, Thank You \u0026 Goodnight.\n\nShane, a father of two, said he \"felt good\" about the final tour with his pals but said he may feel dferently after the final performance.\n\n\"Ending it defines things for all of us.

I hope we will agree that the best way of resolving this is a General Election.\n\n“But I was elected to empower the members of the party.\n\n“So  conference makes a decision I will not walk away from it and I will act accordingly.”\n\nThere was a similar message from deputy Labour leader Tom Watson, who told The Observer: “Jeremy and I were elected in 2015 to give the Labour Party back to its members.\n\n\nWow. Is this confirmation from Labour that they want a 2nd referendum and won’t respect the 2016 vote? \nhttps:t.co/pSbpcSiQTT\n\n— Brandon Lewis  \nSeptember 22, 2018\n\n\n\n\n“So  the people’s party decide they want the people to have a final say on the deal, we have to respect the view of our members and we will go out and argue for it.”\n\nA YouGov survey of more than 1,000 Labour members for The Observer found 86% support a referendum on the outcome of Brexit talks, against just 8% who oppose it.\n\nEven in the North and Midlands, where many Labour constituencies voted Leave in 2016, there was overwhelming support – 86% and 88% respectively – for a second vote.\n\nSome 81% believe their standard of living would get worse after Brexit and 89% said it would be bad for jobs.\n\nTory chairman Brandon Lewis said: “The last pretence that Labour ever respected the democratic decision of the British people is rapidly disappearing.”\n\nAs Labour’s gathering began:\n\n– The party announced plans for a £560 million tax on holiday homes in England to fund measures to tackle homelessness and inequality\n\n– Mr Corbyn said his government would require businesses employing more than 250 people to reserve one-third of seats on boards for representatives of their workforce\n\n– Delegates will vote on changes to the way the party elects its leader\n\nAt Labour’s women’s conference on Saturday, the party faced a fresh row after a frontbencher praised the Militant-dominated council which ran Liverpool in the 1980s.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nJeremy Corbyn with Dawn Butler at Labour’s women’s conference \n\n\n\n\nDawn Butler hailed the example of left-wing former councillors who set an illegal budget in 1985 in protest at cuts to central government funding.\n\nHer comments were criticised by senior peers and fellow MPs in a further indication of the isions within the Parliamentary Labour Party.\n\nMs Butler said: “We are in Liverpool, where over 30 years ago the council stood up to Thatcher and said better to break the law than break the poor.”\n\nThe comments revived memories of the party’s battles of the 1980s, when then leader Neil Kinnock denounced “the grotesque chaos of a Labour council – a Labour council – hiring taxis to scuttle round a city handing out redundancy notices to its own workers”.\n\nHis intervention was a key moment in the drive to break the far-left Militant group’s hold over parts of the party, which ended with the expulsion of figures including Liverpool council’s deputy leader Derek Hatton.\n\nShadow equalities minister Ms Butler’s comments were criticised by fellow Labour frontbencher Baroness Thornton.\n\nShe said she was “surprised” Ms Butler praised a council that “issued redundancy notices to their own public sector employees, and failed to protect services too”.\n\n\nWell said \n@GlenysThornton\n \nhttps:t.co/FZIWSLejoZ\n\n— Lord Kennedy  \nSeptember 22, 2018\n\n\n\n\nFellow Lords frontbencher Lord Kennedy retweeted Lady Thornton, adding: “Well said.”\n\nMs Butler’s remarks were “far from what we should be standing for as a party”, one Labour MP told the Press Association.\n\nA Labour spokesman said: “The point Dawn was making was that like the Thatcher government of the 1980s, this Tory Government has prioritised tax cuts for the rich while cutting services like women’s refuges that save lives and keep women safe.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"time to hold our nerve over brexit may tells tories","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo

And it is a time to hold our nerve.\n\n“I have said many times that these negotiations would be tough, and they were always bound to be toughest in the final straight.\n\n“But what’s also clear is that many in Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP are trying to thwart Brexit at every step and seeking to exploit this moment for political gain.\n\n“Some are now openly advocating a second referendum and extending article 50 to delay Brexit, sending us right back to square one.

That is the kind of country we are,\u0027” he said.\n\nHowever, Mr Hunt refused to rule out the prospect the Government could now seek a simple, Canada-style free trade agreement – favoured by many Tory MPs – rather than continuing with the more ambitious Chequers proposals.\n\n“I am not dismissing anything,” he said, adding, however, that a Canada-style agreement, unlike Chequers, would not address the issue of the Irish border.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"10 moving images people think would make","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It is understood the day she will give evidence, and whether she will do so in public, remain up for discussion.\n\nThe committee has pencilled in a possible vote to decide whether to recommend Mr Kavanaugh’s nomination to the full Senate for Monday.\n\nA senior official at the White House said the letter amounts to “an ask to continue ‘negotiations’ without committing to anything”.\n\nHe added: “It’s a clever way to push off the vote Monday without committing to appear Wednesday.”.\n\nMs Ford, a 51-year-old Calornia psychology professor, claims an inebriated Mr Kavanaugh pinned her on a bed, muffled her cries and tried removing her clothes when they were both teenagers in the 1980s.\n\nMr Kavanaugh, a District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals judge, has repeatedly denied the accusation.\n\n\nJudge Brett Kavanaugh is a fine man, with an impeccable reputation, who is under assault by radical left wing politicians who don’t want to know the answers, they just want to destroy and delay.

I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn date, time, and place!”\n\nOn Saturday, vice-president Mike Pence described Mr Kavanaugh as “a man of integrity with impeccable credentials”.\n\nHe said the judge’s record and career deserve “the respect of every member of the United States Senate”.\n\nHe made no reference to Ms Ford, but he said he is confident Mr Kavanaugh will soon join the high court.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kavanaugh and accuser agree to testify on thursday","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The person said Mr Kavanaugh would also appear.\n\nSome details of the hearing, such as the order of their appearance, remained in negotiation. Talks were expected to continue on Sunday.\n\nThe tentative accord could bring to a close days of high-stakes brinkmanship that have roiled Washington ahead of midterm elections and threated to jeopardize Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the court.\n\nTensions have been running on overdrive since Ms Ford, a 51-year-old college professor in Calornia, went public with her allegation that Mr Kavanaugh assaulted her when they were at a house party in high school. \n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley \n\n\n\n\nMr Kavanaugh, 53, an appellate court judge, denied the allegation and said he wanted to testy as soon as possible to clear his name.\n\nMs Ford initially indicated she wanted to tell her story to the committee, but talks dragged on as her lawyers negotiated terms of her appearance.\n\nRepublicans grew frustrated as Ms Ford’s lawyers insisted on a hearing next Thursday rather than Monday or even Wednesday and made other requests, some of which the committee chairman, Senator Chuck Grassley rejected. \n\nDemocrats, against the backdrop of the #MeToo movement, countered that Ms Ford should be shown respect and given accommodation to tell her story.\n\nAs the talks continued, Mr Grassley countered that he would end the stand-off by scheduling a Monday vote on whether to recommend Mr Kavanaugh’s nomination to the full Senate. \n\nMeanwhile, Republicans viewed Ms Ford’s requests as a way to delay voting on President Donald Trump’s nominee.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, a senior official at the White House said Ms Ford’s requests amounted to “a clever way to push off the vote Monday without committing to appear Wednesday”. \n\nIn a single tweet on Friday, Mr Trump broke his silence to cast doubt on Ford’s story in ways Republicans had been carefully trying to avoid.\n\n\nJudge Brett Kavanaugh is a fine man, with an impeccable reputation, who is under assault by radical left wing politicians who don’t want to know the answers, they just want to destroy and delay. Facts don’t matter. I go through this with them every single day in D.C.\n— Donald J. Trump  \nSeptember 21, 2018\n\n\n\n\nMs Ford’s lawyers Debra Katz and Lisa Banks had said that many aspects of Mr Grassley’s latest offer were “fundamentally inconsistent” with the committee’s promise of a “fair, impartial investigation”. \n\nThey said they remained disappointed by the “bullying” that “tainted the process”.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, vice president Mike Pence called Mr Kavanaugh “a man of integrity with impeccable credentials”. \n\nHe expressed confidence that Republicans “will manage this confirmation properly with the utmost respect for all concerned” and said he expected Mr Kavanaugh to join the high court soon.\n\nPatience among Republicans was running thin. The GOP has faced enormous pressure from its base of conservative leaders and voters to swtly approve Mr Kavanaugh, who would become the second of Trump’s nominees to sit on the nation’s highest court.\n\nMr Grassley had set a Friday night deadline for Ms Ford to agree to the committee’s latest terms for her appearance. \n\nMr Grassley said that  she missed that deadline, he would scrap the hearing and his committee would vote on sending Mr Kavanaugh’s nomination to the full Senate.\n\nMs Ford’s lawyers asked for another day. In a tweet aimed at Mr Kavanaugh shortly before midnight, Mr Grassley said he was giving them additional time.\n\n\nJudge Kavanaugh I just granted another extension to Dr Ford to decide  she wants to proceed w the statement she made last week to testy to the senate She shld decide so we can move on I want to hear her. I hope u understand. It’s not my normal approach to b indecisive\n— ChuckGrassley  \nSeptember 22, 2018\n\n\n\n\n“She shld decide so we can move on. I want to hear her. I hope u understand. It’s not my normal approach to b indecisive,” Grassley wrote.\n\nIn backing away from deadlines and demands, Mr Grassley underscored the sensitivity with which Senate Republicans have tried handling Ms Ford.\n\nMs Katz had called Mr Grassley’s original deadline “arbitrary” and said its “sole purpose is to bully Dr Ford and deprive her of the ability to make a considered decision that has le-altering implications for her and her family”.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Grassley had rejected concessions Ms Ford wanted  she is tell her story publicly before the committee.\n\nMr Grassley turned down Ms Ford’s request that only senators, not lawyers, be allowed to ask questions. \n\nThe committee’s 11 Republicans — all men — have been seeking an outside female attorney to interrogate Ms Ford.\n\nHe also rejected her proposal that she testy after Mr Kavanaugh.\n\nMr Grassley’s stance reflected a desire by Mr Trump and Republican leaders to usher Mr Kavanaugh on to the high court by the October 1 start of its new session and before the November elections.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"maldives election begins amid opposition cries of unfairness","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Senior campaign official Ahmed Shahid was named in the warrant as a suspect. \n\nSaturday’s raid was the latest sign of a government crackdown against the opposition, raising fears that the election may be rigged to favour Mr Gayoom’s party.\n\nMr Gayoom used his first term in office to consolidate power, jailing opponents, including his half brother, a former president, and two supreme court justices, and asserting control over the courts.\n\nThe European Union said it was not sending election observers because the Males had failed to meet the basic conditions for monitoring.\n\nThe country’s British ambassador, James Dauris, tweeted: “In view of events in Males, it’s easy to understand why so many people are concerned about what might happen on Election Day.”\n\nThe polls close at 4pm and results are expected after 10pm, election officials have said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"collaboration change event inspired 50th anniversary civil","story":"\n\nProgressive movements from

However that didn\u0026rsquot faze him as he lined up in front of the live ITV4 cameras.\n\nHe stormed past championship leader Zamparelli on the opening lap to grab fourth place, before posting the fastest lap of the race sas he began to close in on the podium battle and pile the pressure on George Gamble ahead.\n\nSome robust defending from Gamble saw Harper forced onto the grass on a couple of occasions, but he was able to find his way past heading into Copse corner on the penultimate lap to take third position, which he held through to the finish.\n\nA time penalty for the driver ahead though ensured the Dromore High School student ended the weekend with a second place finish as part of a superb one-two-three finish for the JTR team, with the result putting Harper just one point shy of fourth in the championship standings.\n\nHarper said afterwards: \u0026ldquoI feel I\u0026rsquom really in my groove in the series now and I\u0026rsquom going to be giving it everything to try and continue our great pace and end the year in style at Brands Hatch GP, a circuit I love.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch woman’s invite to join charity Twilight Walk  ","story":"\t\t\t\nBALLYNAHINCH woman Rosalind Steenson is urging people to join her on the forthcoming Marie Curie Twilight Walk to raise funds for the leading cancer charity.\n\nThe event \u0026mdash which takes place on Friday, September 28 at 7.30pm \u0026mdash will be held in the beautul grounds of Barnett Demesne in South Belfast to raise funds for an organisation which provides care to people with a terminal illness in their own homes or in one of its nine hospices.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe charity is also a leader in research into the best ways of caring for people with a terminal illness and all the\u0026nbsp\n\nservices it provides are free of charge, with around 70% of its income coming via donations with the balance of funds provided by the NHS.\n\nThose taking part in the forthcoming Twilight Walk can expect much more than just a walk as there will be a festival atmosphere with music, entertainment and a spectacular firework display to finish off.\n\nPeople take part in the walk for all sorts of reasons, with a large proportion walking in memory of someone they have lost.\u0026nbsp\n\nRosalind will be remembering her best friend of over 30 years, Michelle Watterson, who died in the Marie Curie Hospice in Belfast in July.\n\n\u0026ldquoMichelle was diagnosed with cancer for the second time three years ago and, unfortunately, it spread to other parts of her body and became terminal, she explained.\n\n\u0026ldquoShe spent her final ten days at the hospice where she received exceptional care.

Even  you start out walking by yourself, you are never alone along the Camino.\n\nThe Camino Portugues, or the Portuguese Way, spans from Lisbon to Santiago de Compostela, the final destination being St James\u0026rsquo Church, where the body of St James is said to lay.\n\nIt travels through the province of Galicia in northern Spain, going through the cities of Porto and Pontevedra and along the coastline of Sanxenxo, the Cies Islands, and Baiona.\n\nWhile this Camino way was shorter that the more arduous Camino Del Norte throughout the northern Basque area of Spain, Edmund said that there were other challenges.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThe biggest challenge was walking in extreme heat, said Edmund. \u0026ldquoIt was 38 degrees on one day but for the rest of the days it was around 28 degrees. Staying hydrated was also a challenge.\n\nEdmund also enjoys the feeling of having to travel from one hostel to another with just the bare basics, as he says it gives him an understanding of what le is like for those with transitory lestyles.\n\nHowever, he adds: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a great togetherness and camaraderie as everyone is doing it together.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"First look inside new £16m Down Leisure Centre with ‘wow factor’  ","story":"\t\t\t\nTHE new \u0026pound16m Down Leisure Centre, which opens its doors to the public in November, has the wow factor those closely involved in its design always promised it would have.\n\nWhile very much a community facility, the ultra-modern and futuristic three-storey building boasts a stunning range of facilities which would rival any of those more commonly found in leisure complexes attached to five star hotels.\n\nWhile the finishing touches are being put to the 6,500 square metre, three-storey Market Street building, the Down Recorder was last week given a sneak preview of the stunning new centre that has been a long time coming.\u0026nbsp\n\nPlans for the new complex were first discussed well over a decade ago and despite raised eyebrows about building the centre in front of the ageing facility it will replace, everything has gone smoothly with council officials delighted they now have a leisure complex that will be the envy of many.\u0026nbsp\n\nThey are confident that once the centre opens its doors to the public, people will recognise the long wait for a new leisure complex has been worth it, with the new vitality suite on the top floor which boasts a sauna, steam room and small pool with its own mini fountain, particularly stunning.\n\nThe spacious and airy entrance foyer opens up to reveal two swimming pools, one of which has a moveable floor. There is a reception, lobby area and ground floor studio with Newry, Mourne and Down Council\u0026rsquos corporate colours a recurring theme throughout the building.\n\nThere are dedicated changing facilities on the ground floor with the pools designed for use by people of all abilities. The smaller of the two pools measures eight metres by 13, while the main 25-metre pool boats six lanes and electronic touch pads to time races.\n\nThroughout the building, every effort has been made to flood it with as much natural light as possible which helps provide the centre with its imposing look. A boccia court designed for use by disabled bowlers is also located on the ground floor, with this particular area also doubling up as a dance studio and multipurpose hall.\n\nCouncil officials have also revealed the new centre\u0026rsquos ground floor level is higher than the main road outside to protect the building from future flooding that may occur in this part of the town and which was a signicant problem a number of years ago.\n\nModern sound proofing techniques have been deployed throughout the building, particularly in the swimming pool and main hall areas. When the natural light fades,\u0026nbsp subtle, state-of-the-art LED lighting illuminates the building, adding to its unique character.\n\nMains gas was connected to the building which also boasts a combined heat and power source which helps minimise its carbon footprint with photovoltaic cells on the roof helping heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas. In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns into warm air.\n\nSo-called ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building on the ground floor, also reducing glare and preventing people from outside looking in.\n\nThere are miles of pipework and electric cables with the plant room \u0026mdash the new leisure complex\u0026rsquos nerve centre \u0026mdash resembling something akin to the interior of a futuristic space ship.\n\nThe impressive four court hall on the first floor can be used for a iety of sports, including badminton, basketball and five-a-side football. One of the walls has also been specially marked at the request of the Down Handball Club.\u0026nbsp\n\nAs with the ground floor swimming pools, there is also a dedicated viewing area over the main hall, while nearby there is a dedicated area for racquet ball and handball.\n\nA spin studio and multi-purpose area are also located on the second floor, with all music and sound systems built in and controlled from the main reception area.\n\nThe third floor boasts spectacular views across to Down Cathedral, the Dromara Hills, the Mournes and across Dunleath Park towards the Vianstown area.\n\nWhen not admiring the views, users can immerse themselves in getting fit or pampering themselves in the vitality suite. The third floor boasts an 85-station fitness suite and fitness room that can be hired by sports clubs to use. Council officials say the use of the top floor will evolve over time and has the capacity to respond to need.\n\nEach of the eight beams which hold the top floor in place weigh 35 tonnes and had to be put in place overnight as part of a military-style operation which involved heavy lting gear and went without a hitch.\n\nThe vitality area extenuates the wow factor, featuring a relaxation pool alongside steam and sauna rooms, with the careful attention to detail in the design process accentuating this particular area where people can relax and unwind. There is also a dedicated lt to take people from the swimming pool area directly to the top floor.\n\nCouncil director Michael Lipsett said the new leisure centre was top of his in-tray when he joined the local authority eight years ago.\n\nSince then, he has attended countless meetings to propel the scheme forward and is delighted ratepayers will soon have an opportunity to use a centre which the district can be justiably be very proud of.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe long wait has been worth it and this is a fantastic building which I have no doubt people will appreciate and enjoy. It will also be a pleasure for our leisure staff to move to a modern building.\n\nMr Lipsett added: \u0026ldquoI have watched the building grow from the drawing board and to finally see it nearly complete is really something else. Everyone associated with the building, from the designers to the builders and the councillors who supported it financially deserve credit.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoTheir collective efforts have produced a magnicent building that would not be out of place in the private sector. That\u0026rsquos how good this building is.\n\nOnce staff move in and the old leisure complex has been decommissioned, it will be bulldozed to provide a major new car park at the rear. Ahead of the opening, council officials plan to organise a series of visits to provide the public with a glimpse of the spectacular new 21st century leisure centre.\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C September 19%2C 1978  ","story":"\t\t\t\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Downpatrick\u0026rsquos old town hall is to be turned into a training centre for out of work teenagers in an exciting \u0026pound500,000 initiative to combat the district\u0026rsquos growing youth unemployment problem.\n\nWork has already begun on clearing the hall and the centre is to expected to be fully operational by January next year with room for up to 30 trainees. Organised by a newly named community group \u0026mdash Lecale Training Workshops Ltd \u0026mdash the scheme will cater for young people between the ages of 16 and 19.\n\nLatest unemployment figures put the total number out of work in that age group in Down district at almost 500. The aim\u0026nbsp\n\nbehind the new centre is to give them work experience and provide them with basic skills in a iety of jobs.\n\nThe idea for the new community group is the brainchild of Mr Bill Hampton, of Down District Trades Union Council. Lending a hand is Downpatrick man Mr Malachi Curran, who is head of the Department of Manpower Services in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe whole idea has ben introduced to help young people who have been unemployed to prepare for work, Mr Curran said. \u0026ldquoIt isn\u0026rsquot an apprenticeship, but rather is aimed at teaching them basic skills and perhaps helping them choose the type of career they want to follow.\n\nMr Curran said that they hoped to be able to put anything up to 250 young people through the course inside five years.\n\nCLOUGH \u0026mdash The death toll on a road outside Clough climbed to five in three years when a young motorcyclist was killed on Sunday. He was 19 year-old Andrew Stephen Martin, of Ascot Park in Belfast.\n\nMr Martin was involved in a head-on collision with a car at a spot known as the Rectory on the Ballykinlar-Clough Road. The accident happened at approximately 2pm and Mr Martin died about two hours later in Downe Hospital.\n\nThe driver of the car, who was a soldier based at Ballykinlar camp, was taken to the Downe, but was later transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast suffering from severe facial injuries.\n\nMr Frank Greeves, a local lorry driver, told the Recorder that it one of the most dangerous bends he had ever seen. He asked: \u0026ldquoHow many more lives have to be lost before something is done?\n\nA DoE spokesman said there were no plans to carry out work on the road.\n\nSTRANGFORD \u0026mdash A party of 130 mentally and physically handicapped children and young adults went cruising on Strangford Lough free of charge on Tuesday \u0026mdash courtesy of the Downpatrick Division of the DoE Roads Service.\n\nThe group\u0026rsquo aged between 12 and 25, came from the Downpatrick area and were accompanied by parents and volunteers. They left Strangford in the morning on the MV Portaferry to explore wildle and points of interest on the lough.\n\nThe idea of the cruise originated with the staff of the Downpatrick Roads Division who realised that the ferry \u0026mdash often used for educational and pleasure cruises by many groups \u0026mdash was also ideally suited for use by handicapped people because of its ramps and high sides.\n\nThe crew for the outing worked their rest day without payment and the other overheads for running the boat were written off by the DoE as normal test running. Ready Mix concrete stepped in to provide refreshments.\n\nMr Ray Carter, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State and Minister with responsibility for the DoE, was there to see the children off on their cruise.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis a fine and warming gesture by the crews of the ferries to give up their free time. I know to look at the happy faces around me that their kindness is very well received.\n\nKILLYLEAGH \u0026mdash A scheme to turn Killyleagh harbour into a boat and leisure centre has proved to be the straw which broke the back of a group of local residents. Already 104 residents have signed a petition against the scheme which has received outline planning permission.\n\nPut forward by Mr Robert Morrow, a local coal merchant and businessman, it sets out his hopes to construct pontoon jetties, a clubhouse, toilet block, bar, restaurant, chandlery, workshop and car parking spaces.\n\nThe residents, while believing that there is an urgent need for the harbour to be brought up to an acceptable standard, feel that the scheme falls short of that is required and that it is likely to have a \u0026ldquomost undesirable impact on the residential area surrounding the site.\n\nRATHMULLAN \u0026mdash The Rathmullan Mound is to stay \u0026mdash or at least the best part of it is. After four months of intensive archaeological digging, experts have ruled that the Mound is too valuable to be removed, though they have taken away the top section.\n\nBut although the Department of the environment has put a protection order on the site it will not be taking the Mound into public ownership in the way it has done with other ancient monuments.\n\nThat decision is expected to anger local historians and Down councillors, who have been battling to save the monument from demolition and who have called for it to be taken into public charge.\n\nThe Mound is a rath dating back to early Christian times, with evidence of five dferent settlements from 700 AD to the 16th century. The top section, which is Norman, has been removed, though all of the archaeologist\u0026rsquos findings have been carefully preserved.\n\nOne of the most exciting discoveries was a large souterrain, or underground passage. This 1,000 year-old chamber was used by early inhabitants of the area and is still as perfect in parts as it was when it was first built.\n\nBALLYGOWAN \u0026mdash Female wrestling comes to Ballygowan in a big way tonight when Blackfoot Sue takes the ring at The Squire\u0026rsquos Inn.\n\nThe shapely wrestler from the USA gets to grips with another lady grappler, Manchester\u0026rsquos Miss Lena. The bout is sure to be the star attraction at this initial venture by the Ballygowan night spot.\n\nBut several other star bouts are on the programme, including world middleweight champion Adrian Street, Prince Jitsu and Bruce McDonald.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash Hugh Duggan, the newly appointed progressional at Ardglass Golf Club, took up his position at the seaside club on Monday. Twenty four year-old Hugh, formerly attached to Kirkistown Castle Golf Club, becomes only the second professional golfer appointed to the club in its 84-year history.\n\nHis appointment, combined with many other improvements both on and off the course, has made Ardglass one of the most progressive clubs in Co Down.\n\nBALLYNAHINCH \u0026mdash Ballynahinch piper Ian Jess took second place in the All-Ireland solo piping championships at Banbridge Technical College on Saturday.\n\nIan was placed second in the march section and third in the reel and strathspey section, but had to be content to finish runner-up behind Tom Anderson, from Dublin.\n\nIan is tutored by Joe McAdam, the pipe major at Ballynahinch, and is now regarded as one of the best pipers in the country.\n\nKILMORE \u0026mdash A former pupil of Down High School has obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Lancaster. He is John James McIlhone, from Kilmore, Crossgar, who graduated with a second class honours BA ision one in history.\n\nIn the junior section Richard Parkes, of Field Marshal Montgomery, came out on top.\n\nSAINTFIELD \u0026mdash A woman was taken to hospital on Saturday night after two cars were involved in an accident on the Crossgar Road, Saintfield.

This was the product of gathering together his late father\u0026rsquos copious notes on the history of the town.\n\nThe society\u0026rsquos other founding members included Mr Robert Brown, an agent for Dunleath Estates who was treasurer, Down County Council official Mr Robert Maxwell, who was secretary, and the Rev John Radclfe, who was chairman.\n\nOther society members included other local clergy, headmasters, representatives of professions and local businesses and iniduals who were interested in local history.\n\nThe first meeting took place in Denvir\u0026rsquos Hotel where it continued to meet every month for several decades. At this meeting the objects of the Society were outlined \u0026ndash to encourage and foster interest in the history and traditions of Downpatrick and County Down, music, arts and sciences and the architecture of buildings and monuments of historic or artistic value in the area.\n\nThe following day\u0026rsquos Down Recorder reported that Mr Parkinson gave the first lecture of The Downe Society, fittingly on the subject, The Story of Downpatrick, in which he spoke about man reaching Ireland some seven thousand years ago, through to the ravages of the Norsemen, De Courcy and the Normans, the Fitzgeralds, Cromwells, Southwells and into the eighteen century.\u0026nbsp\n\nHis closing words were on the urban administration of the day with a sense of the historic past and the hope of future well-being.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn 1948, the formation of the Society was a signicant attempt to bring together people from all sections of the community, particularly across the religious ide. Both The Downe Society, and its later partner, the Lecale Historical Society, maintained a proud non-sectarian record.\u0026nbsp\n\nOver the years, the society hosted many outstanding speakers including a Lord Chief Justice, local author Lynn C.

Even  you didn\u0026rsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.\u0026nbsp\n  After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. It\u0026rsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.\n  But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.\n  For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.\n  That\u0026rsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.\u0026nbsp\n  Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.\u0026nbsp\n  For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.\n  Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.\n  I\u0026rsquod say that you can\u0026rsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.\n  It\u0026rsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really don\u0026rsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I don\u0026rsquot think they\u0026rsquore going about it in the best way.\n  If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.\n  If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as you\u0026rsquore passing.\u0026nbsp\n  If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to see  there are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isn\u0026rsquot going to do me much good.\n  A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isn\u0026rsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.\u0026nbsp\n  As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the store\u0026rsquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where they\u0026rsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.\n  We wouldn\u0026rsquot have had the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that there\u0026rsquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.\u0026nbsp\n  We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go there  they don\u0026rsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast aren\u0026rsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.\n  The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but it\u0026rsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, we\u0026rsquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.\n  We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so there\u0026rsquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.\u0026nbsp\n  People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses can\u0026rsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. It\u0026rsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.\u0026nbsp\n  If Translink brought back open  tickets, I\u0026rsquom sure we\u0026rsquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break. Some people are understandably cautious of driving in unfamiliar places, especially towns but four hours on a bus in one day doesn\u0026rsquot leave much time for relaxing or shopping.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

This year the RUAS are delighted to welcome Paul Trapp, who is travelling from Wisconsin, USA, to judge. The event is also a great chance to interact with 200 dairy related trade exhibitors on the most relevant technological advances, dficulties and solutions in the industry. \u0026nbsp\n  Rhonda Geary, Operations Director, RUAS said: \u0026ldquo2015 saw the move of Winter Fair to our new purpose built exhibition venue, Eikon Exhibition Centre at Balmoral Park. The move has worked brilliantly and attracted one of the largest attendances to date. In preparation for the 31st Winter Fair we have increased the livestock accommodation and now have stalling, washing and milking facilities for 200 cattle. There is 4750m2 of exhibition space and a full house of 200 trade stands. \u0026nbsp\n  During the Winter Fair there is a busy Seminar Suite with talks presented every half hour from 11am until 3.30pm.\n  Dr. John Bailey from AFBI will speak about better phosphorous management, Bobby Irwin of United Feeds presents a paper on getting the lactation to the right start and Roberta Simmons of the YFCU and Barclay Bell, President of the UFU will speak about succession on farms.\n  CAFRE\u0026rsquos Martin Mulholland will be advising on feed efficiency this winter, making optimum use of grass silage \u0026nbspwhile Christopher Osborne form the UFU will speak about dairy commodity markets and the prospects for 2017.\n  Dr. Sam Strain and Sharon Verner from the Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland will look at improved biosecurity and BVD while Jessica Sloss from Red Tractor, speaks about the farm assurance scheme.\n  The live calf rearing demonstration will be making a  for the 2016 Show. \u0026nbspGorteade Cow Care owned by Barry O\u0026rsquoLoughlin will be displaying a fully ing calf igloo with veranda and Heatwave ad lib calf feeder.\u0026nbsp\n  One of the innovative technological features at next week\u0026rsquos Winter Fair will be the Northern Ireland launch of the CalfApp and Calf Cloud by Volac which won gold at Eurotier in Hannover. It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres. Cows grazed outdoors using a Lely Grazeway \u0026nbsp\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

We are absolutely delighted with the set-up here, and last year for us was just unbelievable. This has given us the space to not only expand the products which were on offer last year but to incorporate new leisure pursuits such as fishing. I’m sure the fishing lake will be a great attraction in the new hall this year with the opportunity for the public to try their hand at casting. We also have more boats, more cycles and more outdoor gear on display with both Decathlon and Go Outdoors coming onboard. The thing we love about the Leisure Show is that local businesses come together and work as a team - I think it is just brilliant.’’\n\nBilly also delightedly announced that renowned chef Paula McIntyre will be at the show for three days with three demonstrations per day.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nShow sponsors including Downtown Radio and main sponsor, Calor NI\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nPaula enthused: ‘‘I’m delighted to be involved. Confined cooking facilities needn’t be a barrier to delicious food. \n\n‘‘I’ll be using the best of local ingredients to cook up dishes that can be prepared on a couple of rings or butane camper stove, I have first-hand experience of cooking in a campervan so it’ll be great to be able to show what can be done to the wider audience!’’\n\nWith a launch which included an eye-popping somersaulting spectacle from the Go-Fyt Warriors, who will be hosting a fun-fuelled challenge on the day suitable for all ages, this year’s show promises to provide all-round entertainment for the entire family. Representative Kevin Howlette said: ‘‘We’re delighted to have Go-Fyt Warrior here in a series of races and challenges for you all to become NI Warriors. Once you enter our ninja challenge your le will never be the same again.’’\n\nThe family-friendly event, which this year will also host a new dog show, will also boast refreshments, entertainment and camping packages - and is offering trips to local shopping centres for those wanting to make the most out of their weekend. Billy added: ‘‘Last year we were happy to welcome members of the Caravan Club and Motorhome Owners Club to stay with us in Balmoral Park for the weekend.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that this year this arrangement will continue and will be extended to members of the Republic of Ireland branches of these clubs. We plan to have over 500 units camping with us over that weekend with something for all to see and do. For three nights stay plus three days admission, including a shuttle service into Lisburn city centre and Sprucefield on Friday and Saturday morning with entertainment on Saturday evening altogether for £20 / euros and £15 / euros for OAPs.’’ A free shuttle transfer service will also operate from Lisburn Railway Station to the show site at Balmoral Park.\n\nCalor’s Andrew Sands, Cylinder Sales Rep, added they can’t wait to : ‘‘Calor has been operating now for over 80 years across Northern and Republic of Ireland. When we exhibited at last year’s show, we were blown away by its success and the interest we received for Calor products.’’ Calor NI Leisure Show will run on Friday, November 2 from 2pm - 10pm and Saturday and Sunday, November 3 and 4 from 10am until 5pm.\n\n\nTickets and online\n\nVisit: \nnileisure\n and Like the NI Leisure Show Facebook page at: \nfacebook/N.I.LeisureShow\n for updates.\n

Zealand and France. Whisked egg whites and very little flour make them wonderfully light, and the ground almonds make them really moist. Traditionally they\u0026#8217re small cakes, but here I tip the batter into a baking dish and cook it whole,\" explains chef Yotam Ottolenghi.\n\n                \n\"You can make the batter well in advance here,  you want to get ahead – it keeps well in the fridge up to a day ahead – but don’t macerate the fruit for this amount of time as it will become too juicy.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"Serve with custard, vanilla ice cream or cream. The fruit can be played around with, depending on the season,\" he adds. \"Raspberries and peaches can be used in the early summer months, for example.\"\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHOW TO MAKE YOTAM OTTOLENGHI’S PLUM, BLACKBERRY AND BAY\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nFRIAND BAKE...\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Place the blackberries and plums in a bowl with the vanilla extract, sugar, bay leaves and half a teaspoon of cinnamon. Set aside for 30 minutes. Don’t be tempted to leave them sitting around for longer than this, as the fruit will become too juicy.\n\n2. Preheat the oven to 190°C fan.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n3. Mix the flour, icing sugar, ground almonds, the remaininghalf a teaspoon cinnamon and salt in a separate large bowl. Set aside.\n\n4. Lightly whisk the egg whites by hand for 30 seconds, so they just start to froth. Stir into the flour mixture, along with the melted butter, until combined.\n\n5. Tip the batter into a 20 x 30cm parchment-lined baking dish and top evenly with the fruit and juices. Bake for 40 minutes, covering the dish with foil for the final 10 minutes, until the batter is golden-brown and the fruit is bubbling. Set aside for 10 minutes before serving.\n\nOttolenghi Simple by Yotam Ottolenghi with Tara Wigley and Esme Howarth, photography by Jonathan Lovekin, is published by Ebury Press, priced £25.

employer has reluctantly admitted that it indirectly made money from the RHI scheme \u0026#8211 but insisted that she did not realise that until after RHI closed.\n\n                \nJanet McCollum, who was replaced as chief executive of Moy Park earlier this year, told the RHI Inquiry that although she now accepts that her former company received an “indirect benefit” from the publicly-funded scheme, that has become clear from the public inquiry’s work.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nJanet McCollum pictured with DUP ministers Arlene Foster and Lord Morrow\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHowever, Mrs McCollum, who is a trained accountant and was Moy Park’s chief finance officer before being promoted to head the company, said she was ignorant of that fact at the time when the company was reaping that financial reward.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe company, which supplies 30% of all UK chicken, had four boilers of its own, but its farmers – to whom Moy Park advertised the scheme – have between them 40% of the boilers on the scheme.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nEarlier evidence to the inquiry from one of those farmers showed how Moy Park’s complex business model meant that the benefits which appeared to be going to farmers ultimately began to accrue to the company itself – with taxpayers’ money indirectly ending up in the bank account of its Brazilian parent company.\n\nIn her written evidence, Mrs McCollum said: “Moy Park has not indirectly earned any RHI scheme tarf income”.\n\nMoy Park is well connected at the top of Stormont, with the inquiry having already revealed that Arlene Foster’s former adviser, Andrew Crawford, tipped the firm off that RHI was to close – leading to it immediately ramping up its attempts to get as many boilers on the scheme as possible.\n\nHowever, under close questioning at the inquiry yesterday Mrs McCollum accepted that the lucrative RHI payments to its farmers not only helped it to rapidly expand its business by funding better heating systems for poultry houses but also helped make up for a shortfall between the fuel allowance which Moy Park was prepared to pay to its farmers and the cost of the fuel which they required to raise chickens.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIn June, she told the inquiry that she was never made aware that RHI was financially benefiting the company in an indirect way.\n\nWhen asked  she ought to have been told of that, Mrs McCollum was initially vague in her answer, saying that after reviewing information last year she could see that there was “potentially” an indirect benefit to the company.\n\nEventually, she went on to say: “So, looking at the indirect benefit and the evidence that’s been brought to the inquiry that I’ve seen, I can understand how it might be considered that Moy Park might have benefited indirectly from the RHI scheme from the commercial arrangements that have been long-standing in place with the growers.”\n\nShe went on to say “I can understand how it might be considered that Moy Park might have had an indirect benefit.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nShe said that no-one in the company ever brought it to her attention that the company was benefiting from RHI.\n\nWhen asked  she was surprised that no one had told her that, she said she believed her staff were trying to ensure that they did meet all the farmers’ fuel costs  – even though not doing so was financially advantageous to the company.\n\nWhen asked the question again, she paused before insisting: “The company did not see at that point in time an indirect benefit.”\n\nSir Patrick Coghlin then intervened to say: “So you were not surprised?” She said: “No, because the emphasis was on the over-usage, chairman.”\n\nThen, having initially conceded that RHI “might be considered” an indirect benefit to the company, after being pressed she paused before saying: “Yes, it’s an indirect benefit...”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nSir Patrick then pressed her on when she first became aware that benefit. She said: “I first became aware of that through, having left the business, through the inquiry’s evidence that had been brought and the questions that have been asked.”\n\nJanet McCollum repeatedly told the inquiry that Moy Park’s decision to pay its farmers less for heat than she now accepts they needed was out of a desire to discourage wasteful heat, rather than an attempt to increase the company’s profits.\n\nThe former Moy Park chief executive was repeatedly pressed on how she could have been unaware of how the company she headed was profiting from the scheme.\n\nInquiry counsel Donal Lunny put it to the witness: “So you were never aware of that indirect benefit – which you now accept existed – during your time as chief executive. \n\n“To go back, again, to a question I asked earlier, does that now surprise you – that nobody within your organisation had brought that to your attention?”\n\nMrs McCollum replied: “The company and the team, I believe, were trying to do the right thing in a situation where there was a lot of heightened awareness around usage. The focus was on ensuring responsible usage of heat.”\n\nPressed again to answer the question of whether it surprised her she wasn’t told about it, she said: “Well, it would surprise me  the team had seen it as an indirect benefit. \n\n“It wasn’t recognised as an indirect benefit – but I can see how it is an indirect benefit. It wasn’t talked about as an indirect benefit.”\n\nMr Lunny took the former Moy Park boss to documentary evidence which the inquiry has compelled the company to release which shows that it was aware that it was reasonable for farmers to use about double the amount of heat that it was prepared to pay for.\n\nHe put it to her that the RHI benefit to the company must have been “obvious” to it as it calculated how much to pay its farmers for heat.\n\nMrs McCollum did not directly answer the question, which Mr Lunny then asked a second time.\n\n“She again did not directly answer the question, prompting the barrister to ask it a third time.\n\nMrs McCollum eventually said that it had not been obvious to her that RHI was benefiting the company of which she was chief executive until after she had left her role.\n\nUnder questioning from the inquiry’s technical assessor, Janet McCollum agreed that as a business Moy Park would have kept a tight rein on costs and would not have knowingly paid its farmers more than they needed for their expenses.\n\nEnergy expert Keith MacLean put it to her that it was clear that the company was keeping very detailed information so that it set its allowances for farmers at a rate which did not disadvantage it by being overly generous.\n\nHe said that  Moy Park was not able to do those calculations “it sounds quite surprising for an organisation of your size and importance that you’re incapable of doing what the industry from both sides – the consumers and suppliers [of RHI boilers] – seem to have been able to do from a few weeks after the scheme came into force. Are you really describing a deficiency in the ability of your organisation to do those sums?”\n\nMrs McCollum said: “I believe the organisation took the evidence that was available to them at that point in time...on the implementation of the fuel allowance for biomass, we immediately increased it by 50% OK? That’s why I’m saying there was a really signicant increase in the energy allowance. Subsequent to that, the year later, looking at the GB evidence, we brought it up. I believe the dferential in fuel allowance is relatively small.”\n\nDr MacLean said he found it “very hard to understand” how a huge firm like Moy Park would not be able to do the same sums which RHI claimants were doing and thus concluding “there is a benefit here accruing to us because we are paying less than it is costing the farmers – but we’re quite comfortable, morally, to be doing that because we know that they’re making a killing on the subsidy”.\n\nMrs McCollum said: “I understand the perspective you’re taking there and I think it’s all down to the usage element and how the usage relates to what the growers were using and what that gap potentially is.”\n\n*** Next week is set to be the highest profile week of the inquiry thus far, with the entire week taken up with senior DUP figures.\n\nOn Tuesday, leader Arlene Foster will  to testy, particularly in relation to the period in which cost controls were delayed and her then-adviser is alleged to have been working to delay them – something he denies.\n\nOn Wednesday, John Robinson – whose father-in-law is an RHI claimant and who was once the Spad in the department running the scheme but is now the DUP’s chief spin doctor – will testy.\n\nHe will be followed by another ex-DUP Spad, Stephen Brimstone, who is an RHI claimant. And on Friday the inquiry will hear from the DUP’s most senior backroom figure – its chief executive, Timothy Johnston.\n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n    \n
