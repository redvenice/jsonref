The majority of its 3,600 shops had reopened by April 14, according to reports.However, scientists at Harvard, MIT and the University of British Columbia examined four samples from the seafood market and found that traces of the virus were ‘99.9 per cent’ identical to those taken from a Wuhan patient.This suggests the virus detected in the samples came from infected visitors or vendors, indicating ‘Sars-CoV-2 had been imported into the market by humans’.‘The publicly available genetic data does not point to cross-species transmission of the virus at the market,’ said Alina Chan, a molecular biologist, and Shing Zhan, an evolutionary biologist, who were involved in the study.Gao Fu appeared to contradict these findings - and the statement he has now made about the market not being responsible for the outbreak - in January in an interview for Chinese state television.He said the virus had not just been found in people\u0027s bodies but on wild-meat stalls - prompting him to call for an end to the consumption of wild animals.The study reinforces research published by a team of Chinese researchers in January, which showed the first person confirmed to have coronavirus was likely exposed as early as December 1 - showing symptoms on December 8.The \u0027patient zero\u0027 - the first person to actually contract COVID-19 in Wuhan - has not been confirmed but authorities believe it may have been a 55-year-old man from Hubei province infected on November 17.This suggests the virus was spreading undetected in the human population around Wuhan for weeks before the \u0027super spreader event\u0027 at the market.\u0027The novel coronavirus overturns much of what people have known and many of its patterns are beyond our cognition,\u0027 said George Gao Fu of the Chinese CDC.Revealed: Seven year coronavirus trail from mine deaths to a Wuhan lab | News | The Sunday Times"},{"url":null,"title":"New poll Majority Scots favour independence","story":"Share this article \u0027Support for the SNP is also at a record high. Panelbase\u0027s polls conducted over the past six months, including today\u0027s, have on average put Yes on 51 per cent and No on 49 per cent.\u0027This is the first time in polling history that Yes has been ahead over such a sustained period.\u0027Support for independence is up three points on that recorded on average last year - and six points on 2018.\u0027 He said those who had switched from \u0027No\u0027 to \u0027Yes\u0027 were among people who voted both Remain and Leave in the EU referendum. The latest survey also found that the Scottish public appeared to support the Scottish Government\u0027s handling of the coronavirus crisis much more than that of the UK Government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/058b47cc4daa45259e594e1d960b8c0000a4b0de/0_415_7703_4621/master/7703.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=937ca3be28d72135e2fc3399855a9071","title":"its made a difference to the family the children going back to school","story":"As primary and secondary schools put measures in place for a partial return, staff, parents and pupils explain to Rosie Mullender how they are adaptingHome schooling has become the new normal for millions of children across the UK. And while there is evidence of broad disparities in the quality of education these pupils are receiving, the majority are unlikely to return to school before September. For certain age groups though, the school gates opened again earlier this month, meaning that students at pivotal points in their learning could have face-to-face access to their teachers for the first time since March.Before reopening the doors of Bonneville primary school to reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils on 3 June, headteacher Andrea Parker spent weeks preparing pupils, staff and the school building itself for a safe and productive end to the summer term.From installing hand sanitisers and distance markers to iding children into “bubbles” with their own classrooms, equipment and playtimes, Parker took pains to keep staff, pupils and teachers safe.Before her doors were opened to the children, she communicated the changes to everyone involved, including in weekly newsletters and a video hosted by teachers showing pupils what to expect on their return.“To see everyone sticking to the timetable – to see parents coming in and lining up on the 2-metre lines as you planned them to do, bubbles of children moving at the right times, and everything running smoothly, makes me exceedingly proud,” says Parker.“It’s been a community effort, and has taken a lot of hard work from education professionals who’ve spent hours perfecting what we need to do in order to get children back to school – we’ve been living and breathing it.“But the result was that there was no reluctance on the children’s part when they came back – they’re thrilled to see their friends and be able to play with each other. The parents have been very grateful too, and our teachers are really happy to be back.”The safety measures put in place at Bonneville have run as planned, with the addition of Friday afternoon “induction days” for any staff who are returning to school for the first time the following week.“Any teachers who were anxious before coming back were reassured as soon as they saw how everything worked,” Parker says. “So we introduced the induction days to give them the opportunity to walk through and see the school in action for themselves before returning.”“We were apprehensive, obviously, but I was desperate for my daughter to go back to Bonneville because she was getting a bit down at home,” says Miriam Paridjanian, whose 10-year-old daughter Rosa was one of those returning. Paridjanian, who is a qualified teacher, found home schooling “very challenging”, and jumped at the chance for her daughter to be able to work alongside her friends again.“Rosa is normally very bright and bubbly, but she just wasn’t feeling happy,” says Paridjanian. “I had a really hard time motivating her – she was getting a bit despondent and unmotivated, and she didn’t want to do the work.“The school seemed to have prepared for reopening very well – there was lots of communication, and I knew if I had any queries they’d be answered – so whenthe offer came to send her back, I took it.“Psychologically, I think children need that routine of getting ready and leaving the house in the morning, and since we sent Rosa back after half term she’s perked up so much – she’s like a different child. It’s made a difference to the whole family.”Despite some initial misgivings, Rosa is equally happy to be back at Bonneville.“I was excited when Mum told me I’d be going back to school but nervous too, in case it didn’t work and we’d have to go back to being home schooled,” she says. “Some parts aren’t great – we have to eat lunch in our classrooms, then go out to play, whereas we’d usually just all eat together in the dinner hall, which is better.“But I’ve made some new friends, because we all play together in our bubble in the playground now, and lessons are easier to do in school because we’ve got help from our teachers. I also like seeing my friends – everything’s more fun with friends.”With primary schools such as Bonneville reopening, the next stage of the UK government’s plans to bring children gradually back into formal education began on 15 June. Years 10 and 12 are encouraged to receive some “contact time” in advance of the summer break, and exams taking place in 2021.Hinchingbrooke school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, is one of the secondary schools that has reopened its doors to years 10 and 12.“I’m extremely proud of our teachers and the whole army of support staff who’ve worked really hard to make the school safe,” says Andrew Goulding, chief executive of a four-school academy trust that incorporates Hinchingbrooke school.“Teaching is a lot more than just imparting knowledge and giving pupils the opportunity to develop their skills. It’s about supporting iniduals and their complex emotions.“Although Hinchingbrooke and many others have done a great job with online learning, there’s no real substitute for being face-to-face with a teacher, because a good teacher motivates students in ways online learning can’t. Fundamentally, teaching is about human interaction.”To prepare for its new arrivals, the school has split its year 12 pupils into two groups, who attend one day a week on Monday and Tuesday. Similarly, the larger year 10 has been ided into three groups, each attending on Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.Between the year groups, some children will attend school every day of the week, and the system allows the school to manage a large number of students across each week during what are key educational years.“It’s really clear from the feedback we’ve had from parents that they’re desperate for their children to get back to school,” says Hinchingbrooke’s school principal, Mark Patterson. “They need that safety net and routine.“Quite a lot of the students, particularly the younger ones, are struggling with self-discipline. But while it’s important for everyone to be back at school, you have to prioritise those students who are nearer to their national exams, because they’re the first ones who’ll be tested externally next year. Giving them some time in person before the summer, so we can direct their learning, is crucial.”Like Parker, Patterson has prioritised communication to reassure students and ease them back into lessons, via weekly virtual assemblies and video call sessions for each tutor group.“We’re one community, and have had to rise to the challenge of keeping that sense of identity through the crisis,” he says. “But when students come back, it’s a dramatically changed picture from the one they left before lockdown. Familiarising them with school again shouldn’t be underestimated.”Returning children have received a set of safety guidelines, and both students and parents have been asked to sign a contract agreeing to abide by them.Safety measures put in place at the time include red circles marked on the ground 2 metres apart to help with queueing, reorganised classrooms with distanced desks and chairs, and one-way systems to ensure students don’t have to pass each other in close proximity. There’s also signage around the school reminding everyone of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand-washing and keeping their distance.Year 12 Hinchingbrooke student Rheeya Makwana, 17, had to learn how to adapt when she returned to school on 15 June – and so far, she’s pleased to be back.“I can study quite well independently anyway, but it’s better to be back at school,” she says. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom – and although it was obviously quite different being 2 metres away from the teacher, they still tried to teach as normal.“Seeing my friends again was so great, too. During lockdown, I FaceTimed them every day, but it’s different seeing them at school.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

She attended Stanford University and earned an MFA in fiction at the University of Michigan. Her acclaimed first novel, The Mothers, was published in 2016, when she was 26. Her follow-up, The Vanishing Half, has spent the past three weeks in the top five of the New York Times bestseller list and the screen rights have been optioned by HBO in a seven-figure deal.HBO had to outbid 17 rival TV companies in the race to adapt your book for the screen. How does that feel?Last week was truly the wildest week of my life. It was my birthday week, so I’ve never been sent so many bottles of champagne or bouquets of flowers in my life, and probably never will be again.And that was on top of your book debuting at No 1 in the NYT bestseller list. What were you doing when you heard the news?It was maybe 5 o’clock in the evening and I was just sitting on my couch, and my editor called out of nowhere. We were optimistic, but I never imagined that. The people who are No 1 are household names, like Stephen King!Describe The Vanishing Half.It’s a story about twin sisters, Desiree and Stella, who decide to live their lives on opposite sides of the colour line – one as a white woman and one as a black woman.Why do you think it is resonating right now?I think there’s a larger social context into which the book entered the world. It explores racial identity at a time when people are really eager to read and engage with conversations about that, which is true all around the world as you see with these protests in all these countries.How do you feel about the tone and style of your writing being compared to novelists such as James Baldwin and Toni Morrison?It’s an honour to be mentioned in the same sentence as two of our finest writers ever. They are woven into my DNA. It feels as surreal as I think you’d imagine.How did your mother’s upbringing in the Jim Crow south inspire the novel?She told me about a town she remembered hearing about when she was a child, where everyone intermarried so their children would just get lighter and lighter. A town that was so invested in lightness that it wasn’t just a matter of preference, it was something that was almost genetically engineered. I started to think about what it would be like to live in that town, to subscribe to that ideology, to reject that ideology, and then to actually be dark-skinned in a place like that.Was the incendiary political context of 1968 something you wanted to explore as well?My mom left her small town in Louisiana and moved to DC the week Dr King was assassinated, and it was the first time she’d ever been anywhere. She talks about being in the cab and the cab driver being the person to relay this news. I just love that tension between the big historical moment and the smaller emotional moment.What is the most indispensable piece of wisdom that your mum or dad has given you?My dad often says that being right is overrated.How has it felt to see your 2017 essay about police brutality, I Don’t Know What to Do With Good White People, do the rounds again following George Floyd’s death?At the time I think it felt like a moment of sheer hopelessness, that we’re gonna watch this endless loop of black death and there will be no consequences for it. It’s always like that when it starts to recirculate, but seeing so many people on the streets in the middle of a pandemic, to see people willing to really put their lives on the line, and to see this being so multiracial – that’s been gratifying to see.How has your lockdown been?I’ve been in quarantine by myself in Brooklyn since March, so I’ve been slowly descending – you know, deteriorating a bit in the solitude.What has been the best thing about living alone in this time?Nobody getting on your nerves except for yourself! I am very much introverted by nature, so I would have felt much worse if I were constantly trapped around people this whole time. For me, it’s been a very productive quarantine. I’ve been able to channel my virus-anxiety into working.Do you think of yourself as an anxious person?I have a pretty laid-back demeanour, I’m Californian, so nobody really reads me as anxious. But I had the anxiety of being in New York and the virus and not wanting to get sick or wanting the people I love to get sick, and I also had this career anxiety of what’s gonna happen with this book coming out in the middle of a pandemic and is anybody going to read it?You just turned 30. How did you celebrate?I was supposed to go to Napa with my friends to have this wine-tasting weekend which was obviously derailed by Covid, so I had a virtual wine-tasting. They delivered a massive amount – I mean, I don’t even know how many bottles, via one of these apps.

As was the case in 2005, details of the chancellor’s plan to help the vulnerable will be announced on 8 July.There, though, the similarity ends. Sunak’s focus is the UK economy and in particular those about to lose their jobs as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The doubling of work coaches in job centres tells its own story: the government knows unemployment will soar in the coming months.By contrast, in early July 2005, final preparations were being made for the G8 summit to be hosted by Tony Blair at the Gleneagles hotel in Scotland. The leaders who gathered for three days of talks didn’t spend much time discussing their own economic problems, for the good reason that they thought they had none. Instead, they worked on proposals that would provide debt relief and additional aid for Africa.The years leading up to the 2005 G8 marked the defeat of communism and the triumph of the market economy. It was a time of rising living standards and lower trade barriers an era when globalisation seemed unstoppable and central banks had to do little but provide the occasional tweak to interest rates. Living standards rose year in, year out. Economists dubbed it the Great Moderation: a time of steady growth and low inflation.The fact that the UK had 16 years of uninterrupted growth between 1992 and 2008 and has since suffered the two severest downturns of the post-war era is one obvious difference between the pre-Gleneagles and post-Gleneagles worlds but there are plenty of others.For a start, the G8 has become a G7. The hopes in the 1990s that the collapse of communism, financial support channeled through the newly created European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and a seat at the west’s top table would transform Russia into a liberal western democracy have proved over-optimistic. Russia was kicked out of the G8 in 2014 after Vladimir Putin’s annexation of the Crimea and, despite the best efforts of Donald Trump, is viewed as a pariah state. Suma Chakrabarti, who left the EBRD last week after an eight-year stint, thinks there is more chance of the organisation extending its operations to sub-Saharan Africa than of resuming lending to Russia.Among the G7’s members – the UK, the US, France, Germany, Canada, Japan and Italy – some have also had second thoughts about China in the years since 2005. One of the guest invitees to Gleneagles was Chinese president Hu Jintao, which made sense given his country’s rapid growth in the 1990s and early 2000s.A big part of the globalisation story in the 1990s was the shift of production from the west, where labour costs were high, to China, where they were dirt cheap. This meant lower prices for Western consumers as a quid pro quo for the hollowing out of their manufacturing sectors. As with Russia, the assumption was that the arrival of the market would turn China into a western-style democracy. Again, the assumption was wrong: China does capitalism its own way, and stronger growth has not led to political freedom. On the contrary, as China has become richer so it has become more repressive.The passing last week of the Hong Kong national security law has led to a hardening of the mood. India has banned 59 Chinese mobile apps the US congress has passed a bill that would make it possible to impose sanctions on banks that connive in the loss of Hong Kong’s autonomy. The UK government has promised to offer citizenship to 3 million residents of Hong Kong. It also has some awkward decisions to make over whether it wants China to be involved in the building of nuclear power stations or the 5G wireless network. One thing is certain: the dream of a community of countries all committed to the same ends is dead.Which is a pity, since the world still has to tackle the three issues that faced the Gleneagles summiteers: one that they didn’t tackle because they thought it didn’t exist one that they thought they had solved but didn’t and one where they tried and failed.The problem that failed to blip on to the G8 radar in 2005 was that the global economy was much more vulnerable than they imagined. Cheap goods from China and other emerging market economies meant low inflation, which in turn meant central banks could keep interest rates low. This created the right conditions for soaring asset prices and a widening of the gap between those who owned shares and houses, and those who didn’t. In 2005, the pricking of the bubble was only two years away.The problem that the G8 thought they had cracked was Africa. Debts were cancelled, aid budgets were increased, African governments improved the management of their economies. For a while, all looked good, and countries with strong growth and plentiful natural resources were able to borrow freely on the international financial markets. Even before Covid-19, many of those debts were unpayable. The pandemic has inevitably made things a lot worse. The World Bank is forecasting the first rise in global poverty in two decades.Finally, there’s the climate crisis: the issue that was on the agenda at Gleneagles, but where – courtesy of the hardline stance taken by George W Bush – there was no progress. Fifteen years on, the attitude of the man in the White House has not changed but the planet is even hotter.What’s needed? Nothing, apart from a vision of a sustainable, equitable future that all can sign up to and the leadership that was provided at Gleneagles to make it happen. Simple, really."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/873c9ea9ce2ecb89403f7f14f9df5170886821ee/0_280_4777_2868/master/4777.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e09c0c1d94d75570ed08d7d3deb1407a","title":"lifting of lockdown in england how do you feel reopening has gone","story":"We would like to hear from business owners and people who have visited pubs and restaurants to tell us how reopening has been Pubs, restaurants and hairdressers in England are some of the businesses that  were able to reopen from 4 July.

Since a first visit in my early 20s, I have grown very fond of it. During the general election of 2015, when on an assignment to follow Nigel Farage around Lincolnshire, I made a point of staying there en route, solely to remind myself of the England that his politics of nastiness and grievance did not speak for, and of a future that, even as the clouds of Brexit gathered, still felt like it might be within this country’s grasp.And now? As anyone famous will tell you, residence in the headlines tends to reduce people and places to cheap and nasty cliches. And so it has proved. Rather than pointing to appallingly mixed messages from the government, too much coverage of the city’s outbreak has focused on supposedly irresponsible people flouting social distancing rules, while reports of “language barriers” among the local population and the city’s exploited garment factory workers still having to go into work during lockdown have led in some cases to racist poison on social media.No sooner had he bemoaned his city’s treatment by the government than Leicester’s elected mayor was the subject of stories in the national press about visits to his “lover” during lockdown, some of them led by a local Tory MP who had only recently claimed that Dominic Cummings was the victim of a “media witch-hunt”. Such are the distractions that have swirled around the central story – of delays in detailed data about infections in the city being given to local officials and politicians, the late arrival of additional testing facilities, and the local police receiving “minimal guidance” . If anything perfectly captured the dysfunction of it all, it was surely the spectacle of local voices being bypassed as the health secretary, Matt Hancock, served notice from Westminster of Leicester’s lockdown, leaving people on the ground to somehow muddle through.Mix together condescension, vagueness and government by edict, and one thing will spread faster than any virus: the same feeling of local powerlessness that has gripped England for well over 10 years. It is now as central to our experience of the Covid-19 crisis as it was to how millions of people voted in the Brexit referendum, and it has manifested in the strange, slightly hysterical national mood that seems to be defining the summer.Beyond exhortations to go to the pub and shop for Britain, no one in Westminster and Whitehall seems to know where we might be heading. Whenever I speak to members of the public, there is a strong sense that they feel as if they are being left to drift, with no direction from anyone at the top. We seem to have arrived in the worst of all words: local decision-makers being all but ignored, while power at the centre is proved to be not just distant, but useless.Up close, the mess that sits at the heart of all this is still quite something. Over a month ago, I started investigating how little access on-the-ground health officials had to “pillar 2” data about Covid-19 infection outside hospitals what’s striking now is that any meaningful improvement has only just arrived. We now know that the outsourcing giant Deloitte’s contract to run the network of national Covid-19 testing centres does “not require the company to report positive cases to Public Health England and local authorities”. The centralised test-and-trace system still looks deeply defective. And complaints from local leaders still echo loud and clear, highlighting the extent to which the only people who can deal convincingly with on-the-ground developments still feel cut adrift.Last Thursday, I put in a call to Stephen Houghton, the Labour leader of the Barnsley borough council in South Yorkshire, which – along with such places as Bedford, Rochdale and Bradford – had been placed on Public Health England’s “online dashboard” as a supposed Covid-19 hotspot. Infection rates in his area, he said, had now substantially dropped. But after weeks of lobbying, he and his colleagues had received data about local infection broken down by all-important postcodes only the day before we spoke. When it came to Westminster and Whitehall, he said, “nobody’s been in contact with us – not a soul. All we’ve had is a media storm.” Those last words sounded like a crisp definition of this government’s most basic failures.Last week Boris Johnson gave a speech about economic policy in which he returned to the idea that large swaths of the country felt “left behind”, “neglected” and “unloved”. A few days earlier, Michael Gove had delivered a much-discussed oration-cum-essay in which he spoke of “a deep sense of disenchantment on the part of many of our citizens with a political system they feel has failed them”. These are reheated ideas – cliches now, surely – that defined the politics of Brexit and the kind of frustrations that ensured the leave campaign won. But they also speak to the Covid-19 moment – and the spectacle of government denying people and places any meaningful agency while clinging to the idea that it can push the country away from crisis via announcements that no one believes any more. Dejection and disconnection may have brought Johnson and his allies to power, but they themselves are now deepening those aspects of the enduring public mood.And still they behave as if they can work miracles. Amid Johnson’s talk of him and Cummings somehow “rewiring” the state, when the prime minister outlines his plans for “a prodigious amount of government intervention”, he sounds like he is channelling the gigantist spirit of the old Soviet Union, albeit on a shoestring budget. In his speech, he said he wanted to “unleash the potential of the entire country” – to “build a more beautiful Britain” full of buses, trains and newly planted trees, while accelerating “projects from the south-west to the north-east, from Wales, to Scotland, to Northern Ireland, to drive economic growth in all parts of the country”.Beyond a mention of the West Midlands mayor, the only nod to the balance between local and central power was the worrying promise of the “most radical reforms of our planning system since the end of the second world war”. The new economic policy, it seems, will be dropped on places just as clumsily as local lockdowns – and by the same people, whose lack of the basic skills of government has been so comprehensively exposed. Meanwhile, contrary to Johnson’s claim that “we will not be responding to this crisis with what people called austerity”, councils are still facing huge holes in their budgets, and even more cuts.Gove, to give him his due, at least wondered “how we can develop an even more thoughtful approach to devolution, to urban leadership and allowing communities to take back more control of the policies that matter to them”. The problem is that such words are empty of specifics, and devoid of any urgency. Come the autumn, high streets will be emptying out, unemployment will be rising fast and the country’s sense of powerlessness may well have turned critical. By that point, I would imagine that the emotive old phrase “take back control” will have a dreadfully hollow ring."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad4433aee6083449f1e198b107df49497c1328f5/0_196_5871_3523/master/5871.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e8a4d22ece40121973ecc86e188c4a8","title":"only 7 of british people are heading to the pub heres why im one of them","story":"A small proportion of the population are going straight back to the boozer – and while there are many motivations, there’s one group we particularly have to watch out forThe pubs reopening should be the most exciting thing that ever happened to us. In March, I was pledging to arrive at 11am on this sacred day, and keep a seat warm and a tab open for everyone I’ve ever cared for, even a small amount. But freedom has dawned the way we knew it would, from a government whose potency has drained away with its competence: restrictions have been lifted to exactly the degree that people had unofficially decided to lift them weeks before.Pubs were already open. Some have been since the middle of May. You could buy a pint. You could sit in the park opposite (sorry, pubs that didn’t have a park opposite, I can see things were different for you). The only thing you couldn’t do was have a glass made of glass or use the toilet. In theory, this should have made people go home earlier in practice, everyone just went behind a tree. It was as if the entire pub genre had been reconfigured for hard-drinking toddlers. We should have counted ourselves lucky we weren’t given our pints in sippy cups.So I’m seeing a lot of static from cautious citizens about how pubs will be full of the most risk-seeking personality types in the country, and do you really want to drink next to those people? What if they bring a snake or their blowtorch? But the real daredevils have been drinking for six weeks solid, especially the young ones, and are about ready for their beach-body detox.The risk-averse, meanwhile, are still stacking up benefits against costs: a lovely foamy head v their continued good health the camaraderie of strangers staying studiously apart v those same strangers, four drinks in, initiating a conga. This is most people. Support for pubs reopening has dropped over the past week: if we had a referendum on whether or not to go to the pub, the nos would not only win, they’d have the kind of victory that would allow them to be generous, and maybe let some of us go to the pub occasionally somewhere down the line.But now I want to go to a regular pub on a main road. I want to go somewhere teenagers wouldn’t be seen dead in. Last week we did, actually – went to our local and sat in its front garden with two Heinekens we’d bought in the Co-op opposite (one of us had to go back and buy a bottle-opener) and Mr Z’s condition of the whole enterprise was that it couldn’t be just us – there had to be other people – or it would just be sad. As stunning good fortune had it, there was a family, playing cards and drinking Fanta, and it kind of worked, except when we accidentally looked in the windows at the deserted and dusty interior, and then it was like being in a dystopian novel from the 1950s or, worse, a Simon Pegg film. So, yes, just to erase the memory of that, I’ll be going back.And finally – this is where the trouble will come from – anyone who likes a sense of collective occasion, the people who lead perfectly blameless and moderate lives until there’s a royal wedding or Wimbledon starts or the clocks go back or forward, or the Grand National is on, or le beaujolais nouveau est arrivé, or there’s a leaving do, an Olympics, a World Cup or any given game of sport. This is where all the pent-up energy is. These people, accustomed to a year of miniature punctuations, have had their dreams punctured for months. They’re going to go quite wild, I predict."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e05f08249e94e5a05b5a19a3f86412a3ada71d6d/3_0_10661_6400/master/10661.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a1dde01d51c91e70559b7888b66b422","title":"our school systems are broken lets grab this chance to remake them","story":"Classrooms returning to normal is a priority. But why not create a ‘new normal’, fuelled by lessons learned in lockdown?I don’t want schools to “get back to normal”.It’s tempting to crave a return to life before this horrible pandemic struck. There’s no doubt that those of us who love the buzz of a school community, the thrill of teaching, the boundless energy of children, have missed those compelling and life-affirming interactions.So, yes, I want school to reopen safely to every child in the country. But getting back to “normal” is not what we need.Many school leaders and teachers are of a similar mind. There has been a change of mood, born out of a cocktail of anger, frustration, commitment to social justice and resolve. Headteachers and teachers have worked under immense stress to provide simultaneously an on-site provision for key workers and the most vulnerable and online distance learning (some having to rapidly learn how to do this from scratch). It has entailed confronting real hardship, delivering food parcels, children’s toys, laptops and regularly checking in and providing much-needed social and emotional support for families.The breaking of trust between government and the frontline at this crucial time (the result of too many insensitive, late or contradictory announcements) has perhaps strangely resulted in a growing sense of empowerment in the profession, a desire to take control of our own destiny.At Big Education (a growing social enterprise and group of schools committed to providing a more expansive education), we have been bringing together ideas and insights for renewal from a powerful range of passionate, thoughtful and dynamic people in the sector. Our new website has a mission to use this period wisely to improve how schools are run. Key strands for future reform are emerging.First: rebalancing our schools. Covid-19 has made us reflect on what makes us centred as human beings. It has become clearer to us, as parents and teachers, that academic ability is not enough. To flourish, we need a balance between what we call “head, heart and hand” – knowledge, wellbeing, problem-solving and creativity. That is why an obsession with academic “catch up” in the coming months at the expense of student wellbeing would be the wrong approach. We need every child’s voice – the full range of ersity – to be heard and valued in the classroom and each child’s learning properly supported. The Observer’s manifesto rightly stressed this point and there is an obvious need for extra government funding for mental health services and enrichment activities and not just one-to-one tutors.Second: we need smarter assessment and intelligent accountability. Ofsted inspections have rightly been suspended, as have league tables (neither of which produces the breadth of information parents need), and it would be wrong to have them return next year as schools are picking up the pieces after the pandemic. Schools need time to breathe. And the consensus is now overwhelming that Ofsted needs an overhaul, with the possibility of it being repurposed, from the crude labelling of schools, to sharing good practice across the system.Many are also taking this opportunity rightly to rethink exams. Lord Baker, one of the architects of GCSEs, has joined a growing call for them to be replaced, with a number of groups, including a stateindependent coalition, thinking hard about crafting a better system that measures the full range of student achievements.Third: skilful use of technology. Until this extraordinary forced experiment, where the world’s teachers had to learn to teach online overnight, technology has often been underused or badly used in schools. Now, all but the deliberately contrary can see its many benefits: collaborative tools to aid student learning flipped learning, where students consume the knowledge first and then discuss it with teachers.Parents now have more options to support their children, though the choice can become bewildering at times. Video conferencing can be used when people cannot turn up to parents’ evenings. Professionals from dispersed multi-agency teams can support learners with special educational needs more easily on video calls. Teacher resources have been made available online to students, for them to work on in a more self-directed way. Digital portfolios can showcase student work and emerging skills, and make young people more accountable for their learning.Fourth: a different type of school leadership, a different kind of teacher. Many teachers have been liberated by being off the exam treadmill, some describing having far more in-depth curriculum discussions and the ability to spend proper time collaborating. This is a glimpse of a more sustainable and enriching teaching profession. Many school leaders have found a new voice and new priorities, including giving attention to staff wellbeing and rethinking the micro-management that characterises so many schools. Our new Big Leadership Adventure programme is designed to nurture leaders who want to build a more balanced, agile and expansive education system.In the future, one more quality, finally, is needed in abundance – not just from schools but government, too: imagination. As we come out of the crisis, we must urgently ask whether what we are doing is fit for purpose, particularly given the bleak post-pandemic economic world. We need to imagine afresh what a great education, a big education, looks like, so we can come back stronger. It would be sad if, next June, we were back in a “normal” that no one really liked.In the words of Emily Dickinson: “The possible’s slow fuse is lit by the imagination.”• Peter Hyman is co-director of Big Education and co-founder of School 21.

On the contrary, they have acted like a cage around our thinking, vetoing a range of progressive policy ideas as unaffordable, counter-productive, incompatible with free markets, and so on. Worse than that, economics has led us, in a subtle, insidious way, to internalise a set of values and ways of seeing the world that prevents us even imagining various forms of radical change.Since economic orthodoxy is so completely embedded in our thinking, escape from it demands more than a short-term spending splurge to prevent immediate economic collapse, vital though that is. We must dig deeper to uncover the economic roots of the mess we’re in. Putting it more positively, what do we want from post-coronavirus economics?Mainstream economics has taught us that the only rational way to deal with an uncertain future is to quantify it, by assigning a probability to every possibility. But even with the best expertise in the world, our knowledge often falls far short. Frequently we struggle to predict which outcomes are more likely. Worse still, there may be outcomes we haven’t even considered, futures that no one had imagined, as the pandemic has so vividly shown.There are clear lessons here for how to address the climate emergency: rather than focusing on the average climate impacts predicted by mathematical models that depend on probabilistic knowledge that is highly unreliable, we must think seriously about worst-case scenarios, and take steps to avoid them. Yet economic orthodoxy pushes us away from precautionary action. If mainstream economics has a single overarching objective or principle, it is efficiency.Efficiency means getting the most “bang for your buck”, the most benefit for every pound spent. Any other course of action is wasteful, surely? But eliminating waste implies eliminating excess capacity, and we now see the consequences of that in health systems worldwide. Our obsession with efficiency, if it means failing to plan for a pandemic or a climate emergency, will cost lives.Our priority should be resilience, not efficiency. We need to build resilient systems and economies that are explicitly designed to withstand worst-case scenarios – and have a fighting chance of coping with unforeseen disasters too.Ultimately the problem with economic orthodoxy lies in how it frames our values and priorities. Decisions must always be about trade-offs – the weighing up of costs against benefits, ideally measured through prices in markets. If we take our ignorance about the future seriously, this cost-benefit calculus should not even get started. Because costs outweighing benefits is the oldest excuse for not taking precautions – and is a recipe for disaster when the benefits, or the costs of inaction, are vastly undervalued. In practice, this thinking means that the value of everything is measured by how much people offer to pay for it. Since the rich can always pay more than the poor, priorities get skewed towards the desires of the rich, away from the needs of the poor. So more money is spent on R\u0026ampD for anti-wrinkle creams than for malaria treatments. Big Pharma has been relatively uninterested in developing vaccines, because a vaccination programme only works if the poor get vaccinated too, which limits the price manufacturers can charge.We might seem to be beyond that now: the world has woken up, and rich countries will spend “whatever it takes” to tackle the pandemic. But Covid 19 vaccine research – and countless other fields of medical research with the potential to save as many lives in the long-term – needs continuous, reliable funding over many years. Once the market sees better profit elsewhere, funding will be cut, and the researchers will retire or move on, their experience lost.Economic orthodoxy supports the narrative that this pandemic is a unique disaster no one could have prepared for, and with no wider lessons for economics and politics. This story suits some of the world’s billionaires, but it’s not true. There is an alternative: the pandemic provides further evidence that to tackle the climate emergency, inequality and any emerging crises, we must re-think our economics from the bottom up.• Jonathan Aldred is an economist at Cambridge University and author of Licence to be Bad: how economics corrupted us"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c30b0b62a25d9aeaca1c5e9277faa8b48c9265a/8_0_5333_3202/master/5333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8d419786351d87db7ec22cdd35b1e0a","title":"the heat back on the insiders guide to 2020 best summer culture","story":"From art to architecture, from festivals to films, our expert guests spotlight the hottest cultural events and share their own summer touchstonesLuna CinemaChosen by Carol Morley, film-maker I’m really looking forward to Luna Cinema, which will be hosting outdoor and drive-in cinemas all around the UK, showing old films such as Singin’ in the Rain, Sister Act, Cool Runnings and newer films such as Rocketman and Joker. Growing up seeing depictions of drive-in cinemas in American movies always made me long to go to one, and as an adult the first time I did, it didn’t disappoint. There is a freedom, a frisson – a sense of joy in watching a film outside with others.This summer I will be finishing up my screenplay Typist Artist Pirate King, inspired by the life of overlooked artist Audrey Amiss. Recently, on a walk in the City of London, I stumbled upon Gift of Cain – a brilliant statue by Michael Visocchi and Lemn Sissay that commemorates the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade. It has inspired me to do a lot more discovering in London this summer – no passport required.Mandy, BBC Two (August)Chosen by Daisy Haggard, writeractorI can’t wait to see Mandy by the excellent Diane Morgan (of Philomena Cunk and Motherland fame). She always makes me giggle in everything she does, and as she wrote, directed and stars in this – it’ll be brilliant. David Hockney’s Portrait of an Artist (Pool With Two Figures) always makes me think of summer. That and any image of Greece – any postcard, calendar, tacky magnet. I’m obsessed with Greece so it triggers deep summer holiday excitement and I want to eat a tomato in my bikini immediately. This summer I am finishing writing the next series of Back to Life, then filming the second series of Breeders, but if I can somehow safely leave my house and jump in the sea, I will. I long for a good swim.I’m also very excited about the release of my first ever CD – Alwyn’s Miss Julie (Chandos) – which I recorded last year with the conductor Sakari Oramo and the BBC Symphony Orchestra and, rather unexpectedly, my husband, Benedict Nelson. Ben wasn’t initially meant to be involved but stepped in last minute. It’s our first ever opera together as professionals.Hamilton, Disney+ Chosen by Lynette Linton, artistic director, Bush theatreI love Disney+ so much… it’s been really keeping me going! And now Hamilton with the original Broadway cast has come to the service. Hamilton is one of the best things I’ve seen in years. It’s stunning. The London cast were exceptional, but I’m looking forward to seeing the originals and how the show translates to screen. I am very proud to say that I know every word to every song. I will be playing the soundtrack loudly throughout the summer too. Here at the Bush we’re working hard to get our doors open as soon as we can. In a few weeks I hope to be working with our community partners to be useful within our local area – with a particular focus on developing young people’s creativity.Meat Rack documentaryChosen by The Black Madonna, DJ (AKA Marea Stamper)I can’t wait to see this new documentary about NYC Downlow, a pop-up club inside Block9 at Glastonbury that is – for its short existence – always the best club on the planet. The Downlow has been such a part of my life. I have made a lot of dear friends there and I danced my ass off. It’s going to hurt to watch, but it will also make me feel warm and fuzzy. As we speak I’m living vicariously through all the Glastonbury sets that are popping up, as so many of us communally long to be out in that field with mud on our boots. Weirdly, horror movies are one of my summer touchstones. I spent a lot of my young life in the summer soaking up ice-cold air conditioning and seeing horror movies with my dad.I’ll Be Gone in the Dark, Sky CrimeNow TV (late August)Chosen by Lucy Prebble, writerproducer (Succession, A Very Expensive Poison)Well, of course I want to pick I Hate Suzie, the show I’ve created with my best friend, Billie Piper. But I’m also hugely excited for I’ll Be Gone in the Dark, the HBOSky docuseries about the Golden State Killer based on Michelle McNamara’s dark and dazzling book. It’s a horrifying story, with an ending that Michelle never lived to see. I am fascinated by things that frighten me. I love it when true crime is done well and respectfully, rather than thrashed out trashily, and HBO are the masters of doing it properly. The Before Sunrise trilogy by Richard Linklater always makes me think of summers gone by and lovers, missed and taken, but this summer I’ll be doing post-production on I Hate Suzie and mostly trying not to perish in a pandemic, or to cause others to perish in a pandemic.ENO’s Live La Bohème (19-27 September)Chosen by Suba Das, artistic director, HighTide festivalI was hugely impressed that, for a form so often seen as our dustiest, ENO got out there first back in April, thinking about how live performance could adapt for the era of social distancing. Their Drive \u0026amp Live La Bohème at Alexandra Palace in north London is a cut-down 90-minute version of the opera that will be staged as a drive-in experience for punters in cars and on motorbikes with – we’re told – a cast of brilliant young singers. It should reintroduce an element of punk to a tale of struggling Parisian artists inventing their own rules, and it’s going to be amazing to hear a live orchestra again!Of course, it won’t be the same, but the performing arts across the board need to embrace innovation – too much of the conversation so far has felt like a plea for a state of suspended animation until “normal” can be restored. During lockdown I’ve been enjoying the frankly extraordinary reboot of Dynasty on Netflix (which somehow manages to be simultaneously trashy and hyper-woke). And work-wise, HighTide launched its “Lighthouse Programme” in the first week, as we were profoundly concerned that it is our most marginalised voices who we risk losing first through the sheer economic uncertainty of these times. To date we’ve supported more than 150 writers with commissions, free training, script reading and mentorship. We want to show our artists and audiences we’re here for them now, and for the long term.Jessica Fostekew, Next Up festival (7 July)Chosen by Tim Key, standup poet, actor and writerJessica Fostekew was nominated for the Edinburgh Comedy award last summer. She’s funny as hell. She’s doing a gig as part of Next Up’s online festival, which I’ll be watching. You have to support online gigs because our industry is currently buggerooed! Jess and John Kearns were my favourite shows at Edinburgh last year. Both are powerful, distinctive voices on the live circuit, envied by peers. John’s got a comedy album coming out on vinyl, a recording of his Edinburgh show. It’s fantastic. Workwise this summer I am continuing to reinvent myself as a writer because doing 10 minutes as a dishevelled poet figure in front of 100 people looks unlikely for a bit. Leisurewise, I have a barbecue and a hammock and I know an off-licence and a back-up off-licence.Tim Key’s Poetical Playing Cards, Utter and Press (£15) Central Somers Town, Camden, north LondonChosen by Cathy Hawley, winner of Stirling prize 2019I will be swimming as much as possible in rivers, lakes and the sea this summer – and missing the joy of live music at festivals, but I can’t wait to visit this small community housing project by Adam Khan Architects that is close to completion. It is wonderfully expressive architecture, designed with close community involvement, which sits alongside an existing park and consists of a small block of housing and a series of playrooms and courtyard gardens for the children. Well-considered provision for young people alongside new housing is vanishingly rare in development projects, and this modestly scaled but sophisticated and generous architecture achieved in one of London’s least privileged neighbourhoods is so heartening to see.The Harpy by Megan Hunter (3 September)Chosen by Evie Wyld, author and co-founder of Review bookshop in Peckham, south LondonThe Harpy by Megan Hunter is a short novel – told in Hunter’s restrained and beautiful style – about a woman who is a wife and a mother, and who has discovered her husband’s affair and starts to turn into an actual harpy. Hunter hits so many different notes of rage in the book I’m rooting for the protagonist the whole way through, as she rips her life to shreds. When the weather is really hot, I think about Prince’s album Parade. I spent a summer cleaning toilets around Bondi beach and this was one of the only tapes I had. This summer I’m planning on catching up on all the stuff I should have read over the past few years and revisiting some childhood favourites with my son. I’d also like to do something physical, like dig a big hole or move some rocks about.The Bristol Balloon Fiesta (6-9 August)Chosen by Tom Morris, artistic director, Bristol Old VicImagine all of Bristol as a theatre, with perches and viewpoints from the tower at Temple Meads to south-facing slopes of Montpelier, from the escarpment of Totterdown to the rugged cliffs of the Clifton Gorge. Above is the safest performance space in Europe: the sky. And into that space, over a gorgeous August weekend, a magical slow-motion dance will gently unfold, performed by over 100 hot air balloons. The famous “night glows” are viewable in close-up at Ashton Court (if crowds are permitted). The daily ascents can be seen from the safest seats in any theatre – your own roof terrace, window, garden, park or pavement. There is nothing like a flight of hot air balloons to lift the human heart... and in these tormented times my imagination runs riot with the choreographic possibilities of this most gorgeous theatrical event.Make Up (31 July)Chosen by Rose Garnett, director of BBC FilmsAndrea Arnold’s American Honey always makes me feel summery. You can feel the heat of a long, hot summer in every shot. What a film, what a film-maker. I can’t wait to go back to the cinema – the pleasure of watching films with an audience, and of a space dedicated to presenting them in all their glory. Claire Oakley’s excellent debut film, Make Up, is a pioneer release as theatres reopen. Molly Windsor gives a charismatic central performance in a film that’s equal parts queer love story, realist drama, and thrilling body horror. Also, online, watch Fyzal Boulifa’s startling feature Lynn + Lucy. Both films play confidently with the tradition of British kitchen-sink naturalism, and yet feel fresh. As well as getting back to the cinema, I’ll be spending time this summer in Platonic Juices in Kentish Town, north London – a new space set up by a group of 18-year-olds (including my son) who were catapulted out of school to an uncertain future. I love its spirit and its energy.Salzburg festival, 1-30 AugustChosen by Daniel Harding, conductorSummer music-making is irreplaceable and important for young and established musicians, as well as for audiences. This summer risks being barren and devastating for many, given the necessary measures being taken to keep people safe, and the seeming lack of urgency to protect our enormous cultural sector. A festival such as Salzburg, which recently published its ambitious, albeit reduced programme – including Elektra and Così fan tutte – gives us some hope. I suspect the most inspiring and meaningful events this summer will be the spontaneous ones that manage to flourish in the cracks where opportunity presents itself.Ramy, Starzplay (starts 6 August)Chosen by Ash Atalla, TV producer (The Office, Stath Lets Flats)My choice is season two of the Hulu series Ramy – a sharp, culture-clash show about an Egyptian living in America not quite fitting in it’s brilliant and awkward, how I like my comedy. I’m Egyptian myself and there aren’t many of us in television, so I’m supporting the homeland. Old-school Belle and Sebastian tracks are the sound of summer for me.Floaty melodic guitars: perfect for a summer’s day. I’ll be spending the months ahead trying to figure out how to shoot TV shows in the post-Covid era. And as soon as cinemas open again, we’ll be audience-testing our new People Just Do Nothing movie, which is released next year.Féile an Phobail (Festival of the People), West BelfastChosen by Ronan Bennett, writerThis annual festival will have to go virtual this year, but among the events I’m looking forward to are Indian-Irish writer Cauvery Madhaven discussing her novel The Tainted, about the mutiny by the British Army’s Connaught Rangers in India in 1920, and singer-songwriter Imelda May reading her poem You Don’t Get to Be Racist and Irish (the title says it all). Local boy Adrian Dunbar – Line of Duty’s Superintendent Ted Hastings – will be reading poems by Seamus Heaney.I’ve been going off and on to Féile for 25 years, sometimes to do readings and talks, but more often as a festival-goer. It is always lively, always fun. I will spend summer finishing the scripts for the new Netflix season of Top Boy – we were in pre-production when lockdown hit and had to put everything on ice – but have just started prep again and will start production in October. I’ve also been working on a novel, long overdue. Leisure has mostly been exercise and reading. Irene Vallejo’s extraordinary love letter to the book, El infinito en un junco, which will be appearing in translation soon, made the first weeks of lockdown almost enjoyable.Buñuel in the Labyrinth of the Turtles, BFI Player (16 July)Chosen by Jason Wood, creative director of Home, ManchesterSpike Lee’s Do the Right Thing is the film we need at the moment. It’s set during a blistering summer day, but also carries the message of the need for recognition and change. Of this summer’s new releases though, my pick is Salvador Simó’s Buñuel in the Labyrinth of the Turtles. An animated synthesis of fact and fiction, it tells the true story behind a fascinating episode in cinematic history, using excerpts from Buñuel’s filmography to present a deeply affecting portrait of an artist hunting for his purpose. It’s a gift to cinephiles and has wider family appeal. This is a purple patch for animated film-making, with Netflix having helped bring Studio Ghibli to new family audiences held captive together during lockdown.Gordon Parks at Alison Jacques Gallery, London (until 1 August)Chosen by Brett Rogers, director, Photographers’ GalleryI can’t think of a more timely and resonant show to see now than this exhibition of defining work from American photographer Gordon Parks (1912-2006). The intimate, often serene images within his series Segregation in the South (1956) and Black Muslims (1963) illustrate Parks’s interest in producing photographs that would create meaningful change: “I saw that the camera could be a weapon against poverty, against racism and all sorts of social wrongs.”Summer plus photography usually means only one thing to me – the Arles photography festival in France. Instead, I will be hanging out in King’s Cross, London, where from mid-July the Photographers’ Gallery presents a new photographic exhibition, Games We Play, as part of Outside Art Project, a free open-air exhibition of photographic works. You can discover work by Julie Cockburn, Luke Stephenson and Weronika Gesicka, which will intrigue, amuse and unsettle.There Will Always Be Nights Like This, short story collectionChosen by Sharmaine Lovegrove, publisher, Dialogue BooksMy family and I are going to Berlin this summer and so I can imagine we’ll be heading to lakes just outside of the city with a hotdog and beer in hand and books in my tote. I’m really looking forward to cracking the spine of the first short story collection by new queer-identified indie press Cipher There Will Always Be Nights Like This. Reading is such an essential activity to build empathy and understanding of the world. I will be publishing award-winning titles from North America: The Residue Years by Mitchell S Jackson, Reproduction by Ian Williams and a wonderful short story collection, Frying Plantain by Zalika Reid Benta.Sun Ra Arkestra album, Strut recordsChosen by Gilles Peterson, DJ and label bossSun Ra Arkestra have just announced a new album to be released in the coming weeks. Last year I saw the band perform several times and can honestly say they are among the greatest in the world. They are led by Marshall Allen, who at 96 has never been more vital and relevant.

Home learning is a poor substitute for learning in the classroom.”He added that disadvantaged pupils, who may not have had access to the education being provided online during lockdown, were more likely to attend schools in deprived areas in large numbers, putting these schools at a disadvantage in terms of league tables compared with those in wealthier places.Many children returning to school – particularly those in deprived areas – would also have suffered bereavements and need extra emotional support. Others would have experienced domestic violence, isolation and anxiety during lockdown. “I think every headteacher would want league tables suspended for another year, so schools can focus on what’s really important and not just exams,” said Kidwell. “We want to plug academic gaps and see where children are, but we don’t want to be put under pressure from an unfair accountability measure.”Routine Ofsted inspections have been suspended until January, but in its latest guidance for schools, issued last week, the government ignored calls by headteachers to suspend league tables too.Sean Maher, head of Richard Challoner School in Kingston upon Thames, said he was worried schools would be pressured to address academic gaps immediately, without being given time to understand what children had been through during lockdown. “We’re going to be unpicking things for months about what’s happened – where there have been abusive relationships, family fall-outs, mental health issues. I’m also concerned about staff struggling with reintegrating back into the school environment and families feeling financial pressure.”The government should allow schools more time to support communities and use the opportunity to engage in a national debate with school leaders about how schools are measured, he suggested. “Don’t rush back to Ofsted inspections. Don’t rush back to league tables. Let’s have a conversation, as a country, about how we really want to judge our schools.”Meanwhile, two leading early-years charities told the Observer they were advising parents of four- and five-year-olds to delay starting school in reception in the autumn. Both Early Education and TACTYC say children will benefit from the continuity of returning to their existing nursery or childcare provider in September, encouraging parents to remember that children do not need to start school until a term after they reach the statutory school age of five. The Department for Education said: “Performance tables are suspended for the 2019-20 academic year, and no school or college will be judged on data based on exams and assessments from 2020. We will announce more details on accountability arrangements for the 202021 academic year shortly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c213135ee68024897fb10b93a1a06d816e1dca6/0_203_6111_3669/master/6111.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41324f3d387692137f4bfb88b444ebec","title":"hair salons in england reopen to rapturous welcome","story":"Hairdressers in England booked up for weeks as they try to cope with reduced capacity because of safety measuresWhen Nicky Thompson started taking bookings again she was inundated with more than 200 requests in just a couple of days, and when she finally reopened the doors of her hair salon on Saturday, she could see why.“I’ve had a few dodgy fringes,” she said, laughing. “Some short bits and long bits, it was interesting trying to sort that out.“I also had one lady whose husband had cut her hair across the back to keep it neat and tidy – luckily she wanted it cut into a bob so I could correct that quite easily.”Like many hair salons in England – which were able to reopen from 4 July – Nix Hair and Beauty in south London is fully booked until August, despite the fact Thompson is now opening seven days a week instead of five to meet the demand.“I think as an industry this is going to be a busy, busy month for us. It’s really nice to see the diary fully booked,” she said.She has also had to increase her prices to help cover the costs of the safety measures she has implemented – PPE for staff, a full clean between each client and reduced capacity due to social distancing.At House of Tinu in Manchester, customers have their temperatures checked outside the salon before they’re allowed in. Staff wear visors at all times, and there are disposable face masks available for customers, along with hand sanitiser.“I found it a bit upsetting that we had to lock the door because people can’t just walk in,” said the owner, Tinu Abi. “And the visors were quite uncomfortable. It was a really hectic day, and there was a lot of mental juggling to make sure we’d done everything right.”Abi has had to completely transform her salon to meet the hygiene and distancing requirements. Chairs have been further spaced out, so a room that previously held four mirrors now only has two, while the reception desk has been replaced with a larger one that can accommodate a protective screen.Similar measures have been put in place at C-Suite Lounge in Greenwich, which has had to reduce the number of appointments it makes to ensure social distancing, leading to a few frustrated customers.“We’ve had to turn a few customers away, because they said they needed their hair seen ‘now now now’, but we’re fully booked,” said the owner, Alyson Oruwariye. “They’ve been quite annoyed but there’s nothing we can do. We just want to make sure we’re on top of the cleaning so we’ll have someone coming in daily to help with that.”Despite some suggestion that small talk would be banned in salons, official government guidance simply recommends back-to-back or side-to-side working to avoid the high-risk zone in front of people’s noses and mouths.But the customary chat between hairdressers and their customers has been made more difficult by the layers of PPE. “The visors are taking a bit of getting used to, they’re steaming up when we’re talking or singing – so I better give up singing!” said Danielle Simm, manager of Kolo Hair and Beauty Boutique in Chorley. “We could do with little windscreen wipers.”“And obviously the clients have got masks on so you can’t lip-read, which makes it hard when the hairdryers are on.”Teas and coffees have also gone under the new government guidelines, with customers being asked to bring their own drinks – and no complimentary reading material either. “But everyone has been so supportive, everyone has worn a mask and been understanding, I think people are just happy to have their hair done finally,” said Simm.It has been a worrying few months for hair salons, relying on government support to keep them afloat during lockdown, so Saturday’s reopening was an emotional moment for many business owners.“The atmosphere has been lovely, there is lots of laughter still,” said Thompson. “I’m excited. I’m really looking forward to getting everyone back in and to start being able to move forward with the business again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0b0b3869d2cf8b374441d846a5ac8290055c0ae/0_197_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=721b422cdbee39a568e46bfbd41adf18","title":"from ice queen to hothead how cate blanchett negotiated stardom on her own terms","story":" The versatile actor is back on the small screen in two contrasting roles – Phyllis Schlafly, America’s scourge of second-wave feminism, and as an Australian cult leaderThere are actors who leave you transfixed because of the sheer wattage of their star power, and actors who can suck you in so completely that you forget the person behind the part.Cate Blanchett is that rare thing: an actor who does both. Whether freezing courtiers with a single glare in Elizabeth, the 1998 film that made her name, or hinting at a burning passion waiting to be released by the right touch from the right person in 2015’s Carol, Blanchett has a talent – and a presence – that is impossible to ignore.This week, that range is on show in two very different television roles. On BBC Two on Wednesday she demonstrates charisma to burn as the conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly in the 1970s-set period drama Mrs America. Then, on Friday, she appears in an eye-catching supporting role in Netflix’s Stateless, playing the frumpy co-leader of an Australian cult, who claims to be able to transform lives through the power of song.Put like that, it sounds almost humorous, an Australian version of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, but Stateless, which was co-created by Blanchett alongside Tony Ayres and Elise McCredie, is far from a comedy. The six-part series is a complex tale of immigration, mental illness and detention, and Blanchett is a menacing presence in the life of protagonist Sophie (Yvonne Strahovski).Stateless, with its dark, intertwining stories and refusal to offer up easy answers, showcases Blanchett’s willingness to immerse herself so fully in a role as to become almost unrecognisable. And Mrs America – in which she steals the show from such formidable actors as Rose Byrne, Uzo Aduba and Tracey Ullman (playing second-wave feminists Gloria Steinem, Shirley Chisholm and Betty Friedan, respectively) – highlights why, despite a refusal to court the system or spend much time in Los Angeles, Blanchett remains one of Hollywood’s biggest stars.Schlafly, a self-described housewife and mother of six from Missouri, was in reality a highly educated activist who had already made waves in Republican circles thanks to A Choice Not an Echo, her 1964 polemic about the then Republican leader, Nelson Rockefeller. Determinedly anti-feminist, she rose to further fame in the 1970s thanks to a cleverly orchestrated campaign against the Equal Rights Act, which saw her convince American housewives that second-wave feminists were intent on denigrating their values and destroying their lives.She was particularly intrigued by the way Schlafly manoeuvred her way through Capitol Hill’s male-dominated world. “I was gobsmacked by her ability to inspire, galvanise and mobilise people through various different tactics she was an absolute force of nature.”Where a lesser actor might be tempted to turn Schlafly, with her pastel twinsets and immaculate coiffeur, into a parody of conservative womanhood, Blanchett chooses instead to subtly hint at the ways in which the activist’s tough outer skin was formed by the slights she encountered as a woman operating in a masculine world.Her Schlafly is the steeliest of magnolias, creamy smile permanently in place, even as she plots exactly where to slide the knife in, but she is also visibly hurt when asked to take notes at a meeting on a topic she knows more about than the men sitting beside her. It’s a beautifully calibrated performance, equal parts syrupy charm and fierce ambition, which never lets its subject off the hook, yet which is also rooted in compassion and understanding.“I’m always interested in drama that explores the grey areas of life,” she told the Radio Times. “This is a non-judgmental series that asks myriad generations, ‘What do you think about this? How do you feel about that figure or that policy or that movement?’ It’s all about the conversation, and it’s so relevant. This show is like Groundhog Day – the discussions we were having back in 1971 and 1972 are constantly popping up in the media today.”The writer of that piece, John Lahr, went on to note that Blanchett was “both candid and private, gregarious and solitary, self-doubting and daring, witty and melancholy”.It is a theme that has been repeated throughout Blanchett’s career. In interviews, she appears warm and welcoming – happy to open her home to journalists and to talk engagingly about family life, from lockdown schooling to unexpected chainsaw accidents – yet also reserved.Her reticence was formed in part during her childhood. The middle of three children raised in a close-knit family in Melbourne, Australia, Blanchett’s life was transformed following the death of her father, Robert, when she was 10. It was a tragedy that would reshape the family dynamic – her grandmother moved in to help her mother, Jane, a teacher, with childcare – and have a lasting effect on Blanchett. She has talked movingly about how she waved goodbye to her father, an advertising executive, on the day he died. In 2015, she told the  that while she was loathe to make too much of his premature death, it had been a “very dark” time.Her interest in acting was formed early, although she initially planned to become a museum curator, deciding to study drama while on a gap year in Egypt. “Acting had become like this terrible addiction. I felt I needed to give it five years and see where it took me.” It took her to the very top as a successful stage career turned into eye-catching roles on Australian TV, and eventually film. She has won two Oscars, one for her pitch-perfect turn as Katharine Hepburn in The Aviator, the other for her portrayal of an unstable socialite in Woody Allen’s Blue Jasmine, and been nominated for several more.Happily married since her mid-20s to playwright Andrew Upton, with whom she has four children, she appears to have struck the perfect balance between work and rest, regularly switching between film and stage and taking extended sabbaticals when needed.Her film CV reads like a blueprint for how to have it all: a mixture of classy awards-bait, such as Notes on a Scandal, Veronica Guerin and Carol, and big-budget blockbusters such as The Lord of the Rings trilogy. For all her seriousness about the “craft”, she also has the ability to embrace the unexpected, stealing scenes as the evil stepmother in Cinderella, and making for a gloriously camp Hela in Thor: Ragnarok.In part, that willingness to go over the top comes from the fact that she is a naturally generous actor, as attuned to the performances of those around her as to her own. Over time, and thanks in part to that role in Carol and her own fashion sense, she has gone from regal ice queen to Cate the great. The sense that she remains unknowable at heart only fuels the appeal. Perhaps that is why she is able to be both star and ensemble player. She has always performed on her own terms and for her own needs. As Kapur told the New Yorker over a decade ago: “Cate’s ruthlessness is with herself.” It is why she stands apart."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9c61819a83f46526646755a070340d879d10fa0/0_266_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=735b22c9f23bca49bd5a4118980fb995","title":"dinner at home was a complete triumph but jay rayners kitchen was wrecked","story":"The place looked like a battleground, but on the other hand, the battle was wonThere’s a good reason why the cooks in a restaurant kitchen are called a brigade. It’s not just the hierarchical structure working under one commanding officer. It’s the military precision required to complete dishes of many parts prepared by different people. I do not have a brigade. I have me. That’s why, at the end of a dinner compiled from kits supplied by Elite Bistros in the English northwest, my kitchen looked like a war zone. There were sauce-slicked pans tottering over each other, sheaths of packaging lying hither and yon like the fallen, and slumped around them every tea towel and oven glove I possess.If a battle had indeed been fought, there was no doubt I had won. I had got to eat Gary Usher’s crowd-pleasing food, while sitting at my table at home in south London. Usher will want you to know that the menu was actually devised by his executive chef Richard Sharples, but Usher leads from the front so he takes the blame for the mess in my kitchen. Usher and I have spoken a number of times during the current crisis about its impact on the hospitality industry. His group of neighbourhood bistros, the likes of Sticky Walnut in Chester, Burnt Truffle on the Wirral, and Wreckfish in Liverpool, serve muscular food drawing on the French classics without being beholden to them.Their success is a better marker for the quality of British restaurants than any blinged-up, sushi-wrangling, pan-Asian gastronomic sink hole could ever be. Usher’s mini empire must survive, but to do so, they need a business model. And lo: a full menu of dishes in kit form available for national delivery. Orders open at 9am each Friday and are selling out within a few hours. Starters are around £6, with mains at between £10 and £19.This is a complex moment for restaurants. As I write, all the talk is of them being able to open in some form right now. A few have been taking bookings since mid-June. It’s been an outburst of sweet hope and optimism, because they hadn’t been given any approval to do so. Added to that, this column is delivered two weeks in advance. It’s like the light from a star, a snapshot of the past. That’s my story and I’m sticking to it. All of which explains why restaurants might now be open, but I’m still writing about food kits at home. Expect chaos for a little longer.Those Elite Bistro kits bring both very lovely things to eat and a lesson in what plating up restaurant food requires. For those now mentally heaving their mighty bosom with their forearms like some northern matriarch by Les Dawson while muttering, “About bloody time that filthy, entitled food-hoover learned a thing or two”: I know how restaurant food works. Now it was happening in my own kitchen.As per last week, do not order this if you want a break from the kitchen. It’s the opposite. What’s more, trying to feed more than two of you on many different dishes might prove a stretch if cooking by yourself. I found feeding three courses to four people at times challenging. It does, however, come with beautifully designed instruction sheets. Read them. Then come up with a robust plan of action. Perhaps call a therapist for support. Each dish is made up of bagged parts, all of them in-turn, in a sealed bag. My dozen dishes had at least 60 elements. All that plastic is recyclable though some of it, being sauce-smeared, is unlikely to be eligible.A starter of burrata is straightforward. Put the globe of creamy infant cheese in a bowl, drench it in the smoky burnt spring onion dressing, then scoop away with the fennel seed and chilli crisps and feel pleased with yourself. A thick plank of smoked belly bacon, pre-braised and pressed, must be fried until golden, then given three minutes in the oven. There’s a pot of podded broad beans and another of lemon oil. Introduce one to the other, add salt and the chopped parsley. Dress the bacon with the green beans. Add the sauce gribiche, a pokey mayo-style affair full of Dijon mustard, capers and intent. It’s a piggy starter I’d be very happy to eat anywhere, let alone at home.The mains require a big pot of boiling water. Almost all the key ingredients are pre-cooked and vac-packed. Into that pot, in their bags, go the confited duck leg, the braised half-cylinder of beef featherblade, alongside the truffle mash for that beef, the saffron sauce for the lamb, the butterbean mash for the roasted cauliflower and so on. Watch the labels peel off in the water. Now I have three bags of purées in varying shades of beige. It’s an edible Farrow \u0026amp Ball colour chart.I worked it out. I did not get every ingredient in the right place. I started the lamb rump and the cauliflower in the same pan as they both had to go through the oven. This became problematic when I clocked I had to anoint the lamb with a Turkish-inspired sauce of red peppers, chillies and garlic in the frying pan without getting it on the cauliflower. Argh. And none of those purées were whipped in a saucepan after being heated in the water as advised because I have only two hands, six hob rings, and limited patience.Still, dinner. And a very good one. There was duck confit with a sprightly red cabbage and mango salad and a punchy BBQ sauce, which was like HP that’s been to finishing school. The roasted cauliflower with sumac and toasted almonds on the nutty butterbean mash was a brilliantly strident piece of non-meat cookery. But the star was the slumping featherblade of beef with a lip-smacking red wine sauce and outrageously rich truffle mash. It was the kind of classy bistro cooking you can never be bothered to do yourself.Among the desserts was the spiced Yorkshire parkin, in a pond of salted butterscotch sauce with clotted cream, which I reviewed at Kala in Manchester. It was just as good at my table as at Usher’s.We have a rule in my house. If you’ve cooked you don’t clean up. I voluntarily broke the rule. I felt I ought to own this mess. Not least because the end result had been worth it. These are not normal times. We are fighting our way back to normal. In the meantime, what better way to pass an hour or two than with a little gastronomic chaos? That’s a rhetorical question, by the way. Don’t feel the need to answer.For details and the full menu, including the wine list, visit elitebistros delivery is £12.95Although some restaurants are starting to reopen this weekend, delivery services are not coming to an end.

The Sheffield United manager sees the Clarets as a great example of how to establish a club in the Premier League but his own resourcefulness may have halted Sean Dyche’s accidental European charge.“It was never the aim of the season,” said the Burnley manager. “The aim was to stay in the Premier League.” But his side were heading for eighth place and set to leapfrog the Blades until Wilder shuffled his reduced pack to salvage a draw in this meeting of the depleted. “To get a result from a losing position is satisfying,” he said. “The spirit was there.”It is a common denominator. Another is that adversity can provide an opportunity. Ben Osborn had to wait 11 months for his first league start for United but, with two-thirds of his usual midfield injured, Wilder belatedly turned to one of last summer’s signings against Spurs last week and here he helped fashion John Egan’s leveller. The other contributor was Billy Sharp, introduced as Wilder abandoned his 3-5-2 to adopt a midfield diamond. “Delighted for Ben,” said Wilder. “He drove the game forward for us.”Like that triumph over Tottenham, this was further evidence of United’s powers of recovery after their difficult start to the summer. “Everybody has got about 35 players and we have got about 18 at the moment,” said Wilder. His squad was so stretched that he could not name a full complement of substitutes. The surprise was that Burnley could, though Dyche has only brought on six replacements in four games, but a can-do mentality was reflected when the left-back, Erik Pieters, spent the second half masquerading as a right wing and almost delivered a late winner. “A fantastic professional,” said Dyche. Ultimately, however, perhaps the absences of Ben Mee and Jack Cork, whose ankle injury may require surgery, cost him a third successive win.Mee’s run of 70 consecutive league starts was ended by a thigh problem. James Tarkowski assumed both his usual sidekick’s armband and last Monday’s mantle as a scorer, the stand-in captain sliding in to apply the finishing touch after Jay Rodriguez had flicked on Dwight McNeil’s free kick. Burnley rued other missed chances: after a slick move, Matej Vydra sidefooted wide. Later, looking for a clinching second, McNeil was wasteful with the rebound after Dean Henderson parried Rodriguez’s dipping volley. “We had a couple of golden chances, particularly Dwight’s, which would have seen the game through,” said Dyche. “But they had a really good chance in the first minute.”United had almost struck in the opening seconds, with Nick Pope denying Oli McBurnie. But though the striker and Sander Berge came close in the first half, Burnley’s obduracy meant they had few opportunities before Wilder changed his team’s shape, Osborn crossed, Sharp flicked the ball on and Egan thumped in a goal to mean he has now scored in each of the top four isions. “Cracking finish,” said Wilder. “But that should have been his 10th goal of the season, not his first.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f853b2c41f5986df6c44b216d280b7c06062c562/0_156_6651_3990/master/6651.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=344b5fb79345673a08eaac3d602c4499","title":"paul parker interview manchester united","story":"Thirty years on from starring in Italia 90, the full-back talks David Rocastle, Manchester United and his experiences with racismPaul Parker is getting goosebumps. He has spoken in the preceding hour and a half about the racism he faced in the 1970s and 80s, of having a starring role in England’s journey to the 1990 World Cup semi-final, and the pros and cons of playing football at Old Trafford. But it is the memories of his mate David Rocastle that catch him off guard.“For the 1990 qualifiers, Dave and I shared a room together,” says Parker. “Normally we’d go away with England on the Saturday night and not play until Wednesday. Rocky would sneak in some drinks before training on Monday. I would bring four cans of lager, Rocky would arrive with brandy and Babycham. But that was him. He was the happiest man, always smiling and would often call his wife, Janet, late at night, just to hear the sound of his baby daughter’s voice. You would hear him just singing to Melissa down the phone.”There is a pause. It’s not immediately clear if Parker is emotional or simply collecting his thoughts. “Rocky was involved in every game leading up to 1990,” Parker continues. “Before the World Cup squad was announced, there was a knock at the door. I get up – Rocky was in the bathroom – and it was Bobby Robson. I went a grey colour. All the negativity went to my head and I thought that was me done. I thought he was coming for me. But Bobby just looked at me and silently pointed for me to get out the room. I knew what was coming.“When I went back into the room, Rocky was keeping a straight face but he was an emotional man and you knew that he had been cut from the squad. I carried his bags out to his car at the Burnham Beeches hotel. I was absolutely devastated because in my head, me and Rocky were going to be sharing a room together for weeks and weeks in Italy, having the time of our lives.”Despite Rocastle’s absence, that tournament transformed Parker’s career. He arrived with just 15 minutes of competitive international experience and left as a household name, overcoming his tournament nerves by “listening to Soul II Soul before every game on the bus on my Discman”.Having been on the bench for England’s opener against Republic of Ireland, Parker played every minute thereafter and his tactical awareness, versatility and pace at right wing-back helped England bound towards a semi-final with West Germany, where an unfortunate deflection from Andreas Brehme’s free-kick spooned over Peter Shilton into the net before Parker’s fine, raking pass for Gary Lineker set up England’s equaliser. Robson singled Parker out after the 3-2 win over Cameroon – “he leaps like a salmon and tackles like a ferret” – and the Geordie manager left a big mark on the East Ender.“Sir Bobby Robson would always ask a question of you, never an order,” explains Parker. “So you always wanted to play for him, to answer him on the pitch. And whenever we won he would always come up to you like an excited child, not knowing where to look.”Robson also removed distractions off the pitch, with players encouraged to talk and forge friendships many of the squad had been handpicked from a range of clubs rather than the usual elite, with more players from Nottingham Forest than Liverpool and as many from Derby County as Manchester United.“The only people that formed a clique were the Rangers boys,” remembers Parker, “Terry Butcher, Gary Stevens, Chris Woods and Trevor Steven. They would wear their clothes backwards just to wind up the FA committee members.”Representing England was the realisation of a dream. The son of Louis and Myra, who arrived in England from Jamaica in 1959 and 1961 as part of the Windrush generation, Parker and his family had to overcome overt racism in a predominantly white West Ham neighbourhood. He would watch as his mother was handed National Front leaflets on the street, and she was victim of multiple incidents during her work as a nurse and traffic warden. “In the East End there were skinheads about, and I was always looking over my shoulder ready to sprint,” Parker remembers.His hopes of playing for his local team were also squashed. “West Ham was a very racist club,” Parker says. “Their chief scout, Eddie Baily, was renowned for it. All my mates used to go to Upton Park behind the goal. I would go sometimes and have to take abuse from people from behind. I knew why I hadn’t been picked up by West Ham. You could have the skin as thick as a rhino, and I think I’m one of those people, but you couldn’t have got through it as a kid.”Instead it was Fulham who gave Parker his start, with the long trips across London leading to his professional debut in 1982. Parker, then a 5ft 7in centre-back, would later captain QPR before a 1991 move to Manchester United for £2m.“Everyone thought I would sign for Spurs, and I was sat in the Royal Lancaster Hotel with Terry Venables when Manchester United rung me up,” says Parker. “For anyone of West Indian origin, Manchester United was the team, going right back to Bobby Charlton and Denis Law. I went straight up north that day, was taken around the ground by Alex Ferguson and that was me done.“Fergie knew everything about that club,” continues Parker. “He could have closed his eyes and walked around Old Trafford. He knew people’s names and exactly where they sat. He saw past the playing staff right down to the security guards, would say good morning on first-name terms with every single person at the training ground. United managers since often sneak around the back to avoid people but they don’t understand that when things aren’t going well, you need absolutely everyone on your side.”Parker is now is a pundit and co-commentator as well as an ambassador for Cross Channel Racing, which helps people to co-own horses at the Danebury Stables in Hampshire and network at sport events. He would win two league titles, an FA Cup and a League Cup in his five years as a right-back at United, eventually forced out by an emerging academy graduate named Gary Neville. But his time there was hugely enjoyable on and off the pitch.“Meeting Nelson Mandela on a pre-season tour of South Africa was amazing,” recalls Parker. “Mick Hucknall also turned up quite often because he was quite pally with Sir Alex. We all found out why the band was called Simply Red. He came away with us once for a European game, on the bus, and even warmed up on the pitch at training the night before doing a shooting drill. He was a genuine fella.”It is perhaps a surprise that Parker chose to sign for Manchester United at all. Just a few years previously he had been the subject of horrific racist abuse from the Stretford End as a visiting QPR player, as the home fans repeatedly sung a chant at Parker that included threats on his life, the line “trigger, trigger, trigger” and the N-word.“I remember I made a big strong block tackle on Lee Sharpe on the byline and I honestly thought the ball had popped,” says Parker. “If a challenge was made like that now, people would be screaming for me to be hung, drawn and quartered. But Sharpey just got up and walked off to take the corner. I looked up at the crowd who were chanting, and gave them what they wanted with a smile on my face, making a gun with my hand and putting it towards my head.“My reaction was always going to be: ‘If you’re going to put me down, I’m not going to let it affect my game.’ I’m going to make it difficult for you to enjoy the game. You’ve paid money to watch a little black fella wander round the pitch. More fool you, you hypocrites.’ I won the header from Sharpey’s corner. That chant wasn’t in my mind when I signed for United. It probably should have been but I never received any racist abuse when I became a Manchester United player.Things have progressed somewhat since that awful day in front of the Stretford End but as the Black Lives Matter movement suggests, there is still an awful long way to go to solve the deep structural issues in both football and society as a whole.“In time, I believe there will be more black people at boardroom level although I’m not really interested in the Rooney Rule,” says Parker. “All the black lads that are playing now, like Marcus Rashford and Raheem Sterling who have had their say, the best thing they can do now is to do their best for club and country. That’s the way I believe they can help the black community.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/083edeab9df14a9d9624f64e86b487f27eb22dd7/0_318_3667_2200/master/3667.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e71eb2ed7f2d259c30ad34cba0c330d3","title":"newcastle united v west ham united premier league live","story":"62 mins: Saint-Maximin executes a silken 360 on the right wing. Sure, it doesn’t really achiever very much, but still, yeah.59 mins: Newcastle get the ball into the West Ham penalty area, through a series of not-really-controlled passes that nevertheless somehow work out, but Almiron’s left-foot half-volley doesn’t work out.54 mins: Imminent substitution alert: Mark Noble is being briefed on the sidelines.52 mins: It’s fair to say that the start to the second half hasn’t been as exciting as the start to the first. Still, the tempo is good.48 mins: Amiron fizzes a left-footer wide from 20 yards or so.47 mins: Krafth and Almiron combine on the right, and the right-back tries a low cross similar to the one that led to Newcastle’s first. This time though Gayle runs away from the near post rather than towards it, and it’s cut out.46 mins: West Ham get the second half started. No breaktime changes to report.The players have had a rest and are on their way back out. West Ham started the first half like a runaway train before sitting back to protect their swiftly-won advantage, a tactic that seemed to continue even after they lost it. 45+4 mins: And a few seconds later the whistle sounds. It’s been a promising half, but with too many set pieces and stoppages.45+4 mins: Fornals brings down Lascelles, as bookable a challenge as you’ll ever see. The referee however has his mind on his half-time digestives, so he gets away with it.45+2 mins: Saint-Maximin is down now, having run into a defender and fallen awkwardly. He eventually rises gingerly to his feet, and the physio aims a thumbs up at the bench.45+1 mins: Into stoppage time, of which there’ll be about three minutes. 43 mins: Hayden has sustained some kind of minor muscleknack, and Bentaleb is coming on to replace him.39 mins: Saint-Maximin is such a lovely, fluid runner with the ball. But he keeps undoing his good work with completely rubbish right-foot sidefooted shots and passes.37 mins: Gayle mistimes a sliding challenge on Antonio so badly that he eventually clips his trailing foot with his chest. He’s booked, a bit harshly given the very slight contact.36 mins: Excellent interchange between Fornals and Fredericks, disappointing cross.32 mins: Save! Cresswell has a pretty poor shot from outside the area, but Bowen throws a foot at it and gets a slight deflection, but the ball goes straight to Dubravka’s left boot, and he does really well to shift his weight and kick it clear. 31 mins: An, um, unconvincing challenge from Joelinton gives West Ham a free kick on the right, and Bowen delivers an excellent dipping, curling cross, but Dubravka deals with it well.28 mins: Which leads to another corner. Shelvey sends this one towards Fabianski as well, and this time the keeper punches clear. 27 mins: Saint-Maximin gets the ball and starts running. He shimmies left, he jinks right, and then Declan Rice comes along and kicks him. Free kick.23 mins: The drinks break comes with Newcastle very much on top. Shelvey and Saint-Maximin in particular are looking sharp, and Krafth overlapping well on the right.20 mins: Newcastle are pushing for more. They win a corner on the left, which Shelvey curls towards Fabianski, who panics, flaps at it and falls over. Luckily for the Hammers the ball falls to Fredericks, who clears.The equaliser! Saint-Maximin gets the ball and starts running, the entire West Ham defence quivers, he sucks in Cresswell and then passes to the overlapping and completely untracked Krafth, and his low cross is turned in at the near post by Almiron!13 mins: The ball falls to Gayle, about 12 yards from goal, but he’s facing away from goal and can’t turn so lays off to Almiron, who is closed down, and the ball squirts behind for a corner.11 mins: Antonio does excellently to control a stretching volley from beyond the far post and conjure an effort on goal, but Dubravka stops it.10 mins: Gayle wins a free kick not far outside the area, dusts himself down and takes it himself. It deflects off the ball and wrongfoots the keeper, but it wasn’t going very quickly to start with and the deflection slowed it further, so Fabianski makes an easy save.8 mins: Shelvey shimmies nicely before shooting from 25 yards. The ball hits Ogbonna’s right arm, prompting loud penalty appeals, but the defender’s arm was hanging by his side and there was no hand-to-ball movement, so no dice.7 mins: Since the goal Newcastle have had the ball pretty much all the time, but haven’t done anything much with it. Early breakthrough bonanza! Bowen gets down the right, and his low cross runs straight to Lascelles, but he gets his feet in a middle, makes a horrible hash of things and barely touches the ball, which runs to Antonio at the far post, who controls and smashes into the net!1 min: Four seconds and one aimless punt forward later, it’s a West Ham goal kick.1 min: Fornals was in their half when they did so, so they get to do it again.1 min: Peeeeeep! Newcastle have kicked off!The players are out! Newcastle have taken an admirably different approach to the covering up of empty seats that elsewhere in the Premier League has largely been achieved by the production of large banners, just leaving them empty and open.The two managers have spoken to Sky. Here’s Steve Bruce:I think all of us probably are in a situation where you have to use your squad. Bournemouth was something like our fourth game in 11 games so we switch it around and it works. So when it works it’s not too bad, it’s when it doesn’t work and you think, have I picked the right team? That’s got to be the challenge for us all. Our first objective was to stay in the Premier League, and if you look around a club like ours it’s only fair that we’re in it. So the challenge to all of us is now, we’ve got five or six games left, can we maintain the form we’re on and see if we can finish in the top 10? That’s got to be the challenge.Obviously we’ve tried to get a good bit of stability and momentum going. We actually think we weren’t so bad in the earlier games but we had tough opposition. Newcastle are tough opposition because they’ve started this period really well. So I hope we can get the same from the players. If you win your own games you don’t need to bother about anybody else, so ultimately that’s what we have to do. We’re aware of that. We’re in a batch of games now that gives us opportunities to pick up points and we have to do that. We start today, we go again, and try to get another result.So two changes for Newcastle, for whom Isaac Hayden and Miguel Almiron come in, and Sean Longstaff and Nabil Bentaleb drop out. West Ham stick with the side that started the win over Chelsea in midweek.The team sheets have been handed in (very carefully, and subject to appropriate social distancing), and these were the names upon them:That slender cushion came courtesy of their dramatic last-gasp win over Chelsea on Wednesday, and given the abysmal form of their relegation rivals another six points will probably be enough to save them - though despite their promising display in midweek having lost eight and won only two of their last 12 league games even that moderate level of achievement can’t be taken for granted.Newcastle meanwhile are among the teams of the restart, attacking with a fluency that they rarely seemed capable of before lockdown, unbeaten in the league, and smashing three past Sheffield United and most recently four past Bournemouth.I have a sneaking suspicion this might be a doozy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/891d0a67418d6c94ae3673cf0071b1c999b11657/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83bafa3e8f2714e57f1ac19b3eb87300","title":"kale to kimchi 12 foods that are good for gut health","story":"The contents of your shopping basket can have a huge impact on your wellbeing, so stock up on the items which can help to promote digestion and a healthy gutWe’ve probably never been more aware of how the groceries we choose impact on our health. Who among us hasn’t tried to resist the lure of the cake aisle? The connection between food and wellbeing seems particularly salient when it comes to gut health. And, it turns out, by making simple changes to our diet, we can start to take care of our tummies. Try popping some of the items listed below into your shopping basket and see if you notice a difference.Potatoes Pile plenty of potatoes into your shopping bag, but resist peeling them because their skins contain fibre. Fibre helps to maintain a healthy digestive system, passing through our small intestine without being broken down. The UK government recommends we aim for 30g of fibre a day although British adults manage to eat only around 19g on average. Potatoes are also a source of resistant starch, a form of starch that can’t be digested in the small intestine and so is classified as a type of fibre. This, too, may aid gut health.WholegrainsChoosing wholegrain varieties of bread and pasta is an easy way of boosting your fibre intake. Unlike the refined grains used in white bread and pasta, whole grains include the bran, the fibre-rich outer layer that gets stripped when grain is refined. Remember to check the label on any packets you buy so you can be sure about the ingredients, fibre content and nutritional values. European regulations state that a product claiming to be a source of fibre should contain at least 3g of fibre per 100g or at least 1.5g of fibre per 100 kcal, while a product claiming to be high fibre should contain double those figures.Wheat bran A daily intake of 10g of wheat-bran fibre is known to support your gut health by helping to accelerate the transit of food through your intestines. An easy way to boost your intake is by eating breakfast cereals high in wheat-bran fibre, such as the Kellogg’s high fibre range, which includes Bran Flakes, All-Bran Original and Fruit \u0026amp Fibre.Oats These are another handy breakfast option. Oats are known to provide a type of fibre often referred to as soluble fibre. This fibre dissolves in water and forms a gel in the gut, which can beneficially impact digestion and metabolism. Remember oats aren’t just used to make porridge but are the basis of muesli, oatcakes and oat bread.Leafy vegetables Parents down the generations have told children to “eat up your greens”, and it turns out they were right. For example, broccoli and kale can provide a source of fibre.Probiotics and fermented foods We can enrich the ersity of our gut microbiome by eating probiotics – technically defined as live bacteria that, when consumed in a viable form and adequate amounts, are beneficial to health. Kefir, a fermented milk drink, is an example of a food providing a probiotic source. Such foods may complement a fibre-rich diet, in the context of gut health. Other fermented foods such as certain yoghurts, sauerkraut, miso and kimchi are examples of probiotic sources.Bulgur wheatIf you’re bored of potatoes but need something on the side, this wholewheat grain is your friend. It comes in four sizes, from fine to very coarse, and is great as a basis for salads. Mix it with anything from tomatoes and cucumber to parsley and lettuce, for a tasty side dish.PulsesThese come in all sorts of varieties, with some of the most familiar being lentils, chickpeas and kidney beans. All three contain fibre, as well as resistant starch, and can be added to soups, stews, curries or salads.Nuts and seedsPumpkin, sunflower and flax seeds are handy if you’re looking for a fibre snack while on the go. Nuts and seeds can be sprinkled on stir fries, blitzed into curries, stirred into homemade cereal bars, or added to breakfast cereals. And don’t forget nut butters, which come in varieties such as cashew and almond as well as peanut.Assorted fruitsIf you fancy something sweeter, remember that plenty of fruits contain fibre, such as strawberries, blackberries and pomegranates. Avocados might be savoury but they are a fruit, and another good option.BananasWhen green, these are a good source of resistant starch. As a rule of thumb, the greener the banana, the more resistant starch it contains, so try to eat them before they turn completely yellow.PrebioticsFibre reaches the large intestine undigested. Once there, some types of fibre become “food” for the good bacteria in our gut. These types of fibre are referred to as prebiotics. Small amounts can be found in foods such as chicory root, onions, garlic and artichokes. But you can also opt for foods with added prebiotic fibre."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82a8e3a0b45292bf140ff4044ea9220541a99bc3/0_2306_4361_2615/master/4361.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecbdf6466f5881a4bc5036bec1efbb79","title":"honey i shrunk the shopping","story":"Mini products are the latest toy fad. But are the dinky replicas just some harmless fun, or a cynical marketing tool to boost brand awareness?There are two bottles of Dove body wash in my home, and they are nearly identical. They have the same distinctive curved shape and flip lid, the same label, the same Unilever trademark. They differ in just one crucial way. One is 22cm tall and is designed to be used in my bath. The other measures 5.5cm – about the size of my little finger – and is a children’s toy.My miniature bottle of Dove was hatched from the inside of a plastic egg. It is just one of 115 supermarket items that have been miniaturised by New Zealand toy company Zuru as part of its 5 Surprise Mini Brands range. A child buys a Mini Brands ball unaware what’s inside – it opens much like a Terry’s Chocolate Orange (Zuru have trademarked the toy’s “bloom open”) – and discovers five segments each housing a miniature. Among other things, you can get a teeny-tiny tin of Spam, a packet of Wet Ones wipes, some Knorr rice, a jar of Hellman’s mayonnaise, a box of Lipton tea bags and a bottle of Kikkoman soy sauce. Most of these boxes and jars don’t open – there’s just packing foam inside.Mini Brands was launched in January 2019, but exploded in popularity last Christmas. It was the number one Googled toy in December and consequently the American grocery store Target sold out of the $10 (£8) toy online. Although Mini Brands aren’t currently available in UK stores, British customers have been buying them online for as much as £25 for a single ball. We’ve also seen a similar offering from Marks \u0026amp Spencer, which launched a “Little Shop” last summer – shoppers could collect mini seeded loaves and cartons of milk. This begs the question: should logos really be slapped on children’s toys? Are miniature groceries turning kids into tiny little loyal consumers?Heavily branded children’s toys aren’t new. In 1994, Mattel released a Barbie McDonald’s Restaurant Set, complete “with talking drive-thru” and miniature menu boards. Around the same time, ride-on toy cars for children became popular, and BMW, Jeep and Mercedes-Benz wasted no time slapping their logos on plastic bonnets. Daniel Cook, a professor of childhood studies at Rutgers University and author of The Commodification of Childhood, says: “Consumerism has been a part of children’s lives for as long as there has been modern consumption,” roughly since the mid-1800s. He references Victorian artist Kate Greenaway’s picture books of the 1880s, which had a tie-in line of clothing for girls produced by Liberty of London. He also points to Campbell’s Soup’s range of dolls, first sold in 1909.Mini Brands is a step further, however, since the toy itself is the branded item. After cracking open a plastic orange, I find myself the owner of child-friendly mini Magnum ice-creams and, more bizarrely, a bag of Knorr four-cheese risotto. I am charmed by the mini aspect of them and yet they’re troubling, too. Isn’t shrinking everyday household products a cynical way of manipulating children into favouring a brand? Part of the appeal is that children are drawn to imitating adult life. As Cook explains, much like dollhouses, miniatures allow children to have a “mastery” of the world.And that has huge commercial potential for so many adult consumer brands looking to expand their market.“That sense that children might be imprinted early on with positive associations towards their product definitely drives this,” he says, “Companies want to instil their brand, their product, in children’s minds… What’s interesting about this is it’s bringing in the brand message without the product – it’s the surface.” In other words, you win the mini consumer over with the packaging first, while the content comes later.As such, Cook says miniature items are a “cheap” and “intimate” way to get children familiar with brands – but does it actually work? The academic says that research shows children do tend to imitate their parents’ purchases when they go to university, but stresses no one can yet know whether these toys will influence kids.“I don’t know if it works, and I don’t think they know if it works,” he says, noting that children are among the most fickle consumers. Yet, regardless of the long-term consequences, companies clearly see the toys as a worthwhile endeavour – the partnership between brands and toymakers is ultimately a financial one, and the toys undeniably make children more brand-aware.According to author Simon Garfield, humans have always been drawn to tiny things. In his 2018 book In Miniature: How Small Things Illuminate The World, Garfield explains that minis both educate and excite us – “The miniature world embraces control,” he writes, arguing that children who play with miniatures get a taste of adult power.In the 16th century, miniature books with microscopic text became popular. Today, one Instagram account that showcases everything from hand-crafted mini tape dispensers to mini spaghetti has nearly 200,000 followers. An array of product designers have jumped on the fad – in late 2019, French fashion designer Simon Porter Jacquemus released a minuscule handbag, its 9cm width making it too small to hold even the average mobile. In 2018, Nutella began selling mini “Nutellino” jars in supermarkets, each housing just two spoonfuls of the chocolate spread.As well as human psychology, Mini Brands capitalises on current trends – on YouTube, “unboxing” videos favour toys with an element of surprise, while collectibles have always been a staple of the toy market. Yet the Mini Brands craze can also be explained in relation to another phenomenon: the video-sharing app TikTok, which has been downloaded more than 2bn times worldwide and is very popular with kids.Paul Solomon, CEO of Moose Toys, which makes Shopkins Real Littles (tiny versions of real products), says the range was inspired by a desire to make “things that kids can relate to and see in their everyday lives”. With the added advantage that it may well be on their own shopping list in a few years’ time.Over Skype, seven-year-old Ava, from the west coast of America, plays with her Mini Brands and Shopkins. Her favourite Mini Brand is Bosco chocolate syrup, because she likes eating it in real life (she doesn’t like the strawberry syrup toy because she doesn’t like strawberry syrup). “I like how the boxes look real,” she says.Ava’s mum, Wells, has spent $300 on Shopkins and stores her substantial collection in clear acrylic units hanging on walls. She has nearly 30,000 followers on Instagram, where she shares her toy collection. “I thought people would be like, ‘Oh you’re totally crazy,’ but most people think it’s really cool,” says Wells, who is wearing a purple Shopkins shirt that matches her daughter’s. She adds another reason parents buy minis for their kids – they’re easy to tidy away.Both King and Wells have received free products from companies in exchange for posting about toys online – brand director Aneisha Vieira explains that Zuru has done no TV adverts for Mini Brands but did send products to TikTokers. “We’ve garnered over 600m views,” she says. “That’s what fed the sell-through rate we saw instore. We struck gold.”I can’t deny I’m entertained by my miniature groceries. I marvel as I compare the mini Dove to the real one. Yet as children’s toys, they are more concerning and you can’t help wondering where playtime ends and consuming begins.Cook says it is up to parents to decide whether they’re comfortable with their kids playing with tiny branded goods. “Treat it with the degree of suspicion and concern you would have for most other things that might come into your child’s life,” he says. “Brands are in kids’ lives all the time – it would be good to have alternatives, always, so they can think of the world around them separate from particular companies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b636eae23c06935a7a1c129d0b12480e52451f0f/0_85_2100_1260/master/2100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6800041c4fa616b2365a80d388a9241","title":"sunday with dani shapiro perfecting frittata and not learning italian","story":"The American writer on instapots, not learning Italian and perfecting frittataHow does a regular Sunday start? You mean, in the Before Times? I was travelling a great deal on a book tour, staying at hotels, trying to remember which city I was in. If I was at home, my husband and I would start the day slowly, reading the paper in the usual order: the arts coverage, the books coverage. I would often write on Sundays, and I like to cook. Before the pandemic, there was a different rhythm to it.How have things changed? Well, if I didn’t look at my phone I’m not sure I’d know what day of the week it was the days blur from one to the next. Weekdays have taken on this slower quality, so Sundays don’t feel particularly different. I receive more work emails on Sundays, and I send them as well. It’s as if we’re all limping along.Have you learned anything new? My cooking skills have greatly improved, as has my interest in cooking. I’m inhabiting my home in a different way now – there’s something different about being at home with nowhere to go. I was so used to looking at the calendar: what’s next, what’s next? But for the time being, there is no next.Are you enjoying the downtime? I’m starting to embrace it to say, ‘I really am just going to sit here and stare out the window and not feel I have to be productive.’ There’s been a lot of productivity porn, everybody posting things they’ve accomplished. ‘I’m learning Italian.’ ‘I’ve perfected my frittata.’ It’s too easy to think that’s how it really is, and not just the parts of ourselves we’re showing to others. I have perfected my frittata though.What were Sundays like growing up? I was raised in an observant Jewish home. Saturdays were the Sabbath and I wasn’t allowed to do anything: ride my bike, play the piano, see my friends. Sundays were more uplifting. My father would pick up delicious food: bagels, lox, whitefish – the kind of food I now only eat once a year.Guilty Sunday pleasures? The best TV is on Sunday nights. What else? We bought an instapot.

What does our ability to stand patiently say about us?The line snaked ominously around the forecourt. I knew B\u0026ampQ mid-lockdown would be bad, but I hadn’t quite appreciated how bad. “They should call it Q\u0026ampQ,” my son remarked. There were at least 50 people in a socially distanced trolley conga, braving airborne particles and suspicious glances to lay their hands on shelf brackets, parasols, titanium-tipped screws.What was my excuse? Just as a driver complains about being “in traffic” when they are in fact, traffic, so the queuer laments the phenomenon they create. I was painting my kitchen, I had run out of paint, a retail park just off the M5 was the only place where I could lay my hands on the right brand and shade, the government had said it was OK and we were wearing masks. But I also wanted to subject the queue to the sort of study that the anthropologist Kate Fox pioneered while researching her 2004 classic, Watching the English, which spends a lot of time discussing the commonly held notion that we are a nation of queuers. “An Englishman, even if he is alone, forms an orderly queue of one,” noted the Hungarian émigré George Mikes in his bestselling 1946 book, How to be an Alien. In his 1944 essay The English People, George Orwell remarked on “the orderly behaviour of English crowds, the lack of pushing and quarrelling, the willingness to form queues.”Fox saw in the English queue (Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish queues are no doubt available) a “microcosmic minidrama”, full of “scheming and intrigue, moral dilemmas, shame, face-saving, shifting alliances, anger and reconciliation.” The English, she says, are one of the only people who will spontaneously arrange themselves into a single queue when faced with the two-cashier problem. “Many of the foreign visitors I interviewed regard these processes with open-mouthed amazement,” she notes.But Fox also found an interesting paradox. While the English are hyper-alert to infractions of queue etiquette – such as the “chat and cut”, that bugbear of Larry David in Curb Your Enthusiasm – hardly anyone dares object when it happens (as Larry David always would). So nowhere in the world is it easier to break queueing rules than it is in the UK. I now know this to be true, as my son and I busted B\u0026ampQ simply by strolling confidently in through the exit. I know, I know, I know… I merely hoped to demonstrate that queues are not necessarily the impregnable bastions of fairness that they are made out to be. No one said a word.But the coronavirus lockdown has brought many unexamined features of British life to the surface. Much of our queueing these days takes place virtually. “You are currently 25th in the queue,” said the automated voice when I phoned the council to ask whether there was much of a queue for the recycling centre that day. But during lockdown, queues have become far more visible as they have been moved outside shops to aid social distancing. It’s a daily pantomime of supposedly British notions of fair play and mustn’t grumble, and one of the few things to unite the nation other than a TikTok video of an American making tea in a microwave.But just maybe, the queue is also a symbol of decline, inefficiency, docility, passivity and snobbery. When “non-essential” shops were allowed to open in mid-June, the scenes of queues outside Primark prompted a bizarre outburst of class-shaming on social media. I haven’t seen too many people doing that to the queues outside Waitrose – whose goods (unlike Primark’s) are available online. Meanwhile, the scenes of MPs snaking around Westminster thanks to Jacob Rees-Mogg’s archaic insistence on voting in person were a potent symbol of a government failing to move with the time. “It was a breeding ground for infection. Supermarkets have better Covid management in place,” one MP complained.But there was a brief golden period of the lockdown queue – before the prime minister took ill, in the days when it really did seem as if we were in it together – and I don’t mind admitting that a particularly well-marshalled queue in the Horfield branch of Tesco moved me to tears. What at first appeared to be an ominous sign of misery and privation soon revealed itself to be a model of practical good sense and community spirit.A Tesco spokesperson informs me that company policy is for all stores to start queues 6m from shop fronts, ensuring that 2m markers are clearly visible. There are signs alerting customers to the queues and, in the larger stores, “helpful colleagues” to marshal the queues – and “most importantly” to thank customers for their patience. A one-way system within stores and a “one in, one out” policy ensures that social distancing is observed. Longer hours minimise the need for queues and NHS, healthcare and emergency services workers, vulnerable and elderly customers are invited to identify themselves and move to the front.All this can make for a far more efficient shopping experience than usual. A socially distanced queue moves far quicker than a normal queue – what was previously a step forward is now a 2m stride. If you have a single queue for all checkouts, it eliminates any potential checkout envy. And if you have a nice Bristolian granny saying: “Thank you for waiting my lover, checkout number 15 there,” the whole experience can be quite spirit-lifting.But how English – how British – is this experience? The orderly lines outside voting booths in the US state of Georgia, where the Republicans brazenly attempted to stop black people from voting in this month’s primary, are a clear demonstration that, yes, other people can queue, too. The Japanese apparently view us as amateurs. A viral Reddit image shows customers at a Thai bank forming a virtual queue with their flip flops and sitting out the wait on a bench. In small shops in Spain, it is common to call out: “¿Quién es el último?” to find out who is last in line, a system that allows you to nip out for a cigarette without losing your place in the queue. It also relies on addressing a room of strangers and is therefore unlikely to catch on in the UK anytime soon.Joe Moran, social historian at Liverpool John Moores University and author of Queuing for Beginners, notes that queues are by their nature temporary so don’t really lend themselves to comparative studies. “It’s really hard to say whether the British have been better at queuing than other nations, just because a queue doesn’t leave behind any evidence,” he says. “You can’t look into an archive to find out how well-mannered people were in queues in 1950. And manners are incredibly subjective, anyway.”Still, there was a definite uptick in observations about the BritishEnglish and queueing when rationing took hold during the Second World War. This was the time when you might join a queue without knowing what it was you were lining up for. “Queuing was not a trivial thing, but a fraught feature of everyday life,” says Moran. “My hunch is that the myth developed as a necessary fiction. We had to convince ourselves that this was something we were good at, and could take pride in, because times were so difficult.” Pregnant women were given a stamp in their ration book that allowed them to jump queues – a little like NHS workers today. This gave rise to a popular joke. Shopkeeper: “Excuse me, Miss, are you pregnant?” Woman: “Well, I wasn’t when I joined the queue!”To some extent, the notion that we are a nation of queuers becomes a self-seeding myth. The idea that the British are a uniquely fair-minded people may not be based on any objective truth – but the more we tell the story, the more alert we are to infractions, especially from people who don’t look like us. As the historian of empire, Charlotte Lydia Riley notes, the story helps reinforce the idea that the British are a deeply law-abiding people who will wait patiently and respect hierarchy. “The counterpoint of the careful British queuer is the colonial mob,” she says. “The idea that foreigners don’t know how to queue also fits into the broader co-opting of very normal and universal things as ‘British values’.”Moran further notes that people have been complaining about the decline of the British queue for as long as the British queue has been a notable phenomenon. A 1957 Times leader on the death of the bus queue lamented: “It is nowadays hard to have a relationship with a subordinate which rests on mutual consideration based on acknowledged authority.” But bus queues are seldom seen now for a far more practical reason: they don’t make sense when there are different buses serving the same stop.“There’s always this nostalgia for the moment we were better queuers,” notes Moran. “As with a lot of nostalgia, that moment can never be located. It exists alongside the myth. But that’s what sustains myths. They need to be constantly maintained and we need to be vigilant.”It was Winston Churchill who made the most political hay out of queues – but as ever with Churchill, the reality is a little different from how it is remembered. After the Labour landslide of 1945, he conflated the queues with the new un-British strain of socialism. “Why should queues become a permanent, continuous feature of our life?” he thundered on the campaign trail for the 1950 general election. “The Socialist dream is no longer Utopia, but Queuetopia.” Clement Attlee’s Labour won that contest but lost in a snap election held the following year, having lost the support of middle-class women, who resented the amount of time they now spent queuing.In his book Militant Housewives, James Hinton quotes the Labour Party Women’s Organisation complaining that “the last election was lost mainly in the queue at the butcher’s or the grocer’s”. Labour’s Ed Miliband noted on his podcast Reasons to be Cheerful that Rees-Mogg’s Parliament queue itself became a site of insurrection, as MPs had plenty of time to scheme and grumble while waiting to cast their vote – even while observing the 2m social distancing.Queues are often less fair than they first appear. A day pass for Alton Towers – reopening in early July – is £34 in advance. A Fastrack Platinum ticket that allows you to jump all the queues is £100. We are not equally able to spend hours waiting in queues either. The rules governing holding someone else’s place in the queue are far from set in stone. And as much as we love to perpetuate an idea of fairness, we’re usually open to exploiting advantage. Think of all the politicians who have promised that Britain will be “first in the queue” when it comes to trade deals or vaccines in the future.“It’s about clarity,” says Moran. “If people know the rules, they tend to follow them. The good thing about a coronavirus queue is that it’s ordered – it has to be – so it’s visibly fair. When people see that it makes it much easier to be patient.” But the queue itself is not enough – it relies on iniduals within it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef771e178a2b56fd648883572b87eb803135cdb9/0_373_7360_4414/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=835e4b9aed9c0dfa67450e0d5d5e2237","title":"weird but true lockdown has made many families happier","story":"Almost a third of mothers tell a survey that despite home schooling and financial worries they feel closer to their familiesSome people may disagree, but a new study suggests that lockdown has strengthened many parents’ relationships with their children.Its previous studies have reported that mothers are bearing a disproportionate amount of the extra work involved in looking after children who would normally be at school. But the new findings suggest this has not negatively affected their relationships with their children.“Many recent studies have pointed out the increasing economic and caring burden for women,” said Prof Brienna Perelli-Harris from the ESRC Centre for Population Change at the University of Southampton, who led the study with Sandra Walzenbach from the University of Essex.She pointed to the April Covid-19 survey which indicated that, on average, mothers were spending nine more hours per week during lockdown on childcare and home schooling than fathers.“The survey has shown that working from home and having the time to home school seems to improve parent-child relationships,” Perelli-Harris said. “However, those who can work from home are most likely to have higher incomes and education.

Nixon, like thousands of others, had been informed by her travel agent that her package tour of Morocco could not go ahead because of coronavirus restrictions.Also, like thousands of others, her request for a refund was refused. The agent, TourRadar, claimed it was a “suspension”, not a cancellation, and that she would have to accept a credit note. The tour operator, Intrepid Travel, insisted that a credit note was the only option.Nixon, who is on furlough and fears for the future of her job, issued a chargeback claim for her £600 via her card company, Amex. That’s when the voicemail message was left.A TourRadar operative said it was successfully contesting credit card claims and that if she did not drop her case, it would deem her to have cancelled the holiday and breached the contract. She would, therefore, be left without a refund and lose her entitlement to the credit note.“TourRadar has continued to advise me every day by email that if I don’t withdraw the dispute within 24 hours it will remove the offer of credit and I’ll receive nothing,” she says. “It claims that it doesn’t have long to file paperwork with Amex to fight its side, but Amex tells me that dispute windows have been lengthened to 60 days. I believe they’re trying to put pressure on me by creating a false deadline. I now have no idea what to do.”The travel industry is facing ruin as Covid-19 continues to wreak havoc on the holiday market. Although consumer law requires firms to refund customers if they cannot provide the goods and services purchased, many are instead offering protected credit notes in a bid to remain solvent. Some appear to be trying to manipulate the law to deter those who are unable or unwilling to rebook their cancelled holidays.The Observer has been contacted about half a dozen agents who have retrospectively added exemption clauses to their terms and conditions, renamed cancellations “postponements” to avoid payouts or threatened customers who seek to enforce their right to a refund.The approach by TourRadar, which sells holidays arranged by a range of package tour operators including Intrepid, is troubling.Customers who do not receive the goods or services they have paid for have the right to make a claim via their card issuer. They can do this either through the voluntary chargeback scheme operated by Visa, Mastercard and Amex – which retrieves the money from the trader’s bank – or, if they used a credit card, under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act, which requires the card issuer to cover the cost.Nixon’s booking had already been cancelled by the tour operator before she sought redress from Amex, so it’s absurd for TourRadar to threaten to hold her liable for cancelling it herself.Nonetheless, an email from customer services informed her that the booking terms and conditions had been amended after the coronavirus outbreak to redefine cancellations as “suspensions”. Amended terms and conditions can’t be retrospectively applied to a contract and the original terms promised a refund if the operator had to cancel.Moreover, the Package Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements Regulations require operators to issue refunds within 14 days for cancelled trips. Nixon was eventually refunded after approaching Intrepid for a second time.The Financial Ombudsman Service says it was unaware of companies trying to pressure customers to drop claims. “Consumers have the right to make a complaint about section 75 with their bank and we’ll expect businesses to investigate these complaints thoroughly and treat consumers fairly,” it says.Amex told the Observer that it took into account the terms and conditions that were in place at the time of the transaction if a card holder raised a dispute. “Our card acceptance agreements require merchants to comply with the laws applicable to their businesses,” it says.TourRadar claimed that the voice messages were merely a recommendation that Nixon seek a refund directly from the tour operator, despite the fact that its subsequent emails insisted that Intrepid’s refusal was non-negotiable, and none suggested she approach Intrepid again.“Looking back, we do acknowledge that communication between our team and Ms Nixon was not very clear in explaining this recommendation as typically the most successful route,” says Vanessa Subramaniam, global director of customer support at TourRadar. “We take full responsibility for this. Moving forward, we’ll continue to work on our training to ensure processes like these are carried out in line with best practices and standards in place.” Intrepid Travel was contacted for a comment.Sheila Pearce was also told that her tour operator’s terms and conditions had been changed retrospectively, denying her the refund promised for her cancelled package holiday. When she attempted to recover the money through the small claims court, she was warned that the company would use pending insolvency legislation to thwart it.Pearce had booked a £3,640 tour of Pompeii with an award-winning specialist travel company, Andante Travel. She was notified that the trip would have to be cancelled due to the pandemic and was twice promised a refund within six weeks. Instead of her money, she received a message informing her that the booking terms and conditions had been changed and she was only due a credit note.“We objected on the grounds that we are pensioners with an underlying medical condition, so we will almost certainly never travel abroad again,” says Pearce.Andante refused to budge and, when she began legal action, its lawyer sent a letter advising that the company could not afford to pay refunds to all its customers. It warned that the directors would not defend her claim so a default judgment would be issued by the court and have to be enforced.Enforcement is usually done through a petition to wind up a company and, the letter stated, the pending corporate insolvency and governance bill, designed to protect struggling companies during the pandemic, would prevent Pearce doing that.“It will therefore be the case that in the event that you proceed with your claim and are successful in obtaining judgment, the company will not make payment and will be protected from further enforcement measures by you,” the letter concluded.The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy told the Observer that the new rules do not prevent creditors appointing bailiffs to enforce a county court judgment, and that winding up petitions can still be brought once the temporary new insolvency legislation has expired.“The measures are not a licence for a company not to pay debts which remain legally due and enforceable,” says a government spokesperson. “Where cancellations occur, companies have a legal obligation to ensure their consumers are fairly compensated.”Jackie Willis, CEO of Andante Travel, says the purpose of the letter is “simply to set the legal position from the company’s viewpoint, having received appropriate professional advice”.Pearce is still without her £3,640. Andante Travel promised customers that they can claim a refund if they do not use their credit notes before they expire at the end of March 2021, but Pearce does not want to wait a further nine months.“I feel they are, in effect, using our money as an interest-free loan without any agreement on our part,” she says. “This is causing us considerable stress, to say nothing of the disappointment from losing the chance to visit Pompeii which we have planned for 40 years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29ea36e40fa1903429a21915103739090b1696bb/69_336_3440_2064/master/3440.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ed19c199d42d87af6a8bb926070ef67","title":"buju banton upside down 2020 review as good as hes ever been","story":"(Roc NationGargamel)The controversial reggae star returns with a majestic howl of rage and an inspired mix of dancehall, roots and rockBuju Banton is the 90s Bob Marley in Jamaica. In the UK, it feels necessary to recall his miserably homophobic single Boom Bye Bye, which cast a poisonous pall over his nascent international career in 1992. Banton wrote it aged 15, half the age Eric Clapton was when he ranted about “keeping Britain white”. But we don’t read about Clapton’s racist drivel in every review and interview. Adult Clapton was given a pass that teenage Banton never got. White privilege? Perhaps.Yet although Banton renounced homophobia, and has now deleted the song from his catalogue, he was still performing it in 2007. And while there are dozens of Buju lyrics on Genius, only one has over 100,000 views. Its squalid allure endures. It shadows his later, conscious work.On his first album since release from jail on drugs charges, Banton’s visceral caw is similarly uncaged. Wolfishly savouring every smoky, oaked syllable, his secular and religious lyrics intertwine brilliantly with dancehall, roots and rock. These days Buju tries too hard to appeal to everyone, but the twitchily paranoid Trust and 400 Years’ majestic howl of rage are as good as he’s ever been.

Could she be the next Tory leader?Priti Patel did not betray so much as a flicker of anger. Her voice was calm, her shoulders steady, and she bit her lip only very briefly before responding to black MP Florence Eshalomi’s emotional call for her to acknowledge and act on the fears raised by Black Lives Matter protesters taking to the streets.She was “saddened”, she told the House of Commons, to be accused of failing to understand: “It must have been a very different home secretary who as a child was frequently called a Paki in the playground a very different home secretary who was racially abused in the streets, or even advised to drop her surname and use her husband’s in order to advance her career.” She needed no lessons on racism from Labour, she said.It was an arresting exchange, more so since Patel rarely talks of such things. She prefers to cast herself as the immigrant shopkeeper’s daughter made good, in a consciously upbeat echo of her heroine Margaret Thatcher a woman defined by overcoming adversity, not suffering from it. It’s a gung-ho attitude that has helped the Tories’ first female Asian MP rise to the top of a post-Brexit party. Yet it means surprisingly little is known about what makes the most senior woman in Boris Johnson’s cabinet tick. Even some of Patel’s colleagues are said to have been surprised by her vehemence towards Eshalomi, a thoughtful new MP of only a few months’ standing, and 32 Labour MPs warning that “being a person of colour does not automatically make you an authority on all forms of racism”. Some felt that as a woman of Asian heritage, Patel couldn’t claim expertise on black British experiences.Yet if there was a weight of history behind Eshalomi’s questions – she was thinking, she says, about her three-year-old son growing up and being targeted for stop and search – there was history too behind Patel’s response.Becomes the first female Asian Conservative MP. Picked for junior ministerial roles in the Treasury and Department for Work and Pensions by David Cameron. Allies herself with the ‘new right’ when she co-authors – with Dominic Raab, Kwasi Kwarteng, Chris Skidmore and Liz Truss – a 2012 book called Britannia Unchained, which calls for lower taxes and massive economic deregulation, with one section famously describing Britons as ‘among the worst idlers in the world’.Gains the right to attend cabinet after the election as secretary of state for the Department of Work and Pensions. A lifelong Eurosceptic, she campaigns vigorously for Vote Leave in the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign. Attracts ire from Emmeline Pankhurst’s great granddaughter, Helen, when she compares her anti-EU women’s campaign group, Women for Britain, to the suffragettes.Becomes international development secretary under Theresa May, raising concerns among departmental staff and aid charities because of her support for Brexit and her longheld scepticism towards international development and aid spending. One charity even compiles a cuttings dossier of her previous statements calling for the aid budget to be reduced or redistributed.The BBC’s James Landale breaks the story that Patel has held unauthorised work meetings in Israel with senior figures including Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, during what was billed as a family\u0026nbspholiday. She is summoned to Downing Street and, after first robustly defending herself, she resigns.After less than two years on the backbenches, returns to the cabinet under Boris Johnson in July as home secretary, prompting rights groups to raise her previous comments on areas including immigration, asylum and criminal justice – not least the death penalty, of which she spoke in favour on the BBC’s Question Time in 2011, a view she now disowns.Sir Philip Rutnam, the Home Office’s top civil servant, resigns and threatens to sue for constructive dismissal after what he calls ‘a vicious and orchestrated’ campaign against him by Patel. A string of further allegations emerge of her bullying, intimidating, belittling and shouting at civil servants in DfID and the DWP as well as the Home Office. She is said to have been cleared by a Cabinet Office inquiry, as yet unpublished.Criticises police chiefs for not clamping down on the Black Lives Matter protesters who toppled the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol. Condemns the actions of protesters around the country as ‘reckless and unlawful’. Stokes controversy when she tells the Commons she will not ‘take lectures’ on racism, having experienced it herself.All her life, she has faced uncomfortable questions about reconciling her politics with her identity. How can she justify curbs on so-called low-skilled immigration, which might have stopped her own parents coming to Britain? How could she be cheerleader for the leave campaign, which some saw as xenophobic, or defend the hostile environment for immigrants that led to the Windrush scandal (while apologising to Windrush victims themselves)? She has been accused of selling out, letting herself be used as cover for racist policies on social media she has been called a “coconut”, a racist term for someone deemed brown on the outside but white inside.Yet there is genuine anger among ethnic minority Tories both at charges of betrayal from the left, which they see as inflammatory in the current climate, and at what they see as pressure to conform to leftwing ideas of how they “should” think. For all the liberal fury Patel attracts, meanwhile, she can never go far enough for some on the right. She walks a similar tightrope to that described by Sam Gyimah, the black former Tory minister who defected to the Liberal Democrats, when he wrote recently that “many on the left were frustrated with me for not being black enough, and on the right for not quite belonging”.Priti Patel was born in London in 1972, to parents who had fled Uganda just before Idi Amin’s decision to deport all Asians. The Patels were originally of Gujarati Indian origin and she has said that her grandfather owned cotton and tea plantations overseas, yet they arrived in Britain with nothing. Her father dropped out of his studies to take low-paid work, eventually establishing his own chain of corner shops. His daughter grew up playing under the tills while her parents worked, then helping in the shop herself (it was a customer, the Conservative MP Cecil Parkinson, who first encouraged her to join the party.) She often talks of her gratitude to Thatcher for creating the conditions for her family to succeed, and like her, stands in an old rightwing tradition whose message is that if one person can succeed against the odds then others can be inspired to do so. It’s an ideology that doesn’t particularly emphasise solidarity with one’s own race, sex or class and often shifts responsibility on to people to solve their own problems rather than on society to change, reassuringly perhaps for those whose interests lie in society remaining roughly as it is. (Famously, Thatcher managed to become Britain’s first female prime minister while insisting that she didn’t believe in women’s lib, winning over men who might otherwise have felt threatened by her.)After Watford Grammar, an all-girls comprehensive, Patel studied economics at Keele University, followed by politics at the University of Essex. She was still at university when John Major’s disastrous exit from the European exchange rate mechanism triggered the Black Wednesday crash, and a recession in which her parents’ businesses were badly hit.That helped seal what was to become a lifelong distrust of anything to do with the EU. Patel’s first serious job was as chief press officer for James Goldsmith’s Eurosceptic Referendum party, a forerunner to Ukip. But when it disbanded after the 1997 election she came to work for the new Tory leader, William Hague, an instinctive Eurosceptic.It was there, as a cub lobby reporter, that I first came across her then in her mid-20s, she was friendly and energetic, with a sharp nose for news. As a rough indication of what Westminster culture in the 1990s was like for young women, I have an excruciating memory of being made to call her about a picture story my then boss insisted on running, the working title for which was “Priti by name, pretty by nature” (she was always immaculately turned out). She was very easygoing about it, given she wasn’t hired for her looks, but then she perhaps comes from that breed of Tory woman who associates complaining with playing the victim.She left Hague’s team in 2000 to work for the PR firm Weber Shandwick, followed by a stint at the drinks giant Diageo. It was during this period that she met and married Alex Sawyer, a marketing consultant and Tory councillor in Bexley, south London, while also hunting for a parliamentary seat. She was championed by some powerful names, including the then leader Iain Duncan Smith, but a winnable seat proved elusive (she ended up fighting the impossibly safe Labour seat of Nottingham North in 2005.)The big iding line of the era was not yet Europe, but how far the Conservative party needed to change in order to win. In the battle between modernisers – anxious to detoxify the brand by getting more female and ethnic minority MPs elected – and more reactionary traditionalists, Patel was classed as a moderniser. She told the Daily  in 2002 that her party’s problem was so obvious “it’s in gly colours and flashing lights this party has got to progress… We are seen as the nasty party. At the last election we were against things but not for anything.”Yet she was quick to say she had been taken out of context when she was quoted a year later by the Financial Times talking about “racist attitudes” in the party, words that could easily have damaged her chances with grassroots Tories already suspicious of the modernisers’ agenda. Already she was learning to walk a very fine line.Whether or not she chose to discuss it publicly, her allies certainly felt she was encountering prejudice both because of her ethnicity and her gender (selection panels were famously suspicious at the time of young women they thought might go on to have children). She was advised by at least one sympathetic senior MP to tone down the moderniser stuff, and stress her Euroscepticism instead. Shortly afterwards she landed the winnable seat of Witham in the Essex commuter belt, following a barnstorming performance before the selection panel in which she declared law and order was breaking down and backed capital punishment. (She endorsed it again on BBC Question Time nine years ago, but now insists she was never an “active supporter” her hardline views on crime have, however, been consistent throughout her career. She is an instinctively authoritarian home secretary, whose reaction to graffiti being daubed on the Cenotaph last month was to suggest 10-year sentences for defacing war memorials).Although she didn’t emphasise it, winning Witham in 2010 was a genuine watershed moment. “Remember, until she gets elected that night, there has never been a British Asian woman elected then there’s six that come in together,” says Sunder Katwala of British Future, the identity and immigration thinktank. “That just seems a million years ago now, but it wasn’t.” Although there have been male Asian MPs since 1892 and Diane Abbott became the first black female MP in 1987, one last hurdle to representation remained. Of the six who finally cleared it, Patel was the only Tory.Her first few months at Westminster weren’t easy. Her son Freddie was not yet two, and politically she wasn’t close to the clique around David Cameron. When she defied the whip in 2011 to vote for an EU referendum (not yet party policy), she knowingly blew any chance of early promotion.Yet hers was an unusually independent-minded intake, who decided early that slavish loyalty to the Cameron-Clegg coalition wasn’t necessarily in their long-term interests. Patel quickly allied with the so-called “new right”, mostly from more humble backgrounds than Downing Street’s Old Etonians and more hardline on issues such as welfare and the free market together with Liz Truss, Kwasi Kwarteng, Chris Skidmore and Dominic Raab (all but Skidmore now in Boris Johnson’s government) she co-authored their mission statement, a book called Britannia Unchained. A trenchant defence of capitalism in a post-crash era, it complained that “too many people in Britain prefer a lie-in to hard work”.Yet what’s striking, rereading it in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement, is that it opens with a notorious story from the previous year’s London riots. A young Malaysian-born student, newly arrived in Britain, had inadvertently cycled into the wrong place at the wrong time first he had his jaw broken by a teenager who stole his bike, and then he was robbed by two others who pretended to help him. For Patel and her fellow authors, Ashraf Rossli symbolised the best of immigrant Britain, with his A grades and determination to succeed his 17-year-old attacker, Beau Isagba, represented the worst of what his country had become. The story was intended to signal that “good” immigrants who worked hard to succeed were more than welcome, with the book lauding Asian tiger economies’ work ethic and high educational aspirations. But seen through a 2020 lens, what’s striking is the contrasting of an aspirational Asian teenager with a violent young man who – although the book doesn’t say so – was black. (One uncomfortable undercurrent of Patel’s clash with Florence Eshalomi is the way it suggested growing differences between BAME communities. A key demographic for the Conservative party is people of Asian and south Indian heritage, with socially conservative views on issues such as law and order and taxes but they do poorly among black Britons, a gap arguably now being exposed by the Black Lives Matter movement. Eshalomi herself is clear that “what I experience as a black woman of Nigerian heritage is totally different to what she does” as the daughter of Ugandan Asians, and that one experience shouldn’t be used to silence the other.)By 2013 Patel had been sufficiently forgiven by Cameron to join his policy unit, and by 2014 was a Treasury minister after the 2015 election she was promoted to employment minister in the Department for Work and Pensions, attending cabinet. Yet when her prime minister finally called the Brexit referendum in 2016, she risked it all to support what was widely expected to be the losing side, campaigning volubly to leave.“She’s very popular among Brexiters because like everybody in the cabinet at the time who put their jobs on the line, that was a very brave thing to do,” says Suzanne Evans, the former Ukip deputy chair who was on the board of Vote Leave. “It’s a testament to her principles.” While some wonder how deep Boris Johnson’s Euroscepticism goes, nobody doubts Patel’s. When she unexpectedly backed Theresa May, rather than the more obviously pro-leave Andrea Leadsom, in the post-referendum Tory leadership contest, some saw it not as a mellowing of her views but as an act of revenge for Vote Leave giving Leadsom more airtime than her.May rewarded her with a poisoned chalice: her first cabinet job, but at the Department for International Development (DfID), something she’d publicly advocated abolishing. Undeterred, Patel hired the Vote Leave staffer Rob Oxley (later to become Johnson’s press secretary) as her special adviser and embarked on a very public search for waste to cut.By the summer of 2017, May’s authority was visibly draining away but Patel’s star was rising. Her crowd-pleasing speech to that year’s party conference strayed well beyond the aid brief into a ringing statement of her credo that “wealth is created by people and enterprise. I believe in people, markets and freedom.”A month later, the BBC broke the news that during a family holiday to Israel that summer Patel had met senior Israeli politicians without telling the foreign secretary, a startlingly cavalier breach of the rules. More intriguingly still, she was accompanied by the Tory peer Lord Polak, chair of Conservative Friends of Israel given his impeccable connections among Tory donors, the instant assumption was that she was preparing for a leadership bid. To May’s fury, further details of undeclared contacts with Israel emerged, and Patel was forced to resign. She spent only 18 months on the backbenches before new leader Boris Johnson gave her not just a comeback but a big promotion to home secretary, with a remit to deliver on the promised control of Britain’s borders.It was seven months later that the first allegations emerged of her bullying, belittling and shouting at civil servants. Claims of a “toxic clash” with her permanent secretary Sir Philip Rutnam ended in Rutnam resigning, and threatening to sue for constructive dismissal. Similar stories began trickling out of the DfID and the DWP, where a formal complaint of bullying and harassment against the department was reportedly settled out of court for £25,000 with no admission of liability.Patel can be utterly charming, and disarmingly kind. When the bullying allegations emerged, 100 professional acquaintances signed an open letter to the Daily  in her defence. But with even her own husband reportedly calling her his “personal piranha”, colleagues don’t deny she has a temper, especially behind closed doors. As one puts it: “If you work with Priti Patel you see one Priti Patel, and if you work for her you see a different one.” Her pace is legendary – she rises at dawn, leaves late, and works through weekends – and she has no patience for being told something can’t be done, or having her convictions challenged.Some however see her bulldozing style partly as a means of hiding her own insecurities in a department notorious for being a political graveyard. “I think she herself is incredibly insecure, and the way that plays out is kicking the nearest dog. She isn’t as smart as some of the previous occupants,” says one former Tory staffer. Although she was thrown a lifeline this spring when leaked reports of an inquiry into her behaviour by the cabinet secretary found no evidence of breaching the ministerial code, at the time of writing the full report has yet to be published.In his autobiography, David Cameron writes that of all the ministers who campaigned against him for leave, it was Patel’s behaviour during the referendum that “probably shocked me most”. There was unease in No 10 over her willingness not just to attack the government of which she was still part but to front inflammatory Vote Leave messages suggesting that immigrants were fuelling a shortage of primary school places, or wealthy remainers didn’t understand how immigration hurt the poor.Tories who have worked in government with her dismiss the idea that she’s a puppet, manipulated into mouthing other people’s slogans: “It’s her, it’s what she believes.” But those beliefs are perhaps more complex than is sometimes acknowledged.The points-based immigration system she is introducing has been widely criticised for excluding so-called low-skilled migrants, doing jobs that in some cases have proved vital during the pandemic. But to the dismay of some leavers, it contains no legal cap on the numbers coming in she has ditched Cameron’s target for immigration to be limited to “tens of thousands”. During the referendum she repeatedly argued that ending unlimited free movement from the EU could mean Britain accepting more skilled migrants from former Commonwealth countries such as India or Pakistan, and she pushed hard inside cabinet for nearly 3 million Hong Kong citizens to be offered visas to live and work in Britain, amid escalating tensions with China. (Some wonder whether she sees parallels between the Hong Kong cases and her own parents fleeing Uganda when asked why she devises policies that might have excluded her own family, she invariably insists they weren’t coming to Britain seeking work – as entrants under the points-based system will be – but escaping a hostile regime, suggesting they might be classed as political refugees). For now, her tough stances on immigration and crime make her critical to No 10’s plans. But is her position as secure as it looks?She is the most senior woman in cabinet, yet wasn’t officially added to the innermost “quad” taking all the big coronavirus decisions until June, and appeared only rarely at the daily coronavirus press conferences. The rightwing tabloids love her, but some old Whitehall hands wonder if those eye-catching headlines are coming at the expense of long-term strategy. “Her survival is dependent on her playing her part as a key cavalier in the culture war, and that’s the problem,” says a former Tory aide.And while the Conservative faithful still adore her, the unspoken rule seems to be that she doesn’t make them feel uncomfortable. “Priti Patel is loved by the grassroots, but that’s because she expresses the views of the grassroots,” says one former colleague, who argues her appeal lies in making the party feel good about itself for choosing her. But like all tightrope walkers, Patel must know that if she makes the wrong call, the ground can be a very long way down."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f7161259a5950eabf076fb4dfba2a127b607b3d/0_334_7200_4320/master/7200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34aa470bdd0f24a436efd5b072b34484","title":"we never ran out of toilet roll the edinburgh eco store thats thriving in lockdown","story":"The husband and wife team running The Eco Larder have been stranded in different parts of Scotland in lockdown, but that’s not stopping them from keeping their zero-waste store openOn 5 June, The Eco Larder co-owner Matthew Foulds had his first day off work for 90 days. Making the most of his free time, he picked up a hire bike and went for a ride. An apt choice, given that when lockdown began, The Eco Larder started offering bicycle deliveries for the first time.This new option is one of the ways that Matthew and his co-owner and wife, Stephanie Foulds, have adapted their business during the coronavirus pandemic. “We started offering a delivery service as soon as the lockdown came into place because of how difficult it was for people to get hold of groceries,” says Stephanie. “And because we’re an environmental company, we decided to do this by cargo bike.”The Eco Larder is a zero-waste social enterprise food store in the Haymarket area of Edinburgh. It opened in November 2018 after a successful crowdfunding campaign helped the couple to raise £23,000. Their vision was inspired by their daughter, who was only six months old at the time. “She’s a really big driver for why we do what we do,” explains Stephanie. “We just wanted to bring her up in a world that takes better care of the planet than we have been seeing over our lifetime.”Juggling a newly established business and a small child is a challenge. Add a global pandemic into this mix? “It was total chaos”, laughs Stephanie, who is currently staying on the Isle of Bute with her mother and daughter. They travelled there before any of the lockdown restrictions came into force so that her mother, who shares their flat in Edinburgh, could recover from a period of ill health, which included a week in intensive care.Until she is able to return to Edinburgh, Stephanie is handling ordering for the store remotely while Matthew keeps the shop doors open with the help of assistant Charlotte Wood.Yet despite the physical ide, they have worked together to adapt their business model as circumstances changed. As soon as the store’s local Post Office shut, for example, they stopped orders of lifestyle products through the website. They also reduced the store’s opening hours to manage deliveries and the extra cleaning now required.The couple are both qualified yoga instructors and have a studio at the back of the store. While the physical classes have had to come to an end for now, Matthew is managing to find time on Sundays to offer a Zoom class for their regular yogis who are still keen for their weekly fix.The lockdown has resulted in more positive innovations too. As well as introducing cargo bike deliveries, The Eco Larder now offers click-and-collect. “It’s a contactless service,” says Stephanie. “We leave the goods outside the shop for people. That’s been really popular now that lockdown is easing.”Stephanie is keen to highlight Matthew’s hard work over the last few months (“I’m really proud of him for everything he’s doing and showing up every single day”), but it is thanks to both of them that their business has done so well. “We never ran out of toilet roll,” says Stephanie with pride.The couple have also been able to draw on support from various sources. Thanks to an existing relationship with a walking and cycling charity, they were able to borrow two cargo bikes and find two volunteers to do their deliveries. Being part of the Visa network has helped too. “Having the support of bigger companies is necessary for smaller businesses,” says Stephanie. “They have the resources to raise the profile of a small business like ours.”The couple have been keen to give back to others, too. Rather than charging for their deliveries, they asked for a £5 donation and put a food box together every week, based on how many deliveries they had, and delivered it to the foodbank at Tollcross community hub, which is close to the shop.Looking to the future, Stephanie and Matthew would like to open another store in Edinburgh as this would expand their zero-waste mission and allow them to reduce prices. “Being the type of shop we are, it’s all small suppliers,” states Stephanie. “It’s just an issue of supply and demand. The more demand that there is, then the lower we can provide prices.Until that is possible, the couple are focused on buying their own cargo bike and offering deliveries on all weekdays, not just three days a week – so Matthew had better get more practice miles in on his next day off too.Shop local.

The PE premium is a ring-fenced top-up to school funding which helps ensure every primary school-age child gets 60 minutes of physical activity a week. The £320m fund has been in place since 2013, but had not been confirmed for September, leaving schools uncertain as to their planning for the year.A series of athletes including Mo Farah, Hannah Cockroft and Manu Tuilagi wrote to the government two weeks ago calling for the premium to be confirmed, their calls backed by a number of youth and sporting charities and organisations.On Sunday the Education Secretary, Gavin Williamson, confirmed the money. “During these challenging times, it has become clearer to me than ever the importance of keeping active and how it benefits not just our physical health but also our ability to pay attention, our mood and our mental health,” he said.“I know that many children will have missed time spent outdoors with their friends – that’s why it’s so important that ahead of a full return to school in September, schools get the certainty they need to prepare their PE and sports activities for next year.”Unspent money from the funding for the previous year, interrupted by the pandemic, will also be rolled over. It follows research showing that lockdown has hit the levels of physical activity among children, especially the most vulnerable.Labour’s Shadow Sports Minister, Alison McGovern, criticised the government for being slow to confirm the funding. “I am relieved the PE sport premium funding has finally been confirmed but I am furious the Tories have once again played politics with our kids’ health,” she said.“Every year kids from low-income backgrounds fall behind their peers health-wise and this summer is set to be even worse, so the PE sports premium is even more important. But this is not new money. The delay was another example of the Government being slow to do the right thing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71a83b2f527efab0a1cf81c82b8c5594f5109169/0_9_4631_2778/master/4631.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c35b3bf1e829ef2ac37f5f5f855b5293","title":"austrian grand prix f1 live","story":"Lap 6571 Lrt’s have some standings:Lap 6471 Leclerc, in fifth, attacks Norris in fourth ... and he passes him beautifully! Meanwhile, in sixth, Carlos Sainz has just set the fastest lap of the race. Lap 6371 Hamilton and Albon are under investigation. Bottas leads the former by 1.981 s, which Perez is 3.079s behind. This is building! Lap 6271 That’s experience for you! Albon, who’s never managed a podium finish, tried too hard to get by when he had plenty of time to plot a route. Perhaps Hamilton didn’t leave him enough space to stay on the track, but he’ll be furious with himself. He’s now last. Lap 6171 Off we go again and Bottas streaks away. Albon has a slipstream on Hamilton but Hamilton shuts the door forcing him the long way around, then again, and WHAT! Lap 6071 The safety car will be with us for one more lap. Lap 5971 Albon has decided he was ahead of Perez when the safety car came out, so has moved ahead of him. Permission for the move was sought, and given. Lap 5871 I think it’ll be one more lap and then the safety car will be away. In the meantime, Verstappen tells Sky that he lost power and doesn’t know why yet, but it’s not how you want to start. He knew quite quickly that Bottas was quick, but thought he’d get an easy podium”. Lap 5771 The safety car is back, which I guess is good for Bottas and Hamilton, who want this race over save a quick joust for first place just before the end. Lap 5671 Raikkonen is out of the car and stalking off the track. The question now is whether Albon was ahead of Perez when the safety car was summoned, or whether Perez got back at him in time. Either way, that’s seven retirements so far. Lap 5571 Bottas leads by just over a second as they accelerate, but Albon takes Perez out, then Perez regains third place and Raikkonen crashes! His tyre came off its wheel, bouncing across the track, and what’s going to happen next? Lap 5471 The safety car goes, and off we go! Lap 5371 Christian Horner says his team “rolled the dice a bit”, bringing Albon in and losing a place, with the aim of getting it and others back presently. Lap 5271 By the looks of things and of those leading, it’s only Albon with new tyres. He should be a proper threat when we get going again.Lap 5271 Albon gets into the pits for a set of tyres, while Grosjean is still there. I think his day might be done. George Russell has a mechanical issue and has to pull off the track onto the grass verge. He’s out of harm’s way, but this’ll be a safety car situation because you can’t just leave him sitting there. Perez, Albon, Norris and chums are suddenly in with a chance of winning! Lap 5071 Romain Grosjean finds his way into the gravel track off the main track I think that might be it for him, and in commentary they think he might’ve run out of breaks. Lap 4971 The Mercedes can stay down the middle of the track and maintain their lead over third. Lap 4871 “We’re in worse shape than the other car,” Bottas tells his team. By the look and sound of things, Mercedes will have to try and hold on, with Hamilton sitting in second rather than attacking third. The things is, Albon in third is more than 10 seconds behind Hamilton.Lap 4771 “The gearbox issue is critical, please stay off the kerbs – that’s both cars”, Bottas and Hamilton are told. Gosh, might this be a chance for Alex Albon? Lap 4671 At what point does Hamilton make his move? Lap 4571 Bottas’ lead is now 0.697, and the problem is gearbox sensors. Lap 4471 Hamilton is told to stay off the kerbs a second time, on account of sensor issues affecting both Mercedeseseses. “Look after the car,” he’s told “He’s doing it more than me,” he says of Bottas. Lap 4371 But how is Hamilton going to take Bottas out if he drives down the the middle of the track? I’d not be surprised to see him file that suggestion in the bin. Lap 4271 Hamilton is told to stay off the kerbs. Sage advice I can apply to my own driving. Lap 4171 Hamilton starts his attack, a bit of DRS and a bit of slipstream taking a couple of tenths out of Bottas and another fastest lap upping the pressure. Lap 4071 Hamilton is in DRS range, but staying out of Bottas’ slipstream - in commentary, they wonder if theair is too hot. Lap 3871 The lead is now fluctuating between 0.5 and 0.8s. Hamilton has just set the fastest lap, but Bottas responds and extends the gap to beyond one second. Lap 3771 Bottas corrects after a couple of scrappy laps, taking the lead towards 0.7s. Lap 3671 Bottas leads Hamilton by 0.548s. “I think Mercedes have this well enuff,” tweets @claptonfan. “No real competition actually.”No, once Verstappen went it was only a matter of who comes first and who comes second. Lap 3571 Here comes Hamilton! That lead is now well below a second! Lap 3371 Perez sashays past Norris like it’s nothing! He now sits fourth, roughly two seconds behind Albon. Lap 3271 Bottas sets the fastest lap so far, and ratchets his lead up to over a second. Well! Sainz will replace Vettel at Ferrari next season. Based on what we just saw, it looks a move. Lap 3171 Bottas leads Hamilton by 0.869 - that’s actually a little more than was so when the car disappeared. Lap 3171 The safety car is going .... gone .... and off they go again! Lap 3071 I wonder for how much longer the safety car will be be on the track. As you might imagine, there’s not a lot going on for the now. Lap 2971 Bottas has binned the soft tyres he wasn’t enjoying and has open road in front of him, but I can’t see either of those two advantages being enough to hold off Hamilton.

No legislature, no law enforcement agency, no regulator. Congress has failed. The EU has failed. When the Federal Trade Commission fined it a record $5bn for its role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, its stock price actually went up.Which is what makes this moment so interesting and, possibly, epochal. If the boycott of Facebook by some of the world’s biggest brands – Unilever, Coca-Cola, Starbucks – succeeds, it will be because it has targeted the only thing that Facebook understands: its bottom line. And if it fails, that will be another sort of landmark.Because this is a company that facilitated an attack on a US election by a foreign power, that live-streamed a massacre then broadcast it to millions around the world, and helped incite a genocide.I’ll say that again. It helped incite a genocide. A United Nations report says the use of Facebook played a “determining role” in inciting hate and violence against Myanmar’s Rohingya, which has seen tens of thousands die and hundreds of thousands flee for their lives.I often think about that report. When I watch documentaries showing Facebook employees playing ping-pong inside their Menlo Park safe space. When I took a jaunt to the suburban Silicon Valley town earlier this year and strolled down the “normal” street where Mark Zuckerberg lives his totally normal life as the sole decision-maker in a company the like of which the world has never seen before. When I heard that Maria Ressa, the Filipino journalist who has done so much to warn of Facebook’s harms, had been sentenced to jail. When I read the Orwellian defence that our former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg wrote last week. “Platforms like Facebook hold a mirror up to society,” he said.Facebook is not a mirror. It’s a gun. Unlicensed – it is not subject to laws or control – it is in the hands and homes of 2.6 billion people, infiltrated by covert agents acting for nation states, a laboratory for groups who praise the cleansing effects of the Holocaust and believe 5G will fry our brainwaves in our sleep.People sometimes say that if Facebook was a country, it would be bigger than China. But this is the wrong analogy. If Facebook was a country, it would be a rogue state. It would be North Korea. And it isn’t a gun. It’s a nuclear weapon.Because this isn’t a company so much as an autocracy, a dictatorship, a global empire controlled by a single man. Who – even as the evidence of harm has become undeniable, indisputable, overwhelming – has simply chosen to ignore its critics across the world.Instead, it has continued to pump out relentless, unbelievable, increasingly preposterous propaganda even as it controls the main news distribution channels. And just as the citizens of North Korea are unable to operate outside the state, it feels almost impossible to be alive today and live a life untouched by Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram.But this is so much bigger than Facebook’s problem with hate. And it goes far far beyond the US, though the role it will play in the US election is pivotal (and it’s worth noting that #StopHateForProfit’s demands don’t extend to stopping lies in political ads, a crucial necessity). Facebook’s harms are global. Its threat to democracy is existential.Is it a coincidence that the three countries that have dealt with coronavirus worst are those with populist leaders whose campaigns exploited Facebook’s ability to spread lies at scale? Trump, Bolsonaro, Johnson. Perhaps. Perhaps not.And if you don’t care about democracy, think for a moment about coronavirus. If and when a vaccine comes along, will enough people want to have it? Facebook is riddled with anti-vaxxing like it’s infected by antisemitism. If that’s a mirror, Nick, you might want to take a long, cold, hard look in it.Sometimes you don’t realise the pivotal moments in history until it’s too late. And sometimes you do. It’s not quite yet too late. Just almost."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29f0a97b70c0bf0419c30cde755789b2d7c76797/108_345_4642_2786/master/4642.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75870d69d2c8ed5df2e384ba05b092e0","title":"jim steyer the man who took on mark zuckerberg","story":"With 800 firms now joining the Facebook advertising boycott, the man whose idea it was explains how the company could easily clean up its act With more than two billion users Facebook is bigger than Christianity,” says Stanford law professor Jim Steyer. “Their ability to amplify hate speech or white supremacy or racist messages is so extraordinary because of the scale of the platform.”It’s a typically bold statement from the man who set up the Stop Hate for Profit (SHFP) campaign calling on advertisers to withdraw from Facebook for the month of July. More than 500 firms have joined the temporary boycott, including Coca-Cola, Adidas and Unilever.As far as Steyer is concerned, Clegg, the former deputy prime minister and leader of the Liberal Democrats, has become a mouthpiece for social destruction.“Nick should be embarrassed for putting that forward,” says Steyer. “He and Mark would flunk a fifth-grade civics class with their libertarian ‘free speech trumps everything in society’ argument. The first amendment doesn’t apply to Facebook. The first amendment applies to government restrictions on speech in the United States.”He says the campaign is not afraid to “shame people who do terrible things to our society,” as long as it doesn’t involve ad hominem attacks. As forthright as he is in his opinions, some of the heat is taken out of them by the fact he seems to call everyone by their first name. This may be because he knows everyone. A renowned networker, the ebullient 64-year-old has been said to be “connected to more big names than Kevin Bacon”. His “little brother”, as he calls him, is the billionaire former hedge-fund manager Tom Steyer who ran a conspicuously unsuccessful campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. He dropped out in February, having spent $191m on advertising.Among the names he mentions is “Sheryl” – Sandberg, the number two at Facebook. Steyer likes to joke that he is “no longer invited to Sheryl’s Hanukkah party”, as a result of his 2012 book, Talking Back to Facebook.It argued that Facebook, along with other social media platforms, had “a very significant and negative impact on the social, emotional and cognitive development of children”. Steyer is the founder of Common Sense Media, a non-profit organisation that promotes safe media and entertainment for children. A New Yorker, he started out as a schoolteacher in Harlem and the South Bronx, moved into civil rights – he did death penalty work with the lawyer and activist Bryan Stevenson and ran the NAACP Legal Defence Fund – and began teaching civil liberties at Stanford in 1986.Today, with his flowing blond hair and wearing an old T-shirt, Steyer looks every inch a Californian. On our Zoom call he even uses an image of a surfer’s wave for his screen backdrop. Since his book, his attitude towards Facebook has if anything hardened. Last autumn he found himself in conversation about social media with a new friend, “Sacha”, the comic actor Sacha Baron Cohen – best known for the satirical inventions Borat and Ali G. “He’s a very, very intelligent man,” says Steyer.They were joined by Jonathan Greenblatt, head of the Anti-Defamation League. Out of their discussion came the idea for SHFP. Steyer’s intention was to launch the campaign back in January but decided more partners were needed. In the event Baron Cohen made a cutting reference to Facebook’s CEO when he introduced JoJo Rabbit at the Golden Globes.“The hero of this next movie is a naive, misguided child who spreads Nazi propaganda and only has imaginary friends,” said Baron Cohen. “His name is Mark Zuckerberg.”It was the protests provoked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on 25 May that led civil rights groups including Colour of Change and NAACP to come on board with Steyer. “A lot of the white supremacist arguments being made and falsehoods about both Covid-19 and racial justice were on Facebook,” he explains.The newly formed coalition’s strategy was to “hit Facebook in the wallet”. But it’s a very large and deep wallet. The company generates more than $70bn in annual advertising revenues, and most of that money comes not from major brands but from small businesses.So far the boycott has been limited to the United States, which means many of the companies that have been vocal about withdrawing their advertising continue to spend money on Facebook elsewhere in the world. Indeed, some have simply shifted their advertising to Instagram (also owned by Facebook) or targeted Facebook users through the Facebook Audience Network.Steyer is aware of these get-outs, but says he’s astonished by how quickly the campaign has taken off, far outstripping his expectations. In any case, he says, this is just the first stage. SHFP are now seeking a global response, and are looking to the UK and Europe to follow suit. They’ve set up a London office, headed by former Conservative culture minister Ed Vaizey.“It’s critical the UK and Europe speak up,” says Steyer, “because they’re incredibly important territories for Facebook and the big tech companies, and there should be a universal rejection of hate speech and racism and mass disinformation because they’re actually undermining the norms of our democracy.”But is Facebook to blame for racism and hate speech? Is it the job of communication forums to police content? Until relatively recently, the social media giants have done a very effective job of presenting themselves as disinterested platform providers, no more liable for what takes place on their sites than a phone company is responsible for the conversations that occur between two callers. Using section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act to make its case, Silicon Valley companies have successfully passed themselves off as internet service providers rather than publishers, which means they are not legally liable for user content. Steyer says it has become his “crusade” to remove this protection from companies like Facebook. “They’re the biggest publishers in the world,” he complains, “but they’re seen as utilities.”A complicating factor – and one on which SHFP is applying pressure – is that social media, in particular Facebook, has eaten up most of the advertising revenue that traditional media, operating with all the restrictions and responsibilities that publishing entails, long depended upon. This economic component is just one part of a complex jigsaw of interlocking issues and causes that Steyer passionately maps out. It’s no coincidence, he argues, that the growth in unregulated social media has been accompanied by a growth in “authoritarian populism”.“Don’t tell me they can’t figure that out,” says Steyer. “They’re a trillion-dollar company. If they really wanted to, they could completely clean up that platform.”SHFP maintains that Facebook not only allows too much hate speech, but also has chosen Breitbart News as a “trusted news source” and has made the right-wing news website The Daily Caller a “fact-checker” (one of the third-party entities that review the accuracy of stories on Facebook). Both publications, says SPFH, have “records of working with known white nationalists.”SPFH also admonishes Facebook for not actively helping to get out the vote. Is that their responsibility too?“I didn’t put that there,” Steyer says, before accusing Facebook of allowing voter suppression messages aimed at African Americans. Clegg made a commitment on Thursday that “every Facebook user of voting age in the US will be given information, prominently displayed on the top of their News Feed, on how to register to vote”.Nevertheless for Steyer, the company’s political leanings are clear to see. “Zuckerberg has his thumb on the scale for Trump,” he says.Referring to the private dinners held between the Facebook chief and Donald Trump, and attended by the Trump-supporting libertarian billionaire and Facebook board member, Peter Thiel, Steyer believes the Facebook hierarchy has allowed the president to use “dishonest ads and misinformation” and spread hatred. Thiel last week let it be known that he won’t be backing Trump’s presidential campaign this year because of the economic damage wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic.Amid the Black Lives Matter protests, Twitter placed warnings on some of Trump’s tweets, including the line, notorious for its racist echoes, “when the looting starts, the shooting starts”.Trump put the same message on Facebook and Instagram without any intervention. Zuckerberg said while he disagreed with Trump’s language, democratic accountability meant that the president’s words should be available for scrutiny.“They’ve permitted him to have violence and hate…” says Steyer, before trailing off.Having grown more animated in his denunciations, he is suddenly aware of moving too far from the stated agenda, and promptly issues a reminder that the campaign is politically nonpartisan. “It’s not Trump we’re focused on. It’s hate, misinformation and racism. All the platforms have responsibility, but the biggest offender is Facebook.”Ultimately, he would like to see Facebook, which owns WhatsApp and Instagram, broken up and subject to the same publishing guidelines as the old media on whose content it trades. But that, he concedes, will be a long struggle.“I’ll be doing this for many years to come. I’m a young man, I like my job, and unlike my brother, I’m not going to be running for president. I look at this as a mission.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f6f09a3b1c680a4477b4c2b6afd55819f8117a8/0_208_3153_1892/master/3153.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc299a853ba8a681c46ab6130b640faf","title":"the big picture summer camp goodbyes","story":"Mark Steinmetz’s pre-Instagram pictures show American teenagers and children at camp experiencing their first taste of independenceFor about 10 years from 1986 Mark Steinmetz photographed children at American summer camps. He taught photography to the kids, but he also captured those moments when children discovered the strangeness and possibility of independence for the first time. Summers in bunk beds and cabins and woods stretched ahead of them, communal and lonely by turns. Part of the photographer’s motivation was to recapture the intensity of the periods he had spent away from his own family as a boy.His pictures are from different camps and different years but they share an emotional trajectory. The children arrive singly, clutching sleeping bags, they slowly overcome fears in ritualised games and campfire bonding, and they leave changed. In this picture the time away is coming to a close. The bus is waiting to return teenagers to the routine of home and school and TV. But as Steinmetz’s says: “Even if they’re miserable and bitching to one another throughout, by the end they’re like: ‘Oh my God, this is ending, you’re my best friend, and this has been the most intense thing I’ve ever done in my life!’”One of the things that strikes you most about these images – now collected in a book, Summer Camp – is how unselfconscious the children seem in the presence of the camera they don’t yet know all the angles. It is probably no coincidence Steinmetz gave up his project with the arrival of ubiquitous digital photography. He has persisted in working with film, and in black-and-white, over the years since because he “prefers the way film describes the light”. His summer camp pictures make that argument, which is less about nostalgia than a kind of emotional connection. “With digital,” Steinmetz has said, “every object in the frame seems slightly distinct and separate from every other element in the frame whereas silver prints have more internal harmony – they feel less nervous.” Summer Camp by Mark Steinmetz is published by Nazraeli Press (£50)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87fe8fb175a148a3243109a5c86a4100754acd3b/0_243_3645_2187/master/3645.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d26093316251d256cfb0ead38dee29b","title":"anthony costello world health organization independent sage coronavirus","story":"The paediatrician and member of Independent Sage on Matt Hancock, the likelihood of a vaccine and why 50,000 deaths were preventableAnthony Costello is a paediatrician and international expert on child health who has been an outspoken critic of the British government’s response to Covid-19. He is a member of Independent Sage, a group of experts set up to provide “robust, independent advice” in regard to the UK’s coronavirus policies, and former director of the Institute for Global Health at University College London. He has worked in a number of low-income nations, developing effective strategies for cutting newborn and maternal mortality rates. He also served as director of maternal, child and adolescent health at the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva.What do you think about the decision to open pubs yesterday?Well it’s very odd in Britain that we’re opening pubs before schools. It says something about our priorities. Being outdoors the risks are pretty low – 19 times lower risk according to a Japanese study. I would have said open pubs as long as you serve outside. The worry is that people will be crowding together to get drinks, and that as they’ll be drinking, they’ll lose their inhibitions. And in an indoor space there’s lots of potential to be a super-spreader. So I’m a bit opposed to pubs opening, but I understand the reasons why they’ve done it.Do you agree with Sir David King, chair of Independent Sage, that the government has lost all moral authority?Did the government ever have much moral authority? The whole English response, almost from the beginning, has been an unfolding tale of inidualism and new Conservatism, which has damaged public health. Now you have this bizarre situation where you’ve suddenly got this mysterious body called the joint biosecurity centre, which is going to be in charge of data and nobody knows who they are or where they’re getting it from. You’ve got Public Health England (PHE) being marginalised and, I would think, abolished, and the Sage (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies), which is now wary of the politicians, not really being listened to. So it’s a very odd situation.PHE was blamed for restricting the coronavirus testing process to its own labs. Was that a fair criticism?Yes, I think it is. If they’ve got any defence it’s that the whole public health system was turned on its head about seven years ago with the Lansley reforms. We had a structure in place that allowed regional public health people to take control of something like an epidemic, and that was dismantled. They’ve degraded the public health system. You could also argue the problem was Sage. In early February, they should have known that this was a pandemic that was coming and the first thing you would want to do was test – and they had a test. Why didn’t they go to the 44 molecular biology laboratories around the country that were all geared up to do this? There was no public health person on Sage. No one who was independent who could say: “Come on guys, this is what you’ve got to do.”Should the Black Lives Matter protests have been allowed to go ahead?Given that protests are outdoors, and if they’re well managed and the people organising the protests make a serious attempt to control them, you could argue that democracy overrides the risk at the moment because we’re on the downward part of the curve. The problem is if protests get very big, there is a risk there. But pubs are much more risky than a protest or even Bournemouth beach, which got slightly unfairly criticised.What do you say to the criticism that Independent Sage muddies the message and undermines Sage’s authority?David King always says Indie Sage has got to be relevant to the pandemic and constructive in suggesting areas that can be improved on. Obviously, there are people with axes to grind, me included, about aspects of what the government or Sage have done. The problem with Sage is that it is unbalanced. They’ve got some very good modellers and some good behavioural scientists, but a lot of them have now come over to us because they were very frustrated that they weren’t being listened to. Science should be open and discursive.It’s widely thought the lockdown should have started earlier. Why do you think it didn’t and what difference would it have made in terms of deaths?The first reason it didn’t happen is because they decided early on that testing wasn’t going to be done. That was bizarre. That led on to them really planning a response to the wrong virus – flu. Flu is a very different virus. You don’t test for it because it spreads so quickly. The influenza mindset then led them on to this herd immunity idea – that it’s a pandemic and you can’t stop it. They had 230 contact tracers for 67 million people. In Wuhan, they brought in 9,000 for around 10 million people and they had a full lockdown... I fell off my chair when I watched that 12 March announcement from Johnson. Almost everything they said was wrong. Can you name a virus where you let it run through the population to get herd immunity? Herd immunity is what you get from a vaccine. At the moment we’re at about 65,000 excess deaths, according the Financial Times. I honestly think we could have prevented about 50,000 of them, if we’d gone early like South Korea. I think Sage got it wrong, PHE got it wrong, and Boris Johnson got it wrong.What is your assessment of a vaccine development and when, realistically, is the earliest one will arrive?The good news is that you’ve got more labs in the world looking for a vaccine for this virus than any other. They’ve got better techniques for designing vaccines and there’s a lot of money going into it. Having said that, they’ve never had a vaccine to a coronavirus. Vaccines usually take several years to develop because you’ve got to test the safety of it. And most worrying, it seems the immune response to the virus is not very good, and fades. That suggests any vaccine you come up with may have only short lasting immunity. For all those reasons I’m cautious. The people I respect say two years would be a possible time. My guess is that we may get a partially effective one a bit quicker.Is it possible that, as Sunetra Gupta of Oxford University suggests, many people have come into contact with the virus but not developed antibodies?Yes, it is possible. When I first looked at Sunetra’s stuff and I spoke to epidemiologists I respect, they said she can’t possibly be right. She overestimated the spread of the disease and underestimated its strength. Having said that, there’s some element of truth in what she thinks.What do you think of Matt Hancock’s performance as health secretary?I tweeted recently that he should resign. At first I thought he was probably the most authoritative of the ministers in the briefings. Then he became obsessed by testing without understanding why you do it, from the finding, testing, isolation and support – you need all of that for it to work. But latterly, I think the decisions to go with private companies such as Serco and Deloitte, and with this total mess in Leicester where they can’t get the data because the private sector doesn’t share it – I think that’s almost criminally negligent. And the decision to bypass PHE rather than strengthen it, and strengthen links with primary care, has been lamentable.There has been much speculation about societal change following Covid-19. Do you think that will happen and how would you like it to manifest?I hope so. Although I’m a paediatrician and most of my work is doing community health in low-income countries, in the past 10 years I’ve been quite involved in climate change. I’m co-chair of the Lancet countdown on climate change and health. I used to do too much flying and I always felt when I was at the WHO that you didn’t need to do so much of it. I know Zoom can drive you round the bend but we’ve done everything at Indie Sage on Zoom. And it’s been incredibly productive. My fear is that within a couple of years, if this all settles down or we get a vaccine, things will go back to where they were. But the climate crisis is so much more serious and we have so little time to get this right."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d330d7c2b9469c72aaa22264c6d4428a5f7bdb14/0_363_5425_3254/master/5425.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9831d6d7416f58cd662bd41ffd38b0a2","title":"hong kong books by pro democracy activists disappear from library shelves","story":"Move follows new security laws and include titles by Joshua Wong and lawmaker Tanya Chan Books written by prominent Hong Kong democracy activists have started to disappear from the city’s libraries, online records show, days after Beijing imposed a new national security law on the finance hub.Among the authors whose titles are no longer available are Joshua Wong, one of the city’s most prominent young activists, and Tanya Chan, a well known pro-democracy lawmaker.Beijing’s new national security law came into force on Tuesday and is the most radical shift in how the semi-autonomous city is run since it was handed back to China by Britain in 1997.China’s authoritarian leaders say the powers will restore stability after a year of pro-democracy protests, will not stifle freedoms and will only target a “very small minority”.But it has already sent fear coursing through a city used to speaking openly, with police arresting people for possessing slogans pushing independence or greater autonomy and businesses scrambling to remove protest displays.Wong said he believed the removal of the books was sparked by the security law.“White terror continues to spread, the national security law is fundamentally a tool to incriminate speech,” he wrote on Facebook, using a phrase that refers to political persecution.Searches on the public library website showed at least three titles by Wong, Chan and local scholar Chin Wan are no longer available for lending at any of dozens of outlets across the city.An Agence France-Presse reporter was unable to find the titles at a public library in the district of Wong Tai Sin on Saturday afternoon.The city’s cultural services department, which runs libraries, said books had been removed while it is determined whether they violate the national security law.“In the process of the review the books will not be available for borrowing and reference,” it said.The law targets acts of subversion, secession, terrorism and colluding with foreign forces.China says it will have jurisdiction in some cases and empowered its security apparatus to set up shop openly in Hong Kong for the first time, ending the legal firewall between the two.Rights groups and legal analysts say the broad wording of the law – which was kept secret until it was enacted – outlaws certain political views, even if expressed peacefully.Any promotion of independence or greater autonomy appears to be banned by the legislation. Another vaguely worded provision bans inciting hatred towards the Chinese or Hong Kong government.On the Chinese mainland, similar national security laws are routinely used to crush dissent.The new security law and the removal of books raised questions of whether academic freedom still exists.Hong Kong has some of Asia’s best universities and a campus culture where topics that would be taboo on the mainland are still discussed and written about.But Beijing has made clear it wants education in the city to become more “patriotic” especially after a year of huge, often violent and largely youth-led pro-democracy protests."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9ca3de7dfc470c7081a20558c257c9dd4c8ea4f/269_176_2324_1395/master/2324.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45fab5a451a295f3b5f30e818cfe47ce","title":"matt hancock praises people for acting responsibly as pubs reopen in england","story":"Health secretary says overall he is pleased with behaviour as hospitality sector reopensThe health secretary, Matt Hancock, has praised “the vast majority” of people who behaved responsibly as pubs in England reopened on Saturday.In an interview on Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, he played down a claim from the chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales that social distancing could never work with people who were drunk.Asked for his overall assessment of how the easing of lockdown measures on Saturday had gone, Hancock said: “From what I’ve seen, although there’s some pictures to the contrary, very, very largely people have acted responsibly.“So overall I’m pleased with what happened yesterday. It was really good to see people out and about and largely, very largely, social distancing.”Fears that the decision to schedule the lifting of lockdown restrictions for pubs in England on a Saturday might lead to widespread disorder proved unfounded, but John Apter, the Police Federation chair, said people who had been drinking were not complying with social distancing rules.He said: “What was crystal clear is that drunk people can’twon’t socially distance.”Asked about Apter’s comments, Hancock said that throughout the coronavirus crisis there had always been some incidents that were “very unhelpful”. But they were just a small minority, he said. “The large proportion of people, the vast majority of people, are, I think, doing the right thing..”Hancock said the government had a “balanced message” for the public: “People should enjoy summer safely, and of course the emphasis is both on enjoy and safely.”Stressing the need for people to carry on with safety measures such as hand-washing, Hancock went on: “We have got this virus getting right under control, the number of new infections is under 600 on the last data, so it is really coming down in terms of the number of positive cases that we’re finding and that is good news.“But we’ve just got to have the resilience and resolve to stick at it and to be very careful in how we enjoy those new freedoms.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b39fd2c061208fb3feab77e4c205c9109cce1db/0_393_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=baddee33d2fca6669e5b5e5c50ca022a","title":"planet virus seven novelists from around the world on living with the pandemic","story":"Covid-19 has exposed social and political fault lines from Brazil to Iceland to South Korea. Here, seven acclaimed writers share their lockdown experiencesTayari Jones is the author of five novels. Her fourth book, An American Marriage, won the 2019 Women’s prize for fiction. Her latest novel, Silver Sparrow, was published in March, to critical acclaim. Born and raised in Atlanta, she returned to the city recently after a decade in New York, to teach at Emory UniversityI was born in 1970, two years after Martin Luther King Jr was martyred in service to civil rights for all Americans. As a child, I reaped the benefits of the sacrifices of my parents’ generation. I was spared the tyranny of Dick and Jane, instead learning to read with books featuring drawings of happy, beautiful black children. My first paediatrician was a black man, modelling for me and my brother that we could be doctors, scientists, or whatever else we wanted to be. I never felt the sting of a racial slur hurled at my face until I was about 40 years old, living in New York City. Because of the strong foundation on which I had been built, I experienced the insult with annoyed disbelief, not as a blow to my soul.Social justice has always been my parents’ ministry. As a mere teenager, my mother participated in the Oklahoma City sit-ins, three years before the famous Greensboro demonstrations. My father protested segregation at the Greyhound bus station for his trouble he was arrested, jailed for a week, and then expelled from university. Their bravery was rooted in a commitment to bettering the world for the next generation. This is my parents’ greatest gift to me: a life without the daily in-your-face racism that they faced growing up in the Jim Crow south.But now, in 2020, my parents are on my mind every day, as we are living in a horrific Venn diagram, where the plague of racism overlaps with a global pandemic. Mama and Daddy are, thankfully, in good health. But they are 77 and 84 years old. They aren’t young any more. Covid-19 is especially dangerous to the elderly. It is especially lethal for elderly black people.Luckily, my parents are intelligent. They listen to doctors. Daddy is especially compliant, wearing the masks my mother sews, even when we meet for our weekly outdoor visits.The conversation inevitably turns to politics, and all of our moods darken. Every day there is another outrage. The police murders are the hardest, as they echo the lynchings that were an omnipresent danger in my father’s boyhood in small-town Louisiana. Above his mask, eyes reflect anger and despair.My parents live in a lovely neighbourhood of roomy stucco homes, nestled on cul-de-sac blocks, adorned with crepe myrtle trees and dogwoods. It must be said that it is a lovely black neighbourhood. (The mayor herself lives only a mile or so away.) They chose to live on this side of town because they enjoy the comfort of other black folks. Here, they are free of the hassles of everyday racism, like your neighbours mistaking your kids for prowlers and calling the police. They do, however, have to deal with the soft racism that shows itself in the little things. For example, their favourite grocery chain won’t deliver to their home, but pick-up service is an option. I live about 15 minutes away in an integrated neighbourhood, so we have the food delivered to me and then I take it to them. I am happy to be useful.The person who delivers the groceries also does the shopping. My order appears on her phone and she texts me to ask if it’s OK to substitute white rice for brown, or pears for apples. She apologises that there is no yeast in the store at all. The hired shopper is almost always a black person, usually a woman. One day, she drove up as I waited on my deck. From my perch, I told her to make sure to take the envelope tacked to the door, where I leave extra tip money. I asked her if she would like a bottle of water.“No, ma’am,” she said. “We have plenty in the car.” Unmasked, chatty, and vivacious, she explained that every day she drove two hours to Atlanta. Her town, she said, didn’t need much grocery delivery. “Also, we drive for Uber Eats!”Confused, I said, “Who is ‘we’? Do you work with a partner?”She said: “No! It’s me and him.” She went to her car and opened the back door. A few seconds later, she showed me a plump baby. She held his arm and bobbed it so it looked like he was waving.On the drive to my parents, all I could think about was that baby. The delivery woman is what we call an “essential worker”, which means that she works for low wages and cannot shelter at home to hide from the virus. I imagined her walking through the store, infant on her hip, shouldering the risk for me and my family. I thought of the extra tip tucked in an envelope. It wasn’t enough. It could never be enough.When I arrived at my parents’ home, they were waiting on the lawn, sitting on folding chairs. Daddy stood and took a step toward me, his arms extended, but then he remembered and let them fall to his side. My mother invited me to look at her flowerbeds, fretting that her begonias weren’t thriving this year.I told them about the delivery woman and her baby.“How old?” my mother asked.“Six months, looked like.”Daddy frowned at his fist. “This goddamned country,” he said. Now it was my turn to move in his direction, arms outstretched, only to turn away because, in the age of Covid-19, touching is not allowed.Maxim Leo, 50, is an author, screenwriter and journalist. Born and raised in East Berlin, he continues to live in the city and has worked as an editor at the Berliner Zeitung. His memoir, Red Love: The Story of an East German Family, won the European book prizeYesterday, I watched Meet the Parents with my daughters for the 86th time. Since by now we know the dialogue off by heart, this time we watched it in Greek, which made the film even funnier, not least because of the curiously high-pitched dubbed voice of the Greek Robert De Niro. I was particularly struck by one thing: the people in the film often stand very close together, they’re constantly hugging and shaking hands for far too long. I thought: this is crazy, aren’t they scared?Until it occurred to me that I was still hugging people 10 weeks ago. It was 13 March, a Friday. I had a reading in Brandenburg to which only four people came, because of the start of anxiety about the virus. After that I drove to my friend Esther’s birthday party. We drank, laughed and danced a lot there was a strangely cheerful atmosphere, as if we’d already sensed that there wouldn’t be another evening like that for a long time.All of that seems so far away, as if from another time, another world. Which means above all what an incredibly important part getting used to things plays in our lives. Sometimes I think our whole life is one long process of getting used to things. That everything we see as immutable and decreed by fate is ultimately nothing more than a routine that we’ve come to love. Which means that we could radically change our lives at any time even without a crisis. If the fear of the unknown were not so great. And the love of what we know.A lot of people say this pandemic will change the world and our lives will never be the same as they were before. I don’t believe that. Because getting used to things works both ways. In a few weeks we will have forgotten a lot of what seems so big and inevitable right now. Most of what we are now struggling to learn will pale into the mist of the past. As soon as the situation is different.Personally, I’m a passionate nostalgic – I always mourn the past and wallow in memories. Incidentally, it doesn’t matter a damn how unpleasant the past was. For example, when I still lived in the German Democratic Republic I thought the country was completely round the bend. Then, when the GDR was gone, I missed it.That’s how it could be with the coronavirus. I wouldn’t be surprised if I kept this chapter of my life in melancholy memory too. Particularly given that there are already a few things that I’ve just learned and I’m a bit proud of for example, the technique I have by now perfected of opening doors with my elbow. Or the idea of stopping cutting the nail on my right index finger because it means I can use the touchpad of the credit card reader without making dangerous skin contact.Or the breathing technique that I’ve developed over the weeks, which allows me to hold my breath for up to a minute if somebody near me sneezes. Or the turbo-personality scan that I’ve developed to categorise passersby coming towards me in the street by risk group, and distancing myself more or less according to my estimate of the situation. Or, don’t forget, my video-conferencing skills. Amateurs always look at the screen, vain amateurs only look at themselves. The professional looks into the camera and consequently looks everyone straight in the eye.What I still haven’t managed to do is keep my distance. I still stand too close to people. I was like that before too, though. I like touching people and sometimes pinch particularly good friends on the bum. That’s actually what I miss most, when I come to think about it.Otherwise, these days I sometimes look at the international statistics of new infections and deaths and think: well, I guess we’re not doing too badly. I know it sounds a bit silly, as if I was the health minister or something. No idea why I’m filled with pride all of a sudden, but that’s the way it is.This morning, as I write this, for example, the number of new deaths in Germany had fallen to a record low 23 people had died of the virus over the previous 24 hours. The only places doing better were Russia, Turkey and Iran and let’s not talk about the transparency and honesty situation in those countries. So I assume that at the moment we Germans are in first place in terms of deaths. We’re corona world champions, you might say.And that’s wonderful when you bear in mind that we have not only the handsomest virologists and the most enlightened chancellor, but also the best hospitals, the most brilliant ventilators, the most money and the most awesome crisis management – even though we also have the most criminal meat producers. Somehow, that makes you feel that you yourself are all the more awesome, brilliant and handsome, doesn’t it?Of course, I realise how embarrassing and backward-looking such feelings are. They are the opposite of European integration and human solidarity – they are steeped in stupid arrogance, narrow-mindedness and egoism and belong in the emotional dustbin! For ever!And I’m afraid I still feel that way, I can’t help it. That’s also how it was before corona – I nodded proudly when it said on the news that we were once again world champions in exports. Then I quietly thought to myself: not bad, world export champions! Hats off to you, ladies and gentlemen! As if I had even the slightest thing to do with it. And the only thing I’ve ever exported from Germany is my battered dark-brown suitcase.Corona pride is, of course, much worse because it’s about human lives. And because it’s supposed to be a source not of joy but of humility when fate is kinder to you than it is to your neighbour. That’s why we can’t go around boasting about our magnificent successes it doesn’t go down at all well in other countries. I see that in the video conference calls with my wife, Catherine’s family. Her sister lives in Milan, her brother in Paris, their parents in Brussels, all more or less corona hotspots, as you can tell in the video conference calls by the fact that the others all look very pale because of the strict lockdown. We’ve stopped telling them that we always go to our garden in Brandenburg at the weekend, but they can tell anyway – by our suntanned holiday faces.The conversations are difficult too. You can’t ask: “Well, what have you been up to?” I know that, because I’ve asked the question. And the answer was icy silence. Even cheering words are frowned upon and pity is out of the question. Right now, as a successful German crisis-fighter you’re pretty much on your own.My wife says the Germans have no sense of solidarity. She says: “You bring back 240,000 German tourists, you let 30,000 eastern European harvest workers fly in. And only 47 Syrian refugee children. You’re opposed to corona bonds and your biggest fear is not being allowed to fly to Greece in the summer! You should be ashamed!”At such moments, it occurs to me that as an east German I am in a sense the Greek among the Germans. And that my false pride might also be a cry for love. I’d need to think about it.Translated by Shaun WhitesideThis story has a false ending. In the movies that’s when the villain gasps back to life, a bloodied hand claws the floor, a zombie bolts upright for one more kill. In Aotearoa, in New Zealand, we were Covid-free for 24 days. Now we’re not. She’s baa-aack. If the pandemic had a musical score, that trick ending might be a caesura, shown by two parallel diagonal lines: railroad tracks, only we ran out of rail.The opening scene is a party in late February. The house is packed, people squeezed against walls and crammed on to the deck, drinking from anyone’s glass, dancing close. A guest says calmly we’ll be in lockdown before long, that millions, globally, may die. Is he making it up? He’s a what, epidemiologist? Have another drink!One month on, the world has changed and alert level 3, near-lockdown, looms. A screen split four ways: Zoom. One friend worries about her partner overseas. Another, in Australia, isn’t sure what support non-citizens will get. Will anyone keep their jobs? We’ll make it through, we swear, with love. An hour later one of those friends and I are fighting over whether it’s safe to keep our date for dinner. Accusations, crying, fear. That night we do meet, don’t hug, and hand sanitise madly, agreeing how rigorous isolation will be. Cut to us outside in the dark, sharing drags on a damp-ended joint, exhaling with borrowed calm.Alert level 4: the interminable middle. Cases rising. The first death. For a country with huge inequality, we’re small enough that the prospect of mass death feels terrifyingly personal. There’s a sense of solidarity, although everyone’s lockdown depends on the pre-existing conditions of their life.Here’s another music notation: the fermata. I feel like a dot muffled under an arch. A friend incorporates the pandemic into her novel there are brilliant zines, poems, endless fucking online readings, as though the writing world has been poised for this, introverts raring to go. Me, I’m bringing back the zombie metaphor, teaching on Zoom, enjoying bloodless family harmony despite the urge to stab someone, and wandering an internal desert. What’s the point of anything, any more? But Christ, I am thankful – for the safety of loved ones, the job, the house, the time to angst.Another word some use to describe what’s happening is rāhui, a Māori concept which, among its meanings, can connote protection from harm by placing temporary restrictions, management of an endangered environment, the observance of restraint. Not all agree it’s the right word to use, but this, rather than the carceral-sounding “lockdown”, suggests the potential implicit in the pause.Trust in the government is high, but there’s change needed before they earn everyone’s the pandemic response comes under scrutiny for ignoring Māori considerations. Ongoing inequities in the healthcare system, in so many systems, the systems themselves, are exposed anew. In parts of the country, Māori communities set up their own checkpoints to successfully protect the area and people, an enactment of devolved power, with police and other institutions following the community’s lead.It’s one thing to obey instructions when you generally agree with those giving them I try to imagine how I’d feel if our previous, rightwing government was implementing lockdown. Polls are stratospheric for Jacinda Ardern, whose masterly communication skills, steeliness and genuine empathy were established well before this crisis. At some point, the leader of the opposition gets rolled for failing to read the room – losing subplot status to the booming national side hustle in chief medical officer merch.My son has moved home from his university hostel. “What’s the first thing you’re going to do when we go to level 2?” I ask our cosy family bubble. Without missing a beat he says: “Pack.” But the bubble concept works. So light, gentle, clean. If alert levels conjure civil defence seriousness, the bubbles connect us to the suds we’re constantly frothing up in the sink.Active case numbers dwindle. It feels hopeful, but weirdly hollow. Many of us have connections with other countries, friends to whom it feels indecent to mention the moment our new cases stop. Level 2 arrives one midnight in May. A neighbour celebrates by gunning his car. It might be the best sound I’ve ever heard.And suddenly, astonishingly, we’re out. A crisp blue autumn has given way to cold flat skies. Who cares! It’s level 1! Outlines are sharper, people are beautiful, all is possible. We gather in a pub to hear a politician talk about environmental change. We gather at BLM support rallies that call for decolonisation. We gather to watch sport. Well, I don’t nothing could deliver that plot twist. Instead I run through peopled streets to my nephew’s concert, a student quartet playing exuberant Haydn in an empty church, the violinist rising from his seat as he wields the bow. In that moment all I want is for everyone in the world to be able to hear live music.Now we know that the idea we could be Covid-free was a false ending. That’s OK. We’re better off without fantasies of “purity”, of “specialness”, that keep us from taking responsibility. And just this week, the health minister has resigned. But we still have, at the time of writing, no community transmission we’re still at level 1. And we did act collectively. We could keep on doing that.In a ski town, by an achingly beautiful lake, a local tells me people have already left to try their luck in the cities. Maybe the ruinous loss of international tourism will be good for the environment, she says maybe recovery could look different fewer people on the mountain trails. Right now it’s desperate. Rents, debt. Two of her friends had the virus. One survived. The other, she says, chose not to go on. Silence. I don’t ask for details. We talk instead about the global situation: how long does she reckon before things improve? That means how long till a vaccine, a stupid question. She uses the word “we” to mean something more than just this country. It’s the first time I’ve heard that since our lockdown lifted. “We’ve still got new cases rising daily,” she says. She means all of us.Natalia Borges Polesso is a Brazilian writer and journalist. In 2017 she was named as one of the Bogotá39, a list of the most promising young writers in Latin America. Her book of short stories, Amora, translated by Julia Sanchez, was published in MayThere’s a saying we have: Brazil is not for amateurs. I get it. Still, even as a Brazilian, it’s hard to breathe easy at the moment. I speak from a position of relative privilege. I work from home. My routine is practically unchanged, with the exception of all the literary events that have been suspended, postponed, cancelled or moved to online platforms. And yet I’ve been feeling tired. There have actually been a ton of book clubs, lectures, panels and debates and since I’ve been home it’s seemed easier to attend everything. But it isn’t. It tires me out, wears me down. Everybody wants to talk. Everybody needs to talk.I want to talk and have conversations too. Sometimes I feel like opening my mouth to scream: enough! Everybody supposedly in charge, cut it out. You got us into this position and now you want to go back to “normal”? At the expense of human lives? More lives lost every day. For what? I want no part in it.But it’s hard to scream when you can’t breathe. And for some, that is not a metaphor.There are good days and there are bad days at any moment in time, but here in Brazil there are a lot more bad days if you look at the political situation, which is terrible. Two health ministers have been fired in the middle of a pandemic because they didn’t agree with the madman currently occupying the most important seat in the nation. Our deplorable president doesn’t appear to have a plan to handle the health crisis or to handle the social crisis that’s sure to arise as a consequence of his growing negligence. And he definitely doesn’t have a long-term plan for taking care of the Brazilian people. I can’t even think about art, culture and education, all of which have been systematically attacked and discredited by many politicians in Bolsonaro’s government and their supporters. It’s all heartbreaking. I don’t understand why people would want to go back to what they call normal. It reeks of death. It’s like a plot for genocide.In Brazil, every day we wake up with a hole in our chests, and though it’s hard, it would be impossible not to follow the news. It’s difficult to watch people in your extended family share fake news and hatred on social media. During the lockdown, we’ve had the military police throwing teargas at demonstrators protesting against fascism a Ku Klux Klan-inspired march with torches and white robes a pro-dictatorship march attended by the president the president and his lackeys deliberately toasting with a glass of milk, claiming that it was in support of the farming business, even though we all know it is an alt-right symbol that extols white supremacy a black boy gunned down by the police in his aunt’s house (the police fired 72 rounds). Here, we call Bolsonaro “Bozo”, the name of a sad clown in a 1990s television show. I feel bad for the clown, not the president. Meanwhile, he legitimises death, racism, sexism, LGBTQ-phobia and populism.I haven’t been able to work. My work basically involves language, thinking about things and debating them. You’ve got to be healthy in mind and body for that kind of work. You need courage. My relationship to the world has changed. My relationship to time has changed. My relationship to dreams has changed. I can no longer think of tomorrow, for example. I used to like it that the future was mysterious and uncertain, but not any more. Now, the future looks disastrous and distressing. The incompetence, the desire for death, the genocidal policies we are being subjected to will leave deep marks.Those of us who survive this pandemic will need great creativity to envision new ways of narrating the world and narrating this mess, this wreck. I believe in and cling to the strength of those who live through this world every day and who must forge for themselves a new world every morning, in this world that has long been ending. I will join my people in creating something new, something once unimaginable, something that will give us all room to breathe.Translated by Julia SanchezSjón is an Icelandic poet, novelist, lyricist and musician whose books include The Blue Fox, Moonstone: The Boy Who Never Was and CoDex 1962, both published by Sceptre. He frequently collaborates with the singer Björk and has performed with the Sugarcubes as Johnny TriumphAs someone who has written a novel that takes place in the days of the 1918 Spanish influenza, I was maybe better prepared than most people for the narrative that the coronavirus set in action. It was all eerily familiar to me from the research I had done for my book, Moonstone: The Boy Who Never Was. The string of denials following the discovery of a new virus. The belief or hope that it will somehow stay put with the population it preys on first, as the first victims tend to be the most vulnerable in society and therefore already “unclean”, unlike the rest of us. The disbelief that it was really as infectious and deadly as the viruses of the past. The reluctance of politicians to take immediate measures against it, seemingly because these are both expensive and unpopular – they disrupt the flow of money and goods. But most likely it is because pandemics always shake the foundations of societies, by exposing their underlying social illnesses, and sadly most politicians are not up to the task of making the systemic changes needed to make us better prepared for the next virus attack… even if it were just for that.So, for the past three months, I have been marking on my checklist the mistakes made, the good actions taken in the private and public sphere, the acts of kindness and selfishness, the deceptions of the opportunists, the sacrifices by those on the frontline.It takes a global disaster for the people of a small place such as Iceland to remember that we are also a part of the planet’s ecology or realpolitik. When life runs smoothly we “play nation” in our miniature country under glass – turning it upside down once a year to make it snow in winter – and it’s only the occasional volcanic eruption that turns the eyes of the world our way. But the small population size of our island and its distance from continents can also be our strength, as the first round of the fight against the coronavirus has shown.From the moment the first person tested positive, the authorities managed to get the people’s attention and turn the response to the advancing wave of cases into a national competition to flatten the curve. The government focused on economic and social measures while admitting their shortcomings in the medical field and promising to heed the advice of specialists. The ministers stepped aside and the daily press meetings were handled by the Directorate of Health and the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management and given by two doctors and a police officer. At every meeting, there was always a guest representing hospital workers or different civilian groups directly affected by Covid-19 or by the rules we had to adhere to. The method of testing, tracking and quarantining proved to work and the 2-metre distancing between people and restrictions on assembly did too, as did the closing of the borders. To that success story I must add the contribution of the private bio research company deCODE, which donated manpower and technology to make the mass testing possible. As with elsewhere there was a flurry of online cultural and communal events organised by people in lockdown, meaning I didn’t get too far in my discontented box-ticking when it came to my own country.Still, what underlying social illnesses did the pandemic reveal to us here in Iceland? Well, for the first 20 days, all information sent out by the authorities was in Icelandic only – announcements on everything from the importance of hand-washing to unemployment benefits to access to testing or treatment, ignoring that an ever growing part of the population uses other languages in their daily lives. We were so used to excluding the Polish, the Filipinos, the Lithuanians, the Latin Americans, the English speakers (to name but a few) from the public discourse that no one thought of providing them with the same life-saving information deemed essential for the rest of us. Luckily, that changed and now the official website on Covid-19 is available in more than 15 languages, and for the first time the Icelandic National Broadcasting Service and the major newspapers translate into Polish and English.I believe this feeling of opening up the public platform also resulted in the big turnout at the recent demonstration for Black Lives Matter in Reykjavík, where Icelanders of colour shared their experience and were listened to with more attention than ever before. Hopefully the culture of inclusion and respect will become one of the long-term changes in Icelandic society brought on by the virus.The simple lesson we should take from all of this is that “inequalities are a virus’s best friend”. By proxy, it will also make us better at tackling the ongoing climate emergency that Covid-19 has pushed to the side for the time being.Yes, like so many others, for the past three months I have been dreaming more vividly than usual.Domenico Starnone is an Italian author, screenwriter and journalist whose novels include Ties and Trick, both translated by Jhumpa Lahiri. Born in Naples and now living in Rome, he and his wife, the translator Anita Raja, have often been whispered about as the real authors of the works of Elena Ferrante, but have never confirmed or denied thisCovid-19 barged into my life in the same way adults did when I was a kid. I’d be playing wildly with my brothers or cousins or friends and the adults’ sepulchral shadows would appear out of nowhere and say: “That’s enough.” All of a sudden that same desolate silence fell over things, at home and in Rome, the city where I live.The most obvious harbinger came from the big Catholic church across from my building. Until February it was, for a non-believer like me, irritatingly active. People sang at the top of their voices, they played music and, most significantly, all the parishioners, both young and not so young, would linger and chat outside until midnight. Then lockdown made a desert of everything and rats took over the churchyard. I’d watch from my balcony in the evenings, feeling no relief.Within days, everything lost meaning. People soon gave up chanting patriotic hymns and cheerful songs from their windows. No more Sundays with children and grandchildren. Intellectuals delved into all the books that made even the vaguest reference to a plague. The planet suddenly turned into what it is: a shard of matter, overcrowded with action figures who are precariously alive. Religion, history, philosophy were all laughable. So too science, whenever it offered up remedies that were as old as the hills. And the arts, literature? Compared with the urgent reality of supermarket queues and the number of people who were infected and dying, they seemed like toys meant for frivolous times.The worth of national character was quickly reduced to precious little, too. When the virus raged in China, windbags in the west had plenty to boast about. Then it came to Italy and we became the butt of the joke. In the end, fear put us all in our place. We in Italy were the first to behave sensibly, like sheep obeying every edict uttered by prime minister Conte, who, despite some ups and downs, has surely done a better job than Trump and the petty dictators who share his vision. Of course, one should not imagine that obedience – those harbouring authoritarian fantasies take note – was absolute. I have a friend who, locked up because of the virus, a prisoner in his home, with a wife and three children, broke every human and ine law in order to see his lover, even for a few minutes, on the other side of the city. And I witnessed how a respectable gentleman in a queue at the supermarket, who had politely asked some fellow to keep a safe distance, proceeded, risking that distance himself, to come to blows with the undisciplined inidual who had rudely talked back to him.Now, they say, the war is over: we finally know the enemy, so we turn back to our old fairytales. These are misleading metaphors. Wars have always been fought by human beings who confront one another with intense ferocity. The virus is neither friend nor foe, it’s just a part of the innocent becoming of all things. What we dealt with, and continue to deal with, is merely a collective educational experience that has shown us how all our planetary games can lose meaning and can seem both egotistic and futile. So we ought to be ready to reorganise them according to nobler rules founded on altruism. But now we’re worn down by the fear of getting sick, coupled with the fear of wretchedness. Optimism smacks of blindness.Translated by Jhumpa LahiriKyung-sook Shin is a South Korean novelist whose breakthrough novel, Please Look After Mother, sold over 2m copies in Korean and went on to become a bestseller around the world. She became the first woman to win the Man Asian literary prize in 2012 for the same book“It’s not our first virus, so we had better be careful,” was my initial reaction to hearing about Covid-19. This is self-centred of me, but even when Wuhan went into lockdown, I thought of it as a problem exclusive to China. Having this titan of a country as our neighbour, Koreans have long accepted that the weather in China determines the amount of particulates in Korea’s air and I assumed this would play out like that. Soon enough, Koreans started testing positive. A religious group called Shincheonji in the city of Daegu created the first major cluster, putting Korea on high alert. But I remained self-centred. Despite Daegu’s distress, my thoughts mostly concerned my friend in Seoul. Last autumn, she had moved her ageing father to an apartment below hers to take care of him better, and what a relief that she did so. If she hadn’t, my friend would have worn herself down to the bone with worry.I was, even at that point, complacent. Then I saw on the news that infected passengers on a cruise ship were being denied entry and the ship was left with nowhere to go. A chill ran down my spine. That inside this ship some were dying while others were being infected but none of them was allowed to leave… This ship lay in the water for several days. News that the passengers were from 56 countries rendered me speechless. I finally realised, then, that Covid–19 was a global event. Events in Seoul were also moving fast. The number of diagnosed patients increased by the day. Our phones rang with emergency alerts and the Korean Centres for Disease Control began daily briefings.Patients’ movements were revealed to the public and the streets where they had passed through were shut and sterilised. Then came the World Health Organization declaring it a pandemic and countries closed their borders. An acquaintance of mine staying in Lisbon had her plane ticket cancelled six times, finally managing to come home by detouring through a string of countries that allowed her to pass through, and she immediately complied with self-isolation upon landing in Korea.With our neighbouring countries, China and Japan, as well as Europe and America in turmoil, being a Korean living in Korea felt reassuring for the first time. Even little children talked knowingly about “social distancing” and long queues formed at pharmacies selling masks. For the past 15 years, on days when I was in Seoul, I’d show up at my neighbourhood yoga studio at 9.30 in the morning. That studio closed. The cessation of this ritual made me feel as if time itself had frozen. My schedules cleared I was the first to suggest we postpone a book club meeting with diplomat wives in Seoul to discuss Please Look After Mother. Korea was also looking forward to a National Assembly election on 17 April was it going to be delayed? But the Korean people adhered to social distancing, wore their masks, disinfected their hands and voted in the elections.After that, I decided to remain calm. I read no newspapers and watched the news for only half an hour in the evenings. The news was making me feel anxious that Covid–19 was going to end the world. I thought, in light of this unprecedented event, I needed to take stock of my life. I disinfected my yoga mats and left them out around the house. Whenever I felt helpless while reading or doing my writing, I got on to a yoga mat and did whatever asana that came to mind. In the morning hours, where I used to read the papers, I did a yoga session on my balcony. Mostly 16 sets of salutes to the sun and some deep breathing.My neighbourhood has mountains behind it and in front of it. The mountain in the back is Bukhansan, frequented by many Seoulites. My feet usually led me to Bukhansan for hikes, but one day, I turned in a different direction, towards the mountain on the other side, the one I’d neglected because I’d been distracted by Bukhansan’s beauty.“Look, this trail was here all along,” I thought to myself as I went into one forest one day and another forest the next. Flowers bloomed and then fell along the trail. The buds on the trees soon grew into lush leaves of green. With travel now impossible, I pined after new horizons. But the things I had forgotten while I’d been busily on the move were coming back to life one by one. “This is all part of life, too,” I thought. When I thought about why I was so good at adapting to frozen time, I realised it was because, pandemic or no pandemic, a writer’s life has always been a life of slipping into the self-quarantine of work.Despite this, the pandemic was the first silent war I had experienced, just when – as someone born in 1963 – I was wondering what could possibly remain unexperienced. I’d glance at whoever entered a lift without wearing a mask anyone coming up to me to say hello made me anxious. The pandemic has shattered life as we know it. A young friend returning from New York, in the midst of quarantining herself in rental accommodation to protect her parents from possible infection, texted me saying “I miss you” while in quarantine. “I miss you, too,” I answered. She could not take a single step outside her apartment, so her masked mother would leave food for her at the door, text her and wave at her from the doors of the lift. She said it was a sad and funny situation, that she had spent 14 hours on a plane but was unable to see her mother up close.But a serious problem is that this battle doesn’t look like it will end soon. Even Korea, which has defended itself fairly well, keeps having new clusters. Our patience seems to have run out. The virus shows no signs of slowing down and will probably continue to mutate. Last month, news came in that cafes and restaurants in Paris had reopened. Can we ever return to our lives before the pandemic? I’m pessimistic. Still, we cannot keep our children at home for ever, or stay away indefinitely from elderly parents in nursing homes. We have to create a new everyday. We must accept that this unprecedented experience is part of our lives from now on. And the next step is to think deeply about how we must change.Translated by Anton Hur"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17ef08f2c032d5d9504b64c8efde5bae8c06289c/126_0_2795_1677/master/2795.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97f42eeeb9bb8bc0fd637302cfd4506f","title":"have differing approaches to social distancing rules caused issues in your family","story":"We want to hear from people who have experienced issues with family or friends over different approaches to physical distancingThe prime minister has confirmed that the 2-metre rule would be dropped in favour of a “1-metre-plus” approach, as people from two different households will be able to drink or dine together from 4 July in England.However, those who are more at risk or vulnerable may choose to continue to maintain the 2-metre rule or wear face masks or gloves.We want to hear from people who have experienced any issues with friends or family over different approaches to physical distancing.We are keen to hear from more than one person in the same familycouplefriendship group, if they have differing views.

She examines how housing pressures, in-work poverty and racial inequalities contributed to the deaths of 36 residents from Covid-19 journalist Aamna Modhin tells Rachel Humphreys about reporting from Church End, a small neighbourhood in Brent, north London, which has a large Somali population. In early March, residents began to fall ill from coronavirus, eventually resulting in 36 deaths. Locals believe the cluster, which is the second worst in England and Wales according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics, does not account for the true scale of the devastation, as it does not factor in people who work in Church End but live nearby.  Aamna met Rhoda Ibrahim, a 57-year old community leader who has been left devastated by the deaths of so many people she knew. The virus thrived on the structural inequalities that Ibrahim has spent much of her life fighting against. It flourished in a housing crisis that was 40 years in the making, stark in-work poverty that left many struggling to put food on the table, and deeply entrenched racial inequalities. The council leader, Muhammed Butt, believes the government’s failure to provide tailored support to communities such as those in Brent worsened the situation, and that the country should have gone into lockdown earlier.

Residents of A Marina, along Spain’s northern coast in the province of Lugo, will not be able to leave the area from midnight on Sunday until Friday.I mentioned earlier that a group of scientists are planning to write to the World Health Organization (WHO) to suggest that they are underplaying the risk of airborne spread of Covid-19.Hannah Devlin, our science correspondent, understands what they are saying rather better than I do, and has written a report for us about the conflicting views. As she puts it:WHO guidance states that the virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact. Aerosol transmission involves much smaller particles that can remain in the air for long periods of time and can be transmitted to others over distances greater than one metre.Members of the WHO’s infection prevention committee have said that while aerosol transmission may play some role, there is overwhelming evidence that the primary routes of transmission are through direct contact and respiratory droplets expelled during coughing, sneezing or speech. They said introducing new measures to guard against aerosol transmission was unfeasible and unlikely to make much difference to the spread of infection.However, what this group of scientists are saying is that:Emerging evidence, including from settings such as meat processing plants where there have been outbreaks, suggests that airborne transmission could be more important than the WHO has acknowledged.It is well worth reading the whole of Hannah Devlin’s piece to get a better understanding of why they are disagreeing with the current assessment from WHO.Read it here: WHO underplaying risk of airborne spread of Covid-19, say scientistsThe north-western Spanish region of Galicia imposed restrictions on about 70,000 people on Sunday following a Covid-19 outbreak, a day after Catalonia also introduced a local lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus.Reuters reports that people living in A Marina along Spain’s northern coast in the region of Lugo will not be able to leave the area from midnight on Sunday until Friday, two days before regional elections in Galicia on 12 July.The regional government said people will be allowed to move around A Marina but only those who need to travel for work will be allowed to leave or enter the area.Regional health minister Jesus Vazquez Almuina told a news conference on Sunday that the biggest outbreaks were linked to bars in the area. Regional health authorities said there were 258 cases in Galicia, of which 117 were in Lugo.Spain’s health minister Salvador Illa said on Sunday the ministry was following the situations in Galicia and Catalonia very closely.“Social distancing and lockdown measures were the key to flattening the curve. Now they are needed again to stop the outbreaks,” he said in tweet.Spain has registered 205,545 coronavirus cases and 28,385 deaths according to health ministry data, making it one of Europe’s worst-affected countries.Speaking of prayers, there have been mass prayers in Bali as the Indonesian resort island prepares to reopen to tourists shut out due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Sultan Anshori reports for Reuters that more than a thousand people attended a prayer at Besakih Hindu temple in the town of Karangasem, expressing gratitude for the handling of the new coronavirus on the island and seeking blessings for the start of a “new normal”.Bali has reported 1,849 coronavirus infections and 20 deaths so far, while Indonesia as a whole has recorded 63,749 cases and 3,171 deaths since early March.The idyllic Southeast Asian island will gradually reopen this month for domestic tourists, while maintaining a “strict health protocol” to prevent the spread of the virus that causes Covid-19, Bali provincial secretary Dewa Made Indra told reporters.“What I hope is the best for Bali and ... all the tourists will come to Bali and everybody will be happy and healthy again,” Robin Tesselar, a Dutch citizen staying in Bali, told Reuters after attending the Besakih prayers.Tourism-related businesses are preparing to for the reopening by implementing the health protocols, aiming to improve them until Bali reopens for international tourists, said hospitality executive Yoga Iswara. Churches have been open in England for the first time for three months. Worshippers were asked to observe hygiene and social distancing guidance, including changes to singing and Holy Communion, during services.At York Minster, which reopened for evening prayer on Saturday after being closed since 16 March, worshippers were limited in number and asked to leave their names and contact details.Staff and clergy wore face masks and visors to welcome visitors, a one-way system was in place and hand sanitiser was available.Ahead of the reopening, the Minster said services will be simpler and shorter initially, with changes including no congregational singing, hand-shaking or drinking from the common cup during Holy Communion.The Dean of York, the Right Rev Dr Jonathan Frost, said: “We are delighted to open our doors again to welcome people for public worship and to explore this magnificent sacred space.“Over the last few weeks we have welcomed many for inidual prayer, but to gather again for worship - with relevant physical distancing measures in place - will be a huge encouragement for many.”There will be fewer people nursing hangovers in church than might have been expected - fears of widespread disorder last night as English pubs re-opened proved unfounded.And as well as the socially distanced Sunday services, there’s also been at least one church wedding today. Hayley Collins and David D’Arcy got married at 10am this morning in a socially distanced service with 27 guests at St Anne’s Church in Aigburth.They had originally planned to marry on 4 April, but the service had to be postponed.The Miami Herald this morning has published a blunt editorial castigating US president Donald Trump for his coronavirus response, and urging Republican state Gov. Ron DeSantis to take drastic unilateral action on face masks in Florida.It seems after weeks of plateauing new cases, we exhaled briefly and reopened. Now, we’re going backward, just as the nation’s head of infectious diseases, Fauci, predicted. He also has said: “Anything that favors the use of masks, whether it’s giving out free masks or any other mechanism, I am thoroughly in favor of.” With Trump exiting the stage here, DeSantis should be his own man, step up and make wearing masks in public mandatory in Florida.On Saturday, Florida added 11,458 new cases of coronavirus, beating a previous daily record of 10,109. Of the president himself, the paper says:You can read it here: Miami Herald - Trump’s leaving the Covid-19 stage. Florida’s DeSantis should assert his independenceAs well as puzzles over the precise transmission nature of the coronavirus, scientists are yet to determine the long-term impacts of having the coronavirus on the human body. Cate Leighton, a physiotherapist, has previously written for us about the gruelling attempt to recover from the illness, and there is plenty of anecdotal evidence of the illness lingering for weeks. With that in mind, today the National Health Service (NHS) England has announced it is launching a coronavirus recovery service to aid survivors experiencing long-term effects from the virus.Explaining the service, NHS chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, said many survivors would experience “significant ongoing health problems” including breathing difficulties, enduring tiredness, reduced muscle function, impaired ability to perform vital everyday tasks and mental health problems such as PTSD, anxiety and depression.My colleague Molly Blackall has more, and you can also keep up with the latest on coronavirus in the UK on our live blog. Read more here: NHS England launches coronavirus recovery serviceWith so much still uncertain about the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19, even the exact method of transmission remains scientifically unknown. As far back as in May, scientists in Australia were warning the world to be on guard against airborne transmission, and studies indicate that the coronavirus can be detected on particles of air pollution.Overnight the New York Times has written about an open letter that 239 experts are planning on sending to the World Health Organisations (WHO) this week, which the Times says makes one big claim: the coronavirus is airborne.The WHO has long held that the coronavirus is spread primarily by large respiratory droplets that, once expelled by infected people in coughs and sneezes, fall quickly to the floor. But in an open letter to the WHO, 239 scientists in 32 countries have outlined the evidence showing that smaller particles can infect people, and are calling for the agency to revise its recommendations. The researchers plan to publish their letter in a scientific journal next week.It could lead to radical changes to the way that we try and prevent the infection spreading. The New York Times reports Dr. Benedetta Allegranzi, the WHO technical lead on infection control, saying that the evidence for the virus spreading by air was “unconvincing”, but it also looks at how, it says, the WHO has at times been out-of-step with science with its warnings during the pandemic.It’s a fascinating read, which you can find here: New York Times - 239 experts with one big claim: the coronavirus is airborneCompulsory face masks in public spaces have been introduced in Iran after the government admitted its efforts to introduce effective voluntary social distancing have failed, and that the death rate due to coronavirus is now spiralling up to record levels.The latest figures published by the Iranian health ministry on Sunday showed a record 163 had died in the past 24 hours, higher than any daily figure in the initial March outbreak. The total number of deaths had reached 11,571. The number of new infections was 2,560 short of the daily records set at the beginning of June, but in line with the figures for the past fortnight. In fresh tests, 5 MPs have tested positive, and a number of top footballers.The government said the number of provinces declared as red has reached 9, with a further 9 including Tehran declared amber. The level of restrictions in a province, including closure of restaurants and cafes, is dependent on the province’s classification.The country appears to be paying the price for lifting restrictions on April 11, right after Persian New Year holidays when people went back to work. President Hassan Rouhani said, “Anybody who doesn’t wear a mask should be refused services and if a government employee doesn’t wear one, heshe should be marked as absent”. Similarly anyone not wearing a mask will be prevented from using public transport.The government urged the public to ring a hotline if they saw breaches in the guidelines or non-compliance with social distancing rules.The Observer today carries an interview with former World Health Organization director Anthony Costello about coronavirus. It focuses on the way the UK government has handled the coronavirus outbreak, but he makes a couple of wider points about the availability of vaccines and around herd immunity. On vaccines, Costello says:The good news is that you’ve got more labs in the world looking for a vaccine for this virus than any other. They’ve got better techniques for designing vaccines and there’s a lot of money going into it. Having said that, they’ve never had a vaccine to a coronavirus. Vaccines usually take several years to develop because you’ve got to test the safety of it. And most worrying, it seems the immune response to the virus is not very good, and fades. That suggests any vaccine you come up with may have only short lasting immunity. For all those reasons I’m cautious. The people I respect say two years would be a possible time. My guess is that we may get a partially effective one a bit quicker.On the concept of modelling ‘herd immunity’, Costello argues:You can read the interview in full here: Former WHO director Anthony Costello: ‘Opening pubs before schools says something about our priorities’There’s been a dip in the number of new coronavirus cases reported in the US. The figure was under 50,000 for the first time in four days, albeit with the caveat that data might not be complete because of under-counting due to the national holiday weekend.My colleague Maanvi Singh has been looking at one of the states where they took early action, but are seeing a massive rise in infections, to find out what went wrong with California’s coronavirus plan.As hospitalizations surged, the death toll climbed past 6,000, and ICU beds in some regions began filling to capacity, California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, ordered bars, restaurant dining rooms, cinemas and other indoor venues in the hardest-hit counties to close back up. Now, health officials and epidemiologists sifting through the rubble are left wondering how the golden state lost its status as the public health golden child.Singh has spoken several people including health officials and epidemiologists about what California did, and didn’t, do right.Read it here: ‘They feel invincible’: how California’s coronavirus plan went wrongPope Francis this morning has praised UN security council efforts to establish a worldwide ceasefire in order to help tackle the coronavirus pandemic.In remarks following prayers delivered at St Peter’s Square from a Vatican window, the Pope said: “The call for a global and immediate ceasefire, which would allow the peace and security essential for providing the humanitarian assistance so urgently needed, is commendable.”Speaking of the UN resolution demanding “a general and immediate cessation of hostilities in all situations on its agenda”, he said he hoped “this decision will be implemented effectively and promptly for the sake of the many people who are suffering”.Coronavirus cases in Latin America have been rising dramatically. Tom Phillips reported for us earlier today on how years of social progress have been reversed by the virus, amid accusations that politicians have been fatally inept.My colleague Emma Graham-Harrison has also written an analysis of events in the region this morning, and she argues that poverty, not just populists, is to blame for Covid-19’s impact on Latin America.The two countries with the deadliest outbreaks share populist leaders, Brazil’s rightwing Jair Bolsonaro and Mexico’s leftwing Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Both helped turbocharge the outbreaks in their respective countries, playing down the threat of the virus when it first arrived. But it would be simplistic to present the coronavirus crisis sweeping across the continent as simply a fallout from populism. Infections in Peru and Chile, which have centre-right, technocratic governments, have outpaced those in Mexico.Graham-Harrison examines how inequality in the region means that wealthy people have brought the virus back from their travels, and been able to afford to get tested and self-isolate, while the people who work for them pick up the disease, and begin to spread it into poorer communities to deadly effect.You can read it here: Emma Graham-Harrison - Poverty, not just populists, to blame for Covid-19’s impact on Latin AmericaThe Philippines has reported its biggest single-day jump in new coronavirus case on Sunday, adding 2,434 confirmed infections and taking the total count to 44,254, the health ministry said.According to Reuters, the ministry said the rise could be attributed to increased contact among people as the country began easing lockdown measures to help reduce the pandemic’s damage to the economy.The Philippines also recorded seven new deaths, the ministry said, bringing total fatalities to 1,297."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Climate crisis and bioersity loss should be in one department \u0026ndash environment groupsProtestors scaling up action because Programme for Government not radical enough"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impact"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillJuly 4th is a celebration of independence for millions of people in the US. This year, the residents of the Wolfe Tone Close complex in Dublin 1 also celebrated freedom, but the independence they celebrated was their own.The residents of the north-inner city complex, most of whom are over 70, congregated in the community area with their families for a summer barbecue to toast to the easing of coronavirus restrictions and no longer having to cocoon.They had pink and blue balloons hung up – similar to what you would see at a baby shower – to celebrate their “rebirth”, while a DJ played music and everyone drank and ate burgers.Maura Cudden (81) sat at a table with her dog Angel, sipping a glass of red wine. What was she most looking forward to now that she was allowed to mingle with other people? “Getting drunk, of course,” she said with a cheeky laugh, before adding: “I’m only messing, I’m only messing.”Cudden has lived in her apartment for the past 20 years, but she said having to cocoon had created a community among the residents, who used to only say hello in passing.“There were phone numbers being put in my letterbox for if I need anything, there was food left on my table, there would be knocks on the door asking if I needed anything because they were going to the shop,” Cudden said. “It was like I adopted a whole new family. It took the edge off cocooning.”It was not just the community spirit that made the distressing period easier. Her dog did, too.“I used to take her up when the news was on, I used to listen to it because I wanted to know what was going on. When I’d heard the deaths were very high in the beginning, I used to squeeze her to death because I had nobody else to touch or hold so I used to just squeeze her. She gave me such relief,” she added.Imelda Dodrill, who proudly declared that she was the oldest resident in the complex, said she found staying still very difficult.“The lockdown was very hard on me. I celebrated my 90th birthday in May and my family had organised a surprise party, but that never materialised. I worked from when I was 14 until 70, and I like to keep busy. I’m not the type to sit around and stay in,” Dodrill said.She was not terribly excited about restaurants or bars reopening because she is “well past that now”. However, being able to bring her dog Charlie out for walks again was the best part of society reopening.“I brought him out straight away, so I did. I love walking. I walk everywhere, I walk for miles. This, now, being able to move again, is marvellous. It’s like another life.”Margaret Murphy (79) said listening to Joe Dolan was the only way she was able to get through the lockdown, and she was glad she could “get back to normal”.“They told me not to go out so I did what I was told. My daughter lives in west Cork, the other one lives in Carlow and another in Galway. I missed the grandkids,” she said.Now that she no longer has to stay cooped up in her apartment, she has a long list of things she wants to do.“I think I might go on a cruise and travel the world. Well, if I can get the money for that,” she added.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4296523.1593854183!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"only a civil servant could have come up with unenforceable pub regulations","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tClancy’s Bar, Cork City has introduced temperature checks, private snugs and a roof garden. Pictured, Zaida Reyes  cleaning glass in one of the snugs. Photograph: Clare KeoghA publican in Cork has said he is not re-opening under Covid-19 restrictions because they would turn his bar “into a crime scene” and believes he would alienate customers. Con Dennehy, who owns the Venue in Ballintemple, is one of the 60 per cent of Cork publicans who opted not to re-open until July 20th, saying that he didn’t believe the current regulations where customers must book a slot and have a meal were particularly practical.“No, I haven’t reopened -I didn’t want to turn the bar into a crime scene with tape and screens everywhere and I didn’t want to alienate people I know and respect by telling them that they have to leave after 90 minutes or 105 minutes,” he told The . “To my mind, it’s only civil servants who could have made up these regulations because they are totally impractical and totally unenforceable - I’d rather stay closed until September if needs be to open properly for my locals and not end up alienating them with these regulations.”Mr Dennehy said that he expects to open on July 20th and when he does, he trusts his customers to be responsible regarding social distance and keeping one metre apart of their own volition, rather than he or his staff having to go around and asking people to keep apart.“Who is going to police social distancing? The gardaí hardly want to get involved in it, that’s a HSE job and do they have the personnel to police it? I think people should look after their own interest and do the sensible thing and keep their distance without having to be told.“If any fellow is iffy about going into a pub, he shouldn’t go in - I saw fellows coming in March before we closed down and they were taking their pint off the counter and stepping back and they were keeping their own social distance, they didn’t have to be asked so it was working back then.”‘Very co-operative’The majority of pubs in Cork have opted not to re-open until July 20th but those that have re-opened and are serving food in line with Government guidelines are generally expressing satisfaction with business, according to the Chair of the Cork Vintners Federation of Ireland, Michael O’Donovan.Mr O’Donovan said that approximately 40 per cent of the 208 pubs in the city and suburbs re-opened last Monday, serving substantial meals to customers who have to make a booking at the pub and generally it seemed to be working out reasonably well.“A few bars had some teething problems with people coming in and asking for a drink and the bar staff or management having to explain to them that they are really operating as a restaurant and they have to have food and they then can have a drink to accompany it.”Mr O’Donovan said the majority of customers have been very co-operative even though some of the bars are finding the 105-minute limit too restrictive, particularly when they are serving customers a three course meal which is being made to order in the pub.He said there did not appear to be any major problem with people turning up without bookings even though inidual pubs operated different systems with some pubs having set times that people can book while others are allowing the customers to choose a time and then booking a slot at that time.“All the bars have people at the door particularly in the evening so when people come to the door if they have capacity, they take them but if they are full they are moving on - what is noticeable that people are having multiple bookings, some in the same venue or some in other venues.”He said that all bars are operating social distancing and most people are being very co-operative even though he has heard of one or two cases where people have tried to pull tables together but once management explained that this wasn’t allowed, they accepted it.Mr O’Donovan, who runs the Castle Inn on South Main Street in the heart of Cork city, said that he would be waiting until July 20th as he does not serve food in the bar and like many of the 60pc of bars who have opted to wait until July 20th, he does not have a booking service.“We will have capacity for 28 people with one metre social distancing when we re-open on July 20th but if the Government introduce a booking system on July 20th, a lot of bars will remain close because they don’t have a booking engine.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4296549.1593872336!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach disappointed he only learned of barry cowen s driving ban on friday","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Agriculture Barry Cowen said he was ‘profoundly sorry’ about the incident. Photograph: Alan BetsonTaoiseach Micheál Martin has said he is “disappointed” that he only learned on Friday of a driving ban served by Minister for Agriculture Barry Cowen four years ago.In 2016, Mr Cowen served a three-month disqualification from driving after he was found to be driving under the influence of alcohol.He was found to be over the limit and was issued with a fixed charge penalty notice, a €200 fine, and was disqualified from driving for three months.The TD had a provisional licence at the time of the incident, resulting in a driving ban instead of penalty points. The law on drink-driving for learner drivers four years ago meant a concentration 10mg-35mg of alcohol per 100ml of breath was considered over the limit.Mr Cowen’s case did not go to court as the level of alcohol in his system was on the lower scale and did not reach the level required for prosecution.Mr Cowen said he was “profoundly sorry” about the incident, adding that it was “an appalling lapse and one which I have to accept and learn from”.In a statement on Saturday morning, the Taoiseach said he was first made aware of the “issue” on Friday afternoon.“I have spoken to Minister Cowen and I accept that his remorse about this incident is genuine,” he said. “I am disappointed that I learned about it in this way and have made that clear to him.”Mr Cowen was appointed Minister for Agriculture last week by the Taoiseach and was a member of the Fianna Fáil negotiating team in the coalition talks.The Minister has been a TD since 2011 and served as the party’s public expenditure spokesman for the past two years.He comes from a long line of Fianna Fáil politicians, with his brother Brian a former taoiseach and their late father Ber a former TD."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4290693.1593296152!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"who is in the new cabinet members in profile","story":"Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has been elected Taoiseach by 93 votes to 63, with three abstentions, in a historic Dáil vote which has taken place in Dublin’s Convention Centre. Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party deputy leader Catherine Martin is now Minister   for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht.A new Taoiseach was elected on Saturday and a range of new Ministers were appointed. Here’s all you need to know about them:He became party leader in 2011 just weeks before the general election when Fianna Fáil lost 51 seats in the fall-out from the economic collapse. The five wilderness years were spent reorganising the party and its decimated cohort of TDs.In 2016, Fianna Fáil had a mini-revival, regaining 23 seats and in the 2019 local elections won the most seats of any party. The four years since were spent building up a still volatile parliamentary party but Fianna Fáil suffered further losses in the 2020 election and dropped six seats, partially blamed on the party’s confidence and supply agreement with Fine Gael.The 2020 election had become do or die for Martin, whose Cork South-Central constituency will now be home to three Cabinet members - himself as Taoiseach, his party colleague Michael McGrath and former tánaiste Simon Coveney.The first Cork Taoiseach for 41 years since Jack Lynch, he has been a TD since 1989, served on Fianna Fáil’s front bench since 1995 and held four senior government portfolios during the party’s time in office - foreign affairs, health, education and enterprise.Single-minded and driven with a huge work ethic, the pragmatic Martin can be sensitive to criticism. A good media performer he is however seen by some within the party as distant and colleagues are hoping that communications within the party will improve.Health conscious and very proud of introducing the smoking ban in Ireland, he has pushed the Public Health (Alcohol) Act despite the reluctance of rural TDs within the party.Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and EmploymentAfter a terrible election result and what appeared initially to be a guaranteed trip across the Dáil to the opposition benches, Leo Varadkar’s fortunes have been transformed along with those of his party.His calm and assured leadership performance through the coronavirus pandemic combined with a lengthy stalemate over coalition formation talks have resulted in Fine Gael soaring from losers to clear victors in the opinion polls and with Varadkar moving from spent political force back to key player.Nobody has batted an eyelid at the fact that he will preside over the party’s abandonment of its Civil War stance after a century and move into a historic government coalition with Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.Even less remarked on has been his demotion to Tánaiste for over two years as Fine Gael participates in the previously vilified notion of rotating taoiseach. But he also leads his party into an unprecedented third term in office.A social agenda trailblazer, he is Ireland’s first openly gay minister, the State’s youngest taoiseach and is now Tánaiste. The son of an Irish mother and Indian father, his qualification as a doctor helped during the pandemic and assured him of good publicity when he decided to re-register as a medic and said he would do half a day a week on the helpline for people who suspected they had the Covid-19 virus.Never one to shy away from a photo opportunity, the 41-year-old was also the first taoiseach to assiduously use social media to push his message and his carefully cultivated image. And he got into the much discussed habit during lockdown of quoting a variety of books, films and other media in his speeches.He has also used his speeches to throw out provocative messages reflecting his economic views including his oft quoted controversial remark that Fine Gael should represent those who “get up early in the morning”.He previously served as minister for social protection, for transport and for health and now moves into the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. But it remains to be seen if he will innovate rather than merely manage as he was perceived to have done in his previous portfolios.Michael McGrath - Minister for Public Expenditure and ReformWhen political heavy hitter Michael McGrath (43) became Fianna Fáil’s finance spokesman, then minister for finance Michael Noonan pronounced that the accountant had a big future ahead of him in politics.That future has finally arrived for the Cork South-Central TD who has been finance spokesman since 2011, when Fine Gael was in coalition with Labour and again when Fine Gael relied on Independents and Fianna Fáil’s confidence and supply arrangement.First elected to the Dáil in 2007 he has retained his seat at each subsequent election. It has been a long road for the man who will finally take the helm at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.A constituency rival and colleague of his party leader he is seen as a potential successor, is well liked by his party colleagues and has a well-oiled constituency machine.Originally from Passage West but now living in Carrigaline with his wife Sarah O’Brien and seven children, he secured a first-class honours commerce degree in UCC and qualified as a chartered accountant with KPMG in Cork City.A central member of the party’s negotiating team in the government formation talks, he is a low-key, calm and effective spokesman.Stephen Donnelly - Minister for HealthThe appointment of Stephen Donnelly to Cabinet makes it two Ministers for Health in a row for his Wicklow constituency taking the baton from Simon Harris. It is a job often seen as a political crucifixion for the holder.Elected to the Dáil as an Independent on his first attempt in 2011, he went on to form the Social Democrats with Róisín Shortall and Catherine Murphy in 2015 and surged to a poll-topping performance in Wicklow in 2016.Shortly afterwards however, he left the party following disagreements with his co-leaders.In the Dáil he has since had a number of disagreements with the Social Democrats on the much lauded Sláintecare plan and all eyes will be keenly watching how he deals with the much debated health roadmap.After a short second  as an Independent he joined Fianna Fáil in 2017. While party leader Micheál Martin saw his recruitment as a major coup, his arrival left many noses out of joint in Fianna Fáil. Those tensions and the move, appeared to dent his 2020 election chances but he was elected on the 15th count.Darragh O’Brien, Minister for Housing, Local Government and HeritageAnother member of the Fianna Fáil negotiating team to get a seat at the big table Darragh O’Brien (45) becomes Minister for Housing in the new three-party Government.Party spokesman on housing, planning and local government in the last Dáil, he was first elected to the Dáil in 2007. He lost out in the 2011 decimation of the party in the economic recession. He became one of 51 party TDs to be defeated at the hands of angry voters. He successfully ran for the Seanad that year on the Labour panel and became Seanad leader, keeping a place in the Oireachtas.But his Dáil defeat had a salutary effect, resulting in him building up a strong constituency base with his brother as a local councillor. It may have contributed to local party tensions with Dublin Fingal colleague Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee.He went on to top the poll in Dublin Fingal in the 2016 general election.Before entering politics he worked in the financial services sector for 15 years as an area manager with Life Assurance Company.He was elected to Fingal County Council in 2004 before successfully contesting a Dáil seat in 2007.He is married with a young family.Barry Cowen, Minister for Agriculture and the MarineThe no-nonsense Fianna Fáil spokesman on public expenditure and reform Barry Cowen (52) has been appointed Minister for Agriculture. The man who sealed the fate of the water charges in the 2016 government formation negotiations, was again a key member of the negotiating team this time round.The 2016 talks led to the confidence and supply arrangement with Fine Gael but left Fianna Fáil out of government. The intense five-week\u0026nbspcampaign in 2020 led to government and the reward of a seat at the top table for the Clara, Co Offaly native.A brother of former taoiseach Brian Cowen he has been spokesman in a number of portfolios since his election to the Dáil in 2011. As well as spokesman on public expenditure and reform he also held the position of spokesman on environment and local government and on social protection.A married father of four, he was first elected to Offaly county council in 1999, where he served until his election to the Dáil to the seat vacated by his brother.A member of the Cowen family has represented Offaly in the Dáil continuously since 1977. His father Bernard Cowen was elected in 1969 but lost his seat in 1973. He regained it in 1977 and held it until his death in 1984.Norma Foley, Minister for EducationKerry TD Norma Foley, who nominated her party leader Micheál Martin to be Taoiseach has been appointed Minister for Education, five months after her election to the Dáil for the first time.Martin is said to prefer TDs to have done at least a term on the backbenches but the new TD who is a teacher by profession, has shown herself to be an impressive performer and has been effective at the Covid-19 committee in the questioning of witnesses. Calm, courteous and well prepared, she has a great grasp of detail and the bigger picture.The Tralee native took the fifth and final seat in the general election in Kerry, edging out her running mate and outgoing TD John Brassil.It is her second run at the Dáil, having been on the Fianna Fáil ticket in the 2007 election, when she was selected over Brassil.Since 2004, Foley has represented the people of Tralee Municipal District on Kerry County Council, topping the poll in last May’s local elections.She has also served on Tralee Town Council, and held the position of mayor of Tralee on three occasions, most recently in 20172018. In 20182019 she served as mayor of Kerry.She is the daughter of the late Denis Foley, who served as a TD for the constituency for 18 years, broken up by a three-year stint as a senator. He was named as the holder of an undisclosed offshore Ansbacher account.She is married to fellow teacher Denis Maguire.Simon Coveney, Minister for Foreign Affairs and DefenceHe may have lost his role as tánaiste but Simon Coveney (48) has retained the much coveted position of Minister for Foreign Affairs. Greatly admired by departmental staff as probably the hardest working minister in that portfolio, he has received much acclaim for his efforts in dealing with Brexit and is seen as the driving political force in Ireland securing its temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council.Loved by the party’s grassroots and accessible to TDs and Senators, he still retains ambitions to be party leader and is seen as likely to get there. A cautious and moderate politician, his tearaway teenage years when he was expelled from Clongowes school for drinking and partying, before being asked back – are at odds with his later serious image.From Cork’s so-called merchant class and a keen rugby and sailing fan, he has a degree in agriculture and land management and was catapulted into the world of politics following the death of his father Hugh, a TD and former minister, in 1998.He later successfully ran for the European Parliament in 2004 but returned to Ireland for the 2007 general election and he has successfully retained his seat since. He served as minister for agriculture for all five years of the Enda Kenny-led administration from 2011 later adding defence to his portfolio when Eamon Gilmore resigned as tánaiste.From 2016 he spent just a year as minister for housing, when his pledge to end all emergency hotel and B\u0026ampB\u0026nbspaccommodation backfired, before he moved to the hallowed halls of the Department of Foreign Affairs.Seen as open in his approach and meticulous in his work practices, he has risen solidly and steadily through the party’s ranks and his experience in Brexit talks paved the way for his central role in the government formation talks.Paschal Donohoe, Minister for FinanceAs soon as Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe confirmed he was putting his name forward as a unity candidate for the presidency of the Eurogroup, it was clear he was confident of returning to his office in Merrion Street.Ever cautious and highly political he would have been slow to put his reputation on the line without some assurance of keeping his own job while he applied for the top spot in the influential club of finance ministers from countries that use the euro.The deadline for that role came a day before the outcome of the vote on the programme for government.He is highly popular within the party although less so after his poison chalice position as director of elections for both the Dáil and Seanad elections.The electorate proved less than happy with the party’s budgetary and spending policies and Fine Gael lost 12 Dáil seats. It was also embarrassed by the failure to have any women elected to the Upper House.Nine years a TD for Dublin Central, the 45-year-old has held the finance portfolio since 2017. He previously served as a minister of state and then as minister for transport.A central member of the party’s leadership and key to the government formation talks he is viewed as culturally one of the more rounded Cabinet members with an interest in books, film and theatre.The former sales manager with a multinational firm will need all his skills as a party persuader and negotiator to navigate the traumatic economic conditions facing the State while keeping faith with his wary Fianna Fáil and suspicious Green Party colleagues.He will be happy to leave his one stated regret – not managing to control the costs of the new national children’s hospital – to Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath who takes up the re-ided Department of Public Expenditure and Reform portfolio.He is married with two children and lives in Phibsborough, Dublin.Heather Humphreys, Minister for Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the IslandsOne of the Ministers always seen as sure of keeping her seat at the cabinet table, Heather Humphreys fits the criteria for geography, gender and ability.A border-county TD, she was the first woman elected to the Cavan-Monaghan constituency in 2011, when she took over from fellow Presbyterian Fine Gael colleague Seymour Crawford.Now in her third Dáil term and one of three female TDs in the five-seat constituency, she is highly regarded within Fine Gael and viewed as capable and a safe pair of hands.A first-term backbench TD when she was appointed to cabinet in 2011 as minister for arts, heritage and the Gaeltacht she won plaudits for her stewardship of the successful 1916 Rising centenary commemorations.A loyal ally of former taoiseach Enda Kenny she was re-appointed to the portfolio by him in 2016 but was one of the first Ministers to declare her support for Leo Varadkar in the 2017 leadership contest.He promoted her to the Business, Enterprise and Innovation portfolio in 2017 following the resignation of tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald.A business background through her work with Ulster Bank and as manager of Cootehill Credit Union also helped secure her appointment. The coronavirus pandemic brought her biggest political challenge with the crisis facing thousands of businesses and leaving a 25 per cent unemployment rate. Grant and income support schemes, loans and other initiatives have helped cushion the initial blow.The Government will now have to deal with the fallout from a controversial High Court judgment striking out a sectoral employment order and ruling that she had acted outside her powers in making the order for the electrical industry.Her career in finance, experience as minister for business and farming background in Co Monaghan, where she is married with two adult daughters, make her a good candidate for the rural development portfolio.Elected for the first time in the 2011 general election, she lives in Aghabog, near Monaghan town, and her family is from the Cavan-Monaghan border area.Helen McEntee, Minister for JusticeA reserved but smart politician Helen McEntee (33) from Castletown, Co Meath, has been a TD since 2013 when she won the byelection following the death of her father Shane McEntee.Minister of State for European Affairs since 2017, the Meath East TD proved her mettle in the ever present and fraught Brexit crisis, leading the Government’s response on a number of related issues.She has been described as Leo Varadkar’s “secret weapon” and is considered level-headed and a very good negotiator. Former president of the European Council Donald Tusk called her “diligent” and an “exceptional diplomat”. She is one of 10 vice-presidents of the European People’s Party, Fine Gael’s centre-right representative grouping in the EU.Graduating from DCU in 2007 having studied law, politics and economics, she worked briefly in a Citibank subsidiary. She later completed a masters in journalism and communications and worked with her father in Leinster House, first in opposition and then when he was appointed minister of state.A supporter of Varadkar’s from the start she has been by his side throughout the Brexit crisis and has a keen understanding of its intricacies and complexities.Simon Harris, Minister for Higher Education, Innovation and ScienceDespite his increased stature during the coronavirus pandemic as minister for health Simon Harris (33) became a focus of increasing speculation in recent days that he would be demoted from Cabinet.In the fateful 2017 Fine Gael leadership campaign he took sides early on in favour of Simon Coveney as opposed to Varadkar but held onto the health portfolio Kenny appointed him to in 2016.Described as the “teenage” minister when first appointed to the hugely significant but poison chalice department, he has visibly aged in the past three months through the stresses of the Covid-19 crisis.He remained a popular choice in his Wicklow constituency in the election despite concerns about a shortage of hospital beds, the spiralling cost of the new national children’s hospital and the recruitment and retention difficulties around healthcare staff.Those issues disappeared during the pandemic with the unprecedented takeover of all private hospitals and the return home of emigrant doctors and nurses to assist with the crisis.These problems have re-emerged but are no longer an issue for Harris as he moves on from the department described as a war zone.A social media expert, he is one of the party’s top media performers, assured and persuasive in his delivery, accessible and generally guaranteed to avoid political gaffes.He first became engaged in politics while campaigning for his younger brother and other children with autism. He topped the poll in the local elections and secured the highest vote in the country through his social media campaign.While a councillor, he approached then Seanad leader Frances Fitzgerald, became her parliamentary assistant and moved into Leinster House politics from there.Viewed as having an uneasy relationship with his party leader he is far from the inner circle. He is married with one child and lives in Greystones, Co Wicklow.Eamon Ryan - Minister for Climate Action, Communications Networks and TransportIt has been a torrid few months for Green Party leader Eamon Ryan (56) as he enters Government with a deeply scarred and ided party.In all the controversy the spectacular success in winning 12 seats in the general election has been all but forgotten.Now appointed to his long sought role in climate action and transport he will have little time to relish the challenge as he bids to heal the schism within the party.It is a reflection of the party’s isions that when he was mired in controversy after repeating a racial slur in the Dáil that it took a minister from another party, Charlie Flanagan of Fine Gael to publicly defend the Dublin Bay South TD by saying he did not have a racist bone in his body.But through all the accusations, insults and recriminations he has been calm, conciliatory and with party deputy leader Catherine Martin has persuaded the party’s membership to decisively back an unprecedented government with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.He now faces a leadership contest against his deputy leader but has remained sanguine about the prospect.An impassioned speaker prone to gaffes, including a call during the election campaign for the re-introduction of wolves, he nonetheless led a team to rebuild the party after its disastrous first foray into coalition government after which it lost all six Dáil seats.A councillor before his 2007 election to the Dáil he previously ran a bicycle shop and cycling holiday business.He is married to journalist Victoria White and they have four sons.Catherine Martin - Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the GaeltachtDublin Rathdown TD and deputy Green party leader Catherine Martin (47) emerged as a surprising contender for the top job in the party.Her stance on coalition has strained the previously close working relationship with Eamon Ryan but his move to appoint her as lead negotiator in the coalition talks was seen as an inspired move.Cautious by nature, she is said to seek advice widely and does not say things lightly. Some in her party are said to find it hard to gauge where she stands and those on the other side of the negotiating table have described her as an enigma.As an influential voice in the party she will have a significant role in attempting to heal the party’s schism.From her first days in the Dáil she forged good relations across all parties and founded the Irish Women’s Parliamentary Caucus in the Oireachtas, pressed for anti-bullying protocols in the Leinster House campus.From Carrickmacross, Co Monaghan she trained as a classical singer and after graduating from NUI Maynooth, she taught music and English at St Tiernan’s Community School in Ballinteer.Her initial foray into politics was when she was co-opted to her brother Vincent P Martin’s council seat in Monaghan in the 1990s. She returned to politics in Dublin, was elected as a councillor in 2014 and came from nowhere to win a Dáil seat in 2016.Her husband Francis Noel Duffy became a TD in 2020 and took an opposing view in rejecting the coalition deal. The couple has three children.Roderic O’Gorman - Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and IntegrationLong predicted to make the high table Roderic O’Gorman (38) is one of the Green party’s most experienced politicians. His victory in the 2020 general election marked his 10th foray in 15 years including four general elections, two byelections and four local elections. The party’s justice and equality spokesman he was on the negotiating team and insisted in the talks that the coalition must make a commitment to end direct provision.A former chairman of the party he served from 2011 to 2019.From Tyrellstown he lives with his partner Ray Healy in Blanchardstown. A lecturer at the Brexit Institute and School of Law and Government in DCU he is a graduate of Trinity College and the London School of Economics.Close to both party leader Ryan and deputy leader Martin he is courteous, considered and reflective in his deliberations and well regarded across the party. He is a fan of TV shows West Wing, Game of Thrones and Arrested Development.Hildegarde Naughton - Minister of State at the Department of Climate Action, she will be attending CabinetOne of the survivors of the electoral cull of Fine Gael TDs, Hildegarde Naughton (43) has consistently grown in experience and stature since she first arrived on the political stage in 2009.That was the year the former schoolteacher was first elected to Galway City Council, becoming mayor two years later. Mentored and promoted by then taoiseach Enda Kenny, the Galway West TD was appointed to the Seanad in 2013.In 2016 she seized the chance to get on the Fine Gael ticket in the general election after Barry Walsh stepped aside from politics on health grounds.Chair of the Oireachtas Committee for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment in the last Dáil she fought the green fight in an uphill and forthright battle to persuade many reluctant party colleagues to the cause and has been Fine Gael’s leading environmentalist.That role, that experience and her capability has brought her to the Cabinet table - along with the need to have some gender balance at cabinet and take account of geographical considerations.Outside politics she is a talented singer who has performed and won awards for her roles in musical theatre. While a senator she established a group called Bel Canto with two other sopranos, who sang at charity events. She has described her musical interest as “my golf”.Pippa Hackett, “Super Junior” Minister of StateGreen Party Senator Pippa Hackett’s appointment as a “Super Junior” Minister of State is the first appointment of a Senator to Cabinet since the early 1980s.She takes on the role of Minister of State for Agriculture with responsibility for land use and bioersity.Her appointment has taken some by surprise amid speculation that someone among the party’s TDs might be selected.A farmer from Offaly and the party’s agriculture spokeswoman, she was elected to the Seanad in a byelection in November when a vacancy arose following the election of then Senator Grace O’Sullivan to the European parliament.But the move is as much a surprise because it is virtually unprecedented.The last time a Senator took on a ministerial role was in 1981 when then taoiseach Garrett FitzGerald nominated Senator James Dooge as minister for foreign affairs, a portfolio he held for a year.A vocal supporter of the programme for government, Hackett was elected unopposed to the agricultural panel in the Seanad when the other parties opted not to contest the seat.Formerly an Offaly county councillor she lost out in the general election for the Laois-Offaly constituency when she was eliminated in the final round.Originally from Ballandine, Co Mayo she is married with four children and lives in Edenderry, Co Offaly.Dara Calleary - Chief whipNew Government chief whip Dara Calleary has Fianna Fáil in his DNA. The Mayo TD who has been in the Dáil since 2007 and is the son of late TD and former minister of state Sean Calleary who served in the Dáil from 1973 to 1992. His grandfather Phelim was TD for Mayo from 1952 to 1969.Affable and steady, popular with party colleagues he is deputy leader and viewed as a safe pair of hands.He has had a previous taste of government when he served as minister of state for labour affairs and public service transformation from 2009 to 2011 in the Fianna Fáil, Green Party coalition.A graduate of Trinity College with a degree in business and politics he has served as the party’s spokesman on justice, equality and defence, as well as spokesman on jobs, enterprise and innovation.Paul Gallagher SC, Attorney GeneralThis will be Paul Gallagher’s second time in the job, having previously served from 2007 to 2011. During his first term, he was called to offer legal advice on some of the biggest issues ever to face an Irish government, including the bank guarantee scheme, the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency and the International Monetary Fund Troika programme.He is regarded as one of Ireland’s top barristers, with a fearsome work ethic."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Fourteen presumed dead while dozens remain missing in southern part of countryMore than 75,000 evacuated in southern region after landslides and torrential rainZheng Yanxiong will work with police to stamp out pro-democracy demonstrationsNorth Korea claims to have no cases of Covid-19 despite links with ChinaBeijing enraged at plan to help up to 3m residents in fallout over national security lawAt least nine charged under Chinese law that critics say strips Hong Kong of rights and freedomsLaw will punish crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusionHot and bothered commuters refuse to wear masks on public transportTesting blitz as recent jump in infections in Australia stokes fears of second waveHistoric move will allow authorities to crack down on subversive and secessionist activityRisks of viruses crossing species barrier into humans in densely populated regions highlightedWashington plans to target Chinese officials undermining Asian financial hub autonomyJustin Trudeau called on Beijing to cease the \u0026lsquoarbitrary detention\u0026rsquo of two CanadiansMany were struck as they were planting seeds across Bihar state in east of countryThe decades-long project sees a constellation of 35 satellites circling the Earth to rival the US-owned Global Positioning System (GPS)Regime rows back on threat to deploy troops near border amid rising tensionsOfficials prepare \u0026lsquoretaliatory punishment\u0026rsquo after anti-North balloons arrived from SouthBan on cruise ships extended beyond June 30th cases increase as more citizens return homeCovid-19 outbreak in staff at Tyson foods in Arkansas sparks Beijing U-turn on policyChina says draft law is aimed at separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion abroadStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Israel\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4296580.1593884340!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"it s beautiful just to get back english pubs reopen as covid 19 restrictions ease","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t People enjoy a day at the pubs in Soho, London following their reopening on Saturday. Photograph: Facundo ArrizabalagaEPAPeople could get a drink in a pub, have a meal in a restaurant or get a haircut for the first time in over three months on Saturday as England took its biggest steps yet towards resumption of normal life.Pubs were allowed to start serving from 6am, sparking worries of over-indulgence on what the media dubbed a “Super Saturday” of coronavirus restrictions being eased. Some hairdressers were reported to have opened at the stroke of midnight.The Holland Tringham pub in south London, part of the JD Wetherspoon chain, opened at 8am and was about three-quarters full by 11.20am.“It’s beautiful just to get back and have a pint,” said Jim Martin, a 56-year-old carpenter.Julie Scott, a 43-year-old teacher, was there with her family for drinks and food.“I think it’s just where everyone gets to socialise and catch up with people that they haven’t seen...it’s nice to just get together,” she said.Others complained that the lockdown, which began in late March and has been gradually eased in recent weeks, had lasted too long.“It’s about time they opened them up,” said pensioner Ron Lock.Police chiefs are worried the reopening of pubs could fuel drunken and irresponsible behaviour, while hospitals have been warned to prepare for a New Year’s Eve-style weekend.“There’s an element of decompression going on, particularly with younger people who’ve had some very responsible parents keeping them in over recent weeks,” Marc Jones, Police and Crime Commissioner for Lincolnshire, told BBC radio.One pub near Ashford in Kent opened despite a car crashing into its front in the early hours of Saturday morning.The Swan Inn at Little Chart, near Ashford in Kent, was still serving pints to customers outside despite the landlord being woken by the devastation at around 2am on Saturday. Ray Perkins told the PA news agency: “It was absolutely devastating because obviously we were opening today. “We’ve had everybody rally round and clear up the bar, every single glass has had to be washed again.” He added: “We’ve got open, we’ve managed to open the pub – not inside, only outside.”In another relaxation of lockdown rules two households can now meet indoors as long as social distancing is maintained, and overnight stays are allowed.The rule changes apply only to England as Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have been setting their own timetables for easing lockdown restrictions.On Saturday evening, the UK’s department of health and social care said a further 67 people had died having tested positive for Covid-19.British prime minister Boris Johnson called on people to behave responsibly and respect social distancing regulations as the risk of a resurgence of coronavirus remains. Mindful of an economy that has taken a hammering because of the lockdown, he also stressed the importance of supporting businesses.“The success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly,” he said at a news conference on Friday. “We must not let them down.”Pub-goers will find the atmosphere rather different from the usual Saturday-night scrum.Numbers are limited, no one can stand at the bar and there will be no live music. Patrons will also have to give their details to allow tracers to identify them if anyone later tests positive.Wetherspoons, which is one of the UK’s biggest chains, said it had invested £11 million (€12.2m) in safety measures.It is not taking bookings, but said at busy times numbers would be controlled by staff. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4294866.1593715662!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the abrupt end to brexit talks is not only surprising but perplexing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBoris Johnson: Has the immediate political scope to move either way on the negotiations. Photograph:   Will OliverEPABut the language on both sides was restrained and Frost’s had none of the belligerence that often characterises his rhetoric towards Brussels. The fact that Barnier chose not to give a press conference was seen by some as another happy augury but it was in fact simply an act of deference towards Angela Merkel and Ursula von der Leyen, who were giving a joint press conference later.Before this week’s talks began, the EU told Britain it was ready to compromise in order to accommodate the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a video conference last month with the presidents of the European institutions.“The EU side had listened carefully to UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s statements in recent weeks, in particular, his request to reach a political agreement quickly, and his red lines: no role for the European Court of Justice in the UK no obligation for the UK to continue to be bound by EU law and an agreement on fisheries that shows Brexit makes a real difference,” Barnier said on Thursday.The Europeans hoped that Britain would respond with a step towards compromise of its own but by the time the talks ended on Thursday, Frost had produced no such offer. During the course of the week, it became clear that unless Britain makes a substantial move within days, there will be no significant progress this month.Judgment callJohnson this week named Frost as his next national security adviser and the chief negotiator’s word carries a rare level of authority in Downing Street. Last October, he successfully urged Johnson to accept the revised withdrawal agreement as the best available deal. He faces a similar judgment call today.The British red lines Barnier spoke about on Thursday are those Johnson identified in last month’s conference call. The two sides are also at odds over the governance structure but Johnson did not mention it on the call and British misgivings about signing up to a single overarching agreement have diminished. Some within the government recognise that it offers opportunities as well as risks.The issue of fisheries is highly charged politically on both sides but neither views a compromise as impossible. Although Britain rejects the concept of binding “level playing field” commitments, it will agree to maintain current employment, environmental and consumer standards.The toughest issue is state aid, with the EU calling for Britain to continue to follow EU rules on a continuing basis. This is problematic for Britain both because it limits the country’s freedom to subsidise indigenous industry and because it would give the ECJ a role in British economic policy.One obstacle in the way of a compromise is the fact that Britain has not yet set out plans for how it wants its own state aid regime to operate after the end of the transition period on December 31st. This leaves the EU unable to evaluate how a system of parallel state aid regimes would work, with both sides agreeing guidelines but regulating separately.While the British accuse the Europeans of being too legalistic, the Europeans complain about British amateurishness. But both sides agree that Johnson wants a deal and that he would like to get it as soon as possible.At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, there was talk around Westminster and Whitehall about how the crisis could reduce – or at least obscure – the impact of failure to agree a deal with the EU. But few now talk about the disruption of a no-deal outcome being lost within the greater disruption caused by coronavirus.Cost of no-dealBank of England governor Andrew Bailey said last week that the British government could have struggled to fund itself if the bank had not intervened with £200 billion of quantitative easing to buy government debt. The cost of a no-deal outcome to the EU talks, on top of the ballooning cost of the coronavirus crisis, would test either Bailey’s patience\u0026nbspor his credibility when he insists the bank is not underwriting the British government’s debt.Donald Trump’s declining political fortunes are also driving Johnson towards an EU deal as he prepares to deal with Joe Biden, a multilateralist whose advisers see Brexit as an expression of right-wing populism. As Suzanne Lynch has reported, Biden and his team are also acutely sensitive to any risk to the peace process and will monitor closely Britain’s implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol.Despite the fall in his approval ratings, Johnson remains in a very strong position with an 80-seat majority in parliament and no prospect of a general election until 2024. He has the immediate political scope to move either way on the negotiations but failure to reach a deal with the EU will make it harder for him to fulfil his government’s domestic agenda and to make a success of Brexit.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

But they acknowledged the scale of the problems and many understand today that to overcome them, we need to work together.For the United Kingdom, the climate emergency is not new. Already as an EU member state, the UK was leading by example – it was the first major economy to enshrine in law the objective of ending its contribution to global warming by 2050.It always supported ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. And massive demonstrations , led by young people, showed the strength of grassroots’ engagement in this country and elsewhere.The UK’s foundational contribution to the EU’s Single Market, its excellence in research and its innovation in the digital economy are well known.Our British friends have reasons to be also proud of the pioneering drive in countering climate change head on.Today in the EU, we are united behind the idea that the green thread needs to run through all our policies - from transport to taxation, food to farming, industry to infrastructure.The European Green Deal was the first major initiative announced by President Ursula von der Leyen in December last year when she took the helm of the European Commission.And in March, we proposed to enshrine in law, the European Climate Law, the political commitment to transform Europe into the first climate neutral continent by 2050. Our post-Covid recovery plan, Next Generation EU, brings concrete ideas on how to harness additional funding in helping member states to achieve this ambition.The European Union will press on with all these initiatives. But we are very much aware that climate change knows no borders.Countries and people will remain connected by deep ties that bind our future, including how we decarbonise our economies and protect our societies from climate change.The EU and the UK, in particular given its crucial role as COP-26 President, should continue to lead on the path toward climate neutrality by ensuring a strong green dimension in the post-COVID recovery measures we are putting in place and by updating our emissions reduction targets for 2030.The UK now has an ambitious Global Britain agenda. The EU is one of the most important global actors. In addressing climate change and preserving the environment, we can work together: leading by our ambitions keeping the pressure on other global players who may be tempted to compromise for the sake of immediate economic gain being creative and open-minded in finding solutions where none seems obvious.Building on our joint efforts from the past, we need to work together for a future in which humanity will be able to live within nature’s boundaries, in a sustainable manner on our common home.João Vale de Almeida is the EU\u0027s  Ambassador to the UKMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"untold story terry pratchett met roald dahl","story":"As two of English literature’s best-loved writers of comic fantasy, the discovery of a previously-unknown conversation between the late Sir Terry Pratchett and Roald Dahl would be the stuff of fantasy for legions of fans worldwide.But evidence that they met and discussed the dearth of plots and the difficulty of writing children’s books, among other topics, has been unearthed.It is an interview that Pratchett conducted with Dahl in 1969, overlooked until now. Long before he found fame with his Discworld series, a collection of satirical fantasy novels, he was a 21-year-old journalist on a local newspaper with dreams of publishing his first novel.Dahl, then 52, had already published his children’s classics, Charlie and The Chocolate Factory and James and The Giant Peach, as well as short stories for adults and screenplays for the James Bond film, You Only Live Twice, and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.That Pratchett had requested an interview was known because their introductory letters have survived. On headed note-paper from the Bucks Free Press in Buckinghamshire, he wrote to Dahl “as an admirer of your work - both short stories and the children’s books”. Dahl replied: “I will see if we can arrange a meeting.”The two letters appear on the official Dahl website with a note: “Unfortunately, other than the small glimpse these letters give into their correspondence, we have no other information, so tantalisingly we don\u0027t know if a meeting ever took place. Even so it\u0027s a fascinating insight into Terry Pratchett\u0027s early career, before he went on to delight millions of readers across the world with wonderfully imaginative stories - just as Roald Dahl had.”Now Marc Burrows, author of a forthcoming major biography on Pratchett, has uncovered the interview, proving that the two men met at Dahl’s home in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire. Published on May 21 1969 in the Midweek Free Press - a Bucks Free Press offshoot - its contents had been missed, partly because Pratchett wrote then under the pseudonym of “Marcus”.In the interview, Dahl, who created some of fiction’s most memorable nasty characters, said: “The purpose of a writer like me is to entertain, purely and simply. There’s no message behind it except the usual underlying one that any writer tries to get through, which is that some people are very nasty and some are very nice. Most people are very nasty, really, when you get down to it. But basically, one is an entertainer, which is what a lot of fiction writers forget - and they become moralists.He added: “It’s not easier to write books for children, it might be harder to get a good one. But it is much more rewarding – not financially, but otherwise.Pratchett observed that Dahl’s short stories appear infrequently now, adding: “He blames the dearth of plots - they’ve all been used. The short story is becoming extinct.”In another passage, Dahl despaired over the “enormous egotism” of artists: “Art is highly overrated in importance, by artists in particular, who walk around thinking that this is the most important thing in the world and that they are, therefore, the most important people.”He continued: “The most important things in the world are things like childcare, and families, and medicine. Artists have a real nerve! They think there’s nothing else in the world but them.”Colin Smythe, who became Pratchett’s agent after publishing his first books, told The : “It’s a definite discovery … I knew of the title of the article, but had no idea of its subject matter. I must get all the non-fiction articles by ‘Marcus’ checked to see what other important items we have missed.”Pratchett died in 2015, aged 66. Like Dahl, he had gone on to sell tens of millions of books worldwide, after his first book, The Carpet People, was published in 1971. The  obituary noted: “His immaculately written, wildly imaginative brand of comic fantasy breathed new life into a largely forgotten form of humorous writing and enabled him to connect with readers not usually attracted to the science fiction and fantasy genres.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/30/TELEMMGLPICT000163945715_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"first look uk hotels tourism post lockdown holidays","story":"Cliveden House celebrated its grand reopeningCoronavirus latest news: Police and Health Sec have conflicting takes on Super Saturday revelryKey dates: When will destinations around the world reopen to British tourists?The 59 countries exempt from England\u0027s travel quarantine - full listPortugal hits back over its exclusion from quarantine-free listEnglish hotels today served breakfast to their first guests in nearly four months as the tourism industry awakens once more. Travel\u0027s roving reporters have been documenting their experiences from across the country, describing the scenes in usually busy spots such as Cornwall and the Lake District as being surprisingly serene, perhaps in part due to the drizzly weather yesterday. Despite various reports from police on pockets of drunken revelry, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the vast majority of people who went out on \u0027Super Saturday\u0027 were doing the right thing and following social distancing,Today we\u0027ve got first look reports from inside England\u0027s hotels, tourist sites and theme parks including the likes of Thorpe Park, Legoland, Stonehenge, Brighton and the New Forest, as the industry settles in to the new normal.Meanwhile, with news that from July 10, Britons will be permitted to visit a list of 59 countries without the need to quarantine upon their return, we\u0027re publishing the best deals for you to book your getaway.Some experts are predicting that holiday prices will soar this week, as the industry braces for a huge surge in demand for summer getaways.And we\u0027ve got one expert already stationed in Magaluf, which is still looking like a ghost town.Follow all the latest updates below.As pubs in England clean up after yesterday\u0027s revelries, Spain has ordered its second local lockdown in as many days after several coronavirus outbreaks were traced back to reopened bars.Restrictions have been reimposed in La Marina, a community of around 70,000 in the northwestern region of Galicia, and nobody is allowed to enter or leave the area unless required to do so for work.Bars and restaurants have all been told to limit customers to 50 per cent capacity, and all residents must wear face masks when out and about, even at the beach and park.Yesterday, Spain\u0027s northeastern Catalonia region locked down an area with around 200,000 residents near the town of Lerida following a surge in Covid-19 cases.“Social distancing and lockdown measures were the key to flattening the curve. Now they are needed again to stop the outbreaks,”  said Spain’s Health Minister Salvador Illa.The weather wasn\u0027t playing ball so the crowds were smaller than expected in Brighton, but nothing could dampen the general spirit this weekend. Ashwin Bhardwaj reports:I was surprised to see that many of Brighton’s pubs and bars remained closed, and it felt more like a busy Wednesday night than the New Year’s Eve vibe we’d expected. We were even able to get a table at The White Rabbit (one of my favourite pubs in The Lanes) without booking in advance, and a waitress explained how to register our contact details as part of the track-and-trace system.As we walked back to the seafront via the Pavilion Gardens, the mood was festive, even as revellers started to head home.

Penny Walker has addressed them.That\u0027s the conclusion Hazel Plush has drawn from spending all yesterday riding them. Thorpe Park, she reckons, is better now than ever:With the park at a fifth of its regular capacity, the wait for Stealth, the UK\u0027s fastest rollercoaster, was a mere five minutes – unheard of! – and even the new cleaning routine, a disinfectant wipe-down every four or five runs, didn’t hold things up. That’s now standard practice throughout the park: each ride is cleaned every few minutes, using sprays and cloths. And passengers are seated with their ‘bubble’ – with empty rows or seats between groups, according to each cab’s layout. My god, it felt great to yell from the rafters – to squeal and laugh and let go for a few precious moments. Utter catharsis. The New Normal, it turns out, has made rollercoasters even better than before.Read her full verdict here.Strong winds in parts of the country today, but it\u0027s not stopping people getting back on the canals down in Wiltshire, Paul Miles reports.The Lake District is set to be very busy but fret not, there are still some places with availability.

The virus has claimed over 44,000 lives. Nine million people have been furloughed and the national debt has soared.  The sport, arts, travel and hospitality sectors have been decimated. And yet lockdown has saved many lives.  In March, Imperial College research indicated that, with no lockdown, Britain would suffer 260,000 deaths. Currently, the country’s death toll stands at just under a fifth of that projection. What might have happened had the UK followed a different path? Has the last 15 weeks of hardship been worth it? It will take years to properly answer these questions. The pandemic is not yet over. But below,  writers and experts give their early impressions.Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of Wellcome and member of SageThe impact of Covid-19 is unprecedented, like nothing experienced in living memory. The scale and speed of this crisis has been overwhelming. Even for those like myself who have worked for many years in emerging infectious disease and through previous epidemics, including HIV, SARS, Avian Flu, Zika and Ebola. This virus has reached every corner of the planet, taking lives, overwhelming health systems, disrupting society, and crippled economies. All in six months. A pandemic like this, of a rapid-spreading novel respiratory virus, crossing from animals to humans, was a threat long warned of by the scientific community.  The international health community had not, unfortunately, taken full opportunity to act on the need for pandemic preparedness.  Since the first reported cases, scientists have worked at incredible speed to increase understanding of Covid-19. With more than 200 vaccine candidates already in development and one drug, dexamethasone, now known to save lives, we’ve achieved in months what would normally have been the work of a decade. If not longer.  But, we are also still without vaccines, a range of effective treatments or rapid, reliable testing with robust contact tracing systems, that remain the only exit to this pandemic.  National lockdowns have saved many lives where they have been effectively implemented, and infection numbers across Europe, are now low enough to begin very cautious easing of restrictions. It is vital to get the economy open again so people can get back to some sort of normal way of life. Schools should be the priority to fully reopen as soon as possible.  But Covid-19 has not disappeared. Restrictions have not changed the fundamentals of the virus. It still is very infectious, transmitting between people just as easily as it ever did. As iniduals, we must remain very careful. Governments must use this time to prepare for potential second waves and to learn lessons from the first six months.  By acting on mistakes of the past six months now, and by preparing our health systems now for future waves and winter pressures, there is a chance to stop local outbreaks in coming months becoming national catastrophes. The choices we make and actions we take over the next couple of months will determine whether there are second waves and the outcome of this pandemic.   The international community must redouble efforts to support and scale up the research, development, manufacture and distribution of the tools needed globally. The International Money Fund has said the cost to the global economy could be $12 trillion. The cost of tools to test, treat and prevent Covid-19 has been set, by the World Health Organisation and global partners of the ACT-Accelerator, at $31.3 billion. To date, $3.4bn has been raised.  And we need to ensure any – and all – effective diagnostics, treatments or vaccines for Covid-19 are available to everybody around the world, regardless of ability to pay. Until every country is protected, we all remain at risk.  I hope out of this crisis we this will demonstrate to the world there is no future in narrow nationalism. To protect lives and livelihoods from health threats, whether caused by pandemics, climate change, drug resistance, or mental health, we must have unequivocal trusted and effective global partnerships.Lockdown was never a political choice. Whitehall had not planned in advance to suppress a fast-moving virus and ill-judged talk of ‘herd immunity’ cemented that for people, rightly or wrongly. Britons looked en masse to China, Italy and Spain and said, ‘I’ll tell you what, we’ll do that instead.’ Better broke than dead was the thinking. The Prime Minister had no choice but to implement it.Was it worth it? If you take a very narrow view and weigh human life only in terms of economic value, then the answer is probably not. Lockdown has saved hundreds of thousands of British lives but you could argue that most are old, unwell or otherwise unproductive in economic terms. It’s also true that lockdown will, for decades to come, cause many thousands of indirect deaths as a result of the economic storm to come. Deaths caused by unemployment, crime, mental health issues and a withered NHS.But such arguments are as unworkable as they are contemptible. They are the arguments of First World War generals and nineteenth-century colonialists - people who regarded others as little more than a herdable commodity. They are not fit for a modern democracy. Today voters call the shots, politicians and Whitehall officials serve.When the political reckoning comes, people will ask why Britain was not prepared to suppress a fast-moving virus as others in Asia and Europe were. Why were we left with no option other than to lock down completely, while others saved lives and kept their economies ticking over?These are going to be tough questions to answer. They go to the heart of how we are governed and how our just-in-time economy is managed. Was it worth it? Not if you are in government or Whitehall, I don’t imagine.Dr Clare Wenham, Assistant Professor of global health policy at the London School of EconomicsLockdown has been the only meaningful option available to governments. Yet, looking across the world we’ve seen very different lockdowns, which reveals much about how governments prioritise economic security versus people’s health. Some governments, such as those of Spain, New Zealand, El Salvador and South Africa have implemented strict national lockdown, requiring everyone apart from key workers to stay at home. Whilst this nuclear option can reduce transmission and limit damage to population health, it comes with significant economic and social costs – businesses go bust, vulnerable people become more marginalised, and the securitisation of health can jeopardise human rights. Other countries have taken a community approach, with “local” lockdowns at state level in the United States and Brazil. In theory these target the hotspots of infection, although this is harder to manage with mobile populations fed up of lockdown – what’s to stop people simply going to the next town?The most forward-thinking governments have prioritised targeted lockdowns, through track-and-trace systems to ensure they isolate those infected or at risk, allowing the rest of the population (and economy) to continue.  Here in the UK, it’s unclear whether the Government is prioritising people’s health or the economy.We locked down too late, costing numerous unnecessary deaths, based on a hubristic argument of “British exceptionalism”. Even when the Government decided to move to track and trace, this exceptionalism required a British app, rather than simply licencing one trialled already, such as South Korea’s the UK version is still not fit for purpose. Thus, continued cycles of local lockdown seem somewhat inevitable in the UK in the absence of being able to deliver an inidual targeted approach, with a second national lockdown viewed as political suicide for Boris Johnson’s government. Next time, I hope we learn that the key is to move early, be humble, and learn from each other’s experience.Anthony Costello, Professor of Global Health, UCL, and founder member of Independent SageWe forgot about public health. We forgot that infections like flu, hepatitis, dengue fever, HIV, malaria, tuberculosis and bacterial pneumonia, killed more people than all the wars of the past century. And we forgot that public health is about the ‘loving struggle’, what the philosopher Karl Jaspers calls a forum where “all kinds of power and superiority, prejudice and calculating strategic reserve against the other are eliminated”.  Imagine if a public health scientist had been invited to join Sage and had read and understood January’s research papers about the deadly nature of Covid-19. Imagine they had challenged the modellers and their flattened curves and herd immunity theories derived from a different virus. And imagine if they had disputed the myopic view that we couldn’t test, and argued that our 44 NHS molecular virology labs across the country could rise to the challenge. Imagine if all public health directors in every local authority across the country had been asked to draw up a local pandemic response plan, recruit paid contact tracers and volunteers, and been given extra resources. Then we might have mobilised like Wuhan, where, in two weeks, 9,000 community health workers in teams of five were brought to a population of 10 million. England and Wales provided just 270 overworked tracers for 55 million. Imagine if accurate, up-to-date data was shared openly with local communities, to keep them engaged and innovative, rather than concealed in contracts with accountants, call centres and apps. Germany, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Greece, China, South Korea,  Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, Vietnam and Thailand managed their loving struggle. If the UK had not neutered its public health service, if it had locked down two weeks earlier, had trusted primary care and local authorities, built on NHS systems, stopped boasting about “world-beating” this and that, protected the elderly as it had promised, devolved decisions, copied Ireland, and protected vulnerable health and care workers, we might have suffered far fewer deaths and been in a better position to manage the aftermath of lockdown. Dr Ron Daniels, consultant in intensive care, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation TrustI’ve been an intensive care specialist, or “Intensivist”, for almost 20 years. In that time my colleagues and I have seen serious illnesses, unbelievable tragedies, challenging winters and seasons when we’ve been hit hard by flu. We have known for some time that a pandemic was overdue, but with threats such as SARS, MERS and Ebola not really reaching these shores perhaps we had become complacent.We had no idea what was to come. In a matter of weeks, our NHS and our intensive care units became stretched to levels we hadn’t imagined possible.We’re only just beginning to appreciate the effect on those with cancer and long-term conditions. We know there have been many thousands of deaths beyond those expected for the time of year. And it’s terrible to think that people with acute conditions may well have died at home because of fear of accessing healthcare.   We only survived because of lockdown. All clinicians are acutely conscious of the seemingly conflicting priorities of economic stability and NHS survival, but the reality is that this very nearly broke us. Intensive care units were full, we were doubling up patients in rooms, and safe staffing was challenged by unprecedented levels of sick leave. Many staff have still not been able to return to work, and tragically we have lost far too many colleagues.Just as our ability to cope became saturated, lockdown began to work. Patient numbers accessing hospitals reduced, we learned more about how to manage patients with Covid-19, we were able to focus on those patients we had, and we became able to breathe a bit easier again.Lockdown was the right strategy. The next time a pandemic comes, we will be very much better prepared. We have to assume that it won’t be too far away. If there is one thing this virus has taught us it is that preparedness is all.Prof David Heymann, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at LSHTM and Head of the Centre on Global Health Security at Chatham House, LondonMost countries in lockdown are really surviving day to day and nothing\u0027s sure yet about how they will eventually be judged. One of the big questions is: had we prepared for lockdown in advance, would it have been better?In Asia the approach was different than in many other parts of the world. Many countries took an epidemiological approach from the start, and had planned for that after SARS and MERS outbreaks. They heeded the early warnings from WHO and prepared in mid-January.  They had the testing and track and trace systems ready.As the virus spread they looked for where transmission was occurring in greatest intensity, and that\u0027s where they locked down. They did not totally lockdown but rather locked down where they noted that the risk of transmission was greatest, and they opened up when that risk had decreased. In other countries, it seemed it was last minute, just locking down everything without an exit strategy. Now many countries are trying to develop that exit strategy. Should they go for complete suppression of the virus? Or might trying to shield the populations at greatest risk be the better strategy? These are questions we will only know the answers to afterwards, but they\u0027re questions that policymakers are having to address now. It’s very difficult.Why didn’t all countries take an Asain style epidemiological approach? I think many countries planned more for an influenza-type virus which - rightly or wrongly - is seen as more difficult to contain.But some adjusted quickly. Germany is a good example in Europe, they continued their contact tracing having trained a large number of tracing scouts, and in many cases seem to have prevented the virus getting deep into the community. We are all now learning and trying different approaches. There will likely be many lessons taken from Asia. And you know, I\u0027m not criticising anybody. Right now everybody\u0027s building the ship in a different way  - we\u0027ll find out which are best as we sail on.Prof Devi Sridhar, Professor of Global Public Health at the University of EdinburghThe clear lesson from Covid-19 so far is early, hard lockdowns mean a shorter lockdown overall. Trying to keep the economy going, while having the virus circulating, ends up meaning that all balls get dropped, and a halfway house where the economy can’t fully re-open while the virus is still circulating at substantial levels.   Repeated lockdowns or whack-a-mole strategies are not sustainable and are even more destructive for small businesses and children given the uncertainty they entail. The fastest path to protect health, the economy and society is to push towards a “zero Covid” Britain, and then use border screening and checks to catch imported cases.The question of whether the lockdown was worth it for the Conservatives may only be answered by a public inquiry. It is no secret that Boris Johnson, as a lifelong libertarian, initially resisted restrictions on the public’s civil liberties. But, as far as most Tories are concerned, it wasn’t the lockdown that came too late – but the lifting of lockdown. Many in cabinet and on the backbenches long argued against what they perceived as No 10’s over-cautious approach. There were concerns that the Prime Minister had “gone soft” following his intensive care spell – with the NHS given disproportionate protection over Britain’s economic recovery.Certainly the whole episode has caused MPs, particularly those newly elected in Red Wall seats, to question the fallibility of Johnson’s 80-seat majority in light of tanking public approval ratings and Sir Keir Starmer’s growing popularity. Tuesday’s “Build, build, build” speech will have reassured those in previously long-held Labour seats that the Tories’ promise of levelling up looks likely to be honoured – yet Conservatives in the Home Counties will most likely ask: At what cost? If the Prime Minister really can turn this crisis into an opportunity to reform not just the civil service but the UK as a fully-self governing global free trade leader that goes back to manufacturing more of its own goods, while upping the provision of its services around the world, then the post-Brexit electorate is likely to reward him. The lockdown will only have been worth it for the Conservatives if the Prime Minister is going to be credited with Britain\u0027s economic recovery in the weeks, months and years to come. Failure simply isn\u0027t an option, politically or otherwise.The final effect of lockdown on Boris Johnson’s premiership will not depend purely on its practical consequences. As the Conservatives have never forgotten, the ultimate effect of Black Wednesday, when the UK fell out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992, was that the economy boomed – but the Tories were not forgiven for what appeared to be a shambles at the time.The impression that Boris is making now will still matter even if we eventually get a spectacular recovery. The question that looms before him – and the country – is whether he is a leader or just a cheerleader. Like the clever journalist he was, the prime minister can make a persuasive case for any position he adopts, but an eloquent argument is not the same as effective execution of a plan. Even if he casts himself as the inspirational frontman for the people making real decisions, he will still be held responsible for the outcome.That means that those on whom he relies to master the detail must be absolutely sound – and he must not be so dependent on them that they are irreplaceable. There is nothing inherently wrong with a prime minister who is mostly vision (“big picture”). This was a notably successful political formula for Tony Blair. In fact, leaders who are obsessive about detail (Gordon Brown, Theresa May) are often spectacularly unpopular with the public. Margaret Thatcher was the exception to this – but she was an exception to most rules.The electorate is going to make a decision – probably quite soon – about whether Boris Johnson is good at words and little else. And they will stick to that decision for a long time.Tom Harris, columnist and former Labour MPIt is reasonably easy to summarise the Labour Party’s position on handling coronavirus: it was (with hindsight) in favour of an earlier lockdown. It was also supportive of the Government’s reluctance to impose a lockdown.The party was the first to demand a “pathway” out of lockdown and, when that pathway was published, expressed fears that the government was progressing too quickly.And when ministers announced plans to reopen schools, Labour was both supportive of teaching unions’ recalcitrant approach and also, more recently, in favour of getting pupils back into classrooms.  In other words, Labour has somehow managed to hedge its bets. This might be viewed as political cynicism on the part of the party leader, Keir Starmer. But polling suggests voters are willing to offer him the benefit of the doubt.Starmer knows his history and undoubtedly recognises a parallel in events from the 90s. Labour was the biggest beneficiary of the Exchange Rate Mechanism fiasco because voters quickly forgot the enthusiasm the party had previously expressed for ERM membership.Starmer must be hoping that a similar collective amnesia will afflict the electorate, however events progress beyond this point.Britons will be toasting the end of lockdown in pubs and restaurants this weekend but the consequences of an economic disaster we will be living with for decades are far more sobering.  Today we are left with all the baleful consequences of putting the UK in the deep freeze as the economy sheds more than 10,000 jobs in the last week alone. Unemployment will hit 3 million later this year when the furlough scheme ends, and countless companies will go to the wall as fearful consumers save rather than spend. The saving grace is low debt interest, but future generations will be servicing a £2 trillion debt pile for years to come.   Far from the Government’s “levelling up” agenda that swept it to a landslide, the shutdown has also entrenched inequalities. Poorly paid service sector workers bear the brunt of the economic consequences while wealthier home workers ride out the storm in their spare rooms.   The closure of schools will do the same, advancing the better-off at the expense of the disadvantaged. An entire cohort of school and university leavers – some 1.5 million people – will bear the scars of lower earnings decades into the future, as they did after the financial crisis.  Weighing human lives in cash terms is an unpalatable task when families are losing loved ones, but it is the responsibility of being in government. Judged by standards that the National Institute of Clinical Excellence applies to other health treatments, which put a £30,000 limit on the price of extending life by a year, the lockdown has been massively expensive compared to the benefits gained.  Covid-19 presented politicians with the biggest trade-off between health and wealth in our lifetimes. But would they make the same decisions again with the benefit of hindsight? Privately, I suspect not.So was it all worthwhile? It’s one of those questions to which we will probably never know the answer.Personally, I take the view that the lockdown was a panicked over-reaction it might have been better to have stuck with the original plan of learning to live with the virus, which if we had been better at testing, would have been perfectly feasible. This would not have saved the economy from a serious recession behavioural changes alone would have ensured that. But it might not have been so deep.Yet if virtually all other advanced economies, and many developing countries, are applying the lockdown strategy, it becomes politically very high risk to adopt alternative approaches, so from that perspective, the decision was almost inevitable. Once it became clear that the NHS could cope, however, the lockdown became less easy to justify. The longer it went on, the worse the economic costs. These ought to have been more properly weighed in the balance.As a relatively crowded landmass with Europe’s only global metropolis at its heart and a high degree of dependence on service industries, Britain found itself peculiarly vulnerable both to the disease itself and to the economic impact of lockdown. We are therefore at double the risk of a renewed outbreak.As things stand, it’s looking as if the coronavirus contraction, both globally and in the UK, wasn’t quite as bad as initially feared. Now that social distancing measures are being eased, the bounce back may also be rather swifter than was generally anticipated just a few months back. But almost everywhere, the public finances will be left permanently damaged, and behavioural changes may mean economies never fully return to the way they were. Ironically, given where the virus originated, the Chinese economy may end up the least damaged, if only because of its relative lack of exposure to social consumption, the bit of the global economy that has been hit hardest by the social distancing measures. Whether you speak to scientists, social mobility experts or education professionals they will all say the same thing about school closures: the consequences are dire. But what would have been the alternative? If schools had stayed open throughout lockdown this may have been less disruptive for children in the short term, but in the long-run it could have prolonged the coronavirus outbreak in the UK.By the time all pupils return to the classroom in September, some will have been out of school for six months. Since British schools shut their doors on March 20, children’s experience of home learning has been mixed.  Some schools have laid out a full Zoom timetable for their pupils, while others have been slow to get their act together. Even where teachers are doing their best to organise activities for children to work on at home, whether the children actually do the work or not is another matter.It is not only children from deprived households that are falling behind. Lazy youngsters, regardless of their family’s income, also struggled to keep up with their education at home. As the chief inspector of schools pointed out, children who lack motivation will be among the biggest losers of lockdown.A recent study found that more than two million children have done virtually no schoolwork during the lockdown. One in five pupils in the UK – equating to around 2.3 million children – either did no home learning at all or less than one hour a day, according to a new report by University College London\u0027s Institute of Education.Aside from the impact of children\u0027s academic progress, there is also the social and emotional cost of closing schools. Children are missing their normal routine, seeing their friends and their end-of-year events like sports day, as well as other rites of passage like a leavers’ disco or “muck-up day”. Students in older years are missing the opportunity to take their GCSE and A-level exams and instead are being handed predicted grades by their teachers based on previous work which they did not know at the time would count for anything.There is no doubt that lockdown has left the wreckage of countless relationships in its wake: the couples starting out who drifted apart because they could no longer see each other the grandparents deprived of vital, uplifting time with their grandchildren those who had to say goodbye to the dying remotely, or veiled in PPE and, even more darkly, those trapped in abusive households. But humans are supremely adaptable. In many cases, bonds broken were replaced by bonds forged, or renewed. When families and friends were forced apart, neighbour reached out to neighbour. The small act of shopping and dropping off the groceries established new links so that sometimes even those shielding found themselves less isolated, not more. For Britain’s social scandal was actually there for all to see pre-lockdown: the way we abandon the old the unfitness of our social care system too many women trapped and suffering violence the children left behind by schools that fail them. Lockdown has changed none of these failings, these inequalities. It has merely exacerbated them.Lockdown, like war, has not been a game-changer, it has been an intensifier.  The lucky, with gardens, with access to well-resourced private education and tutors, have survived, perhaps even thrived.The IFS found that “children from better-off families are spending 30pc more time on home learning than are those from poorer families”. By contrast the unlucky, locked down with no escape for long periods in smaller or run-down properties, or forced without savings into the stress of debt or to face the virus rather than give up precarious jobs, without computers and a calm place to work remotely, have been tested beyond breaking point. The mental health charity, SANE, reported calls to its helplines doubling during lockdown. There is a way of snatching social benefit from the human wreckage the virus has left behind – but only if we wake up and emerge, striving to right the wrongs that rip up families from the inside.Rupert Christiansen, opera critic and arts columnistSo far, it’s been a catastrophe. Every theatre, cinema, concert hall, gallery and museum in the country has been closed. A lucky few can draw on reserves the remainder have only the furlough scheme and the begging bowl to sustain them.Institutions with the wherewithal have bravely streamed content via their websites, but there is virtually no way of making meaningful money out of the broadcasts. Theatres and concert halls have increasingly little chance of reopening before Christmas at the earliest. The majority of people who work in the arts are freelancers and therefore particularly vulnerable: orchestras and choirs require a degree of physical proximity that makes it impossible even to rehearse.The absence of any road map or timetable means that nobody can plan for the future with any confidence. Redundancies and administration have already begun in cities such as Southampton, Leicester and Plymouth: more will follow them to the wall.That’s one side of it, and it’s undoubtedly bleak. But if one takes a longer view, the lockdown has also offered stronger organisations a chance to reboot and consider priorities. Is too much being spent on marketing, on needlessly extravagant sets and costumes? Are agents and unions being realistic about rates of pay and terms of employment? Does the supply of art exceed demand? Those who address such fundamental questions may emerge ultimately leaner and fitter.But perhaps lockdown’s most positive effect has been to bring us starkly face to face with how passionately we love - and how deeply we need – our theatres, concerts halls, galleries and museums, our opera and ballet. The arts matter.Sport’s great misfortune is that it found itself blamed, early on in lockdown, as a Covid super-spreader. The Cheltenham Festival in mid-March was depicted, with hindsight, as an orgy of Guinness-swilling recklessness, while a Champions League game in Italy between Valencia and Atalanta, Bergamo’s home team, was described by the mayor of that benighted city as a “biological bomb”. In the three-and-a-half months since, the sports-going experience that we know and cherish has been sanitised beyond recognition. The stands at Premier League grounds are filled only with masked journalists and socially distanced substitutes, background figures in a ghostly spectacle enlivened for television by fake crowd noise. It is the palest simulacrum of everything that sport could and should be.  While Saturday represents “Independence Day” for huge swathes of society, it offers no such watershed for sport. County cricket is mothballed until next month, after the Prime Minister described the red leather ball as a “natural vector of disease”. Rugby looks increasingly as if it will be left behind by the pandemic, with even its domestic competitions suspended until mid-August.  All the while, Wimbledon, the Open Championship, and all the great signifiers of summer are painfully conspicuous by their absence. On Saturday morning we should have been waking to the prospect of a glittering Middle Saturday programme on Centre Court. Instead, we consoled ourselves with endless replays of Virginia Wade and the Borg-McEnroe tiebreak.  The hope is that this infernal experience will condition us to appreciate sport all the more, once it returns in full bloom. The portents are auspicious, with the summer of 2021 already promising a rescheduled Euros, a simplified Olympics, and a Lions tour of South Africa. By then, more conventional rhythms, not least visits to the gym and the weekly ParkRun, should be comfortingly familiar again, too. Never will sport have felt more vital to the health of a nation.Martin Jones, CEO of Home Instead Senior Care UK‘Lockdown, combined with the shockingly high coronavirus death toll in care homes, has led to significant numbers of older people either cancelling or deferring care. The UK already has a dangerously large number of older people with unmet care needs, projected to hit around 1.6 million people by the end of 2020, and lockdown will almost certainly have exacerbated that.Where older people should be receiving care, instead we are seeing well-intentioned, but ultimately un-trained and time-poor family members being left to pick up care duties. Similarly concerns around the safety of hospitals, combined with a reluctance to leave the house that lockdown has fostered, means that elderly people aren’t getting the pressing medical help they need.What lockdown has made apparent is that successive governments have not prioritised social care. We are finally recognising and challenging this as a nation, as lockdown and the pandemic that led to it has brought the elderly to the forefront of our minds. Now is the time to act we urgently need a greater understanding of the care options available to people and a greater focus on prevention and wellbeing.As we enter the next phase of lockdown we must better consider how we best care for people - now and  for the long term.What do you think?

Hundreds of police officers have been deployed to ensure the 3,000 residents do not leave their homes unless there is an emergency.This is not going to be a pleasant experience for those residents, but I have a message for those residents: this is not about punishment but protection, Mr Andrews said in a televised conference.Mr Andrews said public health workers would test every resident of the buildings, except those who have previously tested positive.He told local media that none of the residents would have to pay rent for two weeks, and committed to support payments for those unable to work.The communal nature of the facilities, which house people on low incomes, has genuinely explosive potential for the spread of the virus, said Brett Sutton, Victoria\u0027s chief health officer.In addition to the complete lockdown orders, more than 30 Melbourne suburbs are also under strict social-distancing orders, but people there can leave their houses to go to work, school or to buy groceries.Thana Sirag, a resident of a tower block in the Flemington estate, told the  that she received an alert that her area would be on lockdown and within hours the situation escalated.“I heard sirens outside and when I looked out the window I saw flashing blue and red lights and about 30 police cars,” she said.Ms Sirag said police officers told her the lockdown could continue for up to 14 days. Honestly lost for words. We’re not allowed to leave the house, she said.Health authorities have detected at least 27 Covid cases across the North Melbourne and Flemington towers, which are densely populated and include many communal spaces, increasing the risk of transmission among residents.The state government has committed to delivering food packages and other supplies. Residents took to social media to express their disbelief at the situation, and also noted that some packages, when they arrived, were haphazard. In one example, breakfast cereal was included, but no milk and no bread.“Those who are employed and because of the hard lockdown cannot go to work, they will receive a $1,500 hardship payment. For those households where there is no-one in employment, they will receive a $750 hardship payment,” Mr Andrews said.He added: If we have a large group of people who already have pre-existing and underlying health challenges infected with this virus then people will die.

Thankfully, no one actually remembers that American Psycho 2 exists, or that Mila Kunis is the lead, which is good because it ruins the ambiguous ending of the original film. No amount of peppermint sheet masks could ever clean this mess of a movie up. Deciding to leave Baby in the corner, Havana Nights shares little with the original Dirty Dancing.

Your eyes will be left hungry for more.Even if you don’t like James Cameron’s 1997 Oscar-winning behemoth, it’s hard to forget the iconic image of a ship and its passengers meeting their watery doom. The digital effects of Titanic II, however, look like a child’s version of the original’s visuals. The plot – about a boat literally named Titanic II that takes its maiden voyage 100 years after the first – is equally creaky.Ten years after the original film, Mac Davis and Jackie Gleason fill in for Paul Newman and Robert Redford in this heist remake.

This tired comedy never crosses over from stupid into funny, despite many of the cast returning to try and recapture the dubious magic.The sequel to Donnie Darko toys with the concept of time, by wasting yours. The dialogue is awful, the acting wooden, and you don’t even get to see an angsty black haired Jake Gyllenhaal in all his blue-eyed glory. Director of the original, Richard Kelly, was so offended by S. Darko he described the experience of watching it as “horribly violating”.Robert De Niro’s reputation continued to devalue with the third installment of the Meet The Parents series. The title indicates how much effort was put into this family comedy, which relies on under-the-belt hits to wring any laughs out of its audience.This follow-up to the flashy 2013 film squanders the only reason it would have a sequel, and somehow is not named Now You See Me Now. The sleight-of-hand magic here is all style and no substance, and the endless overcomplicated reveals of characters tricking each other become very irritating.Mulan is a gender-bending, brave heroine who refuses to conform to society\u0027s expectations of her. That is, until she reappears in the Disney sequel as a devoted wife who is more than willing to comply with her husbands demands. Now even her pet dragon Mushu doesn’t like her. 1627 Son of the MaskJim Carrey is replaced by Alan Cumming in this low-budget comedy sequel, which manages to be both frantic and boring at once. Director Lawrence Guterman tries to make up for the lack of Carrey’s signature comedic vim by adding a baby and a dog, but their antics can’t distract from the ugly production design.Danny and Sandy flying off into the sunset should have been the end of Grease. But money-hungry film execs brought us back to Rydell High for sequel fans were hopelessly undevoted to. I hated that film with a vengeance and could not believe how bad it was, said Sandy stand-in Michelle Pfieffer years later. At the time I was young and didn\u0027t know any better.1827 Dumb and Dumber ToStupider even than its title, the Farrelly brothers’ sequel puts its stars (Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels) through an overlong retread of past material. The broad humour feels decades out of date, and the energy that propelled the original through its juvenile jokes is gone. It’s hard to imagine who was the target audience for these gross-out sight gags.Hitchcock’s 1963 film The Birds was a masterclass in suspense. The birds that menace Tippi Hedron and the other inhabitants of Bodega Bay become genuinely disturbing through a slow, atmospheric build of tension. This made-for-TV sequel has the same avian threat, and some of the same cast, but none of the classic thrills.Sharon Stone had bad instincts when she agreed to this film. Even a new take on her iconic leg-crossing interrogation scene couldn’t save this sequel from one of the worst rotten tomato ratings on record. It managed to make less than $6m Stateside on a $70m budget.Amy Adams tries her best to tear into her role as a sadistic, sex-obsessed bully but the script for Cruel Intentions 2 – strictly speaking, a prequel, but sssh – is so bad that even she failed to save it. When her stepbrother Sebastian moves into her Mum’s Manhattan mansion, she barges into his shower and warns him, no one is going to threaten my cushy life. What teenager would ever say cushy life? Did a Mean Girls sequel happen if Tina Fey wasn’t around to write it? No, no it did not. A Plastics vs nerds turf war in the pits of the high school jungle just doesn’t work without Fey’s tight one-liners. In Mean Girls 2 we hear none of the “on Wednesdays we wear pink” “that\u0027s why her hair is so big. It\u0027s full of secrets” “you can’t sit with us” zingers that made the original film so magical. Although the soundtrack had its fans, this film is essentially a remake of the 1980 original without one half of the titular Blues Brothers (John Belushi died in 1982). Bafflingly, he is replaced by a 10-year old child in sunglasses. It’s half as funny and nowhere near as infectiously fun, but if you only care about the music, that might not matter.Infamous for ruining what would have been, in many critics’ eyes, a perfect trio of movies, The Godfather Part III delivers a slow anti-climax. The film has its defenders, but given the calibre of the first two Godfathers, this last instalment is the black sheep of the family.A young Hilary Swank stars in the fourth Karate Kid film, a precursor to the modern trend of rebooting ailing franchises with a female lead. Pat Morita as Mr Miyagi is charming as always, but the script is mostly recycled. There are a couple of interesting differences: Swank has a pet hawk, Buddhist monks dance to the Cranberries, and there’s almost no fighting. But what’s a Karate Kid sequel without the Kid or the karate?It might be called Staying Alive, but you won’t want to after watching this sequel. Six years after our hero Tony Manero made white polyester bell bottoms popular, we check back in on him as he auditions for a new Broadway musical called Satan’s Alley. There are far too many romantic subplots, oiled up chests and loincloths to make this film okay. Keanu Reeves wisely didn’t pick up the phone for this Razzie-winning action thriller. The speeding bus rigged by a bomber in the 1994 film is bizarrely replaced by a cruise ship here, making the action a lot slower and more boring. Poor Sandra Bullock is given nothing interesting to do, and surely must have been tempted to look for a lifeboat. Like a reliable friend – or a movie franchise worth millions of dollars – Zoolander returned for another film. In place of a funny script and a decipherable plot, the sequel shoves in endless celebrity cameos. Skrillex, Susan Boyle and Justin Bieber are one of the 39 celebrities that appear in the film, but the force of star power fails to make Zoolander 2 enjoyable.227 I Still Know What You Did Last SummerAn island getaway becomes the setting of predictable kills and lazy thrills in this sub-par slasher. Jennifer Love Hewitt, haunted by the events of the first film, leads a cast running for their lives. The implausibly gullible teen characters still scream, the red herrings are still obvious, and we still know how it’s all going to end.Jaws 2 sees the great white original reduced to a lukewarm b-movie filled with bad special effects and clumsy editing. The only positive thing about Jaws 2 is that all the characters are so annoying that it’s actually pretty satisfying watching them get eaten alive. See also Jaws 3, 4 and 5.He might have been a crazed narcissist, but Patrick Bateman deserved better than this sequel. Thankfully, no one actually remembers that American Psycho 2 exists, or that Mila Kunis is the lead, which is good because it ruins the ambiguous ending of the original film. No amount of peppermint sheet masks could ever clean this mess of a movie up. Deciding to leave Baby in the corner, Havana Nights shares little with the original Dirty Dancing. Patrick Swayze’s simmering dance instructor becomes a charisma deprived pool boy. Our heroine has been replaced by an uptight WASP and worst of all there’s no overhead lift. Your eyes will be left hungry for more.Even if you don’t like James Cameron’s 1997 Oscar-winning behemoth, it’s hard to forget the iconic image of a ship and its passengers meeting their watery doom. The digital effects of Titanic II, however, look like a child’s version of the original’s visuals. The plot – about a boat literally named Titanic II that takes its maiden voyage 100 years after the first – is equally creaky.Ten years after the original film, Mac Davis and Jackie Gleason fill in for Paul Newman and Robert Redford in this heist remake. Considering the movie’s clumsy mobster dialogue and slow-moving plot, the audience in 1983 might have felt like they were the ones who had really been hoodwinked.827 Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2The original Blair Witch changed the face of horror forever, inspiring hysteria with its cheap but innovative found-footage hook. Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 has better production values, but manages to be far less clever. A group of students visiting the first film’s location find themselves in danger, and the plot unravels from there.John Rambo is stripped of any the nuance he had in the first film, becoming an all-American macho cliche and increasing his body count through cartoonish violence. The ex-soldier tears through Vietnam to rescue American prisoners of war as a one man army, seemingly impervious to bullets or logic. If the absurd plot doesn’t jar for you, the politics probably will.Given the global recession that hung over this follow-up to the original 1987 Wall Street, director Oliver Stone could have made a far more interesting and timely film. A cast including Michael Sheen and Shia LaBeouf provide diminishing returns in a tale of greed that ultimately pulls its punches.1127 Weekend at Bernie\u0027s 2You may ask yourself how it’s possible to make a sequel to a film based on two friends pretending a corpse is still alive in order to party.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Scientists have raised fresh questions over whether a coronavirus sample held for years in a Wuhan laboratory could have mutated naturally or via genetic experimentation to become the virus which causes Covid-19.Since the Sars pandemic in 2003, China-based researchers have been scouring bat-inhabited caves in the hope of tracking and analysing potential new coronaviruses, notably at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV).Among the most revered of these scientists is Dr Shi Zhengli, nicknamed “Bat Woman” by her colleagues – who in February co-authored the most extensive academic paper on the novel coronavirus up to that point.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn addition to giving a full genetic description of the virus, Dr Shi’s paper – published in Nature – revealed that the WIV housed a sample of virus collected from bats named RaTG13, which it said was a 96.2 per cent match with the Covid-19 virus – the closest yet discovered.The scientific consensus has been that the two viruses are unlikely to be the same, with some estimates suggesting it could take between 20 and 50 years to make up the 4 per cent genetic difference.However, past research work carried out at VIW to improve the ability of pathogens to cause disease, known as “gain-of-function” research, has been documented in papers published between 2015 and 2017, described in one paper co-authored by Dr Shi as “virus infectivity experiments”.Johnson’s father defends trip to GreeceWomen’s lives at risk from ‘holes’ in abuse law National landmarks to light up in blue to celebrate NHS staff Flag-waving activists ridiculed for Scottish border ‘patrol’WHO reports record global rise in daily cases as pandemic intensifies While scientists also overwhelmingly believe the genetic code of Sars-Cov-2 suggests it has mutated naturally, and has not been engineered, others believe it should not be ruled out that the two viruses may once have been the same.The type of techniques required to turn RaTG13 into Sars-Cov-2 are “identical” to work previously carried out in Wuhan, alleges Professor Richard Ebright of Rutgers University’s Waksman Institute of Microbiology in New Jersey.“The very same techniques, the very same experimental strategies using RaTG13 as the starting point, would yield a virus essentially identical to Sars-Cov-2,” he told The Sunday Times.However, Professor Martin Hibberd of the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine contended that to do so would be “exceptionally difficult”, telling the paper that they “are not the same virus and I don’t think you can easily manipulate one into the other”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe pair also disagreed over how long the necessary mutation would take naturally.Prof Hibberd suggested it could take around 20 years to do so, but Prof Ebright said it was “not a valid assumption” to assume that the virus would have developed at the rate observed since its emergence this year.“When a virus changes hosts and adapts to a new host the rate of evolutionary change is much higher,” Prof Ebright said. “And so it is possible that RaTG13, particularly if it entered humans prior to November 2019, may have undergone adaptation in humans at a rate that would allow it to give rise to Sars-Cov-2. I think that is a distinct possibility.”The origins of the RaTG13 sample held have also been placed under further scrutiny, with one of Dr Shi’s longstanding colleagues alleging that it was found in 2013 in a Chinese copper mine linked to the deaths of three men tasked with clearing bat faeces.While the cause of their deaths was linked to fungus found in the cave, tests carried out on four of the men found they all had antibodies against an unknown Sars-like coronavirus.Security agencies investigating coronavirus spread in Wuhan in OctoberIn 2012, Dr Shi and her team were reportedly called to the copper mine near Tongguan in the Mojiang region after six men fell ill with pneumonia-like symptoms.In a paper called “Coexistence of multiple coronaviruses in several bat colonies in an abandoned mineshaft” published in 2016, she and her colleagues wrote that of the 152 genetic sequences of coronavirus found in the mine, two were similar to that which had caused Sars. One was reportedly described as a “new strain” of Sars and called RaBtCoV4991.In claims backed up by a virus database published by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, who has searched for viruses with Dr Shi’s team for 15 years told The Sunday Times that the sample found in the mine, RaBtCoV4991, had been renamed RaTG13, adding: “It was just one of the 16,000 bats we sampled.“It was a faecal sample, we put it in a tube, put it in liquid nitrogen, took it back to the lab. We sequenced a short fragment.”Referencing the sample’s change of name since its discovery in 2013, he said: “The conspiracy folks are saying there’s something suspicious about the change in name, but the world has changed in six years – the coding system has changed.”While it is reported that what is believed to be the closest-known relation to the novel coronavirus was shelved in the Wuhan institute at that point as not being a close enough match to the Sars virus, scientists have questioned the likelihood of this scenario.Wuhan Institute of Virology\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.From fashion stylist to farm hand: meet the people helping to harvestThe bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Concern has been raised over the reopening of pubs in London after scenes from Soho appeared to show people failing to observe social distancing rules.Numerous pictures and videos have been shared online of packed, crowded streets in the famous London district.One Twitter user wrote: “Just seen the scenes in Soho. It’s as if the health care workers who risked their lives trying to deal with the pandemic were just wasting their time.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnother wrote: “Cycling through London tonight made me cry. Heaving with bodies \u0026amp puke, the continual sound of police sirens. The queues in Soho like when England win a match. And yet we didn’t win. We lost! People will always be trash. But none more so than the Tories. This is on them.”One man who passed through Soho told the Daily Mirror: “Walking down old Compton Street felt like wading through a Petri dish.”Police were present in the area, though it seems no attempts were made to disperse the crowds, which filled a number of streets closed off to cars.Large groups were also seen congregating in Notting Hill on Saturday night.The latest figures show the R rate range has risen above 1 in London – meaning cases of the virus could be growing again.In the capital, the range is thought to be between 0.8 and 1.1. Across the UK, the government says the estimated R number is between 0.7-0.9.On Friday, England’s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, warned that “this virus is a long way from gone.Although ‘Super Saturday’ appears to have passed without any major incidents, there have been reports of disorder across the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As a result four arrests were made by officers and we supported licensees who chose to close their own premises.“No pubs have been closed by the police.“We’d like to thank the majority of the public who have acted responsibly throughout Saturday, especially whilst watching the much-anticipated Derby v Forest match.”Elsewhere, police in Essex claim to have made four arrests following a “disturbance” in Brentwood High Street.Special inspector Steve Weaver tweeted: “That didn’t last long. Disturbance in Brentwood High street assisted other units. 4 people arrested. 2 of my team have arrested and are currently on the way to custody.”Earlier on Saturday, the national chairman of the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) said feedback from branches suggested up to half of pubs did not reopen on Saturday.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out.

I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community.

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.How schools in England are helping pupils return to the classroomThe task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Prior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Coronavirus lockdowns are lifting around the world, raising concerns that it could trigger a new wave of infections.Some countries that experienced a significant drop in new Covid-19 cases in April and May are now beginning to experience an uptick in confirmed daily cases.The concerning trend can be seen in several countries throughout the Middle East, most notably in Iran where new cases briefly dropped below 1,000 in early May but have now more than doubled.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIran was one of the first countries to experience a significant outbreak of the deadly virus, with close to 200,000 total cases recorded.Looking at a smoothed seven-day rolling average for new daily cases, Iran\u0027s second wave came almost exactly one month after the first wave.The data suggests that Iran may have already reached the peak of its second wave and is now on the decline.Other countries in the region appear to be experiencing a more gradual second wave, with official figures from Israel revealing that new coronavirus cases have been rising consistently for the past three weeks.Israel\u0027s second wave remains a long way off the peak of the first wave, and the country remains one of the least affected in the Middle East.In Saudi Arabia, new cases are rising at record rates despite briefly appearing to peak in late May.The false peak means the latest surge of new cases could be counted as a continuation of the first wave, rather than a new second wave.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Government warned businesses to stop people taking part in group singing or chanting as well because it carries an increased risk of spreading coronavirus. Dance floors will also be repurposed into table areas and patrons will need to be sat downthey want to be indoors. Another favourite pastime is also on the chopping block - the pub quiz will have to stay virtual at least for the moment. This is because of concerns it could lead to yelling and spread the virus. But in a hopeful sign for entertainment in pubs when conversation runs dry, the guidance said it will continue to develop based on scientic evidence to enable these activities as soon as possible.   To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ownership of tiny isolated island Rockall could allegedly put the two countries at loggerheads.An unearthed report suggests Scottish authorities claimed the rock was under UK ownership, and tried to stop Irish fishermen from setting up there. Rockall fishing is reportedly a multi-million pound industry But the Irish government said the island was not subject to an international boundary as it was simply a large, uninhabitable rock in the middle of the ocean, claims backed up by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney took a firm stance on the issue in June last year and said that Ireland had never recognised British claims to the island.He said: #We have never recognised UK sovereignty over Rockall and accordingly, we have not recognised a territorial sea around it either. We have tried to work positively with the Scottish authorities and to deal with sensitive issues that flow from it in a spirit of kinship and collaboration.#Nigel Farage has told Lib Dem boss Ed Davey to “get a le” for complaining to the police after he was pictured enjoying a pint in a pub following a trip to the US.Mr Davey accused the Brexiteer of flouting coronavirus quarantine rules and said he had shown a “flagrant disregard# for the safety of others.But the former Ukip leader, , who has just ed from a Donald Trump rally in Oklahoma, hit back: “I have been back  days. But, more importantly I have tested. That test said I do not have any signs of the virus at all.”When asked whether that test meant he was entitled to end his quarantine early, he replied: “Well, you make your own mind up on that.”Having been told about the complaint to Kent Police by Mr Davey, he replied: “Sad Ed Davey. Needs to get a le.#The Financial Times reports that UK funds risk being frozen out of the European market at the end of the year.It says the threat of being shut out “has risen after Brexit negotiators missed a key milestone aimed at securing market access for the City of London”.“We have got enough on our plate with the Covid- recovery and understandingmarkets have got ahead of the economic indicators,” warned Patrick Thomson, CEO of JPMorgan Asset Management’s business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.He told the FT: “Given the pressure the asset management industry is already facing in terms of fees and [the need to invest in] technology, to introduce further uncertainty would not be helpful at this time.”The Lib Dems acting leader, has shopped Nigel Farage to the cops for #breaking quarantine# after he sunk a pint in a Kent boozer today.The Brexit campaigner, , was reported to police over claims he should have been self-isolating having ed recently from a Donald Trump rally in America.Mr Farage could have broken quarantine rules as he was pictured on June  at Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, meaning he didntto the UK until the next day at the earliest.If he came back on June , it would have meant he visited the pub on while he was meant to still be in quarantine.The current rules state a person has to remain in isolation for  days after ing to the UK from the US.The UK is planning on worldwide free trade once the EU’s shackles are released on New Year’s Eve . Even though Britain officially left the EU on January , we’re still subject to most of the EU’s rules until December. But sources have said Britains first independent trade policy sincecome into force in January .The government will lobby for low tarfs and greater powers for the World Trade Organisation, according to an exclusive in The Mail on Sunday.The aim is for the UK to use its year-long presidency of the G to work out free trade with like-minded states, such as Australia, New Zealand and Singapore.According to one Whitehall source, “this is a top priority for the PM”.A Danish MEP has claimed Scotland’s first minister’s attempt to join the bloc will be used as a “punch” against Britain. Following the  referendum, Nicola Sturgeon launched a bid to join the EUScotland gains independence in the near future, The Express reports.But speaking soon after Ms Sturgeon’s move in , one Danish MEP told the : “It will be used by people who would like to punch Britain for Brexit and who are trying to derail some of the wishes coming from the United Kingdom.“It will aid their arguments. Mostly they will do it to annoy London, they are not doing it to help Scotland.”He added that the more united the UK is “the more chance you have to get concessions from Brussels”.The Scottish Governments Constitution Secretary Michael Russell has said a new Brexit plan will seriously undermine devolution. The proposals to create a UK internal market is an attempt to “power grab” from Holyrood, he added.In a letter to Michael Gove, Mr Russel said the unpublished plans #ignore the reality and history of devolution# and would be opposed by the Scottish Government”.The EU’s chief negotiator is “‘losing his French charm.”.Brexit party chief Michael Tice told The Express: “The EU have got a very good negotiating team.#They conned us into agreeing on a ridiculous sequencing process.#They have revealed themselves to be strategically very smart and very confident.#When things dont go their way, and they are not currently going their way, they lose their temperament and get cross very quickly.#The EU like to hold all the cards and have the upper hand, that is what they got used to with our previous negotiators, that has now changed now.#Michel Barnier is suave and sophisticated with this French charm.#But he is starting to look a little rough around the edges and that is because things are not going their way.”Products from Japan or South Korea would be stamped Made in Britain, under Boris Johnson’s plan to save the domestic car industry after Brexit.The idea is an attempt to prevent harsh tarfs that could drive away brands such as Nissan and Toyota and was uncovered in proposals for an EU trade deal.But many Brexit voters could find the idea “ridiculous” after being promised huge benefits from leaving the EU.Goods made solely from foreign parts, but assembled in the UK – particularly vehicles and prepared foods and other manufactured goods – would be granted the same exemptions from tarfs as those from UK components.Alan Winters, professor of economics at the University of Sussex Business School, said companys such as Nissan could leave the UKit had to pay tarfs.He told The Independent: “We know that the Japanese are wondering whether they would stay around.“Brexit is going to be bad news for jobs in lots of dimensions. In this one dimension, the British proposal would help to head off some of those losses.”Dr Peter Holmes, reader in economics, said: “What the UK government is seeking from the EU on rules of origin is unprecedented.“To the average Brexit supporter this approach may sound ridiculous and not part of any deal they voted for, but without it Japanese car plants risk facing  per cent tarfs on cars made in the UKthey use engines, gearboxes or other components made in Japan.”Nigel Farage, well known for his fondness for beer, tweeted a picture of himself in a reopened pub, but was met by a storm of tweeted criticism and suggestions he should still be observing a -day quarantine as mandated for people traveling from the United States.Farage attended a campaign rally for President Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma on June .Acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey called on police to investigate whether Nigel Farage has broken quarantine rules.Mr Farage tweetED a photo of himself at .pm today from a Kent pub declaring # oclock, first customer in. Love it.# However, he insisted he had been back from a trip to the US for two weeks and had tested negative for Covid-.Sir Ed wrote to chief constable Alan Pughsley, stating: #I write out of concern that one of your local residents may have broken quarantine rules regarding international travel and is putting lives at risk with a wilful disregard for scientic and medical advice.The Secretary of State for International Trade Liz Truss has said Britain will boom once Brexit is completedit can successfully form partnerships with other countries.She claimed the UK would greatly benefit from becoming a part of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacic Partnershiponce Brexit was out of the way.During a speech at a Policy Exchange webinar event, Ms Truss claimed the CPTPP would allow Britain to grow in ways that it could not, had it stayed a member of the EU.Ms Truss said: #I also think it’s important to recognise these benefits we could gain by joining CPTPP that wouldn’t have been able to access as a member of the European Union.#We would be able to accede to this agreement in ways that does not damage our national sovereignty.#There is no ECJ and there is no harmonisation of domestic regulation and there is no seizing of our sovereign power.#Prime Minister Boris Johnson met with Kenyas President Uhuru Kenyatta for private talks today during which the two leaders agreed to start negotiations for a Kenya-United Kingdom post-Brexit trade agreement.The negotiations, which are expected to be finalised ahead of the UK’s exit from the EU on st December , will be conducted within the Kenya-UK Strategic Partnership Framework established by the two leaders in January  and the East African Communityparameters in order to enhance regional integration.In a telephone conversation at State House, President Kenyatta and Boris Johnson also discussed several Kenya-UK bilateral interests among them the two nation’s response to the global Covid- health crisis.The UK needs to show more #ambition#it wants to secure a post-Brexit deal with the EU before the end of the transition period, European Commissioner for Trade Phil Hogan said today.the Irish commissioner spoke with Ireland’s RTÉ radio today and said the EU over the past few months has shown it is willing to compromise, but that a #lack of ambition# on the UK side means #very little has happened.#Hogan said: “There’s a frustration on the EU side about the fact that the good faith in terms of the negotiations that’s required on both sides is not happening to the extent that it should.“Boris Johnson has explicitly stated that he wants a deal, so we need to see movement on the U.K. side soon or  it’s going to be too late.The commissioner added that he still believes that a deal can be struck by December , when the transition period ends.“The ambition of that deal on the EU side is real. I don’t see the same ambition on the U.K. side, so the ball is in the U.K.’s court. If they want a deal, there is a deal to be done,” he said.Plans to enshrine a UK #internal market# after Brexit would seriously undermine devolution, the Scottish Governments Constitution Secretary has said.Michael Russell said proposals from the UK Government would be a #power grab# on responsibilities held by the Scottish Parliament.In a letter to Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, he said he is concerned about proposals for an external body which would #test# whether a bill in Holyrood affected the UKs internal market.The letter also details concerns about plans for a #mutual recognition regime#, which he said could lower regulatory standards beyond what the Scottish Parliament found acceptable.Mr Russell said the proposals, which have not been published, #ignore the reality and history of devolution# and would be opposed by the Scottish Government.The EU and the UK issued statements early on Thursday afternoon calling an end to the talks.There was meant to be another day of discussions on Friday # but British officials led by David Frost ed to London.In a statement, Mr Frost said: “We have completed our discussion of the full range of issues in the negotiation in just over three days. “Our talks were face-to-face for the first time since March and this has given extra depth and flexibility to our discussions.“The negotiations have been comprehensive and useful. #But they have also underlined the signicant dferences that still remain between us on a number of important issues.”Talks are due to resume in London next week.Mr Barnier has said that there needs to be a “sustainable and long-term solution” on fisheries.Such a solution must take into account the needs of European fishermen for certainty over their livelihoods.It must also feature an effective all-encompassing dispute settlement mechanism to ensure both sides stick to their obligations.“We will continue to insist on parallel progress on all areas,” he said. “The EU expects, in turn, its positions to be better understood and respected in order to reach an agreement. #We need an equivalent engagement by the United Kingdom.”Mr Barnier says the UK has established red lines over its negotiations, including “no role for the European court of justice in the UK no obligation for the UK to continue to be bound by EU law and an agreement on fisheries that shows Brexit makes a real dference”.But he suggested the EU’s willingness to be flexible on its initial demands in light of the British positions had not been met with similar understanding from Downing Street over Brussels’ red lines.The latest negotiations in Brussels on an EU-UK trade and security deal have broke up early this week.The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has complained of a lack of respect and engagement by the British government.The two sides ended the week’s talks – the first held in person since February – a day ahead of the jointly agreed schedule.Both Mr Barnier and his UK counterpart David Frost say theyre facing “serious” disagreements.“Our goal was to get negotiations successfully and quickly on a trajectory to reach an agreement,” Barnier said in a statement. “However, after four days of discussions, serious ergences remain.”Holidays for Brits are going to be more expensive now after the value of the pound dropped during lockdown.In February, £ was worth €. # but its since dropped by ten pence to €..On Tuesday, it was €. to every pound.This means that Brits will get £ less on every £ they exchange into euros this summer.Experts have blamed the fall in the pound against the euro down to the coronavirus outbreak and uncertainty around Brexit negotiations.Image: AlamyBritain is considering joining an EU plan to secure supplies of potential vaccines against Covid-, officials in London and Brussels said on Friday.The UK-EU talks, first reported by the Financial Times, represent a test of the cooperation required to tackle international emergencies after Brexit.The EU is planning to spend around  billion euros on the advance purchase of vaccines in testing, on behalf of the  EU states.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said she is trying to convince “a signicant number” of world leaders to join forces and buy vaccines up front together, as competition for a vaccine could otherwise raise the cost for everyone.  Once Britain leaves the Brexit transition period and the European Single Market next January, the Government plans to implement a new IT system to manage the additional border checks that will be needed.The new # and untested # system is known as the Goods Vehicle Movement Service, or GVMS.It means UK companies exporting into the EU will have to wait for permission from the taxman before they can move their goods.According to a document circulated by HMRC, lorries will only be able to move loads into the EUthey have a valid reference from GVMS.Hauliers will need to file the correct customs paperwork electronically in advance in order to get approval # and the Government plans to bar trucks without clearance from reaching ports.Chancellor Rishi Sunak has called on Brits to eat out to help out as the coronavirus lockdown restrictions ease today.He says a generation of young people risk being #lost# unless the public starts spending in pubs and restaurants.He told The Times: #This is a consumption-driven economy people used to, three months ago, go out with their friends or family to go and have a meal.#Mr Sunak said that the public had to “relearn what it’s like to go out again” and added, in what may become his new slogan: “Eat out to help out”. Image: WmediaBritish businesses are increasingly worried that the UK governments planned system to check goods heading to the European Union wont be ready in time for when the Brexit transition period ends in .The Government plans to bring in an entirely new IT system to help check goods heading to the EU from January .But leading UK business groups have told Business Insider that the government has failed to confirm to them how the system will work and whether it will be fully al in time.One senior figure who is in close contact with the government about its Brexit plans says Government officials #just dont know# how the new arrangements will work.Royal Dutch Shell is not ruling out moving its headquarters from the Netherlands to Britain, the oil companys chief executive Ben van Beurden said in an interview with a Dutch newspaper.Anglo-Dutch consumer products giant Unilever said last month it plans to ditch its dual Anglo-Dutch legal structure and create a single entity in Britain.Van Beurden did not explicitly say Shell wants to move its headquarters, het Financieele Dagblad said.#You always need to keep thinking,# Shells Van Beurden told the newspaper. #Nothing is permanent and of course we will look at the business climate. #But moving your headquarters is not a trivial measure. You cannot think too lightly about that.#A Shell spokesman confirmed the CEOs comments to Reuters and said the company was looking at ways to simply its dual structure, as it had been doing for many years. The England and Wales Cricket Board has approved an increase in overseas players in domestic cricket from next year and will now allow two per side in four-day and -over cricket.Teams are currently allowed to field only one imported player, though foreign-born players with British passports and those on Kolpak registrations have not counted towards the allocation.The effects of Brexit mean Kolpak deals will be terminated at the end of the postponed  campaign meaning those players # as well as those who have had deals cancelled this summer due to the coronavirus pandemic # will now have a greater chance to earning deals.The move was recommended by the performance cricket committee, chaired by Sir Andrew Strauss.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The original post was later removed from Facebook.While one person re-posted it and commented: “So it starts… So so sad, why oh why do people do this it makes my blood boil,” another added: “And so it goes on… sadly people don’t think about the future everything is disposable including animals.”Indeed, the numbers of animals being cared for by the RSPCA has risen by more than , to , during the pandemic.And while , animals were reported abandoned to the RSPCA between June and August  – around  per cent of the total that year - they now fear that number will increase even more this year, as lockdown eases and people continue to struggle financially.While they’ve so far dealt with fewer abandonments, they fear the coming months will see a massive rise in cases.There has been a big surge in people buying puppies throughout lockdown, with celebrities including Mark Wright and Michelle Keegan as well as Love Island stars Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury even getting pups. Sadly, Tommy and Molly-Maes pet died just days after arriving from Russia. Mr Chai was the influencers birthday gt from the boxer, and they had already faced backlash for importing the pet.Just two days after his arrival, they realised that something wasnt right and took the pup to the vet - and were heartbroken when told hed had a seizure and passed away.While most people, like these stars, offer pets a loving home, its not always the case in other households.Dermot Murphy, head of the RSPCA’s animal rescue teams, tells the Sun: “During lockdown we’ve seen pets become a source of comfort and support for people and it appears many people have taken on new animals.“Fortunately during this time we’ve dealt with fewer abandoned pets however we are worried that as lockdown eases, peopleto work, go on holidays or struggle financially we will be facing a massive surge of animal abandonments.”The RSPCA saw a particularly tragic case when Penny, a heavily pregnant Jack Rusell, was abandoned in a box on June  in a field behind Bagshot Road in Chobham, Surrey.A dog walker discovered her after spotting his own dog frantically snfing under a bush.While Penny, who was covered in maggots and fleas, was rushed to a nearby RSPCA centre, it was too late to save her litter of puppies – with all of them dying just days later.The Millbrook centres deputy manager, Liz Wood, says: She looked gravely ill and was hardly responding to us.“We rushed her to a veterinary surgery where they discovered she was covered in fleas and maggots, was dehydrated and had critically low blood glucose levels.The vet team put her straight on a drip to get vital fluids into her little body. A scan showed Penny was carrying six puppies. Just a day after she was rescued, she gave birth, but very sadly none of the puppies survived.”Liz adds: Had she been taken care of properly all of her puppies may well have survived. Thank goodness Penny was found when she was, otherwise she too may not have pulled through.Dermot is now urging anyone struggling with their pet to ask for help, and says: Animals have been there to help us through the crisis, please don’t abandon them now.”Another -week-old pooch to be abandoned in lockdown was adorable lurcher Peanut, who was rescued by \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Birmingham Dogs Home.Peanut was found cold and starving, with a painful hernia, after being dumped on a railway line near Wolverhampton.The charitys digital marketing officer Rachel Frost tells Sun Online: “He had a small umbilical hernia, he was very cold and very hungry. He just wolfed his food down.“The problem with stray dogs is we have no idea about their background, we don’t know why he was dumped. He wasn’t chipped, there was no collar, so there’s nothing we can do.“We had him checked over, de-flead and everything, and now we’ve fostered him out to one of our trustees.She says while there hasn’t been a major increase in owners ing lockdown pets yet, they’re concerned it could happen – particularly when puppies grow up and become dficult to handle.“We get a lot of dogs coming in to us when they’re adolescent age,” she says.“They’re cute when they’re a little puppy but when they start to get a bit bigger, maybe the consistency in training hasn’t happened, and they get a bit unruly.“It could be that down the line we have that problem – it is a concern.”Animal charities are now urging any new owners to think very hard before making the huge commitment of purchasing a dog – with one recently ed to a \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"PDSA centre after just a week with his family.Lurcher Buddy was bought through Facebook during lockdown, but was then left outside their Portsmouth animal hospital a week later – as his owner struggled to cope with him.PDSA vet Sean Wensley recalls: “We were able to make contact with the owner through social media and she was honest and said she hadn’t made the right choice and she was struggling to cope.“She said some of the dficulties she was having with the dog were exacerbating some of her existing mental health problems. Quite a sad story.“She was able to consent to signing the dog over to us.”They eventually discovered Buddy’s owner had a cat and, due to his high prey drive, he was chasing it round the house – putting its le in danger and worrying the owner.“His owner struggled to cope with the situation alongside her own mental health battles and even considered putting Buddy to sleep,” the PDSA explains in a statement.Sean says the potential for more lockdown pets to be abandoned or ed as owners go back to work is a concern for them.“From our perspective, we have a long-standing initiative where we try to ensure people make the right pet choice for them,” he says.“You’ll potentially have a pet for many years, and it can be fantastic and rewarding.“But it really comes down to asking the right questions and doing the right research to make sure you get the right type of pet for you and your family, and you make sure you get it from the right type of place – so you’re not unwittingly supporting illegal imports.”PDSA is now urging people thinking about getting a pet “to think P-E-T-Sto seeyour situation is suitable for the pet you’d like, before you take one on”.Animal welfare charity \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Blue Cross says their biggest concern now is puppies that were bought during lockdown may not have had chance to socialise with other dogs – making them more unruly when lockdown lts.The charity fears many younger dogs will get “freaked out” when seeing more people in masks, so they’re urging all owners to get them used to it as soon as possible.They said in a statement: “Usually, new puppy owners would socialise their pet by meeting lots of people, attending puppy classes and exposing them safely to a wide range of situations and environments – all almost impossible under lockdown.“Without these key experiences, training and guidance from a young age, puppies can develop behavioural problems as adult dogs and Blue Cross is concerned many will become abandoned by the time they reach adolescencetheir owners cannot cope with their ‘bad’ behaviour.”In , the charity says  dogs under  months old were handed over to them after owners could no longer cope with their behavioural issues. They now fear that number could soar with puppies in lockdown.Animal Behaviourist Claire Haynes, who is fostering her own dog during lockdown, says: “For a happy, confident adult dog, owners need to introduce them to all sorts of places, people and other animals – especially now we can take them on new adventures and days out further afield.”While Battersea hasn’t seen a rise in abandonments or s of pets so far, Rehoming  Welfare Manager Claire OHagan says: “Getting a pet at any time is a long-term commitment and it’s vital everyone is aware of this.“If youre thinking of getting a dog during lockdown, research your local rescue centre first.”The RSPCA has now launched \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"an emergency appeal to continue its vital rescue work as lockdown eases.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That now looks like a very unfortunate explanation. He has straightforwardly shot himself in the foot.It was Maxwell who introduced Andrew to Epstein. It was Maxwell who was Andrew’s guest at Buckingham Palace last summer. And it was Maxwell whose house was the venue for the infamous photo of Andrew with his arm round the bare midrf of young Virginia Roberts who says she was a sex slave for Epstein and a bit of flesh to service his important friends.Andrew told the BBC he went all the way to New York to break off his friendship with Epstein, by then a convicted paedophile. And then stayed for four days at his swanky Manhattan house where he was given a dinner in his honour.Oh, and shortly afterwards Epstein handed over £, as his contribution to the Help The Fergie Fund. It’s a very odd way to end a friendship.Epstein may have died in prison – no doubt very conveniently for lots of famous and powerful people – but it has not stopped the calls for prosecutions of those connected with Epstein, and the calls for justice from Epstein’s victims.The FBI have made it plain they want to talk to Andrew. But he seems determined to keep as far as possible away from them.Geoffrey Berman, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, told reporters earlier this year that Andrew had so far given zero co-operation.Lisa Bloom, representing the women who say they were abused by Epstein, called Andrew’s refusal to answer questions ‘a slap in the face’ for the women.Yet the pariah prince was at it again yesterday, insisting he has in fact offered to co-operate.Well there is a very simple way of finding out who is telling the truth. Let him publish the letters and emails he has sent to the US law enforcement agencies and we can judge for ourselves.Overall, Andrew has done more to undermine the British royal family than any other living person. He is the gt that just keeps on giving for those who want to replace the monarchy with a republic.When local councils earlier this year were told to fly the flag for his birthday there was uproar. The Sun captured it perfectly in its front page headline: Union Joke.Meanwhile a Yougov poll revealed that only  in  have a favourable opinion of him. The only surprise is that it was that high.Horrendous as all the Epstein and Maxwell stuff is, that is just one item in the charge sheet against Andrew.There is the calamitous way he damaged Britain’s image abroad over many years as our trade envoy as he went round the globe insulting those he came into contact with and belting out his saloon bar views, views very often the exact opposite of agreed government policy.Diplomats called him His Buffoon Highness for his mixture of arrogance, rudeness, ignorance and stupidity.There is his outrageous use of helicopters, often to get to golf courses, and private jets when commercial flights would do - all charged to the taxpayer.There is all the dodgy company in dodgy countries he has kept – nasty dictators, outright crooks, alleged torturers, even a convicted gunrunner - some of whom he has accepted gts from, and some he even weaselled into Buckingham Palace, so tainting the Queen with his dubious associates.There is the wealth he has amassed from questionable sources, whether through shady offshore companies, using a  name, Andrew Inverness, or direct from his dodgy friends.What a stroke of luck that he was able to offload his old house, Sunninghill Park, which had been on the market for years at £ million, to Timur Kulibayev, the billionaire son-in-law of the Kazakh dictator, for £ million.Mr Kulibayev never moved in, the house sat empty for a further nine years before being demolished.

On at least one occasion he threw stuff on the ground and told them to “f---ing pick that up.”Or there is the casual racism, using phrases like “n----- in the woodpile” which he denies though plenty heard it, or making a jaw-dropping and hugely tasteless joke about camels at a state banquet for the Saudi royals.

But, this time, don’t head straight back indoors after the clap. Linger in the street, talk to your neighbours, perhaps pop by to say hello to someone who has been on their own during lockdown.We want people to thank each other.On my road there have been a lot of people putting notes through the letterbox saying, “If  you are self-isolating and need help, please call this number”.I now know who my postman is, partly because I am working from home, and I check in with him and have a chat to see how he is. I will be at No Downing Street with Prime Minister Boris Johnson to applaud the NHS and carers on Sunday.Afterwards there will be a barbecue with the NHS staff who looked after the Prime Minister when he was in hospital with Covid-.Hopefully, there will be a moment to address issues of how to look after our NHS workers properly.

The big aim was to save lives and protect the vulnerable.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesI doubt it occurred to many parents that schools would be closed for nearly FOUR months, and counting, or that they were about to take a pivotal role in educating their own children.But that is what has happened. And I know from friends with school-aged children that it has been, shall we say, a bit challenging.So I want to dedicate this column to the hundreds of thousands of parents who became home-educators overnight — with a particular shout out to the “lucky” ones who had to do this while also doing their regular jobs.Trying to educate your child, with no idea of when schools will reopen, and at the same time as trying to do justice to your day job, is seriously hard and my hat comes off to all of you.Now that the UK is slowly unlocking, there are many working parents who face the prospect of having to go back to their jobs.Some have children back at school until the end of term. But it is fair to say that no one is in an ideal situation.It has been a slog for everyone — and what we all need is a holiday. But with all the chaos and uncertainty surrounding trips abroad, and most UK holiday homes and campsites now already booked up, many of us will have been lucky to plan any kind of trip.More pressingly, many of the children’s holiday clubs people rely on are closed. After all, try telling a bunch of seven-year-olds to stay socially distant during a game of football.Many families rely on grand- parents to fill the childcare gaps during school holidays.But even though restrictions have eased, lots of grandparents will have underlying health conditions that make it unsafe for them to venture out.They will be stuck at home, missing family and unable to help out with childcare.In short, there is an army of working parents out there, already on their knees after four months of combining school and work, who now face their kids having seven more weeks off school, with no structure and support.What are working parents to do  This is a really tough situation for families.There are some basic things that parents can do to make le easier — and right at the top of that list is to lower your standards.Very few things are so important that they cannot wait until tomorrow. No one died because the house was not Hoovered.One thing I do know is that when you are working all the hours God sends and looking after kids, “me time” is almost impossible. But when you are firing on all cylinders, it is all too easy to burn out.So my advice for this particular Sunday is this — try to find even just one hour to go for a walk or meet a friend.Or find a corner where no one can bother you, and read a book, do some yoga, have a bath and pour yourself a cup of tea or a glass of wine.The rest of the world can go hang while you recharge your batteries and live to fight another day.Parenting is the hardest job in the world at the best of times. It does not come with a manual or instructions. It is relentless and you get very little thanks.The rewards are happy, healthy, balanced adults — but that comes -plus years later.If you are struggling, remember this — it will pass. Meanwhile, take it a day at a time and hang in there. You are doing a sterling job.The BBC has found the perfect solution to lockdown filming, with their revival of Alan Bennett’s Talking Heads series of monologues.No need to worry about social-distancing with a cast of one.And Killing Eve star Jodie Comer playing a part first performed by Julie Walters in the s in Her Big Chance, was brilliant.She is a fantastic actor, as we well know from Killing Eve, and this performance demonstrated her versatility, too.Did you see those pictures of Loose Women star Nadia Sawalha, who is , stripping down to her underwear If you did, then you may well have uttered the word: “Why ”But she wanted to show what women really look like, and to demonstrate the power that a filter, camera angle and ious other cunning techniques can have in efforts to make women look more “perfect”.When you think about the multiple images of “perfection” that women are subjected to daily, you realise that unless there is a visible antidote to this – actual evidence that real women are not perfect after all – we will never change the pressure we are under.So, good on you, Nadia.This was a successful attempt to highlight the degree to which the camera does, indeed, lie – but also the pressure we are all under to distort normality.I know many people who look great in photos but normal in real le.That feeling of need to alter your image can be a sort of self-hatred. It also fuels others’ need to airbrush themselves, so that all of us risk becoming unrecognisable in real le.The problem with altering your image is that you are fooling precisely no one.What is far better is to love yourself, no matter what you look like.Seeking adulation from people you don’t know and will never meet is a fool’s game because it will never, ever pay idends.It’s so easy to indulge in regret – but this is also a fool’s game.Anyone tempted by its lure needs to take a leaf out of Pierce Brosnan’s book.He said this week he has “no regret” after being told over the phone that he was being replaced in his role as James Bond.The actor, now , had his last outing as  in Die Another Day in  – and although he was eager to do a fth film, producers decided they wanted to reboot the role.Instead of feeling bitter and resentful, he said: “There’s no regret. I do not let regret come into my world . . . it just leads to more misery and more regrets.”Pierce is one of those actors who really has mastered the art of growing old gracefully – a le goal for all of us.He is a gorgeous man and comes across as a genuinely nice guy.Oh, and judging from recent photos, he could still play Bond now.I know many people have been disappointed they are having to scale back plans for big summer weddings.If you’ve been arranging the biggest and best day of your le, you might be wondering whether it’s better to just postpone altogether.For what it’s worth, I have some advice. It really is just a day. Yes, it should be lovely but it’s not the wedding that is important – it’s what happens afterwards.By that, I mean the rest of your married le together.It’s easy to get caught up with expectation and convention but maybe this is a chance to think about what you really want and what matters to you as a couple.You may also realise thatyou marry at the moment there can be no first dance – a tradition surely conceived during the s when couples don’t have sex before marriage – and a cause for celebration.The local lockdown in Leicester is a stark reminder that the next few months, and maybe years, could bring plenty more of the same. Anywhere.When this does happen, we will all have to do our bit.But hearing garment manufacturers in Leicester saying it will defy the city’s lockdown shines a light on what, for some, is the nub of the matter – for so many people, lockdown equals a loss of income.They cannot afford to lose any more money, evenit means putting lives at risk.That is going to be a real problem. But staying open “evenit puts lives at risk” is a cavalier and dangerous attitude.If you own a factory, it is your job to make sure your workers are safe.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But Hong Kong was British for  years, from  to , and it was handed back to China on the understanding that Hong Kong’s unique freedoms would remain unchanged for  years. One country, two systems was the promise.China has trashed that promise. There is one country now — tyrannical communist China where you kowtow to the party line or face the consequences. It is now illegal to sing the wrong song in Hong Kong. It is now a criminal offence to carry the wrong flag. Demanding basic human freedoms that we take for granted — and were also the norm in Hong Kong — will now get you jail time without even the pretence of anything resembling a fair trial.As the free world struggles with crashing economies, soaring unemployment and horric corona­virus death tolls, communist dictators are reverting to the law of the secret police and kang­aroo court, the baton and tear gas and terror.The old men in Beijing love to say that outside agencies are interfering in Hong Kong’s internal policies. But the simple truth is that the young people of Hong Kong — all born after the Union Jack came down — have grown up with freedoms that are un­known on mainland China. They do not want to live under a soul-destroying communist regime.That is why, at every attempt to roll back their freedoms and make Hong Kong as servile as every other part of China, the youngsters of Hong Kong have taken to the streets to protest in their millions. That is why riot police are currently arresting children in Hong Kong. Because they want to be free.President Xi’s National Security Law allows communist China to crush dissent in any way China sees fit. Likewise, President Putin’s referendum marginalises the millions of Russians who would love to see the back of the floundering KGB hardman.Millions of ordinary Russians and Hong Kongers have seen their freedoms eroded this week.And although the UK has problems of its own, we should do everything in our power to stand up to these old communist thugs who rule Russia and China. Don’t do business with them, for starters. And when teenagers are being rounded up on the streets of Hong Kong, we should not be asking a Chinese tech firm to build our mobile network.British history teaches us you can never appease a murderous bullyEnraging Beijing, a poll shows the British public are in favour of offering Hong Kong residents holding British National Overseas passports a home in the UK.So much for a post-Brexit UK that closes its borders to the world.So much for the racist, intolerant, xenophobic country we are supposed to be.This has been a rotten week for freedom. But in the darkness, there is a light — the decency, generosity and tolerance of the freedom-loving British people.And it is a light that will never go out.KATIE BOULTER, the golden girl of British tennis, says she is spending the cancelled Wimbledon fortnight watching the BBC crime series Killing Eve, which stars Jodie Comer – who many suggest is Katie’s doppelganger.The blonde bombshell of the baseline, above, says: “My brother recently said that to me. He was like – you definitely look like her. You’ve got to watch this box set. It’s unbelievable!”I do hope Katie is not disappointed. No series ever went downhill as fast as Killing Eve.The first series was great.Then Phoebe Waller-Bridge bailed out and the second series was mediocre.

Dickens’ experience of watching a hanging at Newgate informs the end of Oliver Twist, when Fagin is hanged – it is only in Lionel Bart’s cheerful musical Oliver! that Fagin gets to dance off into the sunset.With his profound sympathy for the oppressed, the average Victorian would have considered Charles Dickens decidedly “woke”.The character of Fagin in Oliver Twist – my favourite Dickens novel – is meant to be evidence of Dickens’ racism.But Fagin is Jewish – there is nothing anti-Semitic about his portrayal.Has this elderly Green Party graffiti artist actually read any Dickens  If not, he doesn’t know what he is missing.Nobody  has created the range of dazzling characters that poured out of Dickens’ imagination – Scrooge, Fagin, Oliver Twist, Miss Havisham, Mr Bumble, the Artful Dodger, Bill Sikes.Every writer in the English language lives in the shadow of Charles Dickens.This big-hearted genius enriched the language, the world and the imagination of generations.Calling him a racist is pig ignorant.Dickens lived and died in Victorian England.Expecting him to think exactly like a st-century Twitter user hardly seems fair.In fact, it hardly seems sane.THE UK and Japan are both tea-drinking monarchies.

Many could be thrown on the “scrapheap” and those trying to build a new career will find it tougher than ever to get a foothold on the jobs ­ladder.The impact of unemployment will blight their future, as the knock-on effects — including hopelessness and alienation — will last a letime.The Government has a simple choice this week: Either invest now to ensure youngsters have the training and skills needed to meet the challenges ahead, or we will all pick up the pieces later.That means laying the ground for real apprenticeships and work ­experience, with proper jobs at the end of them. There should be more opportunity to continue learning, developing the knowledge and skills required to land a job or, better still, become a future entrepreneur.We should seize the opportunity to create new jobs in the regions by regenerating the North and the Midlands, including tackling climate change, housing and construction, and the added social care challenges of supporting an ageing population.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"The Chancellor should also work with business and the trade unions to recruit , employers willing to assist, by offering them incentives and subsidies, including help with National Insurance and pension contributions.Additionally, existing underspends and the Apprenticeship Levy, together with potential benefit payments, should be topped up to create a £billion fund to meet the challenge of a record ­million under-s predicted to be out of work by Christmas. This is not just a matter of hard-headed public policy.It is about the lives of every inidual and their chances of building a future for themselves, developing a family of their own and contributing to their community. It is about what ­happens when aimlessness turns either into apathy or, more likely, into what my grandfather would have described as the danger of “idle hands”.History has taught us that society begins to unravel when young men without prospects, stability or the capacity to provide a role model become an unattractive prospect as a lelong partner.The future is grim when young women feel that they alone carry the responsibility of nurturing a child, and when a lack of prospects and progress to something better leads to a “live today and to hell with tomorrow” attitude.Former Conservative minister Lord Willetts has written and spoken convincingly about the danger of the generational ide.His honest reflections of how the austerity measures put in place in  hit younger people hardest, and how the protected ­pensions of the past, combined with the enormous rise in property values, have placed the majority of older people in a more favourable place to face the future showed great insight.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Young people lack the prospects of a secure job and either owning their own home or affording the rent.That is why we should face this challenge head-on and invest now, or we will pick up the cost later.In , during the early days of the New Labour government, our New Deal for the young unemployed offered four options.Not surprisingly, the bulk of young people went for either jobs with ­training attached or full-time education, which would lead to much better prospects of holding on to a job with decent earnings.Another lesson learnt, including in -, was that much of what needed to be done should be localised.The tendency to over-centralise ­everything has bedevilled us in this crisis.From the failure to devolve test-and-trace to local government through to months of ineptitude in ­getting our children back to school, the Government has classically created a central bureaucracy then blamed it for failure.While it has done the right thing in investing money in recovery ­programmes for our children over the winter, astonishingly, it failed to put any money in for recovery for those  to -year-olds in further education in sixth-form colleges.These are the young people whose vocational training and practical ­opportunities for work will be vital both for the economic recovery and for their own chances of getting a job.After all, you cannot promise a ­guarantee of apprenticeships or work experiencea business has folded.The Government needs to work with and listen to young people, employers and those in education and training.Unfashionable as it is at this moment to talk about universities, it is crucial that those capable of taking up such opportunities should be supported in doing so.If we don’t, they will be the ones who take the jobs of those less qualied and less confident.The result is simple.

I’ve missed the chance of watching a film in peace - so a day before the big reopening, I booked tickets online.There was limited choice - and nothing new.For now, it’s mainly nostalgic offerings such as Inception and a k restoration of The Empire Strikes Back. Around  films have been available to England’s cinema operators including The Wizard of Oz, Harry Potter and war drama .I scroll through my options which include Back to the Future and Beauty and the Beat and choose Bohemian Rhapsody, a  biological drama about Freddie Mercury which I hadn’t yet got round to seeing.I book and pay for my tickets online - tickets only cost a fiver - and I am encouraged to pre-order and pay for a drink which will be ready when I arrive.When I arrive, there are one way systems in place to follow and there are still manned tills for those who just turn up, though screens have been erected to protect customer’s and staff. Hand-washing stations and antibacterial wipes are everywhere. At no point, am I asked to wear a mask. Public Health England have not made in mandatory given cinemas don’t sit face to face. Signs ‘encourage’ you to wear one, but it’s not enforced. Neither is my temperature checked.I stand in line to collect my drink and then look around to see what food options are in place.

Groups of teens and families going to see Paw Patrol.Toilets are open but at reduced capacity. Every other sink and cubicle are sealed off to make sure customers keep their distance. At busy times, you’d probably need to queue.I head into my film and sit in my pre-booked seat. You don’t have to sit by yourselfyou’re attending with members of your household, but must be at least two-metres apart from everyone . I’ve chosen a quiet showing - there are only three others in the auditorium.It’s actually quite nice having fewer people at the screening. There’s no munch crunch of others eating popcorn behind you and for the first time in months, I sit down and enjoy a film in peace.Did I put myself at risk by going  It’s hard to say and the public seem unsure about how safe it is to go right now, though some are clearly willing to take the risk.

Then, from August , the advice to shield ends completely. The exception is in Leicester, where current rules on shielding will remain due to a local lockdown. The ability to go outside and hug and kiss will be welcome relief for millions whose mental health has taken a toll. But charities warn there is too much dangerous ambiguity and people could have vital support withdrawn. Sick pay and a system of food deliveries will end on July  - which they fear could leave shielded people in the lurch. So what are the changes and what are the implications for you and the ones you love   From Monday  July, there are two major changes for all .million people who are shielding in England. Firstly, people who are shielding are able to join gatherings of up to six people outdoors. These gatherings can be from up to six dferent households - but anyone from separate households must maintain a -metre distance. This follows the rules that were unveiled for the rest of England from June .  Secondly, people who are shielding and live alonewill be able to join the apossupport bubbleapos system topair up permanently with one other household. They will be able to break the two-metre rule with people inside their bubble to hug and kiss. One of the two households - the shielded household - must be a single-adult household. The other household can have an unlimited number of people. What will change from August   From Saturday  August, the .million clinically vulnerable people in England will officially be told they no longer have to shield from the virus. It will bring to an end a period of isolation lasting more than four months. While they should strictly follow social distancing rules, they will be able to go back to workthey cannot work from home, and visit shops and places of worship. Will shielding support end on August   Not completely - but a lot of it will. The governmentaposs direct food parcel and medicine deliveries will end. Matt Hancock confirmed they “continue to the end of July”. And shielding people will no longer be paid Statutory Sick Pay - unless they develop symptoms or are told to isolate. That brings them in line with the rest of the population. The government claims help wonapost simply end at the stroke of midnight on July . NHS Volunteer Responders will still be able to help with collecting shopping or medication, a regular friendly phone call, or transport to appointments. Shielding people will also retain their priority for supermarket delivery slots. But Nick Moberly, Chief Executive of the MS Society, warned: “We are gravely concerned that certain key support measures – such as food packages and Statutory Sick Pay – will be taken away prematurely. Without this help, and with many people still terried of infection, for some the idea of normal le ing will feel more like a threat than an opportunity. WhatIaposm scared toto work on August   Itaposs up to you and your employer - not the government. This is likely to prompt a major row from campaigners who want guaranteed legal protection for workers. The government press release says: From  August, those who need to work and cannot do so from home will be able toto work as long as their workplace is COVID secure, adhering to the  guidance available. But it does not say what will happenpeople feel too frightened or clinically vulnerable to go back. And government sources confirmed this would be a conversation between a worker and their employer - rather than a set legal protection. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told employers: We expect you to do the right thing. Nick Moberly, Chief Executive of the MS Society, warned: “Those who now may have no choice but toto work must be given the right information so that – together with their employer – they can ensure their working environment is safe. We also need clarity on what ‘carefully following social distancing’ means in the real world, in situations like shopping or meeting friends. There is still far too much room for interpretation, and this ambiguity could put people in danger. So are shielded people now under the same rules as other people in England  No. Between July  and August , there are only specic changes. Shielding isnapost being lted completely at that point. Shielded people are still advised not to go to the shops, pubs, restaurants and bars. From August , shielding people are still advised to continue to follow strict social distancing measures so the rules are more or less the same as the non-shielded. But they are still at higher risk. Whatmy family already bubbled up with someone  in June   Then youaposre a bit stuck. Single-adult households in the rest of England have already been able to bubble up with one other household since June . But households are only meant to pick one bubble buddy and stick with that one, not switch around. This meansyou, a family of four, have already decided to bubble up with your non-shielded sister, you shouldnapost then bubble up with your shielded dad. Could I end up having to shield all over again  Yes,there is a second wave of the pandemic. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the shielding list will be maintained and “we stand ready to support people to shield againthat is what’s clinically required”. Mr Hancock also said there could be local shielding ordersthe virus flares up in one particular city. That has already come true in Leicester.

Today, on its nd birthday, we have the chance not just to celebrate it but to reflect on what it means to us. My mum was a nurse, but she was also very ill for much of her le. The NHS she served and loved was also her leline. When I remember the dedication and professionalism of the doctors and nurses who cared for her, I feel a deep sense of gratitude. It is what inspires me to fight for our health system, to ensure that kind of care will always be available to everyone. I know many others feel the same. The NHS means so much to so many. But in the last few months, as we have battled the coronavirus, it has become even more important. The impact of Covid- across our country has been devastating. Friends and families have been kept apart and tens of thousands of lives have been taken too early, including hundreds of NHS workers. At the centre of this storm, our NHS has been a rock. For every le tragically lost, many more have been saved by the actions of our NHS heroes.  I know it has been incredibly hard for those on the front line. Day in, day out, they put themselves in harm’s way to save others. We must never forget who our key workers are. For them, it’s more than a job. Their deep sense of public service and desire to help people in need shine through. They are the best of us. That’s why Labour supports those calling on the Government to make an immediate commitment to talks on a pay rise for NHS workers, and to agree this deal as soon as possible. The numbers of deaths are, at last, coming down. But Covid- has not gone away. The threat from the virus is still very real.  Throughout this crisis, the Government has been too slow. Too slow into lockdown, too slow to ramp up testing, too slow to fix the test-and-trace system and much too slow to get PPE to the front line of the NHS. The situation we saw in Leicester this week shows that the Government has still not got a grip on quickly identying and containing local outbreaks. We need to remain vigilant and do everything we can to protect and support our NHS.  That’s why Labour is calling on ministers to publish an NHS winter resilience plan, with free flu jabs for over-s, weekly coronavirus testing for NHS and social care staff, and proper stockpiling of PPE. The Government must learn from the mistakes made in their response to the virus so far and help the NHS prepare for winter. That includes facing up to the scandal that allowed the virus to ravage our care homes. We need to eliminate the virus from care homes before winter sets in.

Lawyer Charlotte, , had done a km run, a km walk and a session with a personal trainer when the niggling pain kicked in.Incredibly, her doctor made a house call to examine Charlotte, and he said it was most likely trapped wind or irritable bowel syndrome.But just an hour later Charlotte suddenly went into labour. She was about to give birth – yet didn’t even know she was pregnant. A wave of panic and mixed emotions swept over her but Charlotte still stayed cool. She phoned boyfriend Dominic – who was out on a run – then an ambulance. Dominic got back in time for Charlotte to give birth in just three pushes. But little Evelyn Rose was born breach and Charlotte suffered an umbilical cord prolapse, meaning her baby was starved of oxygen. Charlotte says: “I had absolutely no idea I was pregnant. The only signs were stomach cramps two days before she was born. “I thought I’d eaten something bad, or it was period pains, but I called a doctor on the morning before she was born, to be sure. “He visited and said I had trapped gas and IBS. Then an hour later, I went to the toilet and an umbilical cord fell out of me. I could not believe what was happening. “I got a sudden urge to push, then two little feet popped out. I was astonished, but I knew from watching One Born Every Minute that an umbilical cord coming out first is not good, because the baby is being starved of oxygen. “And a breach delivery is harder. So I knew that I had to push with everything I had. “I was strangely calm. I just knew I had to get our baby out.” Evelyn Rose was born in a corridor at Dominic’s flat in Amsterdam, where he and fellow Londoner Charlotte live. Dominic, , picks up the story: “We’d called an ambulance, but I saw the little legs and, at this point, it’s just me and Charlotte.  “I rang the emergency services back and said, ‘You’ve got to get here now, guys!’ Charlotte is standing there, holding on to the legs. She pushed once, and it was half way up the baby’s calves, she pushed again and it was up to the hips. “With the final push, the baby dropped out. Just three pushes. Charlotte grabbed her and passed her to me. She was really floppy and blue. Then we started chest compressions and tried to get air into her. “In the meantime, the ambulance crew turned up and started working on her.” Charlotte continues: “I shouted, ‘Oh my gosh, it’s a little girl.’ I’ve always wanted a little girl – a mini- me. I looked at her and she was so beautul, with dark curly hair. I shouted, ‘Is she alive ’ I really thought at that moment she was dead. Dominic had given her CPR that he remembered being taught in primary school. She was whisked away in an ambulance and we were taken in another. “I didn’t knowshe was alive or dead. Then the emotional rollercoaster started. As a woman who has just had a baby, your emotions are all over the place – I desperately wanted her to survive.” The couple – reeling from the shock of having a baby at all – faced an anxious wait to find outEvelyn was brain damaged. Charlotte adds: “Five days later, the neurosurgeon came back and said to the doctor, ‘Have you sent me the correct scan, because this baby’s brain is absolutely fine.’ She has no brain damage at all – a real miracle given the way she was born. We were so relieved, I burst into tears. We are so, so lucky to have her. She’s a dream come true. “Being able to hold her for the first time four days after her birth was the best feeling in the world. It felt amazing and so special.” Two-week-old Evelyn is recovering well and has been moved out of ICU and on to the children’s ward. To say Charlotte was stunned to become a mum is an understatement.  She had no baby bump and had been having regular periods. Evelyn’s arrival came after a worrying time for Charlotte, who was overweight in her s and feared that might prevent her having children. “I was  stone and my periods were very irregular, so I knew falling pregnant would be a struggle,” she says. In , after a diplomatic word from a friend, Charlotte joined Slimming World, started working out and lost a whopping st in  months – dropping from a size  to size -. She now writes a blog about her weight loss journey, called Slimming and the City, and shares exercise and recipe tips. In , she met Dominic on Tinder and embarked on a long-distance romance with the telecommunications company director, who has lived in Amsterdam for  years.  While they had discussed marriage and children, neither was prepared for the shock birth of baby Evelyn. Charlotte adds: “Because of lockdown, we’d been apart for  weeks, so when I got to Amsterdam three weeks ago, we had a lovely reunion. “Who could have guessed just a few weeks later we would be parents ” Luckily, Charlotte is not a big drinker and hadn’t been consuming much alcohol during her pregnancy. She exercised vigorously daily – running, indoor cycling, exercise classes – and travelled quite a bit too. She goes on: “I feel really guilty I didn’t realise I was pregnant, when I think of the things I have done while she was in my tummy.  “Crazy exercise, personal training sessions. All the travel. “I went to Dubai in February and ended up playing Uno and drinking Hennessey Paradis – which is £, a bottle – with Tottenham footballer Dele Alli on the flight. Luckily that was the only time I really drank. Drinking for me is a single glass of Prosecco on a Friday night. “I also had surgery when I was two months pregnant – a breast uplt and skin removal after losing so much weight. They did a pregnancy test, but it came back negative! “Two days before I gave birth, I started with a run, followed by a walk and an online training session. “Then I worked and cycled into Amsterdam to go to the pub. Two days later, Evelyn Rose was born. Our little miracle. I’m so, so proud of my body and all it has achieved.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dogs incredible transformation looking like","story":"NewsDogs incredible transformation from looking like bag of bones with rotting fleshWhen Nicola Owst stumbled upon a neglected dog trapped in a crate in a field, little did she know he would become a rescue project that would turn her le aroundShareCommentsByLouise Burke:,  JUL NewsPoor Buddy was in a terrible state when Nicola found him \", url\"News, views and top stories .

It was  April  when my friend Sally and I decided to take a trip to view a foal she’d seen for sale on the internet. Sally ran a stables with her husband Rob in Leicestershire, where I’d spent much of my teenage years living and working with horses. It was a bit of a mission to drive down the M in the pouring rain. We had to then weave through tiny B roads and muddy lanes to see this foal, but Sally was the type of person who would go above and beyond to give an animal a loving new home. When we arrived at the address, we both had a funny feeling in the pit of our stomachs. It was clear it was not a proper paddock – it was the grimmest, scariest place I’d ever been to. Two shady-looking men came out and showed us the six-month foal. I was horried to see it looked half-starved and riddled with worms. There wasn’t just one, but two of them. We quickly handed over the cash and coaxed the nervous foals into our trailer. Just as we were about to leave, I spotted an animal wedged into the back of a rusty metal crate. I crept closer to see whether it was even alive. The poor creature, squashed inside a cat carrier, was breathing faintly. His sad eyes were just slits in his bony, bruised face. It looked astrying to keep them open was causing him intense pain. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. His fur had worn away, showing his paper-thin skin over his bony rib-cage and face. His mottled flesh looked like it had been clawed at. He was barely alive. This poor dog had been trapped in his own waste and had obviously had no food or water for days. But what really hit me was the horrendous smell – a combination of rotting flesh and faeces. His little paw pads were burnt and red raw from standing in his own urine. It was unbelievably sad. I didn’t think twice about rescuing him. I swaddled him in a towel and took him back to our x. His legs buckled from underneath him as I carefully placed him on my knee. On closer inspection, I could see he was covered in mange – a nasty infection caused by mites that burrow under the skin. I had to save this poor creature from these horrible people. ‘I’ve got you, Buddy,’ I said to him. The name stuck. We made a sharp exit from that hellhole.  I knew exactly who to call on when we got home – Ian, the local vet, who had tended to the horses at the stables for years. He examined him straight away. Sitting on the examining table in the veterinary practice, Buddy resembled a bag of bones. Ian confirmed he was a Staffordshire bull terrier, probably not even a year old. I watched over Buddy as Ian checked him out. You’d think he would be frightened of me and the environment, but I think he was relieved. The way he looked at me made me think he was grateful to be saved. The vet diagnosed him with demodectic mange. Because he’d been left in his own mess, he’d got secondary infections and his skin was rotting away. Armed with a bag of antibiotics and care instructions from Ian, I took Buddy home. That first night I bathed him gently in the kitchen sink, then I didn’t sleep a wink, constantly checkinghe was breathing. It felt touch and go at times… We took everything slowly. I introduced small plates of chicken or scrambled egg to him so as not to upset his stomach, and gave him just enough exercise in between lots of sleep. If I’m honest, the Staffy breed hadn’t always appealed to me. I had it in my head they were aggressive dogs. But I couldn’t have been more wrong. He is the most loving, kind and loyal dog I’ve ever come across.  Over the following year, Buddy grew stronger and his infections cleared up. I made a point of socialising him even in puppyhood. He was my number one in le, and he soon won the hearts of those close to me. At the stables, Sally’s mum, Phyllis, who we called Gran, had a special bond with him. Instead of running around in the fields, playing with other dogs, he’d prefer to curl up on the sofa with Gran. When she was diagnosed with diabetes, he wouldn’t leave her side until she had her insulin. He’s very intuitive. When it came to finding myself a partner, it was a case of ‘love me, love Buddy and my horses too’. I was lucky to meet Jon through work, and he took us on as a package. To find a man who was happy to love us all meant the world. Of course, we had Buddy as a guest of honour at our wedding in . He had a special outfit for the pictures – my great auntie who has since passed away, made him a fancy collar to match my bridesmaids. Our le as a family of three was going smoothly until Buddy was diagnosed with cancer in March .  It happened the same year I went through two miscarriages. It was a very traumatic time. In a way, him being ill shted the focus away from me. I channelled any emotional energy I had on him getting better. And after numerous rounds of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, he made a recovery in October . The following autumn, I fell pregnant with my son Toby, who is now three.Before Toby arrived, we got another dog, a springer spaniel called Susie, who was rescued from a puppy farm where she was a breeding bitch for three years in a shed. I still haven’t quite worked my magic on her, she can be nervous, whereas I can take Buddy anywhere, and do anything. He’s so well-behaved. I feel like I have a lot to thank Buddy for. I’ve experienced so many things in my le because of him – we’ve been to dog shows like Crufts and won awards, met celebrities like Martin Clunes and Christine Lampard, and have a fantastic circle of friends we’ve met through Buddy, who we holiday with twice a year. Who would have thought that poor, neglected dog I first saw in the cage could have turned my le around for the better  "},{"url":null,"title":"boozy super saturday mayhem streets","story":"NewsSuper Saturday mayhem in streets as pubs reopen sparking more local lockdown fearsThere was no social distancing in Soho, central London, as streets were rammed after pubs were allowed to reopen, and police across England were kept busy dealing with fights and other troubleShareByChris KitchingSenior News Reporter:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video super-saturday-sees-london-rammed-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news boozy-super-saturday-mayhem-streets-\"\", url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

As Englandaposs pubs reopened for the first time in three months, police had to break up fights and deal with other trouble while some revellers overindulged on so-called Super Saturday, which one top cop said was as busy as New Yearaposs Eve. Those who were lax in observing social distancing or caused trouble have been condemned, with the scenes stoking concerns that England could see a surge in cases after restrictions were relaxed. But the governmentaposs critics say the responsibility rests with Boris Johnson and ministers over their position that it was safe to reopen pubs on a Saturday during summer, even though experts have warned that pubs are superspreading hotspots. The government has warned a spike in Covid- cases could result in more local lockdowns such as the one currently in place in Leicester. The decision to reopen pubs came under fire as photos showed hundreds ignoring social distancing in places such as Soho in central London, and revellers looking worse for wear, with some slumped in the streets, during a night out despite Covid- still posing a danger. As Twitter users hit out at the scenes, one wrote: These pictures were inevitable expected the goal when pubs opened. Are you sure weaposre not being manipulated to blame these guys for any second wave, rather than directing it at the decision makers  Another tweeted: Government lost all authority since Cummings incident, noone is listening anymore. Blatantly obvious people werenapost going to adhere to rules with pubs, as most of us know, after a few drinks most rules go out the window. Welcome #SecondWave. A third said of the scenes in Soho: I am all for people going out for a few drinks but this is ridiculous! I am pretty sure pubs were allowed to re-open but social distancing rules still apply! Thanks to this bunch of numb nuts we are probably gonna have to go back into lock down as a second wave is a definite!Similar concerns have been raised over VE Day gatherings, huge crowds at beaches, parks and beauty spots, thousands of protesters attending anti-racism and far-right protests, and illegal raves and block parties. The latest figures show the R rate range has risen above  in London – meaning cases of the virus could be growing again. In the capital, the range is believed to be between . and .. The estimated R number across the UK is said to be between .-.. In the aftermath on Super Saturday, John Apter, the chairman of the Police Federation, said drunk people are unable to properly socially distance. It was crystal clear revellers would not adhere to the one metre plus rule as restrictions were eased on Saturday, he added. Mr Apter was on sht in Southampton, Hampshire, where he dealt with naked men, happy drunks, angry drunks, fights and more angry drunks. There were a lot of situations where police had to take care of people who were so drunk they couldnapost take care of themselves. Mr Apter said: What was crystal clear is that drunk people canapost wonapost socially distance.It was a busy night but the sht managed to cope. I know other areas have had issues with officers being assaulted. Some police forces had signalled they were apprehensive about theof pubs on a Saturday and said they were expecting problems. In some places, their fears came true. Staffordshire Police Chief Constable Gareth Morgan tweeted: Drink  drunk related calls now increased signicantly across @StaffsPolice - feels like NYE - as ever majority able to follow the rules but signicant number cannot. For those working this Saturday doesn’t feel that Super...Pubs  staff prepared well for tonight, worked hard  majority had busy but manageable evening night. Overall demand @StaffsPolice equivalent to pre Xmas NYE - busiest up to midnight. In Nottinghamshire, police responded to trouble at pubs across Mansfield, Sutton-in-Ashfield, Arnold and Newark. Windows were smashed and at least one person was assaulted as police dealt with several incidents of anti-social behaviour. Four people were arrested and five pubs decided to shut early in a bid to prevent any further trouble.  Police said three pubs in Mansfield and Sutton in Ashfield, plus two in Arnold and Newark , closed. Inspector Craig Berry of Nottinghamshire Police said: Officers were quickly on the scene to deal with a number of alcohol related anti-social behaviour reports including a smashed window and minor assault. As a result four arrests were made by officers and we supported licensees who chose to close their own premises. No pubs have been closed by the police. Weaposd like to thank the majority of the public who have acted responsibly throughout Saturday, especially whilst watching the much-anticipated Derby v Forest match.  Devon and Cornwall Police said they had received more than , reports over the so-called Super Saturday, most of which were drink-related. In Leicestershire, police were granted a dispersal order to send people away from Market Harborough town centre after reports of anti-social behaviour. The order was in place between pm on Saturday ad am on Sunday. Images from Soho in central London showed packed streets into the early hours of Sunday with revellers ignoring the one-metre plus social distancing rule which was introduced on Saturday. One man who passed through the busy streets told : Walking down old Compton Street felt like wading through a Petri dish.  Photos showed carnage in the streets in London, Manchester, Bristol, Leeds and Newcastle. Rafal Liszewski, a store manager at Clonezone on Sohoaposs Old Compton Street in London described crowds in the area on Saturday night after pubs were allowed to trade again as out of control. Saturday started very easy. But you could feel tension in the air, the -year-old told the PA news agency. Around pm crowds started to arrive... quickly everything got out of control and by - pm it was a proper street party with people dancing and drinking. Barely anyone was wearing masks and nobody respected social distancing... to be honest with that many people on one street it was physically impossible.  Mr Liszewski, who is originally from Poland but now lives in Finchley, estimated there was between two and three thousand people on the street but his shop was only allowing seven customers at a time. Pubs were allowed to reopen from am for the first time since the lockdown began in late March after Boris Johnsonaposs government decided it would be safe to do so. Many reopened at am or am and there wasnapost an immediate rush, but venues became busy in the afternoon and through the evening, when trouble flared. It was estimated , pubs would reopen and customers would sink  million pints from Saturday. Nik Antona, the national chairman of the Campaign for Real Ale , said feedback from branches suggeted up to half of pubs did not reopen. Many licensees criticised insufficient notice from the government and were taking a wait and see approach, he added. The National Police Chiefs Council had issued a joint appeal with the hospitality industry calling on drinkers to behave responsibly when pubs reopened. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and government experts had urged people to stick to the rules on Super Saturday to avoid creating a second wave of coronavirus. But critics expected Mr Johnsonaposs calls to fall on deaf ears after similar pleas were widely ignored earlier in the lockdown. Matt Hancock said the vast majority of people who went out on Super Saturday in England did the right thing, and the Governmentaposs message to the public is enjoy the new freedoms, but do so safely. Asked when the Government should begin learning lessons from its response to the pandemic, Mr Hancock told Sky News: Well we are learning all of that all of the time, looking at what works and what needs improvement.

The number of excess deaths in the UK since the coronavirus outbreak began is just above , after little change from a week ago. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show , deaths above the five-year average in England and Wales between March  and June . Over the last  weeks since the first Covid- death in Scotland, the number of excess deaths was ,. In Northern Ireland, there have been , excess deaths since its first Covid- fatality, announced on March , was registered. Together, this means the total number of excess deaths in the UK since the outbreak began stands at ,. There are fresh fears of a second wave of Covid- and new local lockdowns after the lockdown was eased in England on Super Saturday. Hundreds of revellers ignored social distancing while drinking and partying in places such as Soho in central London, and there were scenes of carnage in the streets as police dealt with fights, public nudity, vandalism and other trouble.  Photos show police helping people who were slumped on the floor and too drunk to take care of themselves. Health Secretary Matt Hancock claims the vast majority of people who went out on Saturday in England did the right thing. Ahead of the easing of lockdown restrictions in England on Saturday, Mr Hancock had warned that people could end up behind barsthey got too carried away. Speaking on Sky News on Sunday, Mr Hancock said: Well I think that from what Iaposve seen, although thereaposs some pictures to the contrary, very, very largely people have acted responsibly.  The large proportion of people, the vast majority of people are, I think, doing the right thing. However, he added: But of course weaposll take action when we need to when...the minority break the rules. On those who did not social distance, Mr Hancock said: Well weaposll of course keep this very closely under review, and youaposve seen for instance in Leicester but also in other places that we donapost shirk from bringing in more drastic measuresthat is whataposs needed to control the virus. The health service may have to deliver its biggest-ever flu immunisation this winter as a second wave of coronavirus remains entirely possible, the NHSaposs chief executive has said.

In the aftermath, John Apter, the chairman of the Police Federation, said drunk people are unable to properly socially distance. It was crystal clear revellers would not adhere to the one metre plus rule as restrictions were eased on so-called Super Saturday, he added. Mr Apter was on sht in Southampton, Hampshire, where he dealt with naked men, happy drunks, angry drunks, fights and more angry drunks. He said: What was crystal clear is that drunk people canapost wonapost socially distance. It was a busy night but the sht managed to cope. I know other areas have had issues with officers being assaulted. Some police forces had signalled they were apprehensive about theof pubs on a Saturday and said they were expecting problems. In some places, their fears came true. In Nottinghamshire, police responded to trouble at pubs across Mansfield, Sutton-in-Ashfield, Arnold and Newark. Windows were smashed and at least one person was assaulted as police dealt with several incidents of anti-social behaviour. Four people were arrested and five pubs decided to shut early in a bid to prevent any further trouble. Police said three pubs in Mansfield and Sutton in Ashfield, plus two in Arnold and Newark , closed.Inspector Craig Berry of Nottinghamshire Police said: Officers were quickly on the scene to deal with a number of alcohol related anti-social behaviour reports including a smashed window and minor assault. As a result four arrests were made by officers and we supported licensees who chose to close their own premises. No pubs have been closed by the police. Weaposd like to thank the majority of the public who have acted responsibly throughout Saturday, especially whilst watching the much-anticipated Derby v Forest match.

Instead, the former solicitor has gone on to tackle some of the world’s most physically challenging races and has never let his degenerative condition stand in the way. Alex, now , has ­completed the ­notoriously tough Marathon des Sables in the searing heat of the Sahara Desert, pulled a lb sled across the Arctic in temperatures of -C and run  miles through the Amazon. Since , he has successfully ­completed  marathons and challenges. And the dad of three didn’t let up during lockdown either. He spent  hours a day for a whole week climbing ,ft – more than double the height of Mount Everest – using just his stairs to raise money for charity. So far, Alex’s amazing feats of physical endurance have raised more than £, for Parkinson’s UK and more than £, for charities worldwide. He says: “I have learned to accept the bad days, and give my all on the good. I want to raise £million for Parkinson’s UK in the hope of better treatments or even a cure one day.” Fitness fanatic Alex was diagnosed with Parkinson’s in  after he noticed his little finger moving involuntarily. Following a series of tests, he was told he had the incurable disease, which develops when cells that produce ­dopamine in the brain stop working and are lost over time. In the UK, around , people are living with Parkinson’s and a further two people are diagnosed every hour. There is no cure for the le-changing disease, and sufferers are forced to live with the knowledge that they will slowly lose control of their body as the ­illness progresses.  Alex recalls: “When the ­neurologist told me it was Parkinson’s, my le suddenly felt meaningless. “I was devoid of hope and my diagnosis weighed on me from the moment I woke to the moment I fell asleep. “My twitching finger was a constant physical reminder of the battle I couldn’t fight and wouldn’t win.” But after months of ­feeling both anger and ­despair, Alex realised that he couldn’t ­wallow. Instead, he focused on his work as a lawyer and ploughed all his energy into athletic events he’d planned to do ­before his diagnosis.  Alex continued training for the Marathon des Sables – a -mile race across the Sahara Desert, known as the “toughest footrace on the Earth”. During the event, Alex got lost and had to be rescued by local tribesmen. He then became seriously ill and had to pull out of the race due viral pericarditis – an ­infection of the sac surrounding the heart. Alex was ­gutted he had to quit, but still ­managed to raise £, for charity – which made him realise that his global adventures could really help other people. He says: “This led me to the MillionMetres challenge, which ­involves running, hiking, ­cycling, climbing and rowing ,km.” In , Alex ran  miles across the Alps in  hours, ­surviving on just  minutes’ sleep. And the following year, he ran from London to Rome via Brussels and Paris in  days.  In , he became the first person to cross America using four dferent disciplines – cycling, running, climbing and rowing – covering more than , miles in just  days. He also ran  miles across the Dolomite mountains in Italy and  miles of the Colorado Rockies. More recently, in , Alex took part in Fiji’s -mile Lost Island Ultra before completing the London Marathon a fortnight later. He also trained for Primal Quest in Canada – one of the toughest adventure races in the world. Despite suffering broken ribs, a concussion and a bulging disc in his spine, Alex and his team completed the challenge in four days and five hours. Later this year, he hopes to take part in Racing the Planet’s -mile six-stage ultramarathon on Namibia’s Skeleton Coast. Alex is also hoping to secure ­sponsorship to become the first person with Parkinson’s to climb Mount Everest for real – a challenge he hopes to have professionally filmed.  But in the meantime, from July , he’ll be ­running a -mile ultramarathon in  days for Parkinson’s UK in his home town of Wantage, Oxfordshire. Although Alex does his best to stay fit and healthy, the physical symptoms of his condition sometimes flare up, which he finds ­dficult to deal with. “When I have to walk like a robot or lose my voice, my world feels ­intrinsically smaller,” Alex says.  “It really affects my confidence to be a part of society ­because I don’t want the world to see my symptoms. “I know others with Parkinson’s feel this way, too.” It is this feeling that drives Alex to continue with his epic fundraising ­adventures around the globe. He says: “Being physically restricted at times has taught me to be resilient. “That doesn’t stop me feeling angry but I use that anger and hatred for Parkinson’s to do ­positive things, such as raising money for research. “This ­disease can zap your self-worth but you can keep doing what you want to do, evenit means finding an ­alternative way of doing it. “I have hope in better treatments for Parkinson’s being discovered.

Wolverhampton’s cases grew by . per cent in the ten days to July , with Dudley’s up . per cent. These rates are higher than Leicester which saw a . growth in the same period. Official stats show there have been  Covid-related deaths in Dudley and  in Wolverhampton. Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College, said: “The new model picked up Leicester as a consistent hotspot back on June . With our data now flagging up potential new hotspots, it will allow for greater surveillance and focussed testing that could detect problems like Leicester earlier and reduce major lockdowns.” "},{"url":null,"title":"government responsible 10000 covid 19","story":"NewsGovernment responsible for , Covid- care home deaths due to lack of testsEXCLUSIVE: Community Integrated Care CEO, Mark Adams, believes number could have been halved with earlier testing and says plans for weekly tests in England are too little, too lateShareCommentsByAlan SelbyGrace Macaskill :,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsMark Adams, chief executive of Community Integrated Care, has slammed plans for weekly tests in England as too little, too late \", url\"News, views and top stories .

Mark Adams, chief executive of Community Integrated Care, believes thousands would have been saved – and has slammed plans for weekly tests in England as “too little, too late”. To date, Office for National Statistics figures show , care home ­residents have died with Covid-. And Mr Adams’ claim suggests some , could still be alivea robust testing regime had limited outbreaks. Accusing the Government of abandoned residents, he said: “If the priority had been, ‘Let’s just test everybody that’s coming into contact with vulnerable people’, you probably would have more than halved the number you lost in a care home, and maybe even made it a fraction of what it has been. “The Government clearly started off thinking, ‘We’re all going to get this, there are going to be about , people who die’. They’re mainly going to be old people who potentially might have died anyway and they might even save the NHS and local authorities moneythey pop their clogs early’.” Mr Adams spoke after regular testing was finally announced for care home staff in England. He said without twice-weekly testing, care homes and supported living homes would be left completely unprepared for a second, third or fourth wave of the virus. He stressed that twice-weekly testing is needed to stop infected staff bringing Covid- into homes – with residents tested by local public health nurses rather than carers. Mr Adams said: “Dealing with ­vulnerable and confused people who might have dementia, that’s a horrendous experience for them to go through. You really need to have experienced nurses doing the testing now.   “Our organisation has  nurses across  locations. But a great many social care environments are run where you don’t have nursing staff – you have highly trained care workers.“The test has a % failure rate just on the science. But thenyou add the human error into that there’s a risk. The ideal scenario is public health teams would have a dedicated team who visit care homes.” Mr Adams warned the toll could rise much higherthe Government fails to also boost testing in supported living environments. He said: “We talk about the , in nursing and care homes. There’s , in supported living. “The fact that they’re in a dferent building doesn’t mean the complexity of their condition has changed. Every time the Government pats itself on the back about gradually getting its act together five months too late, they’re talking about care homes and nursing homes – they’re not talking about this army of people who are waiting to have support themselves.” Charities have also demanded beefed-up testing for agency staff. The ONS found infection rates were higher in homes that used agency staff who worked across several sites. Professor Martin Green, chief executive of Care England, added: “Regular and routine testing is criticalwe are to garner a better understanding and keep at bay this virus. This initiative needs to be rolled out to all care homes, including adults with learning disabilities and also supported living.” "},{"url":null,"title":"iconic british buildings turn blue","story":"NewsNHS anniversary: Iconic British buildings light up blue to celebrate NHS heroesAhead of the nd birthday of the NHS on Sunday, a moment of remembrance was held for our frontline heroes who lost their lives battling coronavirus this yearShareCommentsByJamie Hawkins:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video downing-street-lit-up-nhs-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news iconic-british-buildings-turn-blue-\"\", url\"News, views and top stories .

This weekend is marking the biggest thank-you yet not only to the NHS and key workers, but also to all those in the community whose support has helped us get through the pandemic. The events will reach a climax with a nation-wide clap at pm on Sunday when people are being asked to come out again on their doorsteps or stop what they’re doingto applaud and then spend some time with neighbours and friends to reflect on those connections that continue to strengthen our communities as we move into the next stage of the crisis. Brits have put a candle or a light in their window to remember all those we have lost to Covid-. At pm the Dean of St Pauls lit a candle on the West End portico of the cathedral in London. Landmarks all across the country have been lit in NHS blue, supported by the #LightItBlue campaign. Number  Downing Street is lit up and a candle is placed on the doorstep to remember the hundreds of key workers who have list their lives during the pandemic.Windsor Castle, where The Queen is currently staying, is also lit in blue this evening.  Kenilworth Castle is another building paying tribute to the NHS. They tweeted: Tonight, weaposre supporting the NHS and Togetheraposs Moment of Remembrance. We remember those we have lost and pay tribute to NHS staff, key workers and everyone who has played their part during the pandemic. #lightitblue#thankyoutogether.  The famous clock at Londonaposs Waterloo station is also lit up in blue, the colour of the NHS. Lordaposs Cricket Ground tweeted: Weaposre lighting the Pavilion blue tonight.On the weekend of @NHSEngland aposs birthday, weaposre joining with other landmarks from across the UK to #LightItBlue as we remember those we have sadly lost during the pandemic.The Eden Project in Cornwall, the windmill in Lytham St Annes in Lancashire, the arch at Wembley Stadium and The Royal Albert Hall are some other iconic venues to also light up blue tonight. And across the country, members of the public have lit candles and placed them in their windows in paying tribute to our heroes. One person tweeted: #NeverForgotten#LightItBlue for those we have loved and lost due to COVID . Another said: Remembering those we have sadly lost during the pandemic. Shining a light in my window #LightItBlue#ThankYouTogether. Thinking about all those who are no longer with us... Light a candle #LightItBlue#NHS#NHSBirthday, another said.  The Covid- outbreak has been the greatest challenge the NHS has faced since it was founded on  July . Premier League stars and match officials applauded healthcare professionals and other key workers before games kicked-off on Saturday afternoon. At pm on Sunday, broadcasters will suspend normal transmissions to encourage everybody to stop what they’re doing and join with othersin their streets or neighbourhoods to applaud not just the NHS and other key workers but all those who have volunteered or helped keep services and community networks going. Sir Simon Stevens, NHS Chief Executive, said: This year has been the most challenging in NHS history, with staff displaying extraordinary dedication, skill and compassion to care for the , patients with COVID- who needed specialist hospital treatment and many others besides. During this testing time our nurses, doctors, physios, pharmacists and countless more colleagues were sustained by the support of the public, not least through the weekly applause for key workers. No health service, not even the NHS, could have coped alone with this coronavirus pandemic. From bus drivers and teachers to care staff and food retailers and, of course, the public who took action to stay at home to stop infection spreading, everyone played their part. The NHS’s birthday this year not only offers the opportunity for us to say thank you to the nation, but for us all to come together at pm to pause and recognise all the work which has taken place in the last months and say a heartfelt thank you. The clap for carers at pm on a Thursday night became an established ritual during the Covid- plague – and a focal point for unity among neighbours, streets and whole towns. The idea for this weekendaposs tribute came from the newly founded Together coalition, which includes the CBI, trades unions, the Scouts and Guides. Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, said: “ My sincere hope is this weekend will serve as a powerful moment of remembrance, thanks and connection, as we come together and commit to helping to create kinder, closer more connected communities.” Others supporters include UK Sport, Clap for Carers founder Annemarie Plas and Baroness Doreen Lawrence. Ruth May, chief nursing officer for England, said: “Throughout its history the NHS has brought the whole country together, treating everyone based on need not ability to pay. So we’re honoured the Together coalition have chosen the NHS birthday to pull the country together.” Kwame Kwei-Armah, director of the Young Vic, said: “At a time when there is so much emphasis on what ides us, giving thanks and connecting with our communities is one of the things that unites us.” The last official Clap for Carers event was held on May .

Hand sanitiser was passed out to the guests and the coupleaposs witnesses had to sign the register, at St Georgeaposs Church in Leeds, with separate pens. But Heather and Tom finally wed, nearly four months after they had first intended to marry. Their original plans - a lavish ceremony in front of more than  guests at Greyfriars Kirk in Edinburgh - had to be axed because they were scheduled days into the lockdown back in March. Speaking from their home in Leeds, the devout Christians said: It wasnapost what we had planned but it was completely unique and really special. I know everyoneaposs wedding day is memorable but this one feels particularly memorable. Indeed, photos show some of the  or so guests wearing face masks in the church. Each seat in the building had a name label on the back to avoid people sitting down where others had sat.  Tape was put on the floor to help guests adhere to social distancing measures too. Heather, who is a PhD student, said: aposEveryone at the church has been so wonderful. They deep cleaned the church and set up a webcam so other friends and family could watch from home.

In documents lodged at the High Court this week, the Duchess of Sussex has insisted she was left “unprotected” by the Royal Family while pregnant with son Archie. It’s the latest salvo fired in her continuing fight with a newspaper over published extracts of a letter she sent to dad Thomas. And the stress of their new le is also said to be taking its toll on Harry who is missing the close bond he once had with his brother Prince William. The relative of Meghan, who does not want to be named, told the Sunday Mirror: “She has gone very quiet. I think she is likely to be feeling extremely low and probably struggling.  “The legal battle and the increased tension it’s created with the royals due to the information that’s coming out has to be putting a lot of strain on them both. “Meghan’s been a lot more distant and introverted over the last few weeks – her family is worried. And Harry must be tormented by his fractured family ties. He was particularly down on William’s birthday on June .” This week it emerged -year-old Meghan has named in court papers five friends who gave an interview to US People magazine defending her and criticising her father.But she denies authorising them to do it.  She insisted her friends spoke to the magazine only because they were worried for her. Meghan also claimed she had been the subject of numerous damaging and distressing articles, with Kensington Palace ordering her to say nothing but “no comment”. Her legal document stated: “As her friends had never seen her in this state before, they were rightly concerned for her welfare, specically as she was pregnant, unprotected by the Institution, and prohibited from defending herself.” The couple quit as frontline royals in January to move to Canada before settling in Los Angeles. Meghan is suing the Mail on Sunday for publishing extracts from the handwritten letter she sent to her father Thomas, , in August . It was written three months after he was unable to walk her down the aisle following a heart attack. The former Suits actress claims the letter was private.  The newspaper says Mr Markle wanted its content published to correct any  impression her friends had given about what it contained when they gave their magazine interviews. Meghan has identied one of her five pals, Friend A, as the person who told People magazine the letter said: “Dad, I’m so heartbroken. I love you. I have one father. “Please stop victimising me through the media so we can repair our relationship.”  In court documents Meghan claimed this was an “unfortunately inaccurate” portrayal of her letter, insisting many times she had known nothing of her closest friends’ decision to go public. Her friends now face the prospect of having to testy on oath in the High Court that this is true. Meghan is also believed to have been hit hard by her spat with long-time pal Jessica Mulroney who was caught up in a race row last month.

Clips posted online show joyful people celebrating and engaging closely with those around them. However the Government had advised Brits continue to keep one metre apart from others despite allowing bars and restaurants to reopen on Saturday July . One man, who passed through the busy roads, told : Walking down old Compton Street felt like wading through a Petri dish.  And that was at about :pm. Not much chance to socially distance even just walking down the street. Another video shared online shows a man twerking against a car trying to navigate through the crowds. The twerker is moved on but the car struggles to get through Soho as other drinkers move into the road. In each video, police officers are seen but signicantly outnumbered by the drinkers. But police had warned Saturday night would be as busy as New Yearaposs Eve for forces across England. Nevertheless, the ugly scenes sparked a furious backlash on social media.  One shocked woman wrote on Twitter : Just seen scenesSoho pubs... my heart goes out to those health care workers and their families who died of Covid to save the rest of us... disgusting lack of respect. And one man shared video of groups gathered in the streets, writing: Soho lockdown is over. Another fumed: Just seen the scenes in Soho. Itaposs asthe health care workers who risked their lives trying to deal with the pandemic were just wasting their time. And Borough Market, also in the capital, was heaving with drinkers pictured sipping foamy pints. They too were bunched together on the street.  Experts predicted pub-goers would sink a staggering  million pints at , establishments across England on Saturday alone. Some opened their doors at am to accommodate the demand. But prices for beer, wine, cider and spirits were hiked as pubs, including Wetherspoons, desperately tried to make up for lost business. Nevertheless, people were queuing to get in some pubs across England. There was a wait of around an hour just to get inside The Regal, a Wetherspoon in Cambridge.

These are teachers abrogating their responsibilities in favour of making money. I feel sorry for the talented, hard-working teachers who have thought up imaginative ways of teaching pupils during lockdown and whose efforts have been undermined by these few rotten apples. But Omar, a full-time mathematics teacher, was adamant moonlighting would not clash with commitments at a secondary school.He was exposed as part of a Mail on Sunday investigation, which saw an undercover reporter pose on a website as a prospective parent.Omar said: At the moment I am working from home due to Covid-, hence the all day [availability].  He gave no comment to the publication when the reporter revealed their identity in the end. Pavan, a maths teacher at a Birmingham secondary school, was also exposed and has since deleted her online account for work. She was reportedly adamant his £ hour-long tutorials would not hamper her main job. Yes I’m able to do school hours depending on time and day. I teach via Zoom. One-to-one at GCSE is £, she said. I am going into school but not everyday – we are on a rota basis –some days from home some from school. So Wednesday Thursday will work well for me.

John Burns, , went from working as a vet in Carmarthenshire to launching his £m business and is now one of the richest men in Wales. His interest in animal health and human health in the s sewed the seeds for his niche business Burns Pet Nutrition. After prescribing medicines to poorly animals that were not curing the problem John decided to create his own nutritional pet food for dogs, cats and rabbits. In its early stages, he would sit with his family around the TV pouring cupfuls of rice into bags which he would sell from his car. His product has since become Walesapos biggest pet food business based in Kidwelly, producing around , tonnes every week. John, from Whitland, said: I thought this was going to be big news, a vet making his own pet food. Johnaposs first ever recipe and bestselling product today was developed in  using simple ingredients including chicken, oats, peas and brown rice. He spent just £ on a box of plastic sacks as packaging and said he wasnapost fussed on colour. From his initial production of two tones of dog food in , John soon expanded to  tonnes and today around , tonnes are produced every week. He said: I didnapost have proper packaging. It just came in a plain polythene bag and I designed the leaflet and a label to go on that polythene bag. So you can imagine what that looked like. It was a very unappealing appearance. As a young vet in the s, John could have been described as alternative and was eating brown rice for breakfast long before it was served up in hipster cafes. Originally from the west coast of Scotland just south of Glasgow, he arrived in Carmarthenshire in  after qualying as a vet and worked at a practice in Whitland. He said: I can remember the very first caesarean I ever performed on a cow was by torchlight in the middle of the night. Even at that stage I was seeing health problems in pets like itchy skin or ear problems. When antibiotics or drugs were seen as the answer, John would advise clients this was not curing the problem and question the cause. He said: I thought aposwell thataposs not what veterinary science ought to beapos. Not for me anyhow. I read an article about acupuncture and thought that looked promising at solving recurring health problems. John left Whitland in  and enrolled in a human acupuncture course while working as a locum vet which in turn led to his interest in alternative medicine and nutrition. He began to reasonit worked for humans, then it would surely work for dogs. John said: Basically the traditional way of eating for humans had been abandoned by the modern world and had become high in meat and animal products with hardly any cereal grains or vegetables. Part of the thinking was that many health problems had been caused by abandoning our traditional way of eating – things like cancer, diabetes and obesity. Rather like humans, obesity in pets is the most common issue affecting health. John moved back to Llanelli and began telling clients in his practice that, while he would treat their animal with drugs, they should stop feeding their animals conventional pet food.  Instead, he advised starting their pets on a wholemeal diet of brown rice, vegetables, and meat in equal portions. But after a few years of trying to get his message across, he realised the only way was to make the pet food himself. John said: It was a job to get hold of quality brown rice back then. Itaposs not like now, although even today itaposs hard finding high-quality brown rice in west Wales.Armed with his perfect formula, John criss-crossed the country looking for a manufacturer who would make the food for him and eventually found one in Llandovery in . He said: The incubation period of my business was not far off  years. I wish Iaposd done it earlier, perhaps, but it might not have been right back in the s. People might not have been ready for it. Wholesalers had initially warned John nobody would buy his product and he was advised to develop his local contacts instead.  He changed his ambitions and instead of rolling it out nationally, he drove to local vets and pet shops and sold his pet food from his car. John said: Before I knew it I had a one-man business which was doing okay. The young vet sold his practice and moved into a bungalow in Kidwelly with his we and their two young children. The family would sit around the TV putting cupfuls of food in bags and sticking on labels. He said: I had to make a go of it. I decided to concentrate full-time on the pet food business."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons cambridge super saturday queue","story":"NewsWetherspoons Cambridge has Super Saturday queue one hour long as English pubs reopenPunters queued up outside The Regal, a Wetherspoons pub in Cambridge, this afternoon after the Government relaxed coronavirus restrictions allowing boozers to reopen on what has been dubbed Super SaturdayShareCommentsByMatthew Dresch:,  JUL NewsCustomers flocked back to Wetherspoons in Cambridge today to celebrate Super Saturday \", url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

She had received a notication through her Nest doorbell while she was out that somebody had been to the door, and the device also sends her footage for home-monitoring and security. The video she was sent had no audio, but when she ed home she reviewed the full clip to work out why the driver had fled so quickly after the aposweirdapos incident in Delaware. And she quickly learned her young son had been behind it, having snuck a very unique set of delivery instructions onto the Amazon order. Before the order went out for delivery, under a box titled aposDo we need any additional instructions to find this address apos, her son had written: No but knock on the door  times and scream abra cadabra as loud as you can and run super fast away. Incredibly, the clip shows the woman place the package on the porch before banging on the door and screaming the magical phrase before jumping down the steps and sprinting back to her van - exactly as instructed.Itaposs had more than two million views and , shares after Lynn posed it on Facebook, along with a screenshot of her sonaposs instructions, with the caption: Thank you to this great Amazon delivery woman! Apparently, my youngest son had put some aposadditional instructionsapos for delivery and she went along with it.

She was often excluded from playing because she either couldnapost physically join in or other children left her out.Mr Hartman spoke to other parents to seean amusement park existed that catered for children with special needs - and he was unable to find one.Having recently retired from property development, Hartman set out to build a park designed with special needs in mind, that intended to bring everyone together. When the Texas, site opened in , it was the worldaposs first fully accessible theme park, created to be inclusive for people of all impairments and disabilities. Morganaposs Wonderland is entirely wheelchair-accessible and features more than  interactive attractions including rides, playgrounds, and picnic areas.Among the rides are an accessible ferris wheel, a train, and a carousel. There is also a wheelchair swing giving children in wheelchairs a chance to experience a swing - maybe for the first time ever.  Children can also use special diggers to access the sandpit and there is a sound garden with built-in instruments for musical fun. It took Hartman three years and million to open Morganaposs Wonderland, and it is now a globally renowned attraction for those with disabilities and their families.

The creatures have suddenly collapsed into heaps on the ground since the start of May in the Okavango Panhandle region.The government is yet to explain what has happened to the animals but has ruled out poaching, as all the carcasses have remained intact. But National Park Rescue is concerned at what it believes is slow progress. Mark Hiley, co-founder of National Park Rescue, said today: Elephants began dying in huge numbers in early May and the government would normally respond within days to an event of this scale. Yet here we are, months later, with no testing completed and with no more information than we had at the start.Mass elephant deaths on this scale are almost unprecedented, certainly in Botswana. A potential correlation between these and the coronavirus pandemic is yet to be ruled out.Youaposre not going to be able to get the elephants to do social-distancing, and youaposre not going to be able to inoculate them, Chris Thouless, head of research at Save the Elephants, said.  But the professional doesnapost believe authorities are dragging their feet. He continued: This is pretty remote country, hearing about the carcasses, getting in there, taking a whole range of samples, knowing how and where to get them from, ... that is a pretty dficult task. Mmadi Reuben, principal veterinary officer in the Department of Wildle and National Parks, said: A government investigating team has been on the ground since the first cases were reported. Botswana responded swtly.

Some countries given the green light from July  still have their borders closed to British tourists, and holiday firms claim utter confusion is putting people off from booking a trip. Only  of the  approved destinations are open to British arrivals without any restrictions, with some countries forcing travellers to undergo health screening at airports or provide up-to-date test results proving they donapost have coronavirus. Confusion over air corridors and restrictions means airlines are planning their schedules hand to mouth and holidaymakers should brace for flights to be cancelled or changed. Travel industry leaders hit out at the government for publishing contradictory advice for holidaymakers - the Department for Transportaposslist of approved destinations conflicts with guidance from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office . They have called for a single list of countries where there are no restrictions for Britons. Noel Josephides, the chairman of Sunvil, told the Sunday Times: It is highly confusing for travellers. We have two dferent sets of advice it is very odd. Itaposs as though government departments donapost actually speak to each other. All we want is one list. Travel consultant Paul Charles, from the Quash Quarantine campaign, claims Britons were being put off from booking trips abroad. He said: There is utter confusion: the two lists do not tally and consumers are going to be extremely confused. Currently, people have to check both lists, the government website for entry requirements and also contact the country they want to visit to make sure the information is up to date. The DfT published its travel corridor list of  destinations, plus  British Overseas Territories, on Friday. English travellers can visit without having to quarantine for  days upon their . Australia and Canada, for example, are on the DfTaposs list but both remain closed to British arrivals.  The Cayman Islandsapos borders are still closed to people who are not citizens or legal residents. People who arenapost citizens will have to quarantine at a government facility for  days at their own expense. Direct flights to Greece are banned until July . Visitors to Austria will have to provide a negative Covid- test that is less than four days old. In the Bahamas, the test result must be less than  days old and passengers must undergo a temperature check.  In addition to restrictions, British travellers also have to worry about their flights being cancelled or changed. Airlines expert John Strickland, director of JLS Consulting, told the Mail on Sunday: A number of airlines are planning their schedules on a very short term, hand to mouth basis. Several airlines have planned flights and put them on sale, only to find that Government policies and regulatory conditions in one country or another have meant that it is not possible to operate and have then had to cancel them and go back to square one. I don’t believe airlines are deliberately or maliciously cancelling flights. The colour-coded traffic light system decides which countries are considered safe to travel to.  Green is given to approved countries, amber is for countries considered less safe, and red means passengers ing from those countries will need to self-isolate for  days. The DfT published a list of  countries and territories where English tourists can visit without self-isolating on their . It features popular short-haul destinations such as Spain, France, Italy, Turkey, Greece and Cyprus, as well as long-haul locations including Australia, Barbados, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand and Vietnam. China, Portugal, Thailand, the Males and the US are among the notable absentees. The FCO published a separate list of  countries and territories which will be exempt from its advisory against all non-essential travel from Saturday, making it easier for UK tourists to be covered by travel insurance while visiting. Although the FCO included most of the places named by the DfT, among those missing are Fiji, Mauritius and the Seychelles. There are also some destinations which the FCO listed but the DfT did not, such as Canada, Estonia, Malaysia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Singapore and the Portuguese regions of the Azores and Madeira. Labour branded the measures a mess and said the Governmentaposs failure to negotiate air bridges was an indictment of their failure to tackle the crisis at home. Scotlandaposs First Minister Nicola Sturgeon acknowledged there are obvious practical reasons for alignment on the issue but criticised the shting sands of the UK policy.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

It shows contempt for those in the NHS who have risked their lives to save others. It shows contempt for those who have died without their loved ones by their side.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk.

Irsquove looked out my monthly cinema pass in anticipation of re-opening around July .I appreciate not everyone feels this way, but Irsquom ready to start living again. Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

Food factories and meat plants in the US, Europe and the UK have become Covid- hotspots. Most recently, a chicken plant in Anglesey, Wales, had to shut down when  employees tested positive out of a total workforce of .Expect the usual ldquoI told you so interpretation of this phenomenon from vegan propagandists who seize any opportunity to frame their usual suspect: meat production. But itrsquos not the type of food ndash animal or plant-based ndash these factories handle that creates the problem.One suspected cluster of cases, for instance, has occurred in a Chinese factory that manufactures crisps. Itrsquos the physical set-up.Food factories donrsquot do Doors Open Days, and for good reason. If we saw how the products we buy, so slickly presented on supermarket shelves, were produced inside such places, it would kill our appetite for them.When I was researching my book Swallow This, which investigates the processed food industry, I inveigled myself into several factories that supply the major multiples, and take it from me, itrsquos no mystery why people get ill working in such environments, or why they have such high staff turnovers. They are horrible places to work in. Food manufacturers want us to think that these factories are just like a scaled up version of a domestic kitchen. But they more resemble car plants and oil refineries, or even the missile-launching pad at the end of Dr No, where James Bond sabotages the efforts of a small army of operatives, lost and almost robotic-looking inside their bulky protective clothing.Whether theyrsquore turning out packs of chicken pieces or vegan lasagna, chilled food factories operate in similar ways. To inhibit the growth of dangerous food poisoning bacteria, such as campylobacter and listeria, the ambient temperature in most zones of food factories is bitingly raw and cold. It chills you down to the bone marrow. Covid- appears to love such conditions. So therersquos problem number one.Thanks to the sheer scale and heft of the machinery in these factories, the noise is deafening. Staff usually get given ear plugs, but when they do have to communicate, they have to shout. Shouting appears to increase the risk of spreading coronavirus problem number two.Problem number three  Letrsquos call it inadequate physical distancing because therersquos nothing sociable about standing closely on a factory line arranging vegan nuggets on trays, or checking that each jalfrezi barbecue skewer has the stipulated four chunks of meat.I wouldnrsquot last an hour in one of these places, let alone get through the demanding shts that workers typically put in ndash  hours isnrsquot unusual, sometimes nightsht. Thatrsquos problem four right there: factory workers have protracted exposure in circumstances where coronavirus flourishes.And that includes sharing tables in the canteen. The one I saw was small and intimate compared to the factory floor. Its dish of the day was bigos, the Polish meat and sauerkraut stew.Housing presents us with problem five. Staff often share living quarters ndash basic accommodation is frequently part of the employment package ndash and workers are bussed from there to the factory and back again after their sht. The Unite union says that staff often struggle into work when they feel sick because theyrsquore scared of their pay being docked.Bottom line  Yoursquod need a very strong immune system to work in one of these factories at the very best of times, let alone when coronavirus is around.This should give us pause to think. The industrial food system didnrsquot create Covid-, but its workplaces are a vector for it. Surely an essential requirement for any sane food economy should be that it creates safe jobs for the people who work in it "},{"url":null,"title":"cant-wait-revisit-five-pick-your-own-fruit-farms","story":"If lockdown has turned you into the next Mary Berry, why not go a step further and pick your own fruit for your baking.

The truth is that most residents are aware of and support the need for social housing and any potential for job creation, but that there are numerous other brown field sites in the area which would be far more effectively utilised and appropriate without damaging the environment, destroying bioersity, increasing traffic, pollution and scarring the landscape.Mr McKenna writes: ldquoa Facebook survey organised by the local community councilhellip showed that an incredible % of social media respondents opposed the development. Why does he use the word \"incredible\"  It is not incredible. This was the actual percentage.He then writes: ldquoThe developersrsquo survey indicated a clear majority in favour of affordable housing and the increased recreational space envisaged by the development but there is no exact figure given of this \"clear majority\" nor is there clarication that the developersrsquo survey asked these questions in a general context, not in one specic to the woodland site between Morrison Drive and Redhills View. He also writes: ldquoOpponents of the development have cited environmental and bio-ersity concerns. Yoursquore left with the impression that this is some kind of Scottish Serengeti and that Sir David Attenborough might soon be pitching up in the neighbourhood. As well as using an unwarranted derisive and sneering tone, as a writer he fails to assert the basic requirement of qualying the use of the \"you\" in \"yoursquore\". As with the use of \"we\" and \"us\" in writing, who does he mean  Who is the \"you\" The woodland area the developers seek to destroy, like all woodlands and gardens, should be maintained by the owners. But far from approaching Lennoxtown and being ldquogreeted by a small clump of overgrown woodland which blocks out the hills and one of the most magnicent vistas in west central Scotland, the substantial woodland is a green and beautul delight to be greeted by in all seasons and not only does it obscure nothing of the vista beyond, it enhances and adds to it.Overall, this article is steeped in accusations and statements which avert scrutiny and are unsubstantiated by sound, objective, balanced, clear evidence.Ilona Wewiorski , Lennoxtown.The broadband connectionTOM Gordonrsquos article ldquoDown to the wire ndashFears legal challenge may put brakes on rural rolloutstarts off as a factual account of the ongoing legal proceedings over the contract to roll out superfast broadband to the north of Scotland. However, by the end it has become a rant against the Scottish Government.At no point in the article does Mr Gordon point out that telecommunications, including broadband, is a UK Government responsibility. UK Government policy is, in general, to \"encourage\" telecommunications companies to make the investment in the expectation that they will get enough subscribers to make aon that investment. Where this is unlikely, for example, in rural areas, they will consider funding the investment. However, they have no objection to other bodies, e.g. the Scottish Government, local authorities, communities, funding investments. Any Scottish Government action is to compensate for the lack of UK Government action.Mr Gordon quotes Liberal Democrat MP Jamie Stone as saying ldquorural communities have endured years of delays and excuses on itsfailure to install much-needed digital infrastructure to equip rural areas with quality broadband ... businesses and residents in the north of Scotland deserve much better than this. Did Mr. Gordon not think it might be appropriate to remind Mr Stone that Alistair Carmichael, as Scottish Secretary, was responsible for implementing the UK Government broadband policy in Scotland from  to  and to ask him what he achieved  A ldquoScottish Conservative spokesman is quoted as saying ldquoThe SNP talks a good game on broadband for rural areas, but its action has been non-existent. Did Mr Gordon not think it might be appropriate to remind that spokesman that Messrs. Mundell and Jack have been responsible for implementing the UK Government broadband policy in Scotland since  and to ask him what they achieved Douglas Morton, Lanark.Stick over a stoneI HAVE just belatedly read Ron McKays Diary in your edition of June  and, in particular, his short report \"Pass me the Semtex\" and must express my disappointment at such a poorly considered account of an issue which is not straightforward, in contrast to the rather biased, uninformed way it was reported.Racism issues are always emotive and demand accuracy of reporting. However, I do not wish to do Rons homework for him but suffice to say: the Jim Crow stone is not named after the US segregation laws carrying the same name it was not \"coined\" by racist white American sailors and it is not repeatedly painted, cleaned and repainted, although there has been some defacement from time to time.Rons judgmental comment \"What is wrong with these people \" is unacceptable. He infers incompetence and racism on some of those involved without having established the full picture. His immediately preceding report \"Statuary offence\" seems reasonably balanced and researched, so why the prejudicial report on the Jim Crow stone Iain MacNaughton, Dunoon.Reform the NTSIN a world where sovereignty is repeatedly trampled on, there is a certain reassurance for us Scots that we are not alone in being a territorially-estranged people. Now the National Trust for Scotlandis taking to TV to effectively appeal for the help of the people of Scotland, whose name it carries with far less authentication than it does the numerous properties up and down the land in its proprietorship. One of these of course is the site of the battle of Bannockburn, the word \"battle\" often in its historical signicance bearing a capital letter B. The site is now subject to prolonged closure, ostensibly because of the current pandemic, and this has again brought the spotlight of controversy on the NTS.The appointment of an outspoken opponent of an independent Scotland, Neil Oliver, as NTS president in  sparked a spate of resignations from this body, and has effectively illuminated for many people the traditional role of the NTS, which in the glare of such controversies has been seen as a pillar of the establishment rather than a means of showcasing Scotlands past through its buildings and land use.In the many instances of Scotland being sold to highest bidders for chunks of its territory, echoes of The Clearances come loud and clear, and the same kind of echoes can be heard in this appeal for funding from an organisation that badly needs reforming into a body that will better embody the history of the people of Scotland.Ian Johnstone, Peterhead."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11545220.jpg?type=article-full","title":"ready-open-island-visitors-say-arran-locals","story":"With lockdown causing a huge financial blow to tourism on Arran, the island is now entering into its recovery phrase and says communities are ready to welcome visitors back safely in a bid to kick-start the islandrsquos economy and get people moving again.:Islanders call for guaranteed ferry spaces for medical appointmentsArran businesses such as retail shops and visitor centres have reopened this week, but many say tourism is now crucial to alleviating the impact coronavirus has had on local businesses.Lorna Mansfield is managing director and owner of Old Byre Showroom and Cafeacute Thyme on the island and says businesses will not be able to recover fully without tourists.She said: ldquoWe opened the retail side of the business and the play park on Monday and wersquore doing takeaway from the cafeacute but itrsquos so quiet because there arenrsquot any tourists.

But they are not allowed to travel more than five miles for leisure.\"This outbreak underlines the importance of following the rules.\"As as of Friday NHS Forth Valley, which serves a population of , saw a spike of ten in a week - with six reported on Friday alone. The rise over the week is identical to that in Scotlands biggest NHS board, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, which provides health care for more than four times the number of people.The Scottish Government says that the situation in Forth Valley was being monitored and contact tracing carried out.The latest analysis of Scotlands track and trace performance shows that despite an expansion in testing facilities - the carrying out of checks against capacity continues to flatline.Latest official figures show that while the Scottish Government has ramped laboratory facilities to meet its target to have the ability to do , daily tests across Scotland to deliver Test and Protect - it has been running in the past week at little over a quarter of capacity, with an average of  checks a day in hospitals, care homes or the community.

It also calls on each inidual island to decide the best route out of lockdown.Camille Dressler, chairman of the federation said there were worries about the \"pent-up demand from people down south\" will put communities at risk through a spread of Covid-.She said: \"This transition from lockdown is a very dficult time as people are having to balance conflicting demands. The fact is that the islands are having to respond to the very detailed instructions for re-opening safely facilities such as public toilets, restaurants and cafes, hotels and museum and that for many businesses these instructions are so demanding that they prefer not to open at all.\"Not every business will have the cash to invest in the new equipment or the extra staff that may be required.\"So the danger for many of the smaller island communities is that their safety - and particularly the safety of those who are more at risk - might be compromisedthere is a sudden influx of visitors that may be carrying the virus without knowing it.\"For this reason, many islands are reluctant to welcome day trippers or campers yet, whereas visitors staying in self catering accommodation are considered to pose a lesser risk, especially when there is limited health service available.\"This may appear as discriminatory to some, but hopefully this is something that most people understand.\"As a federation we hope that the public at large will help keep the islands special and safe, and understands that not all islands are ready to open up as fully as some would expect them too.\"She welcomed a plan on Orkney where tourists are to be given warning letters amid fears that the islands could open up to Covid- with the easing of lockdown.The letter has been produced by Orkney Islands Council and NHS Orkney ahead of the expected relaxation of travel restrictions in mid-July.It will be handed to passengers using NorthLink Ferries, Pentland Ferries and airline Loganair.OIC leader James Stockan said they hoped to have introduced an \"extra level\" of testing for the Orkney but said it has not happened.\"If we were doing that and we had a proper test and trace system in place on the islands, we could have opened up our economy much sooner,\" he said.\"We have tried right through the pandemic to engage with the government. We wanted to try testing people coming in to Orkney before they even embarked on their journey and then a week again a week after they arrived. That was turned down. We were left dangling.\"The chairman of the Arran Economic Group, Tom Tracey said Arran had been Covid- free for seven weeks and that the primary concern was to protect the health of islands.He welcomed moves by the local health and social care partnership to create and Arran-based Test and Track operation that will support the local population and the \"greatly reduced\" number of visitors.Last year Arran had , visitors contributing poundm to the local economy and employing  people. With Covid-, he believes that economic boost will be cut by more than half to poundm with a potential knock on effect on island jobs.\"Opening up to the outside world is inevitable and this undoubtedly carries risk and folks are naturally concerned. However, the best we can do is signicantly limit the visitors numbers, social distancing on ferries will do that, keep the community informed and prepare as best we can with information, best practice and Scottish Government and local health guidelines.:Scottish tourism at risk of total collapse\"Given all of the economics and employment issues, our primary concern remains the health of our community and by implication, our visitors.

Again, the Government is best placed to do that through local lockdowns, or guidance.\"Highland councillor John Finlayson, who lives on Skye said he hoped everyone from tourists to tourism operators will \"take seriously\" the responsibilities they have to \"prevent us having toto lockdown at a later date, which would be catastrophic for everyone\".\"The economy of Skye is hugely dependent on tourism and we need to be acutely aware of the importance of safety and risk assessments as we move forward,\" he said.\"Clearly advice from the Scottish Government is key to what can and will happen but there is also a need for inidual and collective responsibility in terms of how operators apply the guidance whilst also taking cognisance of what community feelings are.\"The majority of feedback I have received from across Skye recognises both the need for safety but also the need for le toto some sort of normality within a context of following the health and safety, social distancing and hygiene rules that are in place. \"Skye welcomes tourists and the suggestion that initially we only have staycation tourism is one that needs discussed but as with all kinds of restrictions around free movement, implementation of checks and who carries them out will be the challenge.\"Ferry passengers have been urged to wear face coverings aboard CalMac vessels, as the transport giant begins to increase services as Scotland gradually emerges from the Covid- coronavirus lockdown.Face coverings are mandatory when travelling on enclosed areas inside a ferry, and on other forms of public transport.The Shetland Tourism Association in a welcome message to would-be travellers said that while they may be looking for assurance about their safety, equally the community had some concerns that the virus \"may accelerate when we re-open tourism\".\"For everyonersquos protection, tourism related businesses have undertaken new risk assessments, applied higher standards of cleaning and changed their procedures to comply with the new Government advice,\" it said.\"Our members have been working hard to ensure safety for reopening this means investing in PPE, equipment, adapting buildings, training staff, or developing entirely new ways of working.

Even its centenary in  sparked city-wide celebration and praise for ldquoone of the brightest gems in Edinburghrsquos richly jewelled crown.Now, unoccupied for  years and costing around pound, a year to keep it watertight, it appears that - finally - Edinburghrsquos former Royal High School building is on the brink of a new beginning.The long-running and at times bitter saga that saw bold plans by joint developer Urbanist Hotels and Duddingston House Properties to turn the building into a pound million luxury hotel rejected by Edinburgh City Council followed by a y and expensive planning appeal, appears within touching distance of being resolved.ldquoReports on the planning and listed building consent appeals relating to the former Royal High School were received from the Scottish Governmentrsquos Planning and Environmental Appeals Division on  June, confirmed a Scottish Government spokesman.ldquoThe reports and recommendations from the reporters are being considered in detail, and decisions on the appeals will be issued in due course.However, its timing has sparked speculation over whether pressure to kickstart the economy by pushing ahead with major development projects may influence the final decision ndash orconcerns over the collapse in the tourism sector might push the hotel plan off the agenda completely.Terry Levinthal, director of Edinburgh heritage watchdog, the Cockburn Association, said the impact of Covid- on the tourism sector has diluted the argument for turning Hamiltonrsquos architectural gem into a hotel, even further.ldquoThe utter devastation of the cityrsquos tourism and hotel sectors as a result of the covid- pandemic is hugely distressing and has seen the virtual collapse of the industry as we know it today, he said.ldquoIn late  the Edinburgh Hotel Association reported that there was an over-supply of hotel beds based in the city, creating challenging trading conditions for all operators.ldquoI think itrsquos fair to say that these changes in the market and the huge impact of Covid- changes the business case supporting the proposed conversion of the royal high school into luxury hotel.ldquoWe advocate for Scottish ministers to actually recognise the potential damage to not only the buildings but to the reputation of the city as a world heritage city that these proposals represent and to refuse consent.On the other hand, David Orr, Chairman of Urbanist Hotels Ltd, said: \"lsquoWe remain ready to progress this long-awaited and signicant development and are hopeful for a positive outcome.\"The controversial hotel proposals for the building once mooted as a possible base for the Scottish Parliament, first emerged ten years ago after a council-run design contest to determine the future of the building was won by a proposal to create a  room lsquoarts hotelrsquo.The move followed seven years of limbo as The Hill Adamson Trust, backed by Sir Sean Connery, desperately tried to raise money to turn it into a photography centre inspired by pioneers David Octavius Hill and Robert Adamson who developed their skills at a studio at Calton Hill.However, within weeks of the councilrsquos decision, loud criticism emerged of the designrsquos potential impact, with fears over the risk altering a key historic building placed on Edinburghrsquos UNESCO World Heritage Site status, and complaints that it was \"fatally flawed\" and \"insensitive\".One planning chief went so far as to suggest it was ldquoone of the most abhorrent and the most ugly buildings that Irsquove ever seen.The plans were later revived to curb the size of the extensions and cut the number of hotel beds, however the city council again refused planning permission and listed building consent in August .Meanwhile, plans emerged from the Royal High School Preservation Trust and St Maryrsquos Music School to restore the building as the new home for an expanded national music school, with public concert hall and garden.Backed by figures such as author Alexander McCall Smith and violinist Nicola Benedetti, and with funding by Dunard Fund - believed to be one of the largest philanthropic gts to Scottish arts and education - the plans received Edinburgh City Council approval in .Despite the approval, the councilrsquos agreement with the hotel developers means the school would not be able to take over the building until .According to Clf Hague, chair of the Cockburn Association, more delays could cause further deterioration of the fabric of the building.ldquoThere are signicant question marks over just how the hospitality sector and international tourism are going to fare, he said.ldquoI think we have a strong case, but itrsquos whether the minister will see this as a stepping stone towards economic recovery. Therersquos also nothing to prevent the developer coming forward with another application, modying the design in light of changing circumstances.ldquoIt is conceivable that the music school could have been operating by now, anda further period of delay will be to the detriment of the fabric of the building.Meanwhile, Scottish ministersrsquo decision over the future of the old Royal High School will have a direct impact on hopes to create a world class music school in the city.A statement from the Royal High School Preservation Trust said: ldquoWe could start tomorrow, except for the intransigence of the hotel developers and an unseen contract they have with CEC which gives them the lease on the Old Royal High until . This contract is not publicly available.ldquoAs far as we know, as long as there is an appeal process ongoing, the contract remains in place, unless it is terminated by Scottish ministers.ldquoWe want the Government to support the aspiration to proceed with our plans without further delay.ldquoThis is no longer a local Edinburgh matter, but has become a national issue, it added.ldquoThis is a once in a letime opportunity with an iconic building, philanthropic funding and the chance to create a major cultural and educational hub coming together for the whole of Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"calls-ferry-clarity-islands-prepare-welcome-visitors","story":"As Scotland prepares to reopen for tourism, it is the second category that worries James Stockan.The leader of Orkney Islands Council has to figure out how to maintain leline services to what he calls ldquoour double insular places, the ones that take two journeys to get to.His concern  The need for social distancing has reduced capacity on the ferries which dart between Orkneyrsquos outer islands. And that means tourists who book could take the seats of locals who do not.Stockan thinks islands ndash not just his own archipelago ndash are going to struggle as Scots and visitors from further afield start trying to holiday again.Last week, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urged Scots to holiday in Scotland. But transport capacity may make that hard to do in the places where visitors ndash and their money ndash is most needed.ldquoWe have some real challenges with opening up tourism, including boat capacity, Stockan said.ldquoIf we donrsquot change the social distancing rules, when tourists start travelling the locals may not get on the boats when they are needing to go to the mainland for medical appointments or other urgent business.The mainland he is referring to is Orkneyrsquos, not Scotlandrsquos. It is connected to the outer islands by an airline and a ferry company, Orkney Ferries. Both services would normally be heaving with people at this time of year.Scottish Government rules mean passengers now have to be more spaced out and must wear face coverings ndash both on short hops to inner islands like Shapinsay and longer journeys to outer ones like North Ronaldsay.There is no way to distinguish between passengers who are locals and those who are holidaymakers. Moreover, a local needing an urgent trip has no power to bump a visitor off a boat.ldquoIt is a public service, said Stockan. ldquoIf the boat is full, the boat is full. So, therefore, the more that tourism opens up, the more tourists will book ahead whereas locals wonrsquot. If locals cannot get on the boat, we will have signicant challenges.This is also true on the big ferries ndash most of the heavy lting is done by NorthLink ndash carrying people between Orkney and the Scottish mainland.Here, too, capacity is an issue because of social distancing. And that presents a huge dilemma to tourism businesses on the islands: will enough people make it across the Pentland Firth to make it worthwhile opening up Stockan said: ldquoSocial distancing on ferries mean we are starting tourism on a reduced ability for people to come. Businesses are now unsure how to start because they canrsquot open fully. It is your last few customers that turn your profit.Orkney is greeting all those who cross from the mainland with a letter, asking them to be be responsible.The islands, Stockan explained, have a ldquoying and yang of Covid. Their isolation makes them less vulnerable to the disease but more vulnerable to the cure, to the long-term economic hardship lockdown will bring.Some Orcadians are nervous about tourism reopening. After all, some of the ldquodouble islands ndash those off the Orkney mainland ndash have no real capacity to treat people with serious Covid symptoms.This is not just an Orkney problem. Islanders across Scotland have expressed concern that ferry providers may not have space for locals and that capacity might be an issue for tourism.Nigel Scott of Comhairle nan Eilean Siar in the Western Isles said his councilrsquos position was that ldquopriority for travel going forward should focus on island residents and friends and family living on and from islands, key workers and freight, while maintaining a safe environment for all.Scott added: ldquoWe are seeking further clarity on this and discussions are continuing with Scottish Government, Transport Scotland, CalMac and CalMacrsquos Community Board. There are obviously many issues around ferry travel and the Comhairle is of the view that our communities need greater clarity as restrictions ease.Camille Dressler chairs both the Scottish Islands Federation and the community council for the islands of Eigg, Rum, Muck and Canna in the Inner Hebrides.

It was said to be an experimental weather balloon. And there it may well died had not that intelligence officer, Jesse A Marcel, allegedly bound for decades by official secrets, subsequently mentioned it to a ham radio correspondent who, in , told Stanton Friedman, a UFO researcher. The aliens were out of the closet, or coffin.The Roswell air base in  was the centre of the United Statesrsquo atomic weapons research programme. Marcel was in charge of security, not just there but in the Pacic where tests were planned to take place. His son, Jesse Jnr, then , later claimed that he handled pieces of the craft. Even later it was reported that a nurse at the base said she had been present at autopsies of three creatures which had been recovered from the debris. Both Marcels are dead , the nurse was never identied and, as in most of these mysteries, she is said to have conveniently died in a plane crash.In July , just days before the th anniversary of the crash when spectators would flock to Roswell, the US Air Force released a -page report ndash The Roswell Report: Case Closed ndash which rubbished the theories and explained that the three aliens were crash test dummies.

The first was in , when local businessman, James Walker was driving between Falkirk and Bonnybridge. He stopped when he spotted a shining, star-shaped object which was hovering over the road, blocking his path.Walker, who must have been exceedingly phlegmatic, said the object flew away at ldquoan incredible speed before he did the same. Others have reported seeing a ldquohowling UFO that buzzed their car, while a cigar-shaped craft was spotted landing on a golf course, probably getting in an early round. Others claim to have been captured by aliens in the Triangle, taken aboard for examination, their memories of what then happened wiped.

They had been taken through what looked like a glass case of a small, brown creature with withered arms, shrivelled legs and a large, triangular skull with gaping eye sockets.

Irsquod look at the substance of what his happening rather than necessarily what the First Minister always says.: Recovery package must match lockdown ambitionIn another change to tradition on Marr, this weekrsquos ldquoexpert slot was filled not by a scientist but someone who has devoted a sizeable chunk of her le recently to Melania Trump-watching.Mary Jordan, the Pulitzer-prize winning Washington Post reporter and author of The Art of Her Deal, began by busting one of the major myths about the First Lady ndash that she cried bitterly when her husband won the presidency.ldquoMelania does not cry, said Jordan. ldquoWhen she gets mad she just disappears.When she had the most power was when the allegations of infidelity were made against her husband.ldquoShe used that. He needed her to back him up in public. If she walked, and he was now a three times orced president, it wouldnrsquot look good to his supporters.On Twitter, Melania and her husband play good cop bad cop, said Jordan. ldquoHe makes a mistake, she helps him pull it back, because he would prefer her to do it than some political enemy. They act more as a team and they are often more complicated than it seems. Where she really shows her power is on big hires.When the shortlist for Vice-President came down to three, Mr Trump asked his we to spend two days with Mike Pence and his family. She chose him, said Jordan, because he was not too ambitious, whereas the others, former Governor Chris Christie and ex-Speaker Newt Gingrich were ldquoalpha males. ldquoEveryone knows Trump doesnrsquot do co-stars.Having entered the US on a so-called ldquoEinstein visa for iniduals of exceptional ability, Mrs Trump has brought her parents and sister to America. Her parents are living in White House with the first couple and their son, Barron.ldquoIrsquove heard from people there that there is this amazing daily scene in the private residence with the mother, father, Melania and Barron all speaking Slovenian. Trump will walk by and mutter about how it makes him crazy that he has no idea what they are saying, said Jordan.Oh, to be a Slovenian-speaking fly on those walls.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Physical distancing means that we will be using urban spaces dferently and so being aware of each other is important so that we share space safely and sensibly.“This information is there to gently remind people to be mindful of less abled or more vulnerable people.”Linda Bamford, Convener of the Mobility and Access Committee for Scotlandsaid: “We welcome this information notice to raise public awareness and in particular that it draws attention to the need to be considerate towards disabled people, including helping with physical distancing.“Disabled people and older people are telling MACS of their concerns and fears when out and about as pavements and shared pathways are busier and they are finding it harder to keep a safe distance passing others and some people are passing them too fast and too close.

It has taken some time to reach this decision.#But as we all start to interact more, it’s vital that we take all reasonable steps to reduce risk and we know that face coverings can help reduce the risk of transmission indoors.#Also in shops, as on public transport, contact tracing is more dficult because we usually don’t know the people that we have been contact with. So a face covering provides an additional layer of protection. It is therefore for all of these reasons, that face coverings in shops will be compulsory from the end of next week.#But please do not wait until then — get into the habit now. This is an important way for all of us to help protect each other and to display that sense of solidarity that has helped the country so well over these past months.#From Friday, July , Children who are  years old or under will now be able to play normally with friends outdoors.Distancing should still be adhered to by children while indoors and there is no change to the guidelines for adults.Other rules will remain the same — you should continue to meet in groups of eight or less, and to meet no more than two other households at a time.For young people aged  to , the limit on the number of meetings you can have in any one day has been lted, meaning that dferent groups of friends can meet at dferent times of the day.However, meetings should still take place outdoors and should be no more than eight people — from no more than three households — at any one time.Ms Sturgeon also announced that the two-metre distancing requirement will be relaxed for some key sectors — with the appropriate mitigations in place.The government will work with those in the hospitality, retail and public transport sectors initially to agree the mitigations that will be required, which will allow sectors to operate a one-metre distance ruling.It is hoped that these exemptions for specic sectors could be agreed and in place by the time phase three comes round, potentially from Thursday, July .Mitigations could be improved ventilation, perspex screens, regulation of customer flow and seating plans that reduce transmission risk.However, Ms Sturgeon recognised that the guidance will be change between sectors.The First Minister said: #In my view, this represents a balanced and proportionate approach to what is a genuinely dficult issue. It allows businesses to cater for more customers — and we know that for some that will be the dference between staying in business or closing.#However, it also continues to minimise risk — which, for some iniduals, and with no exaggeration, could be the dference between le and death.#Obviously,infection levels were to rise again, we reserve the right to re-impose a strict two-metre rule, either nationally or locally, and to take other public health measures that are necessary to keep us safe.#Conversely, though,we continue to make progress, we may be able to consider a more general relaxation in later phases.#Outdoor hospitality, such as pavement cafes and beer gardens, can re-open from Monday, Ms Sturgeon confirmed, and although tourism will not open fully until July , self-contained holiday accommodation — for example holiday cottages, lodges or caravans with no shared facilities — can reopen from tomorrow.An additional five positive cases were confirmed yesterday, taking the total now to , in Scotland.One COVID- death was registered in Scotland in the past  hours, taking the total number of deaths, of people who have tested positive for COVID-, to ,.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After eating far too many patisseries, she enrolled at the Alain Ducasse cookery school to learn how to make macarons. She said: “They’re just so pretty. They’re so delicate. And they’re quite hard to make because there’s a lot that can go wrong.”Once Rachel ed to Edinburgh and noticed a gap in the market, she decided to set up her very own macaron business.She said: “I wanted to have that little bit of Paris with me. I focused on taste bud tourism, so when you eat these macarons you’re transported to the Champs-Élysées.” After nine months of trading from home and going to food markets, Rachel set up her first bricks-and-mortar store.She said: “It was in the centre of Edinburgh, it had a view of the castle. It was beautul.” vw, px\"  But since launching their online store in , and realising that they could send macarons across the country, plus the fact that they had large bookings from both wholesale and wedding customers, the bricks and mortar became unnecessary.The company, which employs eight people, lost all their wholesale customers overnight due to Coronavirus.Rachel said: “It was really scary. All the weddings, all the wholesale customers, and the bulk of our production disappeared. And then, of course, you have phone calls from people wanting to cancel future orders and refunds.“We entered the cash flow situation whereby the wholesale customers stopped paying the invoices. And we’ve now got over £, worth of overdue invoices.”But, it’s not all doom and gloom, as Mademoiselle Macaron has started to see an increase in online orders. It’s thanks to the UK Government’s furlough scheme that her business has kept afloat. Rachel said: “The furlough scheme has been a real leline in this time of crisis. I asked people to volunteer for furlough. So the people who wanted to and were happy to, they were the first ones to go. I cried.“I just felt like I was stuck in this moral quandary. Do we keep going and safeguard the business, so there’s a business for everyone to come back to  Or do I shut down because I can see that this is causing people severe anguish  We managed to recall stock that was sitting in hospitality clients freezers. That is the only reason we survived. What you make, you keep in the freezer and you use when you need to. It’s not like it’s a cupcake,we were perishable goods we would never have survived.”“We have a big kitchen so the space isn’t the issue. It’s more that we wanted to keep the team safe,” adds Rachel.Mademoiselle Macaron’s online sales have increased so much that they’re potentially in a position to hire more people on temporary contracts. Ideally, Rachel would like to help younger people and develop a training program with a college. “They’ve been so much more affected, and it’s just something close to my heart,” she said. vw, px\"  But when the Covid- pandemic struck, the managing director of Wales-based The Seren Collection required urgent assistance from the UK Government’s support schemes to pay his creditors and maintain supplier relationships.Mr Kedward and his we Zoe entered the hospitality industry almost by accident in .He said: “We just happened to come home to South Wales for the weekend and stumbled across The Grove. It was a calamitous trip with lots of wrong turns and family arguments, but we found the owner in, made our offer and that was that.“Our aspiration was much smaller than that, in fact we just wanted to convert the six outlying buildings into self catering units – now we’re a  bedroom hotel.”Neil and Zoe went on to open two restaurants in Saundersfoot and Oxwich on the back of the success of The Grove.Asthat weren’t enough to keep the team busy, he also spotted a gap in the tour operator market.Neil said: It struck me that there weren’t enough tour operators bringing people into the country. So we started a business called routescape, which had a hugely encouraging start, launching at World Travel Market before a big business development trip in . We had built up all our bookings for this financial year.“And then of course the whole project was wiped out by the virus. We lost every single booking. Not just for Routescape, but for The Grove too.”Neil added: “The loan from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme has allowed us to pay off all our creditors and we will be able to relaunch owing nobody any money.”When Covid- struck, one of Northern Ireland’s leading providers of tyres and automotive services, had just invested £.m in a new head office and distribution centre in Antrim and cash reserves were low.But thanks to their ability to adapt, ersy as well as the invaluable support from the UK Government, Kerr’s Tyres  Auto has been able play a vital role in servicing and keeping the province’s key workers on the road.Managing director Norman Kerr said: “The Antrim site used up our cash reserves and had a big impact on our cash flow.“Unfortunately the coronavirus kicked in three months later, when we still didn’t have a chance to build up any cash reserves that we would normally have. So it had a massive impact on ourselves.“But the problem was we had to continue trading because we supply the food sector and the white delivery van man.“So our business had to continue. We had to pay suppliers, we had no choice in it.”However thanks to a UK Government Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme loan of £, through the Ulster Bank, as well as the furlough scheme, the family-run business was able to remain solvent and save over  jobs.Norman said: “Had we not been able to get the UK Government loan scheme, it would have had a huge impact on our business. Our business, in essence, dropped probably  per cent within the first month.“Thankfully that has grown steadily back since then.”Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers.Details of the support available to businesses across the UK can be found at gov.uk coronavirus business-supportcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He bought a field from William Isbister of Kethesgeo and hired Samuel Baikie. Baikie’s obituary says that he designed the hotel but the local story was that it had been a show-house at the  Glasgow Exhibition. Perhaps the plans came from the Exhibition.Good though the fishing was, John Mackay wanted to make it even better. He got some trout spawn and put the fry he had hatched in a specially built pond at Stairwaddy. A year later, he had a lot of good- sized fish.The hotel opened in June . It had a coffee room, drawing room, smoking room, fteen bedrooms, lavatories and one bathroom. The Orkney Herald thought for beauty and comfort it could not be excelled in the north. The first phone line in Orkney connected the hotel to the Masons Arms and this featured in the advertising.In , Mackay had an “Illustrated Guide to Orkney” printed. The useful information included the charges for Maeshowe:- sixpence for one person one shilling for more than one, up to four persons and for more than four, threepence per person, up to ten shillings, the maximum charge for one party. In WWI, Houton was the main seaplane base but late in  it was decided to increase the number in Orkney from  to , to fight the threat of submarines, and a camp was built in Stenness. The Admiralty had not listened to the locals but soon found out that they were right, and the loch was too shallow. The planes were moved to Houton but the hotel remained the HQ of the Naval Air Service.At the end of WWI, another long running battle restarted, as John Mackay fought the Temperance movement. Stromness was dry from  to  and campaigners were determined that Stenness would be the same. Successive owners promised not to sell drink to locals, but it was no use, the petitions kept coming.John Mackay died in  and the hotel was briefly owned by Mrs Jessie Smith. The Misses Catherine and Jessie Harper from Thurso took it over in , announcing they were going to bring it up to date.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a particular interest in social historycopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is also hoped to help Shetland#s existing oil and gas industry achieve carbon net zero targets.Plans for the hub are still in early stages with no specic projects agreed. However, ideas such as an offshore wind farm east of Shetland, and the creation of hydrogen from natural gas or electrolysis, are some of the ideas being suggested.Smaller scale community projects would also be developed through the hub project.Mr Irvine#s report to the council said the hub could generate pound billion of revenue for the region, remove carbon emissions by eight million tons, and create , jobs.He said the formative phase would look at which options are viable commercially and which were not.While the council has already committed pound, to the project, Mr Irvine said funding from the Scottish and UK governments as well as the Highlands and Islands Enterprise would be needed.He also said private sector investment was ldquocore to the project ndash and a steering group was working on that.Lerwick North councillor Stephen Leask had questioned how strong the council#s position # and how much financial risk it could face.Mr Irvine said most of the risk would be taken by the major investors from the energy industry, rather than the SIC.Martyn Tulloch, who leads the Net Zero Solution Centre, at OGTC, told the meeting that while other regions were advancing hub projects, with one in Humberside said to be the furthest advanced, he was not aware of any that had received Scottish government funding.#We have been approached by other regions but this is very much our sole focus at the moment,# he added.SIC leader Steven Coutts said the hub was a #crucial# project to Shetland#s future # and one that the council could not progress alone.He added it would need to bring #signicant community benefits# .#We want to see people thrive in Shetland with a strong and resilient community,# he added.Councillors agreed to progress the project into its #formative phase#, which will see the project team work with the energy industry and government agencies to identy next steps, including research projects and trials.Consultations will also take place with the community, businesses and other relevant interestsA funding application is expected to be submitted to the Scottish government next month...Shetlanders will be encouraged to clap for the NHS again this evening, to celebrate the nd birthday of the health service.

DaoineThe study of areas like Staffin, Tiree and the Western Isles has been labelled as the most comprehensive social survey on the state of Gaelic communities ever conducted.The findings conclude that the language is in crisis, and that within remaining vernacular communities of Scotland the social use and transmission of Gaelic is at the point of collapse.Researchers from the University of the Highlands and Islands Language Sciences Institute and Soillse, a multi-institutional research collaboration which includes Sabhal Mòr Ostaig in Skye, outline the findings in a new book published todayThe authors of ‘The Gaelic Crisis in the Vernacular Community: A comprehensive sociolinguistic survey of Scottish Gaelic’ urge a radical new agenda and strategy for Gaelic revitalisation in the islands.They argue for the creation of a community development trust for Gaelic-speakers that is island based and under the direct control of the community.Professor Conchúr Ó Giollagáin, Professor of Gaelic Research at the University of the Highlands explained the motivation behind the new book.He said: “It is important that we are clear about the immense scale of the challenges involved in reversing the ongoing decline in the use of Gaelic in these areas.“Our statistical evidence indicates that the Gaelic vernacular community is comprised of around , people, of which a majority are in the  years and over age category.“The decline of the Gaelic community, as especially shown in the marginal practice of Gaelic in families and among teenagers, indicates that without a community-wide revival of Gaelic, the trend towards the loss of vernacular Gaelic will continue.“We found a mismatch between current Gaelic policies and the level of crisis among the speaker group which must be addressed to face the urgency of the language loss in the islands.“The primary focus of Gaelic policy should now be on relevant initiatives to avert the loss of vernacular Gaelic.”In order to make Gaelic policy viable, the researchers called for a re-aligning of national policy to address the decline in the use of Gaelic as a community language.Whilst some elements of national policy have had some success, such as the numbers of primary pupils in Gaelic Medium Education, without an overarching revitalisation approach, as outlined in their research, the authors believe the decline in the Gaelic vernacular community will rapidly continue.Iain Caimbeul, research fellow at the Language Sciences Institute in the University of the Highlands and Islands added: “If Scotland is to continue to give practical expression to its commitment to sustaining cultural ersity, it is vital that strategy for the Gaelic group is rooted in the broader context of community revitalisation.#We hope this research will be valuable to those interested in seeking to sht public policy assumptions from a sole dependence on the school system for creating the next generation of fluent Gaelic speakers.“It is vital that we change the basis for allocating resources to protect against further decline.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience

school","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineI’ve always been of the opinion that local government should be exempt from the Machiavellian attempts of people whose only agenda is to disrupt the successful running of the ‘machinery’ of administration we all take for granted.Maybe I was naive to expect we’d all be on the same ‘side’, trying our collective best to maximise the opportunities for the people of these Western Isles.I guess too naive.Cue SNP leader, Councillor Gordon Murray’s latest dog-whistle, resulting from last week’s meeting of Comhairle nan Eilean Siar.For those who remain oblivious to the frequency at which Facebook Barbara Woodhouse wannabes broadcastMr Murray sometimes operates with an economy of factual accuracy which leaves those who are unprepared to dig # even just a little bit further in pursuit of the truth # salivating in the best Pavlovian traditions.There will never be a time, certainly not in the foreseeable future, when there will be ‘spare’ money floating around Sandwick Road.The halcyon days of having underspent budgets and of looking for projects on which to lavish ‘leftover’ cashare but a twinkle in old Convenors’ eyes.So any refurbishment of the council chambers, shamefully overlooked by at least the last five incumbent collaboratives, was always going to be moderately controversial.It certainly didn’t require a Molotov cocktail lobbed in its general direction, especially not one fuelled by completely unsubstantiated innuendo and inferences, designed to ignite ‘public’ opinion.An uncaring, out-of-touch majority of elected membershad decided to refurbish the council chambers in the middle of the Covid- crisis, ignoring the more pressing needs of the local economy.The comfort of our bums on seats was of greater signicance than the struggles of inidual businesses trying to survive a devastating economic downturn.Balderdash.The decision to refurbish the council chambers was about much more and, in any scheme of things, needed doing.That Councillor Murray knew it and had commissioned a report to explain it to him, was neither here nor there.He went with his simple narrative and the howling began.The decision was actually taken some  months ago and, despite some robust discussion, it was agreed that what was planned was necessary and overdue.The seating in the chamber was, after  years of wear and tear, burst at the seams.Its tangerine hue had now assumed a week old, orange peel in the sun, frayed facade.It stank a bit and was, even to my own initial impressions three years ago, a bit of a tawdry embarrassment.Especially so when it doubles as a civic reception arena for visitors of every gravitas and distinction.They say thatyour IT infrastructure is five years old, then it’s probably  years out of date.When you cannot, in today’s modern world, reliably communicate with your ‘satellite’ offices in Castlebay, Balivanich and Tarbert, far less those at Marybank, Cromwell Street and Creed Park then the chances of joining in with anyone further afield may be remote.When, in a hugely changed modern meeting landscape, everything is getting done on Zoom or Microsoft Teams, then you need to be able to do so efficiently, effectively and with stability.Of course, nobody could have predicted this  months ago which is why, retrospectively, we should be ‘selling’ the notion to the public as the excellent news it is. other offices will be upgraded to the same standard of communication technology.Nobody will have to rely, embarrassingly, on a decent mobile signal and having to ‘put you on speakerphone’ to continue a discussion when the smoke signals have failed.Sensible people understand this.People from Gordon’s own party understand this.The ones who inhabit the real world anyway and some have already commented.The fact that an improved connectivity infrastructure might just re-invigorate our democracy hasn’t been lost on the more astute.Going back to ‘how we’ve always done things’ should never be an option again, given this new, exciting opportunity.Of course, there’s much that can be achieved by face-to-face contact and the physical intimacy of ‘actual’ meetings are still important.But that landscape will be vastly altered by the new normal.Hopefully, this will mean that a whole raft of possibilities might open up.The current format for being a councillor makes it dficult for many people to commit to even considering the election process, far less the minimum time required to attend all the meetings.Maybe being able to do so from the comfort of their own homes, raising their ‘virtual hands’ on a large screen in the chambers when they wish to speak, might just persuade more people that it’s time for our elderly, male-dominated, ‘democracy’ to change Which might just make for an influx of fresh thinking and constructive debate.Opposition for opposing’s sake is still the stuff of the primary school classroom.When you know you can propose the most fancul notions without any fear that they’ll ever get beyond the debating arena, you can always tell an incredulous audience that, but for the bad guys in the Comhairle, you could also have had ‘jelly and ice-cream’ in your ‘land of milk and honey’. local members know that successive national government failures have taken away most of the cows and bees, so why the continued deflection from reality by our local group on CNES Because they require to have a purpose, albeit a mostly destructive one.It has generally been accepted that our council workers, officers and directorates have done a pretty decent job in the midst of what have been exceptionally trying circumstances.But when you talk ‘council’ up here, you generally mean the whole kit-kaboodle.You throw everyone under the same bus when # in order to get a massive negative reaction for your own political ends # you allude that the Comhairle are spending a large sum of money on new chairs.Four months of exemplary work down the drain so someone can appear as some sort of martyr.Quite shameful behaviour, and quickly seen through by even his own acolytes, many of whom had spoken passionately in favour of a refurbishment , before adding their names to a list of dissenters when the motion was rejected as incompetent.Incompetent because the procurement processhad already begun, and had been explained, in great detail, several months previously.What has been hugely fortunate these past few months is the resilience which the Comhairle has been able to demonstrate as a result of having ‘balances’ at hand to deal with emergency situations such as Covid-.Balances which, had they embarked on a spree of imprudence as appealed for by the SNP group when budget setting was being undertaken, would have disappeared into the ether.Combine with their insistence on asking for meaningless, time-consuming report after report in an effort to undermine what’s already been decided and the wasted saved money could have us all bedecked in ermine.When you insist on portraying yourself as Roy Rogers in a white hat, consistently battling against the bad guysmaybe it’s time that you listened to Tonto.Hopefully, someone close will volunteer to be that side-kick, and soon, eh kemo-sabe Gordon is essentially a decent guy, but in his aspirations to undermine the credibility of his fellow councillors he undermines the hard work of every single council employee and misses his target spectacularly.The disconnect between the success of his party at national, and at local government level, may be partly down to perception.A degree of maturity, purposeful intent, willingness to participate and collaborate to be serious about their proposals, would go a long way.I like to think of myself as a reasonable fellow and, as I’ve previously stated, I will support any sensible suggestions, no matter their origin.Three years later, Gordon I’m still waiting.And it’s not due to any political or philosophical opposition.When it comes to golf, what you see is generally what you get.At Stornoway last week what we got was decent weather and decent scoring.In the Lewis Cup on Wednesday night, Stuart ‘Tyson’ Campbell triumphed

who have a share on it # would agree to its sale and use.All but one of them did. to resolve.The erosion of hard-fought crofting rights is the last thing for which the West Highland Free Press would argue.Thanks to security of tenure, succession rights, and favourable grant and loan schemes crofting has been the Highlands and Islands’ most effective affordable housing policy for more than a century.But it seems ridiculous that a development for local families – earmarked for bare pasture of little other use # can still be blocked on the whim of one inidual.And the irony is that anyone familiar with the region would be able to point to countless examples of ‘in-bye’ land # the better quality fields that traditionally accompany a croft house # being carved up and sold on as expensive plots without a murmur from either planners or crofting regulators.In recent years we have seen parliamentary acts on crofting, community empowerment and the right-to-buy land, as well as a much-heralded Scottish islands bill.There are also more than enough public bodies.Addressing rural depopulation # accompanied by a targeted budget to fund small housing schemes and self-build croft houses – could be a mission which unites these organisations in the Highlands and Islands.But the Scottish Land Commission, the crofting commission, housing associations and local authorities have to be better at working together to make sure the legislation we already have makes a dference and delivers results.The Staffin example tells us that a way must be found to protect the rights of inidual crofters and agricultural land for the wider interest, while at the same time ensuring ground is also made available to house families on which the future of these communities will depend.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/auction-1-2.jpg","title":"going going gone skye lecturer hosts online auction today for foodbanks and indian","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe auction which is being held on Facebook has around  unique handmade items, which have been kindly donated by creative people who live all around Scotland.Originally from Shetland, Layla Sawford moved to Portree in January to work for the University of the Highlands and Islands.

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

EXPERTISE“Robin has given up his time willingly to do whatever he could to ensure Chamber supported our local businesses.“ I am glad to say that Robin will remain as a Management Committee member and that Eugene, Leigh and the rest of the Management Committee will continue to have the benefit of Robin’s knowledge and expertise and of course his array of jokes which always help cheer up the most dficult of meetings.” Tom noted that both Eugene and Leigh have been members of the Management Committee for some time and have already shown that they are eager to do whatever they can to sustain and promote business in the local area. “I am looking forward to working with our new officials and cannot wait for normality towhen we can hold our AGM in safety and be able to meet our members in person.“ In the meantime I hope everyone stays safe and wish all our businesses good fortune as they begin to re-open and get back to some type of normality.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3210337.jpg--.jpg?1593777214000\n","title":"shop local and shop safe is message to customers as town re opens","story":"Mid and East Antrim Mayor, Cllr Peter Johnston, is calling on shoppers to show their support for local retailers as they join in the  Retail NI Independents’ Day on  JulyBallymena’s retail centre is gradually starting to look busier with more people willing to venture ‘downtown’ for a taste of the new normality.To be honest, it’s not perfect at the moment with queues for shops and toilet facilities causing frustration but as protocols hopefully change and the COVID threat recedes there will be a real need to back local stores and bsuinesses.And to help that cause, Council is branding Independents Day UK as a chance for local people e to show support for the independent retailers they value most in the local community.Independent business owners account for around % of the approximately , retail outlets in the UK.ies.The Mayor hopes shoppers will give their backing to the campaign and support retailers now and throughout the year.He said: “Mid and East Antrim is open for business, and I hope our community will show their support for our smaller, independent retailers as we continue to move out of the lockdown restrictions.Many of our businesses have been there to support us when we needed them.

Wishing Belfastâs bars, cafes, restaurants and hotels a safe and successful reopening today and in the weeks ahead pic DtNjDADs— Simon HamiltonJuly , He added: “With press reports that the Chancellor is considering a voucher scheme, the Northern Ireland Executive must ensure thatthe Government does take such a step then Northern Ireland is either included or follows suit and introduces its own voucher scheme.“There is no doubt that a voucher scheme would bring a much-needed boost for our retail and hospitality businesses.”Many of them have been closed for nearly four months.Mr Hamilton added: “Footfall will continue to be challenged.“By incentivising spending, a voucher scheme would get help to the businesses that need it most and sustain jobs in the process.”PAMost ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Updates on July Brothers in arms: Pallbearers Lynch, Murray and #The Surgeon# turn Storey#s send-off into show of strengthThe NI couple who spent £k on a derelict villa in Andalucia... now you can holiday therePhoto emerges of Ghislaine Maxwell ‘sitting on Buckingham Palace throne’Young Tyrone brothers go viral with hilarious video diaries of le on farm during lockdown ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mrs O#Neill said she would never apologise for attending the funeral of a friend.The PSNI said it is examining footage from the funeral for breaches of the regulations.Loyalist activist Jamie Bryson warned that the PSNI risks harming its standing in loyalist and unionist communitiesupcoming parades are not policed in the same way.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePlea: Dolores KellyLiam McBurney FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPlea: Dolores KellyBut SDLP MLA Mrs Kelly urged people not to gather on Monday week when most parades are scheduled. The traditional parades were cancelled in April when the Covid- pandemic was at its height.But since then restrictions have been relaxed, and up to  people are now allowed to meet outdoors while social distancing.Notications from bands have flooded in to the Parades Commission this week. It comes after the Belfastrevealed the Attorney General had informed the body that it had no power to prevent parades from taking place.Mrs Kelly urged bands to heed the advice of Rev Mervyn Gibson, grand secretary of the Orange Order, who said this week: Because someone  does wrong doesn#t mean we have to follow suit.The Order has also restated its position that Twelfth parades will not take place this year. Mrs Kelly said: The Orange Order has shown leadership and I think it is to be commended for staying strong in what happened in relation to Bobby Storey#s funeral.Rev Gibson#s message has remained consistent this year in the face of a pandemic and a health crisis in which we seek to protect the NHS.I would urge bands to follow the leadership in the Order. The PSNI said it is aware of discussions taking place in relation to the Twelfth and will work with partners and stakeholders to put in place an appropriate and proportionate policing support in place for any events in line with legislation at the time.But Mr Bryson said that events this week in west Belfast have posed big questions for the police.He said that given the PSNI approach when it came to Bobby Storey#s funeral, clearly many in unionist and loyalist communities will be watching closely as to how the PSNI police small, localised band parades in our community.If, for example, we were to see heavy PSNI presence... unionist confidence in fair and balanced policing will erode even further, he claimed.Belfast Related ContentGalleryThe Twelfth bands apply to hold Twelfth marches amid fallout of Storey funeralLoyalists are demanding the right to hold Twelfth celebrations after Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill attended the funeral of Bobby Storey.Most ReadBrothers in arms: Pallbearers Lynch, Murray and #The Surgeon# turn Storey#s send-off into show of strengthCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Updates on July Tyrone GAA star Peter Loughran charged in multi-million drugs probeThe NI couple who spent £k on a derelict villa in Andalucia... now you can holiday therePhoto emerges of Ghislaine Maxwell ‘sitting on Buckingham Palace throne’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchSocialsFacebookTwitterEmailThe Belfastis a member of IPSO and subscribes to its Editors Code of PracticeIpsoSitemapContact UsTerms  ConditionsPrivacy StatementCookie PolicyPaid-for content PolicyGroup WebsitesAdvertise with UsAn INM Websitecopy Belfastdocument.documentElement.style.setPropertydocument.documentElement.style.setProperty"},{"url":null,"title":"552859","story":"A County Derry community has raised thousands towards the restoration of the parish chapel, while travelling more than ,km in total.

From this date passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering.

Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  googletag.cmd.push The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said:“As we move throughthe Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety ofpassengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. googletag.cmd.push “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen.

While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued:“We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is alsoimportant that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe. You have been the leaders in Northern Ireland fighting Covid- and I am asking you to keep it up and we will beat this together. “By acting together and thinking of each other we can reduce the risk of transmission.” Further information is available on nidirect at:https:www.nidirect.gov.uk  coronavirus-safer-travel- guidanceandhttps:www.nidirect.gov.uk  face-coverings  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is anticipated that more could follow in the coming days. The Twelfth is the annual Protestant celebration held every year on July . googletag.cmd.push However, it is being celebrated on July  this year because the twelfth falls on a Sunday. It dates back to a  when the last British Catholic monarch King James II was defeated by Protestant King William, formerly Prince of Orange in Holland, at the Battle of the Boyne. Each year, members of the Orange Order - named after the victorious king and founded in  - carry banners and flags in parades acrossNorthern Irelandaccompanied by marching bands. The Orange Order cancelled events in April due to the Coronavirus pandemic and asked bands not to parade this year. Harold Henning, Deputy Grand Master, said: This year will be a dferent Twelfthbut just because our parades and gatherings are cancelled, does not mean that we cannot celebrate King William’s momentous victory.Quite the opposite, our challenge is to ensure this Twelfth is marked in style online, in your home, at your door, with families and neighbours. Together we can make it a fun-filled, extra-special - socially distanced th - that will be talked about for years. googletag.cmd.push He added: So begin by planning to suitably decorate your home, street, village or town - fly the flag, proudly and respectfully. Encourage children and grandchildren to watchour craft videos and create Orange Liliesand buntingor brush up your history by reading about William’s Generals. However, during our celebrations let us be mindful that the priority in  is to look after everyone’s health this Twelfth as we continue the battle against Coronavirus.Please ensure you comply with the lockdown regulations in existence over the period. But the Parades Commission has now received around  applications for marches to celebrate the Twelfth. The sudden influx has been attributed to the easing of restrictions on outdoor gatherings whereby up to  people are able to gather outdoors, provided social distancing can be observed. Among the areas where applications have been made are Belfast, Ballymena, Newtownards and Enniskillen. SOLDIER F BAND At this stage no applications have been submitted for the annual ‘Relief of Londonderry parade’ which traditionally takes place on the second Saturday of August. On August  last year there was controversy in the city when a loyalist band wore parachute regiment insignia accompanied by a soldier F symbol. It was deemed to be an intentional act aimed at inciting the nationalist community in the city. The ex-paratrooper known as soldier F is being prosecuted for the murders of James Wray, , and William McKinney, . He is also facing four attempted murder charges, plus an additional support count in respect of the attempted murder of a person or persons unknown.

Since the first official announcement of the post-graduate facility in  , a catalogue of failures has been allowed by the university and decision-makers within government. Impediments almost too numerous to list have acted to frustrate,not block, delivery of what is agreed is a much-needed facility. googletag.cmd.push The responsibility and willingness to bow to problems readily rather than resolve them lies at many doors, not least: politicians, internal university committees, government committees, health officials, Stormont officials, UU officials, other universities, and the Northern Ireland Civil Service. Is there an underlying and more pernicious problem that has its roots in decision-making by UU that is seen to favour other places over Derry  Why are our public representatives facilitating this  Since its establishment in Coleraine by the Stormont government in the s, the university has been allowed, and encouraged, to run an unfettered and unchallenged agenda, whereby major development decided upon by university authorities, based in Belfast, has been centred on Coleraine, Jordanstown and, more recently, North Belfast. googletag.cmd.push The post-GFA era has seen little change and, effectively, Belfast and Stormont, acting as a city-state, exercise a veto on every major development in Derry or the North West. This is the continuation of an unfortunate and deliberate policy which we thought had been consigned to a troubled past. Derry has been patiently lobbying for proper and deserved university provision for the region for  years. It is the last remaining grievance of the Civil Rights era, and the failure to provide a modern university in the North West sustains the injustice practiced by the Unionist government, now long gone, of the time. For almost  years, Direct Rule and devolved governments at Stormont and UU have favoured other localised priorities and broken promises to Derry. In , under the Ilex One Plan, UU and government gave a commitment to have , full-time students at Magee by . The actual number – under , – didn’t change at all over the decade. Most recently, a commitment, endorsed by Dublin and Westminster, to have , students at Magee by  was made in January as part of ‘New Decade New Approach’. Just weeks later, Stormont handed a poundm off-the-books bailout to UU for its well over-budget North Belfast campus, while simultaneously putting a freeze on Derry development. The city and the region are either the collateral damage of flawed strategic planning or dismissive indference to any regional equality and provision. It has to be one or the other and when you dismiss a region, you dismiss the people who live there. Given the inequitable outcomes flowing from policy-making pursued by a university with government money for almost  years now, it would, in a normal society, merit a full public inquiry. Local representatives and most worryingly, nationalist politicians, who would have traditionally questioned the policy, are failing to alter what is undeniably UU’s ‘Belfast-first’ agenda - to the huge detriment of northwest Ireland which has still, by far, the lowest Higher Education provision on these islands. Derry University Group figures recently put the HE uptake in Derry at fty percent lower than the next lowest in Ireland. The medical school,and when it arrives, is barely a fig leaf to cover UU’s embarrassment, and Stormont’s shame, at how they have treated Derry. It will house just  students – and the capital costs will be financed not by the university, nor central government, nor Stormont, but by the city-region itself from its City Deal package. Despite having failed utterly, and consistently, in its responsibilities to this region, UU stands to become the biggest single beneficiary of the City Deal. Stormont will not, however, underwrite the on-going running costs of the new Derry facility, on the grounds that UU – having spent all its money, and much more besides, in Belfast - is now for all intents and purposes, insolvent. In recent years, following lobbying by the Derry University Group and others, the Dublin government has stated that it is prepared to help lead university development in Derry and northwest Ireland – a promise, indeed, that is reinforced in its new Programme for Government. It is time to make good on that promise. Representative democracy and investment cannot be the trickle-down preserve of just one geographical area or one demographic community. Such presents as unbalanced economic, educational, social and cultural polarisation. It is a poor and failed model for regeneration especially now, given the possible economic and social repercussions of Covid-. The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, a constituent college of the National University, is ideally placed to develop and deliver a medical school in the North West, and can do so rapidly. RCSI currently runs two medical school campuses in Malaysia and another in Bahrain. A new cross-border facility in the North West, operated by RCSI and overseen by the Irish and British governments directly as part of the North-South institutions, would short circuit the bureaucratic and financial logjams at Stormont and UU. It would also provide a starting blueprint for a new, autonomous cross-border university for Derry and Donegal, which ultimately is the only viable solution to the HE crisis here. It is time to put the North West first and allow us to develop our higher education sector independently, away from the grip of centralised decision-makers.

Kelly, who has coached Derry to back to back Celtic Challenge titles and a Nicky Rackard Cup success, feels the main problem with the Ulster championship is the window of opportunity to get it played. In  and , the Ulster championship was played off in two groups. Derry were relegated in  when they conceded the relegation play-off to Down, after defeat to Antrim in the Ulster semi-final. It also followed a winless Division A league and Christy Ring campaign. googletag.cmd.push Donegal were promoted for winning the shield. Derry were the shield winners in , when the competition was played between the league and the Oakleafers successful Nicky Rackard winning campaign. The decision to shelve the Ulster championship completely was taken early in . Ulster official Oliver Galligan conveyed the message to the Antrim and Down teams at the Conor McGurk final. “The restructuring of the national competitions aims to provide a high number of games for Ulster counties at their own level while the apathy towards the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship in recent times has been obvious,” Ulster Secretary Brian McAvoy later told delegates at the Ulster convention at the time. googletag.cmd.push “Therefore, with a heavy heart, the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship has been discontinued for a three year period .” Kelly outlined four options available to the deployment of the Ulster senior hurling championship. The first one was to play it after the league and before the Christy Ring Cup and other tiered championships. Kelly pointed to the need for counties to vote on moving thechampionships back to allow time. The majority of the counties hail from Leinster and Connacht, who would have to restructure their club scene accordingly, to accommodate the Ulster counties. With the hurling league finishing before the football league and with dual players almost defunct, the Ulster championship would need to fit around the club window “That one is the best option,” Kelly points out about slotting the Ulster championship into mid-season. “Thats the gold star one. The next one would be to play it after the Christy Ring is played. We have tried that and it didnt work,” he added, referring to the  season. “Option C is to play it before the National League, which means the Conor McGurk Cup would become the Ulster championship. You could have the Liam Harvey Cup and the Conor McGurk Cup could become the shield of that competition. Thats not degrading it, it is just saying there is an option.” Kellys fourth option would be not to have the Ulster championship, with the current schedule providing enough games and there is no window to play it. “To me, they are the four options and I dont see anything ,” he concluded.

As more and more companies continue to get back to work, we look at how the financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. CASE STUDY KERR’S TYRES  AUTO When Covid- struck, one of Northern Ireland’s leading providers of tyres and automotive services, had just invested pound.m in a new head office and distribution centre in Antrim and cash reserves were low. googletag.cmd.push But thanks to their ability to adapt, ersy as well as the invaluable support from the UK Government, Kerr’s Tyres  Auto has been able play a vital role in servicing and keeping the province’s key workers on the road. Managing director Norman Kerr said: “The Antrim site used up our cash reserves and had a big impact on our cash flow. “Unfortunately the coronavirus kicked in three months later, when we still didn’t have a chance to build up any cash reserves that we would normally have. So it had a massive impact on ourselves. “But the problem was we had to continue trading because we supply the food sector and the white delivery van man. So our business had to continue. We had to pay suppliers, we had no choice in it.” googletag.cmd.push However thanks to a UK Government Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme loan of pound, through the Ulster Bank, as well as the furlough scheme, the family-run business was able to remain solvent and save over  jobs. Norman said: “Had we not been able to get the UK Government loan scheme, it would have had a huge impact on our business. Our business, in essence, dropped probably  per cent within the first month. Thankfully that has grown steadily back since then.  ON THE RIGHT ROAD: Norman Kerr, of Kerr’s Tyres  Auto “We also had to furlough  per cent of our staff in month one. As business picked up again and things moved forward, by month two we were probably down to  per cent. “Month three was  per cent working and we hope within the coming weeks we will have nobody left on furlough. But againit wasn’t for furlough, this would have also had a huge impact on cash flow. “Honestly, when you have  staff, it’s a big bill at the end of every month. We would have had no option but to have laid off around  staff and there was nothing we could have done about that. “So the schemes that the UK Government has introduced have been very helpful.” With  branches, including four in the Republic and seven in Northern Ireland, plus a workforce of over , the UK Government schemes also gave Norman and his team the freedom to ersy and keep some of the leading supermarkets and delivery firms up and running. He said: “We had to ersy dramatically in our business. Collection and delivery rather than customers coming to us. “We had to operate a night sht. So we put four breakdown fitters on our night sht rota. That was to cover the likes of Tesco, Asda and the white van man. “The delivery men have been working   because everything is getting delivered at home. So we found the need to have to serve them on a night sht rota.” With over  years business experience, Kerr’s also adapted to ensure Government guidelines were adhered to. Norman said: “Because we did ersication and received the UK Government help we were able to continue to do business and can look forward to the future.” ‘A real letime in this time of crisis’ CASE STUDY MADEMOISELLE MACARON Rachel Hanretty, of Mademoiselle Macaron, fell in love with macarons while living in Paris. Once Rachel ed to Edinburgh and noticed a gap in the market, she decided to set up her very own macaron business. After nine months of trading from home and going to food markets, Rachel set up her first bricks-and-mortar store. She said: “It was in the centre of Edinburgh, it had a view of the castle. It was beautul.” But since launching their online store in , and realising that they could send macarons across the country, plus the fact that they had large bookings from both wholesale and wedding customers, the bricks and mortar became unnecessary. The company, which employs eight people, lost all their wholesale customers overnight due to Coronavirus. Rachel said: “It was really scary. All the weddings, all the wholesale customers, and the bulk of our production disappeared. And then, of course, you have phone calls from people wanting to cancel future orders and refunds.  TASTY TREATS: Rachel Hanretty, below, has used the furlough scheme to keep Mademoiselle Macaron going  “We entered the cash flow situation whereby the wholesale customers stopped paying the invoices. And we’ve now got over pound, worth of overdue invoices.” But, it’s not all doom and gloom, as Mademoiselle Macaron has started to see an increase in online orders. It’s thanks to the UK Government’s furlough scheme that her business has kept afloat. Rachel said: “The furlough scheme has been a real leline in this time of crisis. I asked people to volunteer for furlough. So the people who wanted to and were happy to, they were the first ones to go.”   ‘We paid creditors and maintained relationships’ CASE STUDY THE SEREN COLLECTION With plans for a new spa at his five-star hotel, a Michelin-star chef in his restaurant and the launch of a tour operator business underway, Neil Kedward was looking forward to a good year in . But when the Covid- pandemic struck, the managing director of Wales-based The Seren Collection required urgent assistance from the UK Government’s support schemes to pay his creditors and maintain supplier relationships. Mr Kedward and his we Zoe entered the hospitality industry almost by accident in . He said: “We just happened to come home to South Wales for the weekend and stumbled across The Grove. It was a calamitous trip with lots of wrong turns and family arguments, but we found the owner in, made our offer and that was that.”  FINANCIAL AID: Neil Kedward, of The Seren Collection Neil and Zoe went on to open two restaurants in Saundersfoot and Oxwich on the back of the success of The Grove. Asthat weren’t enough to keep the team busy, he also spotted a gap in the tour operator market. Neil said: “ It struck me that there weren’t enough tour operators bringing people into the country. So we started a business called routescape, which had a hugely encouraging start, launching at World Travel Market before a big business development trip in . And then, of course, the whole project was wiped out by the virus. We lost every single booking. “The loan from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme has allowed us to pay off all our creditors and we will be able to relaunch owing nobody any money.” Help available to companies and workers Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

Despite not yet being built, the futuristic eco-house, which is called The Qube, has gone up for sale in the Prehen area of the Waterside with a price tag of pound,. The five-bedroom property called The Qube will be built on land beside the Everglades Hotel. It has been advertised as one of Northern Irelands only passive houses, which means it will use very little energy and leave a small ecological footprint. The three-story dwelling will also be a smart home and the lights, heating and blinds can all be operated from a tablet or smartphone. googletag.cmd.push  The , sq ft building will be locatedon a triangular piece of landat the junction of Prehen Road andHazelwood Avenue. This heavily-wooded area is home to a number of mature trees which arecovered by a Tree Preservation Order . Although work on the property is yet to begin, it has full planning permission. However, the journey to obtaining this was not a smooth one. In Northeern Ireland, local councils are responsible for most planning decisions. Each council has planning officers who make recommendations about planning applications. However, the Planning Committee, which is made up of councillors, has the option to reject these recommendations. googletag.cmd.push The planning application for The Qube first came before Derry City and Strabane District Councils Planning Committee last September. Council planners provided councillors with a detailed report which recommended that planning permission be refused for the building.  The meeting was also told that  letters of objection had been sent by local residents. Among their concerns werethe destructionof ancient woodland and mature trees and the suggestion that the buildingis out of character and proportion with theexisting neighbouring properties. The report said thatthe building went ahead it would have adversely affected thecharacterandenvironmental quality of theof thesurrounding area through the loss of an important and well establishedurban woodland greenspace. Councillors agreed to defer the decision for a site visit, which took place on September  last year and which was attended by seven councillors. On September , the Planning Committee voted not toaccept the recommendation to refuse the planning application and agreed to reconsider itfurther information on the Tree Protection Order was provided. The council sent out additional notications to all neighbours, objectors and supporters ofthe scheme in January this year and  more letters were received, with six in objection to the application and  in support. The letters in support said the site was an eyesore and the owner of the proposed building would have a vested interest in maintaining it. On March  this year, the Planning Committee met again and was told council planners had not changed their position that planning permission should be refused. The Principal Planning Officer told elected members an Arboriculture Impact Assessment had been carried out which broadly agreed with the initial recommendation that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the proposed scheme would not have a detrimental impact on the Tree Preservation Ordersite. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock, who attended the site visit, told the meeting she did not believe the protected trees would be affected by the proposed building. She proposed to overturn the decision of the planning officer and for approval to be granted subject to conditions provided by planners. The proposal was seconded by SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins and was passed after seven votes for, three against and three abstentions. On Friday, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council confirmed that that an application for the Prehen building came before the Planning Committee in September  with a recommendation to refuse as it would result in the loss of a valuable urban woodland green space and the applicant had failed to demonstrate that this dwelling would not have an adverse impact on existing trees. The recommendation was not accepted by elected members and the application came back before the committee on March of this year as a reconsidered application, following a visit to the site by elected members and the submission of further information, said the spokesperson. Whilst the officers presented an unaltered opinion to refuse, elected members voted to approved the application.” The sale of The Qube, which was designed by architect Gerard McPeake, is being handled by McGuinness Fleck Estate Agents   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The championship was put on hold for three seasons, at the start of the  season. Derry won back to back titles in  and , but have not contested a final since the the  final at Owenbeg. Goals from Ruairi Convery and Paddy McCloskey had Derry well in the hunt. Convery, who scored -, levelled the game before Daniel McKernans winner. Antrim have won the last  in succession, with Down not lting the title since . Armagh reached the final in  and , losing to the Saffrons, before the competition was paused for three years, given the new tiered All-Ireland structure which has saw Derry play at Nicky Rackard and Christy Ring level. googletag.cmd.push The  season was the final year of the experiment with the Ulster hurling championship.  The County Derry Post contacted Ulster GAA for clarication of the future of the competition andthere were any further developments. “No decision has yet been taken on this matter. Its a matter for CCCC and Coiste Bainisti and we dont have any detail as to when it will be discussed,” read a statement from Ulster GAA PRO Declan Woods. In a special feature this week, we get the thoughts from Derry, Antrim and Down on the Ulster championship and where it could fit into the calendar. googletag.cmd.push “A provincial championship is a provincial championship. I think there could be a window for it before the Christy Ring,” felt Derry senior manager John McEvoy. Kevin Kelly, a former Derry selector, is on the Ulster Hurling Development committee feels there are four options available, but the best option would be after the league. Antrim captain Conor McCann said the Saffrons would welcome it back, but there needed to be the reward of an automatic spot in the All-Ireland series for the winner. Down boss Ronan Sheehan hit out at the Ulster Council for not having a championship in place.“I make no bones about this, I think the Ulster Council are reneging on their responsibilities by failing to have an Ulsterchampionship,” he said.

Ciaraacuten McShane died last Monday as a result of a road collision on a stretch of the M motorway in County Louth. On Sunday, mourners at the Church of St John the Baptist heard how the -year-old father-of-two had been working to establish a family home for what he called his ‘wee unit’. Fr Charles Kearney told those gathered for his funeral that the former Crossroads PS and St Paul’s pupil had a great sense of humour. googletag.cmd.push “The fourth and youngest of his family, he turned out to be great craic, very quick-witted,” he said. “He had many, many friends. He was a good son and brother. When he began to go out and about, he ended up in Maghera, in Walsh’s Hotel, where he met the love of his le. “They were together for eleven years, and six, of course, as man and we. They have two beautul children, Conan and Carina.” The congregation heard how Ciaraacuten, a plumber by trade, lived for a Sunday, which he designated as a day to be spent with his young family. googletag.cmd.push “Another important thing for Ciaraacuten was a Sunday,” said Fr Kearney. “Sunday was his family day and he played with the children. They watched movies and had great fun together. He adored them and they adored him. “He had built his own house and was working to establish a good family home for his ‘wee unit’. He was a real family man and he is going to miss so many firsts. “One was coming up very soon, when Conan starts school just across the road in September. In his short le, Ciaraacuten McShane brought so much love, joy and goodness to people. “He most certainly will be rewarded for all of that.” Local Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councillor, Sean Bateson, described Ciaraacuten as a ‘proper gentleman, one of the good guys in le’. Pearse’s GAC, Kilrea, where Ciaraacuten played football in his younger days, said they were ‘deeply saddened’ by his passing. “Ciaran played underage with the club and then came back to kit out for the reserves on many occasions. “One thing that everyone will tell you about Ciaran was that he always had a big smile on his face and his sense of humour was infectious.” Ciaraacuten will be sadly missed by his we Shauna, their children Conan and Carina, his parents Bertie and Patricia and siblings Siobhaacuten, Damian and Odraacuten and all his wider family and friends. Fr Kearney summed things up by telling mourners to look back on all Ciaraacuten achieved. “Sometimes bad things happen accidentally, and we know that’s part of le, but it’s devastating when it happens. “We should look back at his years among you and see what he achieved, and it was much.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The supermarket giant wants to build a new store in the Buncrana Road area of the city. The company first applied for planning permission for the proposed store on a vacant site at the junction of Buncrana Road and Springtown Roadin .  The Derry News has learned that planners at Derry City and Strabane District Council have recommended that planning permission be granted for the store. The final approval for the development now rests with councillors on the council’s planning committee. If the new supermarket gets the green light from local councillors, Lidl says it will close its current store at Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push However, the company would retain its current building for storage purposes. In its planning submissions, Lidl said that they wanted to build a new larger store in Derry because of the lack of expansion space at its present store. The proposed new store would have much more parking facilities. The entrance to the new store would be via the Springtown Road which would reduce the traffic pressure on the busy Buncrana Road. Traffic entering and leaving Lidl’s current store creates a frequent bottleneck on the Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The call comes as bars and restaurants who can provide food on site prepare to open from tomorrow. Among the bars who have grouped together is The Dugout Bar in Maghera, and manager Una McReynolds says those making the rules are out of touch with reality. “The reason we can’t open is because we’ve been told we’re too dangerous,” she told Derry Now. “I would say % of the people making these decisions have never been in a local pub. They’re seeing what goes on in the Cathedral Quarter on a busy Saturday night, but that’s not real le. googletag.cmd.push “If we get four people through the door on a weekday, it’s like Christmas to us, we think it’s great. Even at weekends, we probably still wouldn’t be shoulder to shoulder. “Our customers can’t understand why we aren’t open. People don’t read into the specics of it, so everybody just thinks that all the bars can open tomorrow.” The online petition was launched by the owner of McKenna’s Bar in Armagh and has found support in many quarters, with pubs in Newry and Ballymena voicing support along with The Dugout. With the bigger establishments in a position to open their doors, Una feels the regulations show the inequality and discrimination at play. googletag.cmd.push “Hospitality is hospitality. It’s like saying the barbers can open but the hairdressers can’t, because women sit in the hairdressers longer than a man sits in the barbers,” she said. “We’re completely left alone. There is discrimination and inequality. Local pubs are never going to be able to survivethis continues. “All the big establishments are now allowed m social distancing, we’re not even allowed m. We can’t open our doors at all. “Who’s going to fight for us  I sent a message to a junior minster last week, but he couldn’t answer any of my questions. All he could say was ‘scientic evidence’. “Well, show us the scientic evidence that says sitting at a table, eating a burger and having a glass of wine is okay, but sitting at the same table just drinking a glass of wine is not.” The pressure has been exacerbated by dferences between the ious jurisdictions, and the recent political crisis sparked by Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neills presence at the funeral of veteran republican, Bobby Storey. “Now Sky TV are pushing the small bars to give them an update by July , when they’re going to reinstate charges,” said Una. “They just see that in the UK, the bars are open again. England are open on Saturday, Scotland have a date, the south have a date and the north of Ireland have nothing. “We now are in the situation where those in power have decided to throw their toys out of the pram over the weekend. “We’re in the middle of a pandemic, everyone waits to hear about a date and now they won’t even give press briefings. “Small pubs are the hub of the community. Some people would love to go out and have a pint, but they can’t afford to have a meal with their pint. “We have no one to turn to, because no one is responding. We’ve been left high and dry, nobody is making a decision for us and we are extremely frustrated.” The petition can be viewed here.

The call comes as bars and restaurants who can provide food on site prepare to open from tomorrow. Among the bars who have grouped together is The Dugout Bar in Maghera, and manager Una McReynolds says those making the rules are out of touch with reality. “The reason we can’t open is because we’ve been told we’re too dangerous,” she told Derry Now. “I would say % of the people making these decisions have never been in a local pub. They’re seeing what goes on in the Cathedral Quarter on a busy Saturday night, but that’s not real le. googletag.cmd.push “If we get four people through the door on a weekday, it’s like Christmas to us, we think it’s great. Even at weekends, we probably still wouldn’t be shoulder to shoulder. “Our customers can’t understand why we aren’t open. People don’t read into the specics of it, so everybody just thinks that all the bars can open tomorrow.” The online petition was launched by the owner of McKenna’s Bar in Armagh and has found support in many quarters, with pubs in Newry and Ballymena voicing support along with The Dugout. With the bigger establishments in a position to open their doors, Una feels the regulations show the inequality and discrimination at play. googletag.cmd.push “Hospitality is hospitality. It’s like saying the barbers can open but the hairdressers can’t, because women sit in the hairdressers longer than a man sits in the barbers,” she said. “We’re completely left alone. There is discrimination and inequality. Local pubs are never going to be able to survivethis continues. “All the big establishments are now allowed m social distancing, we’re not even allowed m. We can’t open our doors at all. “Who’s going to fight for us  I sent a message to a junior minster last week, but he couldn’t answer any of my questions. All he could say was ‘scientic evidence’. “Well, show us the scientic evidence that says sitting at a table, eating a burger and having a glass of wine is okay, but sitting at the same table just drinking a glass of wine is not.” The pressure has been exacerbated by dferences between the ious jurisdictions, and the recent political crisis sparked by Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neills presence at the funeral of veteran republican, Bobby Storey. “Now Sky TV are pushing the small bars to give them an update by July , when they’re going to reinstate charges,” said Una. “They just see that in the UK, the bars are open again. England are open on Saturday, Scotland have a date, the south have a date and the north of Ireland have nothing. “We now are in the situation where those in power have decided to throw their toys out of the pram over the weekend. “We’re in the middle of a pandemic, everyone waits to hear about a date and now they won’t even give press briefings. “Small pubs are the hub of the community. Some people would love to go out and have a pint, but they can’t afford to have a meal with their pint. “We have no one to turn to, because no one is responding. We’ve been left high and dry, nobody is making a decision for us and we are extremely frustrated.” The petition can be viewed here.

In an anonymous poll conducted by the County Derry Post, with  responses,  of John McEvoys squad indicated they would play for Team Ulster, yet only eight of the squad would see it as a benefit to hurling in the county. As part of the survey comments were sought. One said it was a good idea but it wouldnt be easily organised. All the rest spoke out against it, citing a range of reasons. googletag.cmd.push The combined Ulster team wouldnt compete with Top  teams for the McCarthy Cup, hence it would be a waste of time and resources should be used to get the Ulster championship resurrected. Another respondent pointed to Derrys ability to compete in the Joe McDonagh Cupall the best players in Derry were playing. With more publicity, the current tiered structure was the better solution. Team Ulster would paper over the cracks was another comment, with the already considerable training load also offered as a reason to oppose the concept. On the topic of bringing back the Ulster senior hurling championship,  players indicated it should be ed after its three-year absence. googletag.cmd.push One respondent, who commented at , felt Team Ulster was nice to chat about but would only serve players who felt they needed to be playing in the Liam McCarthy Cup. Full commitment to the Derry jersey, from all the best players, full backing from the county board and supporters, was the way forward, something he felt was happening. Of the squad,  felt it should be played after the league and before the tiered hurling championships, such as the Christy Ring and Joe McDonagh Cups. The remainder opted for a window in pre-season, before the leagues. One respondent felt that Antrim would be so far away from the rest of the pack, but a combined rest of Ulster team playing the Saffrons would diminish the competition.

forward was held in the town on Monday morning, with Ards and North Down Council officials joined by Chamber of Commerce representatives and local councillor Deborah Girvan.Work has been ongoing to develop a strategy on the way forward for Comber as coronavirus lockdown measures continue to ease, with more and more businesses reopening after being closed for four months.News of Mondayrsquos meeting comes ahead of the reopening of the hugely popular Comber Farmersrsquo Market tomorrow which also coincides with its sixth anniversary.A special cake will be cut by council chairman Trevor Cummings who will be joined by Northern Ireland Officer Minister of State Robin Walker.The market has been closed for the past three months as a result of Covid- with its reopening viewed as a boost for existing traders who will benefit from the increased footfall.Alderman Girvan mdash who arranged Mondayrsquos meeting in conjunction with Comber Chamber of Commerce mdash said cafes, restaurants and pubs have been among the hardest hit industries during the coronavirus pandemic.And with the hospitality businesses able to open their doors to the public this Friday, she thought that it would be beneficial to meet with the council to see what support it give to catering businesses to allow food to be served outdoors on pavements.ldquoEven though the two-metre social distancing rule will be halved, it will still be dficult for hospitality businesses to increase their capacity unless they expand outdoors, said Mrs Girvan.ldquoComber is the perfect place to introduce a cafeacute culture as there are wide footpaths on three sides of the town square and,permission for this is granted, it will create a kaleidoscope of colourful tables, chairs and umbrella shades.Mrs Girvan hopes that it will also attract more shoppers, cyclists and visitors to Comber as it slowly emerges out of lockdown.She also recognises that before anything happens, there are many issues to consider and for consultation with residents and businesses, describing Mondayrsquos meeting as a ldquofirst step to explore the opportunities and possibilities of reconfiguring footpaths to ensure the safety of visitors, shoppers, and cyclists.News of the cafe culture plan comes just days after the local council agreed to help hospitality businesses back on their feet by waiving the pound fee for a so-called pavement cafeacute licence fee, initially for nine months.Comber Chamber of Commerce chairwoman Laura Bradley, who is also director of the Indie Fude delicatessen, described the past few as ldquoextremely dficult for retailers across Northern Ireland.She said apart from shops that are selling food and drink, the majority of businesses in Comber have been closed for almost four months.ldquoComber has been branded the lsquohome of great tastersquo and the town has built up a strong reputation for producing, cooking and serving excellent food, continued Laura.ldquoWe have the monthly artisan farmersrsquo market, award winning restaurants, cafes and food shops, and a discerning customer base which comes from far and wide to avail of high quality, locally grown produce.The Chamber chairwoman said she had no doubt that creating a cafeacute culture will not only help all the businesses in Comber, but also help build upon the success of the food industry that is firmly established in the area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Championship draws made  ","story":"THE draws for the  Down Football

have welcomed the resumption of church services after they were suspended  weeks ago due to the Covid- pandemic.Services resumed on Monday after the Northern Ireland Executive announced that public worship could restart.While the parish priest of Castlewellan and Kilcoo, Fr Denis McKinley, was happy to be finally able to celebrate Mass again with his parishioners he said he remained apprehensive over some peoplersquos reluctance to follow social distancing.He said: ldquoI have noticed people are getting fed up with adhering to government guidelines especially over the course of a wake and a funeral. They seem reluctant to continue with the measures that are in place.ldquoI fear the ramications for a further spike in virus casestoo many people all come at once. I would hate to have to turn people away because there are too many already attending Mass. That would only serve to hurt people and I donrsquot want to offend anyone.Fr McKinley suggested that he may have to develop a whole new regime to facilitate parishioners attending Mass and receiving communion.He added: ldquoI have no problem with weekday Masses as the numbers who attend are certainly more manageable. However, I would much prefer to continue to celebrate Mass online on Sundays and distribute Holy Communion at the back doors of the church at a scheduled time later on that day.ldquoWhen the R rate of the virus s to zero and the threat of contamination ceases we will be a lot more relaxed about ato normality. Until then we will be monitoring the situation carefully.The Rev Owen Patterson, minister of Downpatrick Presbyterian Church, shared Fr McKinleyrsquos reservations.He said: ldquoWhile I welcome ato normality some members of our congregation are either elderly or already have underlying conditions that would make them more susceptible to the virus.ldquoWe have found our online worship on Sunday mornings has proved extremely popular. We have many more people tuning in online than we other wise would have had attending our services in Church.ldquoHopefully, we will have an increased congregation when weto Sunday worship in church. We will begin introducing services slowly but without offering a creche or Sunday School to begin with. We will review the situation carefully in August.Mr Patterson said provision had been made to have the church ready to facilitate the resumption of services.He added: ldquoWe have established pens for families who can sit together for worship and sectioned off other seating areas for the more vulnerable. Sermons will also be kept short.He said that anyone wishing to view their Sunday worship online can log on to downpatrickpresbyterian.org or visit their Facebook page for live streaming.The Dean of Down Cathedral, the Very Rev Henry Hull, said he was looking forward to beginning public worship again and welcoming everyone back this Sunday.However, he urged anyone feeling unwell not to come to church.In a letter to parishioners he said: ldquoTheto worship will be on a phased basis beginning with some of the larger churches first.ldquoWe will also adopt a dferent pattern of service times during the summer period, spreading services throughout the day.He added that face coverings were not a requirement at this stage..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Driving force  ","story":"TEENAGE motor racing sensation Daniel Harper has successfully tackled the world famous Nurburgring race circuit in Germany.The  year-old from Annahilt drove the notoriously dficult -mile track for the first time when he made his debut outing in the Nurburgring Endurance Series with the BMW Junior Team.Afterwards he described it as an ldquoinvaluable learning experience, despite an unfortunate technical problem which meant he couldnrsquot contest the race itself.Harper, who has enjoyed a meteoric rise in motorsport was announced as a member of the coveted BMW Junior Team programme in January.He was completing an extensive pre-season training schedule when the coronavirus pandemic led to the postponement of the programme in March.At the start of June, he ed to Germany and last week he drove the Nurburgring mdash scene of some of motor racingrsquos greatest feats mdash as he successfully completed his DMSB permit test for the track.For the opening race event, Harper and his team-mates shared a BMW Mi Racing, the German manufacturerrsquos potent, entry-level car.

In this his third series, Joe s with another fascinating set of programmes celebrating the mighty achievements of the past that have transformed our daily living and reveals the cutting-edge technology that is shaping the future of our infrastructure.With the help of the experts in their respective fields, Joe reveals the stories behind some of Northern Irelandrsquos well-known landmarks and also sheds light on how civil engineering is in operation quite literally beneath our feet!Get ready to go salt mining, quarry blasting, castle roofing, engine restoring, road surfacing and flood preventing to name a few of the activities that Joe gets involved with in this series.In the opening episode which airs next Monday night at pm, Joe visits Delamont which nestles on the shores of the internationally acclaimed waterway.The country park is home to the largest monolith or standing stone in the UK and Ireland, with the signicant landmark standing  metres tall and weighing in at almost  tonnes.Ancient civilisations throughout the world marked important occasions and cosmic events by erecting megaliths, often in circles or other formations, but sometimes as free-standing monoliths. There are over , megaliths in Europe alone but the one outside Killyleagh is quite possibly the most recent of them all.It was erected in  with one thousand young people raising the so-called Strangford Stone using only their bare hands and a lot of scientic know-how.Joe speaks to the people involved in the original design and installation of the stone which was a feat in civil, mechanical and electrical engineering.Safety was a massive consideration, given that , young people were to be on site pulling the stone upright by hand into position.It is certainly a very special monument, not only because itrsquos a Millennium Stone, but also because of the remarkable way in which it was erected.Among those whom Joe talks to are Saintfieldrsquos Martyn Todd, who was heavily involved in the megalith project. His daughter, Katy, one of the volunteers who helped pull the giant stone into place.The tallest megalith in the British Isles faces the Mourne Mountains from where it was excavated.After being quarried in the Mournes, the huge stone was transported by road to the country park and was described by the Millennium Commission as ldquoone of the simplest and most directly appealing of all the year  projects.Four years before it was hauled into place, a group of people decided to bring , young people together to celebrate the start of a new millennium by pulling up the stone.They hoped, as the peace process was gaining momentum, to involve young people from all backgrounds in Northern Ireland to create a lasting testament to a shared future.In November , the Millennium Commission awarded pound, to the Strangford Stone project, with the remaining costs donated as contributions in kind by all the people who worked on it.The former Down Council gave permission for Delamont to become home to the stone which is located on an elevated site which boasts superb views over Strangford Lough and towards Slieve Croob and the Mountains of Mourne.The McConnell family quarried a single block of granite weighing over  tonnes mdash the largest ever-quarried in Ireland mdash trimmed it along the grain of rock, using the ancient plug and feathers technique, to its smallest natural size, twelve and a half metres long.However, during the trimming, a weakness in the granite was discovered, resulting in the stone being split into two parts and then rejoined with three stainless steel dowels.A special steel cradle to support the stone during the pull was designed, as were special low-stretch ropes, a hydraulic safety system and the three metres deep concrete foundation for the stone.

They can afford to employ a mountain guide like me. Doing the Matterhorn and Eiger are much more technical guiding as it on a one to one ratio.ldquoMont Blanc is mostly snow and ice and really exposed with some sections of scrambling where with the Matterhorn, you are pretty much on your hands from the start all the way to the top and all the way back down.Mont Blanc at , metres is the high European peak outside Russia and a mountain that Paul has come to know very well. He prefers to take his clients up later during the day, descending near sunset, to avoid the growing numbers of commercial climbers.Supported by the French government during lockdown from March , Paul has been able toto guiding over the last six weeks but he was still hampered by the fact says that British and Irish people were unable to fly.Born in Vancouver to Northern Ireland parents who emigrated to Canada to escape the Troubles, Paul was  when the announcement of the first IRA ceasefire came in . A year later the family moved back and decided to settle in Newcastle.He was one of the first students to attend Shimna Integrated College at its current King Street site in Newcastle and within years Paul showed his love of the outdoors, particularly mountains.ldquoMy dad and I used to walk in the Mourne mountains, he said. ldquoI had skied in Canada, but really got into the mountains back home.ldquoMy first experience of rock climbing was being taken to Altnadue Quarry just outside Castlewellan by a family friend and I just loved it.ldquoWhile I had played soccer and done a bit of running for the school, I wasnrsquot really into sports. It was around my fth year that I really veered to be more interested in outdoor pursuits. I really didnrsquot knowI wanted it as a career but after getting into climbing, it did shape what options that I was interested in.Paul went on to do a degree in outdoor education at the University of Central Lancashire and made the Tollymore National Outdoor Centre his second home when he ed home during holidays and post-college.Once he completed college, his time was split between taking climbing and outdoor pursuit courses back home. While working in France, he would ski and climb during the day in the Alps and work in bars at night, with the sole focus of funding trips such as climbing El Capitan twice or climbing in Patagonia.He went on to become a guide with the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations, which is the highest recognised mountaineering qualication in the world and the only qualication valid to work outside the UK and Ireland for climbing and off-piste skiing on glaciated terrain.Paulrsquos only salaried job to date was as a youth development officer for Mountaineering Ireland for four years from  based out of Tollymore where he taught young climbers the importance of enjoying the mountains responsibly and safely.Paul said: ldquoI worked every minute I could freelancing to fund the next trip and when I ran out of money, I came back home to work again. Up until my late s, I never thought much about the future, it was just living for the moment.ldquoIrsquove never really had a secure income until I had the Mountaineering Ireland job and it allowed me to buy a house in Castlewellan.While his responsibility to provide for his family is uppermost in his mind, Paul is not yet finished with his need to climb and explore mdash although, interestingly, the worldrsquos highest mountain, Everest, is not on his wish list.ldquoTherersquos a letime of climbs that I would love to do, said Paul. ldquoI love to go back to Patagonia in Argentina to climb Cerro Torre, which for me is the most beautul mountain in the world every climber dreams of standing on top of it. Or the Blasket Islands innorthern Canada would be quite high on my list.ldquoEverest has never appealed to me to go and climb as itrsquos not very dficult technically now. Itrsquos a challenge due to the seriousness of the weather and acclimatising to the attitude makes an extremely serious mountain because of its height.ldquoBut I donrsquot think you need a huge amount of skill to get up Everest and I donrsquot believe you actually have to be a rock climber. You do need to be fit and to be able to acclimatise your body to altitude and you need to have a lot of money.His friend and mentor Dawson Stelfox mdash who became the first Irish man to ascend Everest on his own in May,  mdash is something of a trailblazer to Paul.ldquoI didnrsquot realise that in , when Dawson made the summit on his own, there were no fixed ropes as there are today, there wasnrsquot the support from Sherpas and so on, said Paul.ldquoThat would appeal to meEverest was like that now, then I would love to go. But I donrsquot want to and sit and wait in a queue of  people to get to the top of the mountain.ldquoI really like to explore and there would need to be technical challenge to it as well, apart from overcoming the physical challenges and altitude.ldquoIf you were to take El Cap and put it somewhere a bit remote where it would take you a couple of days to get to it and very few people have climbed it, you would have about , metres of vertical rock to climb.

This allowed pupils from beginners through to seniors to engage in drama lessons and fully prepare for their exams.The lessons were fun-filled and although each of the pupils were in their own homes, they were able to interact with one another, as well as their teacher, to continue to develop their communication and performance skills.They discussed and recited their favourite novels, poetry and some unseen extracts.Clare said: ldquoEach and every one of the pupils adapted so well which is a testament to their resilience during such uncertain times. They are all a real credit to their parents who were so very supportive throughout the whole experience.The exam took place with a New Era Academy examiner in England assessing the pupils online via Zoom.Clare said: ldquoThe whole experience was so smooth and parents even commented on how easy it was to use. They commented that the examiner was friendly, made the children feel at ease but was thorough and professional in her approach.The third term of speech and drama was certainly very dferent. Clare had lessons for everyone, even those who chose not to do exams.ldquoEach lesson was fun and vibrant and certainly allowed the children to continue to develop in confidence and perform on screen with their friends each and every week, she added. Clare hopes to continue lessons again soon and plans to keep online lessons, as well as the regular workshop classes for anyone who is interested.Mourne Stars Speech and Drama can be followed on Facebook and Instagram for regular updates..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Table tennis star Niamh  ","story":"A LOUGHINISLAND girl has the table tennis world in a spin.Twelve year-old Niamh Mason is ranked No  in Ireland in her age group and has been selected for Ulster and Ireland squads.She has also won one major championship and finished runner-up in another.

Powys.NRW proposed the dam as one option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal case for this option, it is therefore clear that we will not be pursuing an upstream storage scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

ldquoThe best part of le-boating is working well as a team.ldquoWe maintain this team spirit by regularly exercising and training both ashore and afloat.ldquoSince opening our new station at the south

favourite rsquoshoutsrsquo are oddly those which occur in the early hours of the morning on a spring day.ldquoBy the time the job has been completed and the boats are washed down and prepared again

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

balances.\"Itrsquos ironic in some ways as when we were setting the budget for this financial year, some of our members wanted to use them and reduce the council tax levels.\"If we had done that, we would not have the buffer we have now.\"Itrsquos fortuitous that at that time I resisted, because I didnrsquot want to be in a position where we would not have finances available to respond to an emergency.\"I didnrsquot know that the coronavirus was going to hit us, but clearly it is having an effect.\"Wersquore not collecting business rates because wersquove given lots of businesses a payment holiday and wersquove also issued a considerable number of grants to businesses.\"We have paid out more than pound million in grants to businesses, which we will get back from Welsh Government, but therersquos no guarantee that all businesses will survive this.\"Wersquove also granted some rent relief for businesses who operate in council-owned premises for the first three months of this year, but who knows how long this pandemic will last \"Whilst Welsh Government has been able to provide some additional funding to local authorities, they have not got a bottomless pit of money either.\"Wersquore also paying out grants to charities and amateur sports clubs.\"\"Covid- is also having an effect on the council tax relief scheme,\" Cllr Moore said. \"The Government currently provides money to help people on low incomes claim a discount.\"The level of funding was set prior to this pandemic and the call on this funding is already increasing.\"This may not be sustainable and we may have to fund it ourselves.\"Applications for that fund have gone up immensely since the covid- situation.\"The Welsh Local Government Association believe there could be a spending increase of around pound million across Wales.\"For us that would equate to around pound,.\"At the moment, we can code spending against the pandemic and make claims to Welsh Government, as is every other local authority in Wales.\"But I emphasise, therersquos no guarantee that it is going to go on forever.\"The virus has also seen internal costs increase in certain areas.\"We needed to upgrade our IT facilities and expenditure on waste and recycling is also rising.\"Wersquove had to increase our investment in IT because a considerable number of staff are now working from home.\"Originally, we thought we were going to get all of that back, but now wersquove been told wersquore only going to get  per cent.\"Thatrsquos an expense we didnrsquot anticipate and itrsquos an expense we will have to absorb.\"The other added expenditure is due to people being out of work or furloughed.\"We have seen increases in applications for universal credit and thatrsquos going to have an impact on us in terms of the ability to collect rents and council tax.\"Exactly what that impact will be is unclear.ldquoDespite that, we are continuing to run services, as far as possible and we have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is having a massive impact on the council and the community.\"The exact extent of this impact is very dficult to estimate, but we will continue to support the community until it is defeated.\"He added:

From this date, passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations. There will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of . Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said: “As we move through the Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety of passengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued: “We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is also important that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe. You have been the leaders in Northern Ireland fighting Covid- and I am asking you to keep it up and we will beat this together. “By acting together and thinking of each other we can reduce the risk of transmission.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fcdfcfdaedadf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bffbacbfdaaf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
