She can\u0027t seem to predict or control when she uses the bathroom.\u0027Last night she s**t ON Johnny while he was sleeping, like all over him. Not exaggerating.\u0027Mr Murphy said in his witness statement that, when he spoke to Depp in April 2016 about the \u0027defecation incident\u0027, the actor was \u0027sullen and disgusted\u0027.Ms Wass read two text messages sent by Depp shortly after the incident, saying that in one, he wrote \u0027my wife left a whopper poop on my bed\u0027 and \u0027then he says \u0027Amber Turd\u0027\u0027.She said: \u0027In fact, it appears from those texts that Depp found the subject quite amusing,\u0027 to which Mr Murphy said he thought the actor was being \u0027sarcastic\u0027.Mr Murphy was asked if Heard had told him the faeces in the bed was a \u0027harmless prank\u0027, and said: \u0027She certainly did.\u0027Yesterday morning, Depp\u0027s previous estate manager, Ben King, gave evidence that Depp and Heard \u0027argued like schoolchildren\u0027, with explosive rows starting from \u0027banal beginnings\u0027.He claimed Heard was the \u0027antagoniser\u0027 in the relationship, often \u0027goading\u0027 and attempting to provoke the actor.Mr King, who worked for the Hollywood star for three separate periods between 2014 and 2016, said he never saw Depp \u0027be violent or unkind towards Heard, or indeed towards anyone else\u0027.In his first witness statement, Mr King said that in March 2015 he was summoned to the house the couple were renting in Australia, where he found a \u0027significant amount of damage\u0027 and discovered the actor\u0027s severed fingertip on the floor of the bar area while cleaning up broken glass and debris.Depp has been accused of subjecting Heard to a \u0027three-day hostage situation\u0027 and trashing the house during the Australia trip, which he denies.His finger was severed during the stay, which he says was caused by Ms Heard throwing a vodka bottle at him, which she denies. Yesterday, the court did not have time to hear from actress Ryder, who was engaged to Mr Depp in the 1990s, or Katherine Kendall, an actress and #MeToo advocate who claims she was \u0027misquoted\u0027 in The Sun\u0027s article.Depp is suing NGN and its executive editor Dan Wootton over the publication of an article headlined: \u0027Gone Potty: How can JK Rowling be \u0027genuinely happy\u0027 casting wife beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?\u0027.His lawyers say the article bore the meaning there was \u0027overwhelming evidence\u0027 Depp assaulted Heard on a number of occasions and left her \u0027in fear for her life\u0027.Heard claims that, during an incident in Australia, she was subjected to a \u0027three-day hostage situation\u0027 during which Depp drank to excess and took pills.NGN is defending the article as true, and says Depp was \u0027controlling and verbally and physically abusive towards Heard, particularly when he was under the influence of alcohol andor drugs\u0027.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Kanye ballot Oklahoma Rapper pays 35 000 qualify November","story":"Share this articleKanye West will appear on Oklahoma presidential election ballot | US news | The Guardian"},{"url":null,"title":"Fox Nick Cannon apologize Masked Singer job sources say","story":"Share this articleKareem Abdul-Jabbar: Where Is the Outrage Over Anti-Semitism in Sports and Hollywood? | Hollywood Reporter"},{"url":null,"title":"Private girls school Dorset plunges administration closes immediate effect","story":"Share this articleSt Mary\u0027s Shaftesbury falls into administration after deal with Chinese investors collapses - Business Live"},{"url":null,"title":"Motorways look like cross caravan boat school holidays start families","story":"Share this articleUK weather forecast: Brits to bake in 29C today before cooler air and heavy rain - Mirror Online"},{"url":null,"title":"From opulence obscurity difference year makes royal weddings","story":"It is understood Edo’s father, Nikki’s first husband, the Olympic skier Count Alessandro Mapelli Mozzi, who holds British and Italian citizenship, was invited, but it is not clear whether he went. A source said they thought it ‘unlikely’ and the pair are ‘not close’.Sources said it was impossible to invite other members of the Royal Family ‘because if you invite one, questions will be asked as to why you didn’t invite the others and there are just too many of them’.An insider said that while it wasn’t the first time that the Queen and her husband have seen members of their family it was still the first family ‘event’ the elderly couple have attended in months.Beatrice and Edo had planned to wed at the Chapel Royal at St James’s Palace on May 29 in front of 150 guests, followed by a reception in the garden at Buckingham Palace.The couple, who spent lockdown together at the home of Edo’s mother and her husband in Oxfordshire, decided to just ‘sit back’ and wait to see how things went. Their only stipulation was that they did not want to have to wait too long to tie the knot – even if it had meant it was just the two of them – and that if they could have a small wedding then the Queen, 94 and Philip, 99, had to be there.When the Government announced that from July 4 weddings with up to 30 socially-distanced guests would be permitted, Beatrice and Edo – with her doting mother taking charge of the arrangements – sprang into action. The 190-year-old All Saints Chapel, also called The Royal Chapel of All Saints or Queen Victoria’s Chapel, is Grade II listed. The Queen regularly attends Sunday service when she is in the area, as did her mother before her.It has the bonus of being completely private – cut off from any members of the public and press – which meant that Andrew who has been keeping a low profile due to the Epstein scandal, would not have to be seen in public.News of Beatrice’s wedding began to break only after a photographer spotted Philip and the Queen, resplendent in a turquoise coat and hat with flowers, being driven in their official car from Windsor Castle up the Long Walk and through the Great Park to the church.Both the ceremony and a reception at Andrew’s home afterward were organised with strict social distancing in mind. Covid-19 guidelines say wedding ceremonies must be kept as short as possible with no food or drink and singing and playing of instruments to be avoided, so the family congregated in the garden.The Queen was one of the first to leave the party at 11.45am in order to honour Captain Tom at the castle.The newly-weds decided not to release the traditional wedding photograph until today to avoid overshadowing the knighthood ceremony.One close family friend said Wolfie was a star turn, adding: ‘Wolfie has spent a lot of time with them and although Beatrice is, of course, hugely respectful that she is his step-mother and Dara is a wonderful mother, she does love Wolfie very deeply. Beatrice is a very sweet, very sensitive young woman.’Another friend said the past year had been a ‘tremendously difficult one for the family’ due to the scrutiny over Andrew’s friendship with Epstein.‘Those children have been so devastated by it all, so it was really nice to have this wedding away from the public eye,’ they said.‘They were all there and Sarah kept the show on the road. Very, very few people were given any information about it.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Sailors told stop using male themed Navy terms like unmanned man power","story":"Share this articleRoyal Navy bans terms \u0027unmanned\u0027 and \u0027manpower\u0027 because it’s \u0027sexist\u0027Royal Navy Commander Sarah West: Sub hunting with first female commander of major Navy warship - Mirror Online"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/958a1e42d1431928f6b34feaa51b7a96e44e9906/0_312_6221_3733/master/6221.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71158d7289fc6133fb40013fae9ac271","title":"lisbon back alley fado legends photo essay","story":"A portrait of Lisbon, saudade and the fado folk music of the city and its relationship with tourism. Henri Kisielewski is the 2019 recipient of the Joan Wakelin bursary, administrated in partnership with the Royal Photographic SocietyFado is Lisbon’s urban folk music, born in and around the brothels, alleyways and ​tascas ​of the city’s poorest neighbourhoods. Fado is to Lisbon what the Blues are to the Delta. Written records trace it back to the early 19th century, though some argue it is much older, connecting it to oral traditions imported from across the Portuguese empire.At the heart of fado is ​saudade.​ This elusive word – apparently untranslatable from the original Portuguese – broadly refers to a sense of sorrow, of yearning, and a resigned desire for what once was. This is the underlying emotion of all fado and perhaps of Lisbon itself.Alfama is Lisbon’s oldest surviving neighbourhood: a maze of medieval and moorish architectures arranged in a patchwork of steep cobbled alleyways and red-clay roofs, rising up from the Tagus river. Once a close-knit fishing community, it is now the heart of Lisbon’s tourist industry.A decade ago, struggling to recover from a deep recession, Portugal’s government turned to tourism and opened the real-estate market to foreign speculation. Today, more then half of all accommodation in Alfama is destined for tourism and thousands of long-standing residents have been priced out of the city centre. One after another, the shops that catered to the local community closed to make way for tourist-facing businesses – many of which are “fado restaurants” – and now Alfama feels more like a theme park than a living neighbourhood. This touristification is affecting much of the city​.​ If things keep going the way they are, one journalist wrote in 2016, Lisbon will soon have to hire extras to play Portuguese people in its streets.In 2019, I spent a month in Lisbon exploring the complicated relationship between fado and tourism. On one hand, fado is often upheld as the essence of Lisbon, an incorruptible mainstay in a rapidly changing city. On the other, it is the main attraction for many of the city’s 4.5 million visitors and is increasingly commodified to meet this demand.A recurring feature in many fados is Lisbon itself, in particular what it used to be. In its long history, many forces have played a hand in altering the city and its social fabric, the destructive 1755 earthquake being a key example. Today’s aggressive touristification is another seismic event, the full impact of which is yet to be fully understood.In many cases, the allusions within fado’s poems refer to both a real and an imagined history, both a concrete remembrance and an imprecise, idealised version of the way things were. In fado, truth and fiction coexist, history and myth are tangled.There is a parallel between this ambiguous relationship to the city, past and present, and the experience of modern tourism. In ​Invisible Cities,​ Italo Calvino describes travellers visiting the fictional metropolis of Maurilia. They are invited to accompany their experience of the present with the help of old postcards that depict how Maurilia once was, the “postcard city” being key to appreciating the city as it now stands.Travellers​ arrive in a location hoping that it will live up to what they had imagined, and are quicker to see the postcard city than the place itself. Over time, the place changes to fit this imagined expectation. It’s paradoxical, wrote the mayor of Barcelona in 2014, but uncontrolled mass tourism ends up destroying the very things that made a city attractive to visitors in the first place.This is particularly obvious in Lisbon, where the sheer speed of change and lack of oversight have magnified the problem. Once the locals have left, once all the menus are in English and, when looking down the ancient, winding alleyways to the waterfront, one is more likely to see the hulking mass of a cruise ship than the water of the Tagus river, what remains is a longing for what has been lost – whether real or imagined. What remains is saudade​.In an anonymous back street, far from the tourist gaze, there is one establishment like no other: a small fado house in a former Italian restaurant where fadistas meet once their tourist-facing engagements are done with. It’s an institution in Lisbon’s underground scene, open from midnight to 6am, and not featured in any guidebooks. I have been asked not to name it for fear that a surge in popularity might affect its delicate ecosystem.Inside, old fado legends glance out from yellowed posters in crooked frames and black funereal shawls – traditionally worn by female fadistas – hang proudly among them like team scarves in a football clubhouse. Thick red curtains cover the windows and the blue formica floor tiles have turned a minty green from decades of bleach and wine.This is the home of​ fadovadio,​ where amateurs and professionals take turns interpreting the canon. It is not uncommon to see a performance by a taxi driver followed by a well-known fadista, and then a butcher’s wife. One regular performer is a respected professor of Medieval bureaucracy.Any mention of this place elicits amused disdain from the owners and staff of the more “respectable” fado houses f​adovadio ​is not serious, they will say.​ ​But it is known to them all and they, too, can be spotted here on occasion, drinking from the source.Manuelo is the master of ceremonies, a prickly and charismatic octogenarian who made a name for himself in fado circles in the mid-60s. Donna Lena, his Russian wife, is a striking blond of ferocious energy. She spends each night serving drinks, making food and tending to the guests’ every need. Donna Lena and her husband are the adoptive parents of Lisbon’s fado community. The story goes that she ran away from the Soviet ballet to marry him when on tour in Portugal. But, here too, myth and history are tangled.At 2am, the performances are about to begin and the air is thick with smoke and anticipation. Beyond the laughter and chatting, one can make out the gentle cacophony of string instruments being tuned.During each set, the fadista performs four or five pieces. Lulled by wine and the red-tinged darkness, the audience is gradually swept up by the music, taken on a hazy voyage that evokes homesick sailors, despairing lovers and death. Some rest their heads in their hands, others stare wistfully into space. There is always at least one person who closes their eyes and falls into a deep sleep.One Saturday, around 5am, Marta Rosa appeared at the door with her small entourage. We had been introduced early in my stay and she proved invaluable in helping me navigate the intricacies of Lisbon fado.Donna Lena was tallying up the night’s damage for a customer with wine-stained lips. An old woman was handing Manuelo a framed picture of herself for the wall.Aside from the table of white-haired men arguing over a card game, the fadistas had the place to themselves. Marta joined the others in the back an L-shaped section of the room that is the domain of the performers.Five or six musicians and a handful of singers were sitting around the wonky tables that had, over the years, been demoted from the main room. By pivoting my chair I was now on the fringes of this new circle. I remember thinking it was a fitting place for me: neither a fadista nor a guest an interloper of sorts, a tourist who looks down on other tourists.There was a loud dissonant jumble, like a music lesson before the teacher arrives. Marta removed her coat and stood with her chin raised, her hands clasped tight in front of her. Then someone played the opening melody of Amália Rodrigues’ Ai Mouraria,​ and the cacophony fell silent. Donna Lena switched off the lights and accompaniment soon came from two sides as Marta began to sing.Her voice was soft to begin with. She floated through the high notes with a plaintive vibrato, squeezing emotion out of every drooping cadence. Then her song grew more forceful. By the end, it filled the whole room as she raised her chin higher, revealing the taught muscles in her neck.Almost as soon as the piece was over, amidst a few friendly heckles, a new one took off on another table. Poems succeeded each other in this frenzy into the early morning with different permutations, styles and rhythms, each singer owning the room in their own way. Occasionally, during a song, the words ​“O Fado” escaped someone’s mouth like a libation, in a voice both hushed and loud. This, I came to learn, was the signal that fado was happening.​Ricardo Ribeiro, one of the icons of modern fado, had explained it to me as a “manifestation”, a moment when everything comes together and all present share a sort of metaphysical communion. When the instruments disappear to leave only music, he had said, and the words disappear to leave only feeling, that is fado.On my last night in Lisbon, I walked down towards the centre of Alfama. I passed a wall near a shuttered restaurant where the words “Locals Welcome” had been thinly painted over and new grafitti had appeared: “Welcome Locals”.During my stay, I saw fado in cramped apartments and concert halls, street corners, ballrooms and sticky-floored taverns where tourists queued at the door. I visited evening classes in a suburb of tower blocks where a new sense of community has formed around fado. I attended a fundraising concert for a disabled girl where fado was the order of the day.The roots of fado run deep in Lisbon and that doesn’t seem likely to change. More than once I heard of the three F’s that make up the Portuguese spirit: Fado, Futebol, Fátima.Just as it survived the censorship and co-opting of the Salazar regime, fado’s essence will likely survive the effects of mass tourism. In fact, singing a more predictable version to tourists allows the majority of fadistas to live from their craft and in turn, allows “real” fado to survive.Trying to make sense of it all, I kept coming back to what Ricardo Ribeiro had said. He wasn’t interested in the distinction between “real” fado or tourist fado, commodification or authenticity only that once in a while, wherever it might be, fado h​appened.​Beside the church of Sao Miguel, the terraces of three restaurants share a sloping square around an old palm tree. In a doorway, a large woman was singing an epic fado about desire, loss and revenge, but her heart wasn’t in it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f960f07252f1852557a32859890ee891a502e4ae/0_209_4840_2906/master/4840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e0d07da5b06e8f4c95c0a840067cee3","title":"appledore book festival shifts gears first drive in book event coronavirus devon","story":"Rethought for the pandemic, this year’s Appledore book festival in Devon will play to audiences in cars, who can flash their lights and listen via radioBooklovers at the Appledore book festival this September will not be able to subject their favourite authors to the usual detailed questioning after a reading. Instead, the north Devon event is setting out to become the UK’s first ever drive-in book festival, where audience members will need to submit questions in advance, and flash their car lights to alert writers to their presence.The Appledore book festival has been running annually since 2006, but organisers said that after months of uncertainty caused by the coronavirus, it became clear that this year’s event would not be able to go ahead if social distancing was still in place. Many of the UK’s book festivals, from Hay to Wigtown, have gone online-only in the wake of the pandemic, but the Appledore team came up with the idea of a drive-in festival, to be held in the grounds of the local Skern Lodge outdoor activity centre.Authors and interviewers will sit, socially distanced, on stage and more than 100 cars will be able to attend each event, listening to interviews through a dedicated in-car FM radio station, or via the PA system. Food and drink will be available to order in advance, served directly to the car once parked, and as guests leave, there will be a drive-through book stall selling signed copies.“We’ve hung on and we’ve kept our fingers crossed, but it became very apparent in the last few weeks that we couldn’t book our usual venues, and people were obviously concerned about any social distancing that might take place,” said festival director Ann Juby. “So we came up with the idea of a drive-in. We were reading about cinema going that way, and comedy festivals. We made some investigations, and it’s on – full steam ahead. People are going to feel safe because they will stay in their cars.”The five-day festival, which kicks off on 18 September, is set to welcome writers including former children’s laureate and War Horse author Michael Morpurgo, bestselling novelist Adele Parks, television presenter Kate Humble, former British ambassador to the US Kim Darroch, and broadcaster and author Jeremy Vine.Guests will be able to send in questions in advance for authors to answer during their events, said Juby. “We’ll also have a mic at a distance, so people can wind their windows down to ask a question, and if we pull out a question sent in before the event, we’ll ask the person who sent it in to flash their car lights so the author can engage. We’re trying to make it as interactive as possible, and luckily we’re in a field so at the end we can have applause and honking of horns and flashing of lights, to make it exciting.”The festival is a registered charity, and profits support a local schools literacy programme. Vine, the festival’s patron, said: “Lockdown has been so hard for everyone but we honestly believe that, as things ease, people will be more desperate than ever for their annual fix of literature by the sea. If there’s ever been a drive-in book festival before, I’ve yet to hear of it. I hope we have a festival like no other, and show the horrible coronavirus that you can’t keep our great writers down.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7acd762ca345a461e3c0ca41194ceb0d1b16c46a/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9dd9e2319541131370d04e180b9712c","title":"asda hq staff must return to office at least once a week from august","story":"Move by supermarket is first switch away from working from home by major companyAll Asda office staff are expected to return to the supermarket’s Leeds headquarters next month in one of the first switches away from working from home by a major company.The UK’s third largest grocer said it expected all its staff to spend at least some time in the office every week from the start of August after putting in place measures to ensure social distancing. Up to 1,000 employees will be able to work in the office at any one time.A spokesman said: “We have always worked to follow government guidelines around Covid and reopened our home offices in May for colleagues who could not easily work from home and have comprehensive measures in place to keep colleagues safe and maintain social distancing.“The number of colleagues returning to the office has gradually increased since then as they see the benefits of balancing home and office working, and our expectation is that all colleagues will spend some time in the office each week from the start of August onwards.”Despite the government’s efforts to persuade those who can safely do so to return to city centres and offices in a bid to restart the economy, many major companies are continuing to keep the bulk of their office from staff working from home. Trade unions say more guidance and support is required to ensure a safe return to work from 1 August.Businesses and workers say a return to the office should be linked to schools reopening, and more capacity on public transport and wider public services.Sainsbury’s has said it is unlikely to bring the majority of office staff back for several months, while Marks \u0026amp Spencer is testing an app that should help manage the number of people in its head office by allowing staff to book a slot to attend. John Lewis said it was undergoing a “phased reopening” under which safety measures would be reviewed at each stage.Some companies have already told workers not to come to the office until January, while several major banks are not expecting staff to return to their desks until at least September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f1e7c4d95c00892b9f3b68704a8273f7c65c247/0_61_4694_2817/master/4694.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f6e0abf9e5a7f60208000ce829e92b8","title":"im using unemployment benefits to buy insulin us workers face hardships over pandemic","story":"Millions of workers have lost health insurance and faced salary cuts and unions say firms are not doing enough to take care of employeesAs millions of workers around the US remain out of work due to the coronavirus pandemic, employers are pushing cuts to wages, eliminating health insurance and other benefits, and terminating workers rather than furloughing them.Rodney Watts worked at the Atlanta international airport employed by the retail and concessions contractor HMS Host for nine years as a warehouse shift supervisor before getting laid off in March.Watts says he is using his unemployment benefits to pay for his insulin, as he lost his health insurance with his job termination.“Without insurance I have to pay out of pocket … I take insulin shots three times a day. Now I’m using unemployment to pay for it,” said Watts. “My diabetes is a rollercoaster. If I don’t take my shots, I feel real bad. The insulin runs me almost $400 for just a small bottle and I also take metformin.”Research on the impact of the crisis shows:Some employers are pushing to avoid providing workers with health insurance, even as the workers begin to return to work, and others out of work who have kept their health insurance are struggling to afford co-pays for life-saving medications.Hanna Castano of Euclid, Ohio, who has type 1 diabetes, lost her job as a server at a Bob Evans restaurant in March 2020 when the pandemic shutdown began. She found a new job at a local drug mart but was shortly laid off due to lack of customer demand the store had anticipated. The change in employment disrupted her unemployment benefits, of which she has only received one week of pay, and the loss of income left her struggling to afford the $50 co-pay for her insulin under her Medicaid coverage. Though her restaurant reopened, she is still waiting to be called back into work when customer demand recovers.“I will go sick because my daughter needs something that I have to get,” said Castano, who has relied on financial support from friends and family while living in a motel. “I don’t know how much longer I can keep paying for my insulin and not being able to get the food and diapers that my daughter needs because I will die without it.”The Fontainebleau hotel in Miami Beach, Florida, is suing the Unite Here union, seeking to stop making healthcare payments for more than 1,000 workers under the current union contract.A housekeeper for 10 years at the hotel, Cristina Aguirre-Sevillano, cannot afford medicine prescribed to her, which costs nearly $400 out of pocket, after recently testing positive for Covid-19.“I haven’t been able to get the medicine my doctor recommended me to take,” said Aguirre-Sevillano. “My daughter is also under my health insurance plan, so she lost her health insurance. I don’t have health insurance, I can’t afford medicine and I can’t pay my rent either because I only received one payment of $275 from unemployment since being furloughed in March.”Initially furloughed in March, Aguirre-Sevillano was called back to work in June but has worked only five days. She is one of several workers in Florida who have not received their full unemployment benefits yet, and she continues to experience problems with the state system.Wendi Walsh, the Unite Here Local 355 secretary-treasurer, said union contract language stipulates hotels must continue healthcare coverage for employees until they have not worked the required number of hours for two consecutive quarters. She said: “Every other hotel we represent has that same contract language and they are abiding by it because they are legally required to do so and amidst a pandemic it’s the moral thing to do, but the Fontainebleau has taken a different path, going so far as to file a lawsuit to avoid taking care of their employees during a deadly outbreak of a virus.”Monalisa Rodriguez, a server and hostess at Terranea Resort outside Los Angeles, for seven years, was terminated in May after initially being furloughed.“It was devastating. At the same time they fired us, they took away our health benefits,” said Rodriguez, who was hoping to eventually retire from the resort. She relies solely on her income to provide for two children and take care of her mother. “It’s been extremely hard. I’ve struggled a lot trying to figure out how to provide for my family, relying on food banks and the Salvation Army to make ends meet.”A spokesperson for Terranea Resort said in an email that 550 out of 1,100 employees were laid off in May 2020 for the resort’s survival. “We will continue to bring back all employees according to our seniority policy and will rehire laid-off employees should we have the opportunity to do so.”Mozes Bautista, who has worked at Hilton Embassy Suites in Phoenix, Arizona, for five years, recently returned to work after being terminated, but he has to wait until September 2020 for his health insurance to restart with the company.“They said they would give back the paid time off but only gave back some of it. Because they fired us, we’re reclassified as new hires so we don’t have health insurance until September,” said Batista. “They’re no longer matching our 401(k) either.”Gate Gourmet, an airliner catering contractor, was one of several airline companies to receive federal bailout funds to prevent layoffs, but it terminated workers anyway. Over $170m is allocated from the Cares Act to Gate Gourmet for payroll protection. According to Unite Here, Gate Gourmet had about 8,000 employees before the pandemic, with only 1,100 currently working and plans to bring back just 1,600 additional workers on 1 September.Lamar Banks worked as a customer service assistant for nearly six years at Gate Gourmet in Chicago before he was laid off in May 2020, just weeks after he had a child and had to use all his paid time off to quarantine after a supervisor tested positive for coronavirus.“I got a letter in the mail shortly after saying it was going to be a permanent layoff,” said Banks. “They stopped health insurance.” Banks said Cobra, which allows Americans to continue benefits they once received from a job, costs $500 a month, and he had not received unemployment yet. “I don’t know what I’m going to do or what that means. I was thinking when things got better, I’d be able to go back to work.”Gate Gourmet would not clarify its current employment numbers. “We are committed to complying with all our obligations, including covid safety measures, seriously and will use all Cares Act funds exclusively for the continuation of payment of employee wages, salaries and benefits,” said a spokesperson. “We continue to be a proud employer to thousands of workers in the United States and are ready to serve our customers as they begin to resume operations.”The Fontainebleau Hotel and HMS Host did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Speaking to the Miami Herald, Silvia Pereda, Fontainebleau vice-president of human resources, said the hotel was “focused on recovering its financial stability so that it can return as many of its laid-off, former employees as possible to employment, which will, critically, result in them receiving a paycheck and benefits once again”.The union’s demands for payment of benefits for laid-off workers was making this harder, Pereda said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08ed57c2c29bbd1053b73b873be299e764121d02/0_275_4290_2574/master/4290.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbcddf644a999579c0e90c4a30d9dca2","title":"st mawes named uks top seaside resort in which poll","story":"Cornish fishing village beats Dartmouth, Southwold and Aldeburgh in readers’ ratingsA sedate fishing village on the tip of a Cornish peninsula has been ranked as the UK’s best coastal destination, beating other better-known seaside resorts to the crown.St Mawes, which sits on the banks of the Fal estuary and boasts a Tudor castle in the shape of a clover leaf, topped a poll of more than 4,000 readers of Which?, who were asked about their experiences of seaside holidays in the UK.For each destination, ratings were given for the beach, food and drink, value for money and peace and quiet, among other things, with scores added up and given out of 100.The list was unveiled as holiday destinations in England started to gear up for the summer holidays and an expected influx of visitors, with many people rejecting overseas travel in favour of trips closer to home.Although they might be appealing to families looking for activities and the opportunity for sandcastle building, some more traditional holiday resorts were at the bottom of the Which? readers’ rankings.However, one visitor told Which?: “Don’t be put off by the stereotypical opinions of Skegness. It’s a well maintained, vibrant area.”Great Yarmouth in Norfolk and Clacton-on-Sea were also in the bottom five.Which? said those wanting to avoid holiday hotspots could consider some of the highly rated destinations on its list which were less well known.Rory Boland, the Which? travel editor, said: “It is a good time to explore parts of the country you may not have considered before and to spread our sandcastles beyond the beaches of Devon and Cornwall.

That isn’t treason – it’s public serviceIt takes a special kind of incompetence for a government to lose a vote for the chair of one of parliament’s most important committees when they have handpicked a majority of its members. Boris Johnson managed this feat on Wednesday, when maverick Julian Lewis was elected chair of the intelligence and security committee over serial bumbler Chris Grayling.The consequences for Johnson are immediate, as the committee has now voted to release the report into Russian interference in British politics, a report which is believed to include details of the links between the Conservative party and Russian oligarch wealth. It is a scandal that Johnson succeeded in suppressing this report for so long.To ert attention, the government spin machine went into overdrive, insinuating that it was former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn who had colluded with the Russians during last year’s election, by campaigning against the government’s secret trade talks with the US. The government, Donald Trump-style, is deflecting from its own ties to foreign money and its disgraceful censorship by throwing around fake news.The facts are very different. More than two years ago, my organisation, Global Justice Now, asked the government to give us details of the trade talks they were holding with more than a dozen countries, including the US. It was basic stuff – when the meetings took place, who attended the meetings, agendas and notes. “No,” came back the official freedom of information reply, “all such information is confidential.”We appealed, and were told we’d been treated a little unfairly. We could see some of the papers we’d asked for. In anticipation, we opened the reams of documents we’d been sent, only to be disappointed. The papers were almost entirely redacted – black pen leaving not much more than page numbers visible (in one case, redacting even that).A few months later, Corbyn held up the redacted papers in a 2019 election debate. His point was that if trade deals with countries like the US were so central to the future of Britain, the public had an absolute right to know what was being agreed in our name.A few days after the debate, we were sent a link to a Reddit page, where we found leaks of the very papers we’d been given in blacked-out form. The leaks showed that our concerns were well founded, and that negotiators were indeed discussing policies that could affect our food standards, our NHS, and our ability to deal with the climate crisis. Corbyn then held a press conference to bring the papers to attention and highlight the serious dangers of a US trade deal under a future Johnson government.We have no idea who leaked the documents. My suspicion is it was an official disgruntled with the way the government was being clearly bullied by the Trump administration over Brexit, and concerned that we would end up with a devastating trade deal with the US. Certainly that’s what the narrative the leaker posted on Reddit pointed to. Given this information was originally posted well before the election was declared, and sat on Reddit in obscurity for several weeks, generating publicity seems not to have been their strong point.The government’s strategy this week is clearly to belatedly discredit these papers. They can’t be allowed to get away with this. No one has denied that the content of the trade papers is real. In fact, government ministers accepted this during the election campaign. No one suggested they’d been tampered with. And everything we’ve found out subsequently underlines our concerns about the US trade deal: from our government’s flip-flopping on importing food produced to lower standards, to US statements that levying special taxes on Facebook, Amazon and Google would be virtually impossible under that deal. In fact, we now know that the US trade deal will certainly feature a digital trade chapter, which is highly likely to make it more difficult to regulate the big tech corporations that are having such an impact on our democracy.What the whole incident really underlines is Johnson’s commitment to secret government. Like the Russia report, the trade papers should have already been in the public domain. Allegations of foreign interference in elections, and trade deals that will change the way our economy and society work, are things we all need to know about. Johnson has shown the depth of his commitment to keeping such information from us – and deliberately spreading disinformation when there’s any attempt to expose the facts to the light of day.The past week has also shown that this approach might be too much for some of his own backbenchers. The release of the Russia report at long last is very welcome. So too are backbench Conservative amendments to the trade bill, which will be debated next week. Johnson has refused to give parliament any meaningful powers over trade policy, making ours one of the most secretive and unaccountable trade systems. This includes denying MPs the right to see any trade negotiating papers, which they need to if they’re to scrutinise the executive. Unhappy Tory MPs, worried about the government breaking manifesto promises on food standards, have threatened to change that next week.In trying to tie together the Russia report with the US trade documents, the government hoped to distract and confuse. But there is a link, in that both documents show a deeply paranoid government, committed to secrecy, and prepared to go a long way to prevent the transparency and debate that democracy requires to thrive. We mustn’t allow them to get away with it.• Nick Dearden is director of Global Justice Now (formerly World Development Movement)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8d71effd4381b034eab062ea542371439cbf4f7/0_745_7225_4335/master/7225.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87b321402f14140619d735d9435a755b","title":"royal opera house lays off entire team casual staff coronavirus","story":"Voluntary redundancy process also under way due to impact of coronavirus crisis on arts sectorThe Royal Opera House has cut its entire team of casual staff, as pressure mounts for the UK government’s emergency arts fund to be quickly rolled out after an estimated 3,000 job losses in the sector.ROH, which is in Covent Garden in London, did not confirm the number of job losses but said a voluntary redundancy process was also under way and that all casual contracts had been terminated.“It is with huge sadness that we have begun a restructure process,” the ROH tweeted. “The scale of financial pressure on ROH alongside continued restrictions on our ability to perform to live audiences, has resulted in this very difficult decision.”The ROH confirmed its chief executive, Alex Beard, had taken “a significant reduction in salary” and the music director, Sir Antonio Pappano, had waived his salary since the beginning of the Covid-19 lockdown. Pappano earned a basic salary of £115,000 for the financial year 2016-17, with additional fees of more than £650,000.Beard told the Stage the “sad decision” had been made because of the financial pressure caused by the Covid-19 crisis, coupled with the continued restrictions on its ability to perform to live audiences. “The process has started with a call for voluntary redundancies and the termination of all casual contracts, with a consultation on proposals for changes affecting permanent members of staff due to commence shortly,” he added.The head of Bectu, Philippa Childs, said the trade union was urging ROH to reconsider the move in light of the government’s recently announced £1.57bn emergency arts fund aimed at preserving cultural institutions. Bectu has estimated there have been 3,000 job losses so far in the culture sector as a result of Covid-19.Childs said: “We are very aware that venues still have no income, and no prospect of ticket sales for the foreseeable future, but the government has announced a bailout package for theatre and the arts and on that basis we have urged the Royal Opera House to pause its redundancy and restructuring proposals.”The coronavirus lockdown has prompted some of the UK’s most prominent companies to announce large-scale job losses. The aviation, automotive and retail sectors have been among the worst hit, as businesses adjust to dramatically reduced revenue projections.While the government’s job retention scheme has so far protected millions of jobs, fears are mounting that unemployment will rise as the scheme begins to be phased out from August.Since lockdown began on 23 March, some of the UK’s largest companies have announced plans to cut a total of 60,000 jobs globally, many of which will fall in the UK.Burberry – 500 jobs worldwide15 July: Total includes 150 posts in UK head offices as luxury brand tries to slash costs by £55m after a slump in sales during the pandemic.G4S – 1,150 jobs13 July: The security company G4S plans to make 1,150 workers redundant as it scales back its struggling cash handling business and contends with pandemic-hit cash usage.John Lewis\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbsp1,300 jobs9 July: John Lewis announced that it is planning to permanently close eight of its 50 stores, including full department stores in Birmingham and Watford, with the likely loss of 1,300 jobs.Celtic Manor\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbsp450 jobs9 July: Bosses at the Celtic Collection in Newport, which staged golf\u0027s Ryder Cup in 2010 and the 2014 Nato Conference, said 450 of its 995 workers will lose their jobs.Pret a Manger\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbsp1,000 jobs6 July: Pret a Manger is to permanently close 30 branches and could cut at least 1,000 jobs after suffering “significant operating losses” as a result of the Covid-19 lockdownCasual Dining Group\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbsp1,900 jobs2 July: The owner of the Bella Italia, Café Rouge and Las Iguanas restaurant chains collapsed into administration, with the immediate loss of 1,900 jobs.

Has the fashion world finally changed for ever? Fashion has been grappling with its existential crisis for months. Broken supply chains, the exposure of racist and classist barriers and labels going seasonless have led to an introspective time for the industry. At the London and Paris fashion weeks, a host of digital-only shows were inventive, pretentious and beautiful, sometimes all at once. Yet it felt as if fashion had turned into a shadow of its former self, the proverbial ball gown reduced to the size of a slip dress in a bad spin cycle.Fashion’s Big Reflective Moment continued this week, but there was also a sense of a Lazarus-like reawakening due to the physical shows beginning again. Yesterday, an hour out of Paris, Jacquemus held its show in a vast cinematic expanse of a wheat field, while a few days earlier, at Milan digital fashion week, Dolce and Gabbana got wild and humanistic. It mixed a pre-show performance by the opera boyband II Volo, belting out the song from the Cornetto ad (O Sole Mio), with a show in the grounds of Humanitas University, where it is funding research on Covid-19. Pomp and grandeur had returned.Today, Gucci’s creative director, Alessandro Michele, showed his co-ed collection in Milan. Presented as a 12-hour-long live stream of the Epilogue advertising campaign shoot, it featured CCTV footage of the house setting up for the session. In comparison with the five-minute wisps of the digital shows, it was provocatively unapologetic in its length, with Michele playing his Warhol role of ever-present auteur observing the ennui of the makeup chair, the lighting rig and outside security.The meat of the show was five hours in: a digital lookbook of more than 70 looks, presented like a primitive 80s computer program. The models, who were all part of Gucci’s design team, appeared on popup screens in clothes that were classic Michele: floral, maximalist and heavy with pop-culture nous. Looks winked at Maria Schneider in Last Tango In Paris, Jane Fonda in Klute and Jimi Hendrix hanging out at Mama Cass’s house in Laurel Canyon. As op-art met kitsch and the Renaissance, it was very much a case of “putting contradictory elements together,” as the photographic collaborator Alec Soth said during the presentation.Epilogue continued the behind-the-curtain theme of autumnwinter 2020’s An Unrepeatable Ritual, and Michele said he wanted to provide a commentary of the “before, after and next” of fashion. “My fairytale in three parts wants to generate a (questioning of) the rules, the roles and the functions that keep the world of fashion going,” he wrote in the show notes. The fluidity of this idea, that fashion’s rules had been broken, but a new era was emerging was incredibly cheering. Watch this space."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b03571f0d56ecb2ba7524856b30707bbc8e1ccb5/61_232_3446_2067/master/3446.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=076c7226e20477c447d608495fba5409","title":"malcolm mcdowell i have no memory of doing most of my films","story":"He was once the embodiment of youthful rage and rebellion. Now, the Clockwork Orange star is reconciled to a life of golf, gangster flicks and the odd glimpse of geniusMalcolm McDowell was the insolent prince of early-70s cinema, the Liverpool salesman who stormed the establishment’s barricades. You can see him on screen in Lindsay Anderson’s If…., kickstarting a bloody revolution inside an English public school. You can see him in Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange, hanging with his droogs at the Korova milk-bar, making up his rassoodock what to do with the night. The sky was the limit. The world was his oyster. One felt he could achieve pretty much anything.If McDowell’s life was a movie, he would either have gone on to be crowned king or he would have exploded and vanished, ideally before he turned 30. But real life has a way of monkeying with the script, which may explain why McDowell is now a snowy-haired 77-year-old. He is a father of five, an avid golfer and a jobbing Hollywood actor specialising in baddies. His wild youth is behind him. He has made peace with his lot. “I had an incredible first few years,” he explains. “And of course that was the golden age. But you can’t keep playing the rebel for ever.”Every now and then he’ll land a peach of a part. Last year he played Rupert Murdoch in the #MeToo drama Bombshell. But his filmography also includes titles such as Abnormal Attraction and Death Race 2050, Kids vs Monsters and Meet the Small Potatoes. He has appeared in nearly 300 productions, many of which he forgot the instant he walked off the set. “People stop me and say: ‘Oh, we loved you in blah-blah’ and I say: ‘Sorry, that wasn’t me.’ And then they’ll show me on their phone or show me the DVD cover and sure enough, there I am.” He chuckles. “And I have no memory of doing it at all.”In his latest film, The Big Ugly, he plays a London gangster at large in the US, intent on laundering dirty money through the green hills of Appalachia. Billed below Vinnie Jones and above Ron Perlman, McDowell comes weaving through the action with a weaselly menace and a face like a clenched fist. It’s the sort of polished, dependable B-movie performance that must feel almost second nature by now.Happily, McDowell remembers The Big Ugly. They shot the film in Kentucky, deep in the boondocks at the height of summer. He recalls boarding at the Motel 6 and eating biscuits and grits at the local Cracker Barrel. “I had my 14-year-old son staying with me. He got so bored and it got so hot. That steamy southern heat that Tennessee Williams writes about. The only thing to do was drive to Walmart and walk around this big air-conditioned building to keep cool. That was the excitement. That was the big thing to look forward to. Breakfast at Cracker Barrel and then we’ll hit Walmart. After a week, he said: ‘You know what, Dad? I think I’d like to go home and see Mum.’”Just lately, of course, McDowell has been at home a lot, too. He lives with his third wife, Kelley, in a small town near LA but says the effects of the pandemic have largely passed him by. The main drag is that he was booked in to have his left knee replaced but the operation kept being cancelled it’s finally happening tomorrow. “I’ve been winging it for long enough,” he says. “Hobbling about, bone-on-bone.”He was a child of the aspirational postwar working-class. His dad ran a pub in Burscough in West Lancashire, the Bull and Dog. In his youth, McDowell worked at the Planters’ nut factory and as a coffee sales rep before alighting in London. He had a confident swagger and an air of dancing mischief. He went about life as though it were a game to be played, or a set of rules to be broken. “You’re a Brechtian actor,” Lindsay Anderson told him. “They know that you’re acting but the audience believes you anyway.”The collaboration with Anderson was like a marriage, he says. Spats, rows and make-ups. They made three fine films together, chasing the character of If….’s Mick Travis through the capitalist hunting grounds of O Lucky Man to the floundering society of Britannia Hospital. And it was thanks to If.… that he landed the role of Alex DeLarge in the vicious, playful A Clockwork Orange, prancing about Thamesmead in bovver boots and a bowler hat. “Fiftieth anniversary next year,” he says. “Where does the time go?”At the peak of his fame he starred in Caligula, a fevered Roman epic bankrolled by Penthouse magazine. The production sounds hilarious it was basically two films in one. First, McDowell played the mad emperor alongside a classy lineup of actors that included Helen Mirren, John Gielgud and Peter O’Toole. Then the producers brought in adult performers to shoot hardcore sex scenes to be deployed as extended cutaways, seemingly at random, so as to give the impression that McDowell was gazing wistfully at a lesbian orgy, or a gladiator getting a blowjob. “There’s quite a good movie in there somewhere,” he says. “But not the porn stuff.”McDowell’s imitation of Gielgud is perfect. He catches the man’s mellifluous delivery and querulous top note. “He’d say: ‘Oh, my accountant says I have to make cutbacks but I don’t see where I can.’ And I’d say, “Well, you’ve got a huge house, John.’ He’d say: ‘Oh yes, but I can’t sell that.’ ‘Well OK, but don’t you have a chauffeur-driven Rolls?’ ‘But, but – how do you think I’m going to get into London?’ ‘How about the train?’ ‘Oh, but I couldn’t do that. The train indeed!’ And I’d say” “Well, that’s why you’re having to do movies like this one, John.’”At the end of the decade, McDowell went to Hollywood to play the role of HG Wells in the film Time After Time. There he met the American actor Mary Steenburgen. The marriage eventually ended but by then he had put down roots. Looking back, he seems more nostalgic for his old London house than for the British film career he abandoned. “It was just off Church Street, near Notting Hill Gate, back of the Czech embassy. Painter’s studio. A unique building. I bought it in 1969 and sold it the first year that Blair got in. And my Aunt Vera lived there for longer than I did. I said: ‘You can stay here, Auntie, I’ll be back in three months.’ Then I went to Hollywood, met Mary, fell in love, had two children. Never went back.”England at the time felt too small, too parochial. Whereas the US was enormous, almost too big to handle. “I was out of my depth,” he admits. “So I played the heavy. The Brit. Which is sort of boring, but unfortunately that’s the way things worked out. When you move to a country like America, you’re a very small fish in a very big pond.”I’m interested to hear McDowell’s side of the story. Reading the cuttings, one gets a different take: the sense of an actor who somehow squandered his promise and let his audience down, possibly out of spite. The critic David Thomson refers to his “strange, thwarted career”. The biographer Roger Lewis describes his later years with an undisguised glee (“his pretty boy looks faded and he was condemned to playing villains in straight-to-video films that turn up on Channel 5”). It’s as though McDowell’s progress offends our collective sensibility. We hate to think of Peter Pan growing up to become a footsoldier in Neverland. The children of the revolution must never ever play golf.I ask whether he is as excited by acting as he was in his youth and he says that he is by and large, it depends on the part. “I still love it, otherwise I wouldn’t do it. Maybe in my forties I didn’t have a good time. People didn’t know what to do with me. I was a useful rebel in the 60s and 70s. But the Kubrick movie was overbearing. Everything was measured against A Clockwork Orange, which gets a little old. But that’s what happens when you work with giants.”Kubrick, in the end, was too controlling, “too brutal”, to properly bond with. But he adored Anderson and was great friends with Robert Altman. Those were his giants. Maybe there are others still out there. From time to time he will overhear his sons discussing new directors they love artists who seem to share the same bold and freewheeling style. “But I’m an old fossil these days. So I sit still and stay quiet.”Far be it for me to moonlight as his manager, but if he hears that there are exciting young film-makers hiding in the woods, why not seek them out? Better that, surely, than another third-billed slot as a photo-fit Mr Knuckles, another film he has forgotten as soon as it is put in the can.“No,” McDowell says, “I’m not going to seek them out. If they offer me something, I’ll do it. But do I want to go parading around actively looking for work? No. Because I don’t have the ambition to be above the title, doing this, that and the other. I really don’t care. I’ve had an amazing run, an incredible career, when you take it all into account.”Maybe this is the arc of most actors’ careers. Maybe it’s not just actors either. We start out looking for the biggest stage, the biggest challenge, the project with the potential to turn the world on its head. We finish up with a different set of requirements: a regular pay-cheque, some half-decent colleagues and a work trip somewhere warm, preferably near a golf course. McDowell – gifted, vibrant actor though he is – once said he would rather hit a home run than win an Academy Award. He tells me that this was partly meant as a joke but that actually he did hit a home run one time and it’s the most exhilarating thing, a feeling that lasts for ever.On top of that, he has never especially been a believer in prizes. It has always struck him as funny, the way the Academy lavishes acting Oscars on the movies with the best script and the best direction, the ones that are already so good that the actor barely makes any difference. The voters, he feels, are coming at it arse-backwards. Those aren’t the films where the real heavy lifting takes place.McDowell casts his mind back over his own long list of credits. The gangster flicks and the sci-fi knock-offs. The kids’ animations that few kids ever saw. He says: “I sometimes think: ‘My God, I’ve just acted in a real piece of shit and I managed to produce a credible performance. I managed to turn that piece of shit into something watchable.’ That’s what’s worthy of an acting award.”The Big Ugly is out on 24 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/923a3c8fb9b1bdd271383e68728bc1604453807a/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4a40ccd02fb60219b005af4fb01d346","title":"money mess and machiavelli johnny depp libel trial week two amber heard","story":"After claims of a lost fortune and a deposit in a bed, next week it’s Amber Heard’s turn to speakIn the second week of the Johnny Depp libel trial, the balance of evidence swung in favour of the Pirates of the Caribbean star. Witnesses called by his lawyers, many of them his employees, repeatedly denied he had been violent and described his ex-wife Amber Heard as abusive.Depp told the court he lost $650m made at the height of his Pirates of the Caribbean fame and was left owing $100m in taxes. He accused former business managers of stealing vast amounts from him. The court was shown a photo of the actor passed out and covered in ice-cream, which the court was told Heard had shown to her then husband in 2014 to “show how pathetic” he had become. Depp’s former personal assistant Stephen Deuters was not a fan of Heard, the court learned, describing her in one text message as a “sociopathic show pony” and a “Machiavellian overlord”.Rarely can defecation have featured so prominently in a high-profile court case. Heard blamed a deposit left on the couple’s bed one morning towards the end of their marriage on their allegedly incontinent Yorkshire terrier Boo. Hilda Vargas, a housekeeper who has been working for Depp for 30 years, was “horrified and disgusted” to find “a large pile of faeces” on the bed. It was a “lack of respect”, she added. To her it was clear that the excrement was human. Depp has said he was convinced Heard “or one of her cohort” was involved in the “defecation incident”.The vehemence of the testimony from Kate James, Heard’s former personal assistant, discouraged Sasha Wass, QC, counsel for News Group Newspapers (NGN), from pursuing further questions. James accused Heard of stealing her own experience of being a victim of sexual violence and twisting it into a different story. She described herself as “a sexual violence survivor”, adding: “It’s very serious to take that stance if you are not one.” James also recalled receiving a barrage of drunken, abusive and incoherent text messages from Heard between 2am and 4am some days. In her witness statement, James said: “Amber would drink vast quantities of red wine each night.”Anticipation had been building before the scheduled appearances via video link of Depp’s ex-partners Winona Ryder and Vanessa Paradis. Depp’s counsel, David Sherborne, said the decision to drop their cameo roles in the legal drama owed to the fact that NGN was no longer alleging Depp had hit other women. The pair’s non-appearance did not prevent their evidence from being released. A courtroom intervention by the Press Association persuaded the judge that since parts of their statements had already been referred to, the entire texts should be released. Paradis, who lived with Depp for 14 years and has two children from their relationship, said: “Through all of these years, I’ve known Johnny to be a kind, attentive, generous and non-violent person.”The trial is scheduled to run into a fourth week, and some key witnesses have still to testify. Heard, who has been listening every day in the public gallery of court 13 at the Royal Courts of Justice, is due to step into the witness box on Monday. She will be followed by her sister Whitney and other witnesses called by NGN. The judge Mr Justice Nicol has asked counsel whether the 12 volumes of evidence he has to read might be slimmed down, since some of it relates to witnesses not called. His request suggests judgment is likely to be reserved at the end of the trial.

The smartly suited executives spread out across Elland Road’s posh seats contested every adverse decision, applauded each promising home move and complained, vociferously, about any vaguely heavy opposition challenge.It was an extremely wet July night, Leeds were thrashing Stoke 5-0 and Victor Orta, the club’s director of football, constantly urged the men and women around him to morph into Marcelo Bielsa’s ultras. The second half had barely begun before any pretence of social distancing was abandoned.As the club’s anthem Marching On Together blared out and a band of security stewards revelled in questioning the referee’s eyesight, it seemed hard to credit there were only 350 people inside one of English football’s most atmospheric and intimidating citadels.At other grounds, even those containing teams with plenty to play for, the restart soundtrack has remained antiseptically silent. In contrast, Orta’s animated choreography reflected not only Leeds’s desperation to end a 16-year Premier League exile but the meticulous attention to detail and esprit de corps which have proved such features of Bielsa’s management.The Argentinian is a brilliant manager and tactician but it is arguably the human factor that enabled Leeds to see off the considerable challenge posed by an apparently reborn Brentford side on an extraordinary end-of-season winning run.Leeds’s promotion from the Championship is attributable to many things but it helps, enormously, that they really have been marching on together.This incredibly powerful unity of purpose was highlighted in March when, led by their captain, Liam Cooper, Bielsa’s players responded to a well-argued appeal from Angus Kinnear, the chief executive, by taking significant wage deferrals in order to safeguard the jobs of 272 backroom staff during the coronavirus pandemic.With players accepting reductions in remuneration to about £6,000 per week – roughly half the squad’s average and considerably less than the £30,000 commanded by the top earners Patrick Bamford and Kiko Casilla – Leeds were also able to continue paying a wider army of casual workers throughout lockdown.Cooper, whose off-field leadership skills have been as important as his on-pitch defensive assurance, asked Kinnear a series of searching questions, thoroughly interrogating him before the squad agreed, unanimously, it was the right thing to do.“Side before self, every time,” reads the inscription beneath the statue of Billy Bremner outside Elland Road Cooper and co demonstrated that such sentiments endure in this corner of West Yorkshire.That mantra served Leeds well as Bielsa’s squad emerged from football’s enforced break apparently spooked by the memories of last season when they collected only one point from their final four games and missed out on promotion.A disappointing 1-1 home draw with Luton in late June prefaced restorative “clear the air” talks at Thorp Arch, the club’s training ground. Suitably galvanised, the team rediscovered their winning habit, trademark high-energy pressing game and, perhaps above all, collective faith.As Mateusz Klich, a Poland midfielder reborn under Bielsa’s choreography, has explained a system revolving around a high defensive line and constant, kaleidoscopic movement is based on trust. “It’s about knowing the team have your back,” Klich says. “There’s no point one player pressing, it has to be 10 working as one.”Thorp Arch is opposite a prison, amid farmland east of the market town of Wetherby – where Bielsa rents a modest one-bedroom flat – and the squad joke that inmates of the institution over the road often have it easier.“It’s very strict here, like the military,” Klich says. “It’s tactics, tactics, tactics and fitness. It’s not easy. You have to have a lot of power and fitness. But we didn’t know how good we could be.”The team’s high concentration levels helped raise the bar. Not for nothing does Bielsa repeatedly demand his players “pay attention, please” from the upturned blue bucket that serves as his technical area perch.With the Brighton loanee centre-half Ben White commanding the defence, Kalvin Phillips anchoring midfield, Bamford’s attacking movement bewildering opponents and Pablo Hernández the much-adored 35-year-old creative talisman, Leeds repeatedly, relentlessly, impose their game on rivals.Unlike many managerial counterparts Bielsa is obsessive about ruling by meritocracy. There is no danger of a 64-year-old seemingly allergic to compromise succumbing to any form of “unconscious bias” regarding reputation, price, profile or personal preference when it comes to team selection.Some managers might have felt under pressure to keep picking the star January loan signing Jean-Kévin Augustin but once the Leeds manager deemed the French striker’s fitness inadequate, he immediately risked a diplomatic row with Leipzig by moving him to the margins.Bielsa – expected to sign a contract extension when his £6m-a-year deal runs out next week – had more luck with Illan Meslier, a previously untested 20-year-old French goalkeeper who has shone during Casilla’s eight-match suspension for racially abusing an opponent.Aware the former Real Madrid keeper was facing a potential ban, Bielsa could have signed a more experienced keeper in January but instead stuck to those meritocratic principles and selected the supposed novice largely on the strength of his training-ground excellence.As the manager puts it in his pedantic yet peculiarly precise – and now cut-glass – English: “Illan transmitted to the team safety. He resolved difficult balls.”Bielsa’s belief in Meslier reflects the wider trust – in the system, the manager and, above all, each other – on which this long-awaited return to the promised land rests. For Leeds promotion really has been all about “side before self”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd99756d00b69e60a4f6e62785bafa07863a4b37/0_0_4833_2900/master/4833.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9303b40a4a78cb0d0e374db174fb2d98","title":"marcelo bielsa leeds fans promotion party","story":"Social distancing was suspended outside Elland Road on Friday night as Leeds fans celebrated the club’s long‑awaited return to the Premier League.The moment the final whistle blew at Huddersfield, where West Brom’s 2-1 defeat meant Marcelo Bielsa’s team were guaranteed a top-two place in the Championship, supporters began congregating outside the famous ground exiled from the Premier League for the past 16 years.As fireworks illuminated the sky, beer was drunk by the Billy Bremner statue and banners emblazoned with “In Bielsa we Trust” were brandished. Car horns blared and chants of “Bielsa is God” were interspersed with: “Are you watching Manchester?”The manager was spotted outside his home in Wetherby saying: “Thank you, thank you,” to fans declaring: “We love you,” before exchanging elbow bumps and posing for selfies.Bielsa’s players celebrated inside the stadium, from where Pablo Hernández and Patrick Bamford waved enthusiastically from an upstairs window and the injured Kalvin Phillips briefly stepped outside to greet fans through a gate near the main reception.Phillips said: “We’re ecstatic. Promotion means everything. There’s no manager I’d rather be under than Marcelo Bielsa. He’s the best in the world.”The goalkeeper Kiko Casilla encapsulated the team’s collective excitement with an emotional tweet: “We are BACK !!!! We are In premierleague !!!! Yessssssssssss!!! We are Leeds !!!! LUFC. Many days dreaming of this Day!!! We deserve it! Proud of this TEAM, proud of our supporters! I can not describe this moment! Yesssssss!! Thanks for your support, Imposible without you!”Howard Wilkinson, the manager who steered Leeds to their last top-tier title in 1992, was quick to predict his former club could “grace” the Premier League. “Marcelo Bielsa’s dared to be different,” he said.In Bielsa’s native Argentina, broadcasters had taken the unprecedented step of screening Huddersfield v West Brom. Normally the only Championship matches shown live involve the Leeds side coached by the brilliant and idiosyncratic 64-year-old, whose previous roles include the Argentina and Chile national teams.In Poland, the front of the family home belonging to the Leeds midfielder Mateusz Klich was covered by a banner declaring: “Premier Klich.”As the party spread to Leeds city centre, Twitter seemed in danger of crashing under the volume of congratulatory messages from former Leeds players including James Milner, Rio Ferdinand, Nigel Martyn and Vinnie Jones.The goalkeeper Paul Robinson, relegated in 2004 amid the club’s financial meltdown, told Sky Sports: “It’s been long-awaited and long overdue. When I played that last game in 2004 you never envisaged Leeds would be out of the top flight for so long but Bielsa has been fantastic. He’s an oddball, a scientist, a professor.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b230465560135235b7af182f7a00a525bd75a916/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=150e829355fb869e908e9bcfa3f4ea4b","title":"fix of the trade how google helped a handyman build his business online","story":"Wielding the right digital tools has enabled Will Lingard to thrive, even during lockdownAs with most self-employed tradespeople, word of mouth plays a significant role in Will Lingard’s job as a handyman in and around Wonersh, a pretty village of red-tile cottages and timber-beamed houses a few miles south of Guildford. Whatever your trade, glowing reviews are good for business.But since setting up Surrey Hills Handyman in 2016, Lingard has sought to gain further advantage, using Google My Business, a free tool for businesses to manage their online presence across Google services. The tool helps him display his five-star ratings and the favourable reviews he has earned on his online profile, which – alongside the use of Google ads to reach new customers – have helped him grow his business exactly how he wants. Like word of mouth, in digital form.Four years on, Lingard can afford to be choosier. He specialises in “all the little jobs” that people often can’t find someone to do or don’t have time for themselves, focusing on quality, not quantity, “like bits of tiling or installing kitchen splashbacks, putting up picture hooks or fitting doorbells”.It’s here that promoting himself through Google tools has really paid off, taking on greater importance in recent months. Lingard had already taken to using Google ads, using keyword research to help find out what prospective clients were searching for online in and around Guildford – for instance, jet-washing a patio during the summer months – and then advertising those specific skills. This ability to be flexible and fleet of foot has had a significant impact on his business – “It’s quick, effective and direct,” he says – but really came into its own following the lockdown, when he was able to swiftly angle his remit as a “contactless service” in order to address customer fears around social distancing.Meanwhile, his Google My Business profile has helped him to keep existing customers updated with his working hours, while the review rating builds his reputation and earns trust with new ones. Lingard says Google also enables him to concentrate on the job at hand rather than tying himself up fielding calls asking what jobs he can do – the photos on Google My Business help showcase this to prospective customers. Even with the unpredictability of the future, given the pandemic, there is significant potential for tradespeople like Lingard to grow their businesses as households contend with the crisis. Homeowners have had more time to contemplate their surroundings, while a growing number of the UK workforce expect a permanent change to their company’s approach to flexible working post-lockdown. It means many homes and gardens will require improvements. Lingard’s Google profile, for example, flags up his skills at assembling flatpack office furniture.At a time when the wider job market looks uncertain, Lingard reveals that he is booked up six weeks in advance. “In a time of social upheaval and economic downturn such as this, demand for my services could have dwindled to nothing, but I’ve even been able to turn work away,” he says. “Google My Business has been central to me weathering the storm and future-proofing myself.”To find out how Google can help your business adapt, visit: g.cosmallbusiness"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b473ddf12486a48df79edc79336b9da1ddb50475/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c64d254b4a65ad0ee81b15a92a6965c","title":"we realised we were a necessity how a high street baker used google to keep serving his community","story":"For Sam Mensah of London bakery Uncle John’s, the right digital ingredients equipped his business to rise to the challenge during lockdownThe bright yellow signage of Uncle John’s Bakery stands out like a beacon on West Green Road, in the north London suburb of Tottenham. Famed for its lovingly made Ghanaian sweet bread and other regional specialties such as drop doughnuts and meat pies, the bakery has served London’s African-Caribbean and wider community for 25 years.Sam Mensah took over the family business in 2015. “When my parents came to Britain in 1982, they had nothing behind them education-wise, but they were ready to seize the opportunities life in the UK could provide,” he recounts.“They longed for the comfort of Ghanaian sweet bread, but the available imports were stale on arrival. So they started baking their own, to a family recipe, using somebody else’s bakery after midnight. Soon they started selling it by word of mouth. Then they had it packaged, placing it in Ghanaian shops. Eventually they built up enough momentum to open a shop of their own.“It wasn’t always easy, but whenever things looked bleak, my mum reminded my dad of a Ghanaian motto: obeyeyie – things will get better. I think – and especially now, when people might feel like they need to give up on things – you have to have resilience.”Resilience and persistence is clearly baked into the family DNA, as Mensah too proved when he set aside a successful music career to take over running Uncle John’s from his ageing parents. Tackling a steep learning curve, he not only added two new production units and gained the certifications needed to be able to supply supermarkets, but also comprehensively rebranded the store and built up a digital and social media presence.And as the UK went into lockdown in March, it was this spirit of resilience that made all the difference. Mensah says he did have a moment of panic: “We closed the store for a couple of days. Then we realised the wholesale side was moving fast and that we were a necessity – that people will buy our bread. So we reopened, putting measures in place to protect our staff, and publicised our new opening times on social channels, and above all, on Google My Business.”Using Google My Business – a free tool for businesses to manage their online presence across Google, including updating opening times on Search and Maps - meant customers could not only see the bakery’s new hours of business, but also that online ordering was available, either for pickup, or for delivery within an eight-mile radius. Uncle John’s also delivered flour – a hot commodity at the peak of the lockdown.If luck is when preparedness and opportunity meet, Mensah had the perfect package at just the right time: an optimised website with Google Maps integration, a strong social media presence, and an informative Google My Business profile. Positive Google reviews further buttressed his credibility, reassuring first-time customers. With all the pieces coming together, what could have been a crisis became a springboard for further growth.Mensah is clear what a lifeline it has proved to be: “With Google My Business, we have been able to communicate our business’ adaptations during this current pandemic, and helped bridge the gap between our business and consumers by keeping customers informed. And in turn, through reviews, we are able to understand what the customer wants and adjust accordingly.”And the effects go well beyond his premises Mensah was also able to publicise his NHS initiative – priority service and free loaves for NHS staff. “Serving our community at this time is more important than ever,” he says. “We’ve given out more than 2,000 loaves so far.”In fact, this community ethos was what drove Mensah to take over the family business in the first place: “What really helped me make that decision was having a daughter of my own. I wanted her to see what legacy is about. I felt that this business was something very important within the community, and for the generation that comes after me.”For Mensah, the way forward is now clearer than ever. “Our goal is to stand our ground among all British companies, not just black businesses,” he says. “And it’s no longer just for us. It’s for all the people who are placing their trust in us.”To find out how Google can help your business adapt, visit: g.cosmallbusiness"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a371e11d8c0194b16ba2ad85052f592fafd61558/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e65dd308a467c45f3bb10e9faf011db","title":"we sold the most books ever in a month how an inclusive bookseller adapted during lockdown","story":"Lynsey Pollard’s family-run business champions ersity in children’s books. Using Google tools helped Little Box of Books become a bestsellerLynsey Pollard picks up her phone from the kitchen table and pans the camera around to reveal dozens of boxes stacked through the living room behind her. “There’s another bookcase full downstairs and some in the hallway,” she says. “You should have seen it two months ago you could barely move. We even had to store them under the bed.”It’s been a hectic three months for the director of Little Box of Books, a subscription service for children’s books she runs with her partner Neil Langston from their London flat. In mid-March, just before the coronavirus lockdown, they took the risk of ordering a three-month supply of books instead of the normal one-month’s supply.“We had no idea how business would go, how our suppliers would manage or if they’d even exist afterwards,” Pollard says. “We wondered what would happen if one of us got sick. Neil also runs an IT consultancy and we’ve got an 18-month-old and a six-year-old to look after. For a two-person business, it was quite intimidating.”Pollard credits Google tools for the surge. “Google My Business has helped us to help our customers,” she explains. “We could let them know we were still open for business and fully stocked up. It is amazing to have a versatile and visible storefront apart from the website that drives traffic to our products, helping people to find us and trust us.”For Pollard and Langston, who founded the company in 2018 with the aim of bringing greater ersity to kids’ bookshelves at home and in school, this enhanced ability to create awareness of their product and capitalise on it is central to not just their business, but to their mission.Pollard, who previously worked in charity communications, had the idea during a period as a single mum to her eldest son. “I just didn’t see our family in any of the stories I was reading to him.” Now, each month, after scouring scores of publishing lists, she sends customers hand-wrapped books and other learning resources that include characters with different racial backgrounds, disabilities, step-parents, single parents, two mums, two dads and anything else that more accurately reflects the society we live in.Pollard and Langston hadn’t even finished testing their website, but she soon found herself on Sky News discussing the study and her new business. To make the most of the media exposure at the time, Pollard started using Google ads so her website would appear when people searched for more erse books. “It helped bring us our first customers who weren’t friends or family,” says Pollard. “That was such a great feeling, to know that people wanted to buy our product.”“We thought books and learning resources that would transport them outside of their family bubble during this time could be important,” says Pollard. “So we created ads to reference that, and help more people to find us.”Pollard says Google tools have enabled their business to reach an entirely new audience in recent months. “They have brought hundreds of people to us who may not have realised that most children’s books don’t accurately reflect the world we live in today. I love that it’s why we set up the company. I’ll continue to update my Google My Business as another place where people can find our business.”There’s a social element to all that Pollard and Langston do. For every box purchased, they send one to London-based child literacy charity Doorstep Library.

And for younger ones who are not seeing other babies in parenting groups – I think it will be hard when they start to go out more”.She added: “Parents are also finding it hard to keep older children’s or teenagers sleep’ on track, as the temptation to lie in is very strong when there is no school to get up for.”A survey of 2,700 people in April gave the early warning sign about the long-term negative impact coronavirus is having on children’s sleep.It supports a newly published paper from the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry that suggests the potential for sleep problems to emerge or worsen during and following the pandemic is high.In Lincolnshire, a sleep service started by the Sleep Charity saw 90 people in March 2020, with 169 on the waiting list.“We are definitely very busy and seeing an awful lot of children with a late sleep phase, so they are finding it hard to go to sleep at a normal time and not falling asleep until late,” said Lisa Artis, the deputy chief executive of the Sleep Charity. “It’s triggered by not having regulated routine but also anxiety.” She added that parents were finding it hard too, because they have little respite and children are not able to exercise as they normally would. “We have had some sad cases where families found themselves separating because of the pressure, so deciding to live separately for a period of time because of the general pressure with sleep being part of it.”In May, researchers from King’s College London conducted a survey of 2,254 people to ascertain how the virus outbreak and lockdown has impacted their sleep. Almost half of 16- to 24-year-olds said they were sleeping fewer hours than they had been prior to lockdown. In comparison, a third of those aged 35 and older said the same.“Coronavirus has had a significant impact on sleep,” said Dr Michael Farquhar, a consultant in paediatric sleep medicine at Evelina London at Guys and St Thomas’ NHS trust. “Teenagers are often trying to be forced into a sleep pattern that is not natural for their biological pattern. They may want to get up later and society and school forces them into a pattern of getting up earlier but lockdown lets that sleep pattern drift.”The Evelina London hospital has released some tips on sleep, advising exercise during the day and getting outside. They also said to make sure curtains are closed and lights dim at night, as well as introducing a calming bedtime routine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c73c1a52e4923a1200ffc3ce21886c700a4a41b1/0_141_7952_4774/master/7952.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0a2bd5285b7c95a35b72ddb6bdda726d","title":"opening night of the virtual proms bbc radio 3","story":"BBC Radio 3A deft but trivial Beethoven tribute was balanced by unforgettable past Proms performances, as the BBC launched a season of historic highlights, with live concerts to come in late AugustWhen lockdown began in March and one-by-one the summer music and opera festivals began dropping off the calendar, the self-styled “world’s greatest music festival” kept quiet about their plans for longer than most. When the BBC finally bowed to the inevitable and admitted that there was no way the summer season as we know it could take place this year, it promised instead to broadcast six weeks of concerts drawn from its capacious Proms archives, followed by a programme of live performances – details of which are still to be confirmed – direct from an empty Royal Albert Hall.That’s what was launched on BBC Radio 3 last night, with a parallel series of televised concerts on BBC Four beginning on Sunday. There are certainly some memorable performances among the selection of recordings that will be broadcast, though they hardly delve as deeply into the archives as one might have hoped. The earliest concert in the list dates from 1987, when Leonard Bernstein conducted the Vienna Philharmonic at the Albert Hall, and among the more glamorous appearances by orchestras such as the Royal Concertgebouw, Berlin Philharmonic and Staatskapelle Dresden there are a number of run-of-the-mill programmes from recent years, when one might have hoped for at least something from the 1960s and 70s.While the bulk of this archive series consists of complete concerts, which presumably will be broadcast exactly as they originally went out, for the first night there was a specially devised sequence of memorable Proms performances. Igor Levit’s performance of Beethoven’s Third Piano Concerto, with Edward Gardner conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra, was part of the opening night three years ago, though the aspect of his performance that made the headlines – his encore of Liszt’s transcription of Beethoven’s Ode to Joy, an unmissable pro-EU statement in the midst of the Brexit debate – was omitted, apparently because of time constraints. A rerun of the premiere of Harrison Birtwistle’s saxophone concerto Panic, with John Harle as the soloist, recalled the delicious furore it created at the Last Night of the Proms in 1995, when an audience that had turned up to sing Rule, Britannia! and wave its union flags, was required to listen to contemporary music, and didn’t enjoy the experience. And to crown it all there was Claudio Abbado’s unforgettable 2007 performance of Mahler’s Third Symphony, with his Lucerne Festival Orchestra and contralto Anna Larsson, in what turned out to be the conductor’s last ever Proms appearance.But there had been something brand new to begin – Iain Farrington’s Beethoveniana, a six-minute mash-up of themes from the nine Beethoven symphonies performed by a virtual orchestra of 350 players from all five of the BBC orchestras, with the BBC Singers adding a final saccharine version of the Ode to Joy. On its own terms it’s a deft enough piece of musical tailoring, slickly integrated and irrepressibly perky in tone, but ultimately trite and trivial. Even considering the current restrictions, though, it was a pretty unimaginative way of marking the Beethoven anniversary inviting a range of young composers to write their responses to Beethoven might have been more inclusive. Perhaps the new works promised for the live concerts at the end of the series will have more weight and sense of purpose.• The 2020 BBC Proms continue on Radio 3 and BBC Four until 12 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/897cda8e74ac7d0bd6c2f1db12bc961ece070c26/0_611_2539_1523/master/2539.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fad9402f202a81d5ebac8f4afa4140a","title":"weatherwatch giant iceberg on the move and picking up speed","story":"Iceberg A68 calved from Antarctica’s Larsen C ice shelf three years ago, and has now travelled over 1000 kilometres from its birthplaceThree years ago, in July 2017, a gigantic iceberg a quarter the size of Wales split off the Larsen C ice shelf in Antarctica.

In September 2018 strong winds broke A-68 free. Since then it has been moving towards South America, picking up speed. A-68A has now reached the South Orkney islands, more than a thousand kilometres from its starting point.The European Space Agency’s Copernicus Sentinel-1 radar satellite has been monitoring the berg’s progress. Radar is helpful in tracking even such a large object, as the Antarctic is dark through the winter months and obscured by cloud for much of the rest of the year.Although it covers over 5000 square kilometres, A-68A is only about two hundred metres thick.

Mayflies hatched, thrived, mated, died, and some distant nebula grew into a red giant, turned supernova and collapsed into a black hole, and still, Dom Sibley batted. And batted. And batted. And it was utterly glorious. Not to watch, necessarily, Sibley’s got a good game for the radio. He’s someone whose progress you might best follow by looking at the scorecards in the foreign edition of a paper you picked up a day late on holiday some place where you can’t get the internet. But, yes, glorious for the team’s cause, and for England’s supporters.Supporters who had grown so frustrated and bored with the way England played during the spendthrift years, when their top-order squandered their wickets like sailors on leave do their wages. In this one innings, Sibley faced more deliveries than five of his recent predecessors did in their entire careers as opening batsmen. If you add up all the balls Jason Roy faced in the seven Test innings he played against Australia and Ireland last summer, and then double them, you still don’t get close to Sibley’s total. He faced 372 altogether. His hundred came off 312 and was spread over four sessions.Which made it one of the slowest ever scored by an Englishman. He got it, at last, with a firm push down the ground, the ball ambling across the slow outfield till it pulled up out of boredom a few yards in from the boundary rope. Which seemed fitting, and not just because it was the seventh three of his innings. Sibley isn’t an elegant batsman, or a thrilling one. In fact he must have one of the ugliest techniques in recent memory. He holds his bat like it’s something he’s seen people do on TV and decided to try for himself. And his stance, squat, square-on, bow-legged, makes him look like he’s thinking about trying to mount a running horse.Well, easy to tease. But there’s an awful lot to admire in the way he plays. After all, a man’s got to know his limitations, like Dirty Harry said. And Sibley’s certainly pretty familiar with his. In an interview he gave on Thursday night he explained that he really does have a lot of shots, he’s just choosing not to use them. He has, he said, played plenty of Twenty20, where he gets his runs at a decent lick, three times quicker than he does in first-class cricket. People who can remember life before the pandemic might recall that he brought up his first Test century with a reverse-sweep when he was playing against South Africa in Cape Town back in January.At Old Trafford, though, he stuck with his clip off his legs, which brought him 50 of his hundred runs, along with the odd prod through the offside and a couple of pokes down the ground, a limited but effective repertoire. And between them they add up to reveal his other great strength: his attitude towards the game. He has great patience and determination, and a clear sense of what he wants to do and how he plans to do it. That came though, too, in the way he decided to lose all that weight during lockdown. He ran off 12kg after seeing how fit his senior teammates are, and for the lack of any better way to use his time.Sibley’s always had the ability to play big innings, he made his name when he became the youngest player ever to score a double hundred in the county championship back in 2013. What you see here, then, is a man with self-awareness to see that despite his achievements he still needs to get better yet, and the drive to do it, too. These are qualities you need to succeed in Test cricket. Even so there are a lot of people out there, good judges some of them, who are sure he won’t, because they think his curious technique will be found out.And it’s true there are some pretty glaring flaws in his game, like his inability to rotate the strike by picking off singles against the spin-bowling, and his habit of getting caught down leg playing the ball off his hip. But these are problems his attitude can help him fix. He may have to learn, too, how to accelerate. In this innings, he appeared to have as many gears as a penny farthing, and finally got trying, and failing to hurry things along after he and Ben Stokes had both brought up their hundreds. Sibley got out playing his first really aggressive shot, skipping down the pitch to loft Roston Chase to deep mid-wicket his one rash shot in all those hours of batting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9850bf89431b68bac8c637a1c6173b2ee96365bc/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=bc30acb5af277edf280532d8c009effe","title":"30 rock reunion special tina fey","story":"Tina Fey and the cast of the acclaimed sitcom have returned for a lockdown special that addresses recent controversies and a different comedy landscapeAs a promotion for the Super Bowl in 2012, NBC higher-ups corralled all of that TV season’s talent for a video rendition of the toe-tapper Brotherhood of Man from Broadway classic How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. Notwithstanding the jack-in-the-box horror of the brief shot of an Apprentice-era Donald Trump, selling this massive corporate interest as one big happy family would prove a big pill for America to swallow, and so the producers of this segment wisely turned to the cast of 30 Rock. The sitcom’s characters opened the segment with some sound one-liners about executives hoarding pay, and more importantly, established a crucial tone of self-referential self-deprecation. The show had never been shy about the incestuous love affair between art and commerce, and so it proved a workable vessel for a commercial that needed to be delivered with a no-BS wink. If we’re going to sell to you, the opening tacitly stated, the least we can do is show a little shame and get some laughs out of it.It’s in this spirit that the gang gets back together for one last ride, which just so happens to be in the form of an hour-long special pushing the next year of content from the benevolent overlords at NBC Universal. It’s a devilishly apt pairing, the orgy of synergy that is TV upfronts presentation and the unlikely 30 Rock revival – a deeply cynical attempt to milk nostalgia for a show about TV deeply cynical attempts to cash in on our sentimentality. That may seem like a weighty concept to convey in the lacunae between sizzle reels, but by the comfortingly unchanged comic sensibility of these writers, that can come across in an insert shot of Kenneth Parcell’s soul gasping out of his body as he prostrates himself before advertisers.He’s the chairman of NBC these days, a paradigm shift set up by the series finale back in 2013, though he has not parted with his country habit of eating chickpeas from a can. (Jack McBrayer also portrays his sultry assistant Vivica, easily the show’s most inspired gag.) The new episode, a word justified here by the structure and occasionally even the rhythm of a normal hour of entertainment, gets rapid-fire laughs from checking in on the happily-ever-afters not previously laid out. Hapless beta male Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) has reinvented himself as a goth-styled rock star, much to the pleasure of his wife, Paula incurable eccentric Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) has moved to Canada, where he spends his free time polishing his hockey sticks using maple syrup, as Canadians are wont to do horndog Frank (Judah Friedlander) was consulting at children’s program Peppa Pig, until he was let go for keeping pornography around the office.These feel like real set-ups for real jokes, made under the permissive auspices of a moneyed conglomerate. Some guest appearances had an intrusive incompatibility to them (for the love of all that is holy, must we watch one of the Kardashians toddle her way through scripted comedy?), and the mandate to set up each clip-package segment with a couple lines of dialogue couldn’t avoid the core shill-ness. Still, the TV-history-literate 30 Rock would be the first to remind us that Milton Berle’s first show on NBC had Texaco right in the title. Same as it ever was, except for the group Zooms.But this show in particular returns with a higher mandate than simply being funny. Topicality was so integral to its DNA that today, every new world happening generates a fresh wave of tweets wondering how 30 Rock would have satirized it. The series has been the subject of some controversy in recent weeks, as Americans remembered en masse that a handful of episodes included blackface, and it would have been comic cowardice to let the issue sit. The writers make an early overture toward simple contrition with one joke re-dubbing “Toofer” (so nicknamed because he’s a twofer hire, as a black man and a Harvard graduate) as James, but the engagement gets even more substantive. We learn that prima donna Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) has been canceled, and that she’s been losing her mind since landing in “famous person jail”.Though the public turned on Jenna for defecating in a Thermos belonging to Mandy Moore, she must nonetheless sort through the thorny politics of “cancel culture”. She makes the hollow justifications that Fey herself knows not to, rationalizing that “the late 2010s were a different time!” After some duly hilarious wallows in self-pity (quarantine has been hardest on “hot extroverts”, apparently), she arrives at the realization that she can do nothing but own up to the wrongness of what she’s done and throw herself at the public’s mercy. And because this is a sitcom, this also involves her using a musical number about the new streaming service Peacock to force Moore to accept her apology.A well-calibrated harmony between earnestness and irony powered the engine that made 30 Rock go, and the old bucket still runs like a dream after all these years. Remorse must be tempered by a resolution to remain uncouth, just as a professional agreement to play a little ball must be undercut by subversive sniggering. Even as they grease the giant grinding cogs, the staff can expose the absurdity of corporate doctrine by delivering its soulless messaging with maximum enthusiasm. These writers have known for years how easily promo copy can be made to sound sarcastic, that it takes nothing more than the mere suggestion of a carbon-based organism ever actually using the phrase “dynamic new platform”.After a while, the ads themselves start to play like cold punchlines, as if each new real show had been conceived as a bit by comedy writers. The lines about such fictitious titles as Dracula PD and Merlin: The Teenage Years sound no more implausible than the sitcom about the boyhood antics of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, which is real. Right? If nothing else, this will be the lasting legacy of 30 Rock. Every time a new season of TV brings us something that seems too dumb to be true – every time that “too dumb to be true” seems like it might be the very essence of the televisual medium, an inkling never stronger than during upfronts season – its genius will grow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d662b1761bb4e4598356c2183d73ef6ee8b69ba4/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b314bacdced2161acb9b1b3c88370fe5","title":"celebrity snoop dogs review canine through the keyhole is a dogs dinner","story":"This insipid show, in which C-list celebrities strap bodycams to their pooches and send them sniffing round the house, has finally, gladly come to and endAt the beginning of lockdown, 43 years ago, it was announced that Channel 4 had come up with the countervailing-est ruse of countervailing ruses to ensure that its portion of the entertainment on which we have come to depend could continue to pour untrammelled into our homes through the small screen. Its plan? They would affix cameras to the backs of dogs owned by celebrities and send them off to wander round said celebrities’ homes. We would then try to guess, assuming we had not gouged our eyes out by this point, who owned the houses and, by extension, the dogs. Or vice versa.The Ruse – which may yet be capitalised in a footnote to a particularly extensive history of the arts during corona times – was greeted with derision. But Channel 4 hung tough, and hung its cameras on various dogs owned by people who, by stretching the word to the very limits of its already considerable elasticity, could be described as celebrities – and then it unleashed the hounds. It chopped the results into four half-hour episodes, found someone to do the voiceover – Kevin McCloud – and gave the results a name: Celebrity Snoop Dogs. There was doubtless some kernel of optimism that the results would afford the channel a kind of cult, so-bad-it’s-good hit. Who could resist, I suspect the thought ran, a canine-inflected Through the Keyhole? Kernels of optimism, of course, may be the largest contributor to human misery the world has ever known.Celebrity Snoop Dogs has now completed its run and – let us hope – been taken off to a farm upstate, where it will live out the rest of its days in peace. The final episode followed the traditional format. The concept – dogs, cameras, celebrity homes – is laboriously spelled out. The ergonomics of the camera harnesses are described in detail. The dogs – this time a labradoodle called Monkey and a pair of American iels called, oh God, who cares – roam around a Tudor pile in Wiltshire and modern shininess in Surrey. McCloud does an unexpectedly good job of narrating without descending too far into archness, despite being forced to call the dogs’ owners “their humans”. There are one-line descriptions of anything that could feasibly have caught the viewer’s eye. A definition of a love seat was this week’s highlight. Invented in the late-17th-century, appaz.Reviewers have been urged to keep the reveal a secret, so I will draw a veil over quite who appears this time for the last 10 minutes to explain why they love their house, why they love their dog(s) and what particular concatenation of circumstances led them to agree to partake in Celebrity Snoop Dogs. (The suspicion looms large throughout that for a not-inconsiderable portion of them, accountants’ desperate urgings have played a role.)The best bit of Celebrity Snoop Dogs was usually the Petplan insurance advert that preceded it, wherein a mother flanked by her two children and holding the family dog speaks effusively to camera about how the dog is “like my child. People laugh at me but he is like my third baby.” Her children sit beside her looking … well, like their mother has just told them the dog sits on a par with both of them. Expressions that cannot be rendered on the page, with only the paltry resource of the written word at my disposal. Best bit. By far."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ecccc90ad2af5295e2c052391c2ac38193b5bd1/0_180_768_461/master/768.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bae283c4361018846829a2a0db308fe2","title":"a single use face mask or one like amber heards how i learnt to choose wisely","story":"As more countries make coverings compulsory, Nazia Parveen experiences face mask envy during a work trip to MallorcaParis Hilton likes hers made from mesh, encrusted with rhinestones, Amber Heard and Johnny Depp have opted to wear bandanas for their dramatic daily court appearances.

After hours of wearing the elasticated loops my ears began to chafe, an unusual, but distinct, discomfort behind my lobes.Lessons were well and truly learned, and I will be armed with research before future mask purchases, as more countries globally make it mandatory to wear them in public spaces.Some countries and states have been recommending that everybody wears face masks in indoor settings where social distancing is difficult or impossible. They have been made mandatory on public transport or in shops in many countries.According to guidance from the World Health Organization, people over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask.The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used.The WHO says masks should be made of three layers – with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and – more importantly – because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.The Costa del Sol, where around 2.3 million Britons holiday every year, recently made it compulsory to wear masks in public at all times, in line with the other tourist hotspots of Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza and Formentera. Exceptions are made only for sunbathers on beaches and pools, when eating or drinking, while practising sport and while playing a wind instrument. However, in Catalonia tourists are still required to wear masks at the beach or by the pool.Across the border in France, the rules are slightly less stringent. While it is compulsory to wear face masks on public transport, it is up to inidual shop owners to ask their customers to wear face coverings. This, though, could be subject to change, with the French prime minister, Jean Castex, recently signalling that face mask use in enclosed public spaces was under consideration.Meanwhile, in Italy, although holidaymakers will not receive a fine for non-compliance, it is mandatory to use masks in enclosed public spaces. Flout it at your peril, as mask-less people will be removed from public transport.Surgical grade N95 respirators offer the highest level of protection against the virus, followed by surgical grade masks, but they are costly and reserved for healthcare workers. Then there are the homemade reusable cloth versions and the single-use paper ones.Whatever you decide on, face masks are here to stay – for a while at least – so spend the next week choosing wisely."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db482cc283adcd9f00acdcfc176aa66976e65e0f/0_195_5624_3375/master/5624.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0256a0f60821786656f3bd9d85007bcb","title":"face coverings show us your homemade masks","story":"Shoppers in England will have to wear face masks from 24 July.

Many, such as Emmanuel Macron and Charles Michel, opted for a friendly elbow bump. Others offered polite bows.After a series of unsatisfactory video conferences, meeting in person was deemed essential if EU leaders are to bridge their differences on a €1.8tn (£1.6tn) financial settlement in a fiendishly complex negotiation that exposes profound differences on fiscal discipline, rule of law and the climate emergency. “The stakes couldn’t be higher,” said Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president and architect of a €750bn coronavirus recovery proposal intended to help Europe’s economy through the deepest economic shock since the second world war. The leaders are also trying to finalise a deal on a seven-year, €1.074tn budget after talks failed in February.Having arrived under grey skies, Macron described the coming hours as “absolutely decisive”, adding: “Our European project is at stake.”The summit, which is slated for two days but could run into Sunday, is taking place under strict hygiene conditions, with extra cleaning and changes to the ventilation system to ensure fresh air at all times. Meeting in the largest room in the egg-shaped dome of the Europa building, each leader found a bottle of hand sanitiser and a sealed packet of clean headphones at their place.All took the advice to wear a mask on arrival, although Bulgaria’s prime minister, Boyko Borisov, allowed his to slip down his face, leaving his nose exposed. Luxembourg’s Xavier Bettel eschewed the pale blue pharmacy option for a pop-art mask reading “moien!” (morning, in Luxembourgish).Angela Merkel, the EU’s longest-serving leader, who is seen as a crucial broker in the talks, said she expected “very, very difficult negotiations”. But before getting down to business, gifts were exchanged. It was Merkel’s 66th birthday, and she was presented by Macron with a bottle of fine white bourgogne. Borisov gave her a traditional silver flask containing Bulgarian rose oil.Merkel posed for a photo with Portugal’s prime minister, António Costa, also marking his birthday. She gave him a copy of a 17th-century map of Goa, a former Portuguese colony where Costa has family ties.Michel, the European council president, wished the pair a happy birthday and offered congratulations to the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, who got married on Wednesday. She had had to change plans three times when a general election, coronavirus and then this weekend’s summit got in the way.Rutte insists his government should have the power to veto coronavirus recovery grants, a demand deemed unacceptable by France, Spain, Italy and others. Among the frugal four, which also comprises Denmark, Sweden and Austria, “he is the only one sticking to unanimity,” an EU diplomat said. “If he is ready to move, you can discuss something.”At February’s EU budget summit, Rutte irritated Merkel and others by ostentatiously telling the press he had brought a book about Frédéric Chopin to pass the time. “No biographies this time,” Rutte told Dutch media on Friday. “It will be hard work.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b65409b54ebba736a5feaa2e04b1927a0c25ec7/0_258_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=6e9f4d5f35cb9e41ba9cd7a703428705","title":"global report coronavirus infections india pass 1m mark","story":"Country becomes third in world to reach figure alarming peak in French region of BrittanyIndia has become the third country to record more than 1m coronavirus infections, following the US and Brazil, as it reported 34,956 new cases in the past 24 hours, taking the national total to 1,003,832.New peaks continue to appear around the world, including an alarming rise in the Brittany region of France.Amid evidence that the disease was taking hold in poorer, rural areas of India with less effective public healthcare, the latest tally prompted renewed concerns about the country’s ability to cope with rising infections.The figures have been released after a week in which authorities in India were forced to impose new lockdowns, including fresh restrictions on 128 million people in the state of Bihar, which came into force on Thursday.The continuing and escalating outbreaks, on top of record cases in the United States – which passed 75,000 daily cases in the last count – have dampened hopes that the pandemic is anywhere close to being brought under control, even as researchers race to find a viable vaccine.Three states in India – Maharashtra, Delhi and Tamil Nadu – account for more than half of the total cases in the country so far. Ashish Jha, the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, warned that the majority of cases in the country were still being missed.The continuing rise has forced authorities to reinstate lockdowns in some cities and states.In Bangalore, the government ordered a week-long lockdown that began on Tuesday evening after a rapid rise in cases.Dr Anant Bhan, a global health researcher, said India was likely to experience a series of peaks as the virus spread in rural areas. He said the capital, New Delhi, and the financial capital, Mumbai, had already recorded surges, while infections have now shifted to smaller cities.India’s response to the virus was initially sluggish, but on 24 March the prime minister, Narendra Modi, imposed a three-week nationwide lockdown of its 1.3-billion population.By Friday more than 13.8m infections had been confirmed worldwide and nearly 590,000 people had died, according to Johns Hopkins University, with Brazil recording more than 2m infections by the end of the week and the US more than 3m.Countries around the world have moved quickly to reintroduce restrictions as outbreaks flare up again. Ada Colau, the mayor of Barcelona, Spain’s second largest city, announced a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people from Saturday as part of a package of measures to curb an increase in coronavirus cases in the Catalan capital.“We have to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people … Only 10 people will be allowed in weddings and funerals from Saturday,” Colau told a press conference. Residents were urged to shop online and cultural and sports events will also be limited.In France, which had already announced plans to make mask wearing mandatory in enclosed public spaces, authorities reported a sharp rise in the infection rate in Brittany. According to data released on Friday, the disease’s reproduction rate in Brittany had risen from 0.92 to 2.62 between 10-14 July.“It’s a worrying number because it means the epidemic is taking off again,” Eric Caumes, an infectious disease specialist at the Pitie-Salpetriere hospital in Paris, told BFM TV.In China, flights into the city of Ürümqi in the far-western Xinjiang region were restricted on Friday, and underground and public bus services suspended, according to local social media.The latest outbreak has underlined the continuing difficulty China faces in stamping out the virus – even with its imposition of draconian measures – which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.Amid fears around the world over the ease in which new resurgences have escalated after countries relaxed restrictions, Hong Kong reported 50 new locally transmitted cases on Friday, stoking further concern about a third peak of infections in the global financial hub.Tokyo hit a daily high of 293 infections as Japan tried to keep the world’s third-largest economy running while curbing infections, a precarious balancing act of opening restaurants and theatres with limited seating, and having store clerks work behind plastic shielding.“We have asked people and businesses to raise their alert levels,” said Tokyo’s governor, Yuriko Koike. She said the recent higher numbers partly reflected more aggressive testing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65db9aa3dcf73bdd26aff1a796e422caa1c11e24/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59463920bc3302a56fa78493fdef6cd0","title":"israel returns to partial lockdown with immediate weekend shutdown","story":"Government unveils measures after marathon emergency cabinet session as infections riseIsrael has reimposed some lockdown measures following a vigorous second surge in the number of coronavirus infections, putting in place stringent weekend shutdowns in which shops, hairdressers and attractions will be closed.The government announced the measures in the early hours of Friday morning, following a marathon emergency cabinet session called after daily infection rates climbed to close to 2,000.Gyms and fitness studios will also be closed at all times, while restaurants, which opened again in May, will return to takeaways and deliveries only. All indoor gatherings of 10 or more people will be banned.Changes start from this weekend, which in Israel begins on Friday afternoon, the eve of the Jewish Sabbath, and last until Sunday, the first working day of the week. Nurseries will remain open, although closures were being considered.Israel Radio reported that full lockdowns, with people again confined to their homes, might be imposed from next weekend, after parliamentary approval.During the cabinet meeting, the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the government’s goal was to stop gatherings of people, but added that the new steps may not be “scientific”.Yair Lapid, the head of the opposition, criticised the partial lockdown, saying it was confusing and not based on evidence. “An entire country is trying to understand why decisions are made in the middle of the night without any data and isn’t able to,” he tweeted on Twitter on Friday.The country of 9 million was praised initially for a swift lockdown in March that was credited with reducing daily infections to single digits. However, officials and public health officials say the economy was reopened too hastily and without necessary steps taken to control the pandemic.With more than one in five Israelis unemployed, Netanyahu has faced mounting public anger over his handling of the crisis, with thousands of protesters holding frequent demonstrations in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, some of which have been dispersed by police.The Israeli leader is also fighting three corruption allegations, including charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust – accusations he denies, dismissing them as part of a politically-motivated witch-hunt.Outside his Jerusalem residence on Thursday night, several hundred people banged drums and blew on horns, calling for Israel’s longest-serving leader to resign. Some wore masks with “crime minister” written on them.Noam Arnonovitch, 32, who lives in Tel Aviv, said he had been seeking employment for a few months while working part-time in bars.“I came because I think there’s something very deeply wrong with our political culture in Israel,” he said, complaining of what he said was destructive us-versus-them discourse from the government.“I think that now, because of the extremity of the situation we’ve reached, people are really fed up and we’re starting to feel it in our pockets, in our refrigerators, and in our general sense of security.”Another demonstrator, Aramit Lotem, said Netanyahu had painted any dissenting voices as those of traitors. “It’s not only the virus,” the 61-year-old Jerusalem resident said. “The virus is really a good opportunity for Netanyahu to manipulate our liberty.”At a nearby counter-demonstration of about a dozen people, one person said he had come to protest against “the anarchists”. He accused the anti-Netanyahu camp of staging violent demonstrations. “I believe that if you want to change the leader, it’s at a vote.”On Wednesday, Netanyahu had presented a 6bn shekel (£1.4bn) package, with payments of up to £175 for iniduals, rising to nearly £700 for families, arguing it would boost spending and “get the economy moving faster”.The plan, which needs cabinet approval, was swiftly rejected by senior officials, including government ministers, who said the money should instead be targeted at the poorest citizens. One prominent Israeli columnist, Ben Caspit, accused the leader of “handing out bribes to the masses” to placate nationwide discontent.However, other polls have shown his ruling Likud party remains the most popular in the country, even if slightly fewer people would vote for it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a29ca186d98a5fa560c642771647aaba11f363c/0_32_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b340ea5fc0d76b361d5c4d81d4041f94","title":"luis esteban kyburg argentina dictatorship berlin germany","story":"Luis Esteban Kyburg, who allegedly oversaw deaths of at least 150 during dictatorship, escaped to Germany in 2013A former naval officer, charged with human rights crimes during Argentina’s bloody 1976-83 dictatorship, has been discovered living in Berlin – despite being the subject of an international arrest warrant.Luis Esteban Kyburg, the alleged commander of an elite navy unit believed responsible for the deaths of at least 150 people, was filmed by the Bild tabloidwalking down the streets of Berlin’s trendy Friedrichshain district .“I’m waiting here. Court in Germany, not in Argentina. I’m waiting, innocent, calmly,” Kyburg is seen telling a Bild reporter in the video.Kyburg, who has dual Argentinian-German citizenship, escaped to Berlin in 2013, after fellow members of the military task force he belonged to were convicted in Argentina.About 30,000 people are believed to have been murdered by Argentina’s dictatorship, which set up Nazi-style death camps where its victims were tortured and then killed, many of them thrown alive from military planes into the South Atlantic.Anahí Marocchi, the sister of one of Kyburg’s alleged victims, called for Germany to bring him to justice.“I came to Germany seeking justice for my brother,” said Marocchi in a video posted on Friday by the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), a Berlin-based human rights organization. “In Argentina, Luis Kyburg, who shares responsibility for my brother’s murder, would have been convicted long ago. I have hope that the German justice system will now ensure he will be justly punished for his crimes.”Her brother, Omar Marocchi, is thought to have been killed in 1976 in the city of Mar del Plata by a naval unit whose deputy commander at the time was Kyburg. The young activist disappeared together with his partner Susana Valor, who was three months pregnant.Pregnant women were often kept alive until they gave birth, then murdered, and their child handed over to a military family to raise as their own.Valor’s child is on the list of grandchildren being sought by the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo, an organization of women who have so far located 130 of their grandchildren.“Luis K’s German citizenship must not shield him from prosecution,” said the ECCHR general secretary, Wolfgang Kaleck, in a statement.“As the commander of an elite combat swimmer unit, he is believed to have been involved in the kidnapping and murder of 152 people during the military dictatorship in Argentina,” said ECCHR.The discovery of Kyburg’s presence in Berlin follows the case of another alleged Argentinian torturer, Mario Sandoval, who was discovered to have worked as a professor at the Sorbonne in Paris, before he was detected in December and extradited to Argentina.Kyburg’s flight to Germany offers a mirror image of the escape to Argentina of a large number of Nazis after the second world war, including Josef Mengele and Adolf Eichmann."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/281cc2cdbecfb580982c974b81d8738bbff56ead/0_0_3000_1995/master/3000.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=35e6b0c5bac6a118b92b8f255e616aa9 1320w","title":"coronavirus live news brazil cases near 2m as more countries re introduce restrictions","story":"Increase of 237,743 cases globally EU ‘no closer to agreeing rescue package’ Brazil cases pass 2mThat’s where we might leave this blog for now.

She agrees the parliament must follow medical advice, but says the cancellation of this sitting fortnight makes it difficult for the opposition to scrutinise government. Question time is a really important forum which the opposition can ask the government questions, and every MP has a chance to raise their voice in parliament. So this is critically important that we have parliament sitting. It is a really important vehicle. Australian Liberal MP Tim Wilson has defended the prime minister’s decision to request the next fortnight of parliament to be cancelled. I can’t think of a single federal MP who doesn’t want parliament to sit, including the prime minister, including the ministry, including backbenchers, including the opposition, including senators. But unfortunately the circumstances that we’re presented with put us in a situation where it’s the responsible thing to do at this time...The advice is informed by an evolving situation. Actions that might have been acceptable a week ago aren’t necessarily acceptable today. What the prime minister’s done is taken medical advice based on the circumstances in which we face. Parliament brings together people from all over the country and puts them in one place. If there is deemed a sufficient risk that Victorians and the evolving situation in New South Wales might lead to spreads elsewhere, the cost and consequences could be extraordinary. Donald Trump has commended Australia’s $270bn defence budget boost and discussed China’s “unfair retaliatory trade measures” and threats to Indo-Pacific security, in a phone call with Australian prime minister Scott Morrison.The US president also thanked Morrison for seeking World Health Organisation reform and an investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic.Morrison described the president’s call as “very complementary”.The defence budget boost meant Australia was no longer a passenger in its defence relationship with allies “and that is greatly appreciated by our American friends”, the prime minister said.The phone call came as Trump, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo and other key members of the president’s administration ramp up rhetoric and measures against China.Pompeo has repeatedly pointed to China’s “coercion” in hitting Australia with steep barley tariffs and beef export bans after Morrison led global calls for the Covid-19 probe.Hello, Matilda Boseley here with you now.Just on that previous news, the Australian prime minister has requested the cancellation of the upcoming parliamentary sitting, due to fears of politicians from more heavily infected state mingling and potentially spreading the disease to other states and territories. The acting chief medical officer of Australia said in a statement:It is my medical advice that, despite proposed mitigation measures, these risks would be significantly higher in the context of a parliamentary sitting period due to the number of persons travelling from Victoria and the inevitable mixing with ACT residents, members, senators, staff and visitors within Parliament House.If the speaker grants this request, it means the next parliament sitting fortnight will begin on 24 August rather than 4 August as planned. Residents of Australia’s second most populous city, Melbourne, are waiting with bated breath to see if case numbers reduce in the next few days as the city approaches two weeks of lockdown. Yesterday the state of Victoria, where Melbourne is located, recorded a record 428 cases in one day. This number is approaching the highest ever national daily total back from the country’s first wave. Health officials are hoping to see a drop in cases from today, the 10th day of serious new city-wide lockdowns, otherwise harsher social distancing measures may be on the table. A positive Covid-19 case has been found in a Melbourne prison for the first time, raising fears for the safety of inmates. The infected man was new to the politan Remand Centre and was conducting a precautionary two weeks of isolation before entering the main prison population. In NSW health officials are still grappling to control a cluster at Sydney’s Crossroads Hotel, which has now been linked to 42 cases. NSW’s case numbers are still generally in the teen or single digits, but officials fear that this growing cluster could place the state in a similar situation as Victoria. As a result, NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian tightened restrictions on restaurants and bars, limiting group numbers to ten a requiring all patrons to be seated while inside. Patrons who visited a western Sydney Thai restaurant have also been ordered to get tested and self-isolate after a third Covid-19 case linked to the venue. NSW Health on Friday afternoon said a customer who dined at Thai Rock in Wetherill Park on 10 July had tested positive for Covid-19.NSW will hold their daily press conference at 11 am local time.Up north, Queensland police intercepted more than 43,000 vehicles and turned away 1,143 at the border with New South Wales, and authorities have constructed a 700-metre border wall at the border suburb of Coolangatta. Queensland has now banned people from entering the state if they had visited “hotspots” in Sydney. Long delays for motorists looking to cross the state border there are expected to last for months. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has written to the speaker of the House of Representatives to urge the postponement of the upcoming sitting of parliament.Morrison says the government “cannot ignore the risk to parliamentarians, their staff, the staff within the parliament, and the broader community of the ACT that holding a parliamentary sitting would create”.Egypt reported 703 new cases, its health ministry said, the lowest figure since late May. In total, 86,474 cases have been reported and 4,188 deaths, including 68 on Friday, the ministry said.Egypt reopened resorts to foreign tourists on 1 July after tourism came to a halt in March under measures to curb the outbreak. But Egypt has not made it yet to a “safe list” of countries for resumption of non-essential travel to the European Union, which is reviewed every two weeks.Brazil has registered 34,177 new confirmed cases and 1,163 new deaths, its health ministry has said. Total cases in Brazil, the world’s second-worst affected country after the United States, have now risen to 2,046,328 while deaths totalled 76,688. California’s governor has announced strict rules for school reopening that would prevent the vast majority of students from returning to classrooms in the fall as cases hit their highest levels yet in the state.Governor Gavin Newsom announced the new guidance on Friday, which mandates that public schools in California counties that are on a monitoring list for rising coronavirus infections cannot hold in-person classes, and will have to meet rigorous criteria for reopening.The Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz has rejected the proposal for a mass economic stimulus to help lift EU economies from recession, he has said. Earlier, we reported that the Czech prime minister Andrej Babiš had said the EU was no closer to a stimulus deal. Kurz said:Our most important central demand is that there should be no long-term debt union... but that what is decided here remains a one-time action.The chancellor said he had talks with his German counterpart Angela Merkel and the French president Emmanuel Macron on the sidelines of a summit of all 27 national EU leaders in Brussels.There will be new proposals over night. There is a dynamic in our direction.Here’s a summary of the latest news:The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported the greatest increase in global cases, with the total rising by 237,743 in 24 hours.The biggest increases were from the United States, Brazil, India and South Africa, according to a daily report. Previously, the most new cases recorded in a 24-hour period was the 230,370 seen on 12 July. Deaths have held steady and averaged fewer than 5,000 per day in July.Total global cases are approaching 14m on Friday, according to various tallies, marking another milestone in the spread of the disease that has killed more than 590,000 people in seven months.Azerbaijan has extended lockdown restrictions, including the closure of its borders, until 31 August after a further rise in the number of infections, the government has said.People in big cities, including the capital Baku, will be allowed to leave their homes only with special permission from 20 July until 5 August. Shopping centres, cinemas, restaurants, cafes and museums in those cities remained closed, while beauty salons will be reopened.Azerbaijan introduced lockdown measures on 24 March and has extended them several times, most recently until 1 August. The South Caucasus country of about 10 million people had registered 26,636 confirmed cases and 341 deaths as of Friday.Long lines form every morning in one of the Bolivian cities hardest hit by the pandemic as desperate people wait to buy small bottles of chlorine dioxide, a toxic bleaching agent that has been falsely touted as a cure.The rush in the city of Cochabamba to buy a disinfectant known to cause harm to those who ingest it comes even after the Bolivian health ministry warned of its dangers and said at least five people had been poisoned after taking chlorine dioxide in La Paz, the capital.“The health ministry cannot risk recommending something that doesn’t have a scientific basis,” said Miguel Ángel Delgado, a senior ministry official.However, Bolivia’s opposition-controlled congress is promoting the use of chlorine dioxide. Last week, the senate approved a bill authorising the emergency “manufacture, marketing, supply and use of chlorine dioxide solution for the prevention and treatment of coronavirus”.The EU is no closer to a stimulus deal designed to help its member states’ economies recover from their lockdowns, the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, has said.Views remain widely different among EU leaders after hours of talks on Friday on the plan to inject hundreds and billions of euros to restart growth. Babis also said he did not feel the 27 EU heads were getting closer to a deal and that there was no agreement on the size of a new fund proposed at €750bn.The US has suffered another 926 deaths and recorded 72,045 new cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has said. That takes the respective totals to 137,864 and 3,555,877.A top medical official has linked a recent spike in coronavirus cases in Canada to groups of young people gathering in bars, nightclubs and parties. When we examine recent trends in case reporting, there is some cause for concern. After a period of steady decline, daily case counts have started to rise.”Njoo said the daily case count had risen to an average of 350 over the last week up from 300 a day earlier in July. More than 430 cases were reported on Thursday.This coincides with increasing reports of iniduals contracting COVID-19 at parties, nightclubs and bars as well as increasing rates of transmission among young Canadians.”Canada has reported 109,266 total cases and 8,827 deaths, far fewer than in the United States.Officials and experts this week said they saw signs of a new spike as the 10 provinces lifted social and economic restrictions imposed in March to fight the outbreak.

I don’t have any idea about what next year might look like. It’s obviously very confusing.“I’m hoping to study Irish and English in UCC. I do have accommodation lined up but I haven’t put a deposit down because I don’t know what’s happening, if I’ll even need to be based in Cork.“The last few months have been so stressful and the worst thing is just the uncertainty, all the speculation. Hopefully we’ll get as much clarification as possible soon.”“I’m really disappointed and frustrated, especially how the news came. The communication could have been so much better.“I was really looking forward to getting those results next month and knowing what’s going to happen. This is so much different to a normal Leaving Cert year. If I had sat the exams I would have a rough idea of how I was going to do but now I really have no idea what those results will be like.“It just kicks that ball down the way and makes it harder to focus on the end goal which is going to college. I am lucky that the course I want to do is low enough points and most of the courses I want to do are in DCU so it makes planning that bit easier but still I would love to have that certainty closer to the time.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"National Economic and Social Council sets out actions needed for sustainable recoveryAnalysis confirms Covid-19 lockdown translated to short-term emissions reductions\u0026lsquoI intend to make substantial progress\u0026rsquo on securing our habitats, says Malcolm Noonan"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"A beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creatures"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: John ThysPOOLAFP via Getty ImagesAre we near the end of this seemingly endless crisis yet?The short and dispiriting answer is no, we are not even close to the end. There was definitely cause for optimism in the early part of the summer with Ireland seemingly moving through the first three phases of the exit from lockdown with comparative ease. All the talk was of the curve being successfully flattened while new cases declined and the numbers of lives claimed by Covid-19 each day fell significantly. But - as has we have seen in many countries across the world - this beast is not easily tamed and infection rates are on the rise again. The critical R number could be, by some estimates, dangerously close to 2. This has triggered loud alarm bells in the corridors of power and in hospital ICUs across the country which has led to many elements of phase 4 of the lockdown exit being pushed back.Can you remind me again what the R number is?The R-number is the average number of people an infected person passes the virus onto and according to Prof Philip Nolan, the chairman of the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) modelling group, it has likely risen to 1.4, but could be as high as 1.8. When the virus seemed to be on the wane the R-number was closer to 0.6. According to the current models, if the spread of the virus continues as it has done recently, the number of new cases could rise to more than 150 a day by August 10th. The State’s current “precarious position” has seen the Health Service Executive (HSE) warn that hospitals will not be able to cope if a second wave of coronavirus hits during the winter flu season.Why is the winter flu season so important?Because, traditionally, when flu is spreading widely, hospitals are under the most extreme pressure. As it stands, they are operating at an 80 per cent capacity, with the 20 per cent being kept in reserve to allow for any Covid-surge that may happen. During the winter months, many hospitals see their capacity exceed 100 per cent and if that coincides with a second wave - or a continuation of the first wave - of coronavirus, we are going to be in serious trouble.That is all very worrying isn’t it?Everything is very worrying these days but it is important to stress at this point that Ireland has not seen a major spike in infection rates and the county’s 14-day incidence of the virus remains among the lowest in Europe, according to the latest country data from European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. We are not experiencing a second wave of the virus.What is the Covid toll as it stands?Official tallies suggest that - at the time of writing (10:20am on Friday July 17th) it has claimed the lives of 1,749 while 25,698 people have been confirmed as having had the illness.What is behind the increased number of cases in recent weeks?Some class of increase was always going to be inevitable as the country started to reopen and people started going about their daily lives and interacting more with each other. However, there have been clusters arising out of house parties in recent days while about 20 per cent of new cases are connected to international travel, either imported cases or people travelling here from elsewhere and passing the disease on.International travel? I thought we were being told to stay at home?We are. But that doesn’t mean the country has been hermetically sealed. Flights to and from Europe and the US are still taking off and landing as they have done throughout the crisis.The US? But isn’t the disease rampant there?It is certainly a long way from being brought under control in that part of the world and an increase in the number of flights to and from the US in recent weeks has been a cause for concern in many quarters, not least because US travellers are not allowed come to other countries in the EU.Why are they allowed come here so?Because Ireland not in the Schengen Area and as a result it is not part of that wider EU ban. It is, however, important to point out that just because planes are travelling to and from the US, it does not mean there is a significant number of people on those planes.What do you mean by that?Aer Lingus have three flights to the US daily, United Airlines have four a week and American Airlines have three. But the reality is that only a handful of people are on any of those flights. In recent days one flight crossed the Atlantic ferrying eight passengers to Ireland.But why would an airline fly a plane with so few passengers?Freight is one simple answer to that question. There is a significant cargo business that needs to be catered for while it is also important to keep the routes open to allow for essential journeys . There are certainly some tourists from the US and from other problematic countries travelling to Ireland but the numbers are not thought to be significant, at least not at this stage.But don’t people who come here from overseas have to quarantine?No, not really. Tánaiste Leo Varadkar told the Dáil this week that the use of the word “quarantine” in this context was wrong. What people have to do is self-isolate, apparently.And do new arrivals “self isolate”?Well, some do and some don’t an answer which is not much use to anyone we know.So, what’s the deal with travel, then?The advice against unnecessary travel overseas has been extended until the middle of August but the Government still plans to publish a “green list” of countries with similar levels of infection rates that people can travel to on Monday.What? That sounds sort of confusing. Have they not heard of the concept of mixed messaging?Indeed it is confusing. On Monday we will get a list of countries we can travel to with relative safety but we will also be told not to go to those countries or indeed any other countries unless it is essential.And what countries will be on the green list?Too early to say, although you can expect to see countries with a broadly similar infection rate to Ireland’s on the list. Varadkar said the green list would include countries where “you are no more likely to get the virus there than here”. Don’t expect too many countries to feature and even if they do feature you’re not supposed to go to them anyway so it doesn’t really matter.Um, what is the point of the green list then?What indeed. According to the Tánaiste, if a country makes it onto the green list for those travelling “between Ireland and a country on the A-list or the green list there’ll be no restrictions, and that’s based on science, based on the fact that if you’re travelling to one of those countries you’re no more likely to get the virus there than a weekend in Dublin or weekend in Killarney. ”Oh, and wasn’t there talk of a voucher so we could holiday at home?Yeah, that is not going to happen.Anything else about overseas visits and visitors?Well, “tighter controls” are also expected to be implemented on passengers travelling between countries not on the “green list” - possibly random testing for Covid-19. At present, arrivals in Ireland only have to fill in a passenger locator form and agree to self-isolate for a fortnight.And the pubs aren’t opening as planned?No. Pubs that don’t serve food were supposed to be reopening on Monday July 20th but that has now been pushed back until August 10th as health officials raised concerns about an increase in Covid-19 infections. The move was described as a kick in the teeth by publicans.And who is going to police that particular recommendation?At a guess, no-one. The idea that the Garda would have the resources or the inclination to call to someone’s house if they saw some class of gathering taking place and start checking numbers and names and addresses seems outlandish.Can you tell me what is happening with masks?Wearing face masks on public transport is already mandatory and is to become mandatory in indoor spaces such as shops and shopping centres.But do they work?When it comes to something like Covid-19 giving a definitive answer to almost anything is a challenge but we do know that masks do not completely protect people from getting the virus. Masks most likely do, however, push transmission down to controllable levels.Do we have any evidence to back that up?We do. According to one US study, when 80 per cent of a closed population wear a mask, infection rates statistically drop to approximately one-twelfth the number of infections compared to “a live-virus population” where no masks were worn. Then there is the University of Edinburgh study which found masks can limit how far exhaled breath travels out by up to 90 per cent. There is also a third study which found the daily growth rate of infections fell by 40 per cent after mask use was made compulsory in the German city of Jena. There are more studies. A lot more. The bottom line is wearing a mask does little harm to anyone - save for those who medically can not wear a mask - and have the potential to do a whole lot of good.So, is August 10th as the last exit from lockdown now definitive?Not even remotely. The final phase of the Government’s roadmap to unlock the Irish economy from coronavirus restrictions may be pushed out beyond August 10th. The Tánaiste told the Dáil on Wednesday that pubs may remain closed beyond that date. He said pubs, nightclubs and other venues will open “no sooner than 10th August. We are not saying they will open on 10th August.” And he stressed that it depends “on how the virus behaves” and the numbers of coronavirus cases which were rising.Singing?Yes, it emerged on Thursday that a cluster of cases had recently arisen from a microphone used for karaoke at a house party in Co Derry Singing it was one of the easiest ways to spread the virus because of the spray of droplets, Dr De Gascun said.What is happening with schools, the Leaving Cert, university and all the rest?To say there is still uncertainty about what will happen to Ireland’s student body come September is an understatement up there with “Covid is a nasty dose all the same”. The plan as it stands is to reopen schools in September as normal and guidelines on how that will happen will be published in the coming days. More than 60,000 Leaving Cert students will this year receive their grades several weeks later than normal on September 7th with CAO offers for college places issued four days later on September 11th, which means many students may not start their third-level courses until October.And what is happening on the economic front?Next week the Government will publish the snappily-named July Stimulus. It is the Government’s centrepiece policy to try to re-stoke the economy after four months of near standstill during the coronavirus pandemic. The Department of Social Protection said on Monday that the numbers receiving the pandemic unemployment payment had now reduced by 42 per cent, or by more than 250,000 since the peak of nearly 600,000 in early May. It said that 345,000 people would receive the Covid-19 unemployment payment this week, a drop of 67,300 on last week.What’s the story with the wage subsidy scheme?Mr Varadkar has said continuing the wage subsidy scheme, and commercial rates waiver, until the end of 2020 will be central considerations of the July Stimulus. Mr Varadkar has also said he will consider extending the wage subsidy scheme - which is due to come to an end on October 31st - to seasonal workers and others who might not have been on the payroll last February. He also indicated a reboot of the already-operational restart grant for businesses.Something big is happening in Brussels this weekend?Yes, EU leaders are meeting to discuss a €750 billion recovery plan to fight the worst recession in a century. The leaders will also discuss the EU’s next seven-year budget. A group of so-called frugal states led by the Netherlands want cut to the €750 billion and believe the money should be distributed as loans. The European Commission has proposed borrowing on financial markets to raise the money for the fund, which would then largely be distributed to member states in grants that would not need to be directly repaid.What is happening with Covid in other parts of the world?The crisis is getting worse in many parts of the world and even in places which were thought to have largely brought the pandemic under control, there are spikes still happening. On Thursday the US reported a record 77,300 new coronavirus cases , the highest one-day total for the pandemic so far. It is by far the worst-affected country worldwide with almost 3.6 million confirmed infections and 138,358 fatalities. Brazil is next highest with 2,012,151 cases and 76,688 deaths. The state of Victoria in Australia has just reported a record 428 new cases, 10 days in to a lockdown of Melbourne while the neighbouring state of New South Wales has tightened restrictions on pubs, restaurants and gatherings. The residents of three districts in a Barcelona suburb have been told they must stay indoors amid a resurgence in cases while Lerida in the north east of Catalonia, which is home to 160,000 people, is now in lockdown after a surge in new infections.And how are we doing with the vaccine?The global race to develop a vaccine is continuing apace with several candidates leading the charge. Dr Anthony Fauci, of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said one could be ready at the end of the year, although others have said that may be optimistic.Moderna’s potential Covid-19 vaccine produced immune responses in patients in the early stage trial, according to results published in a peer-reviewed journal this week. The US biotech company’s vaccine candidate produced antibodies in all 45 participants in the first cohort of the phase one trial run by the National Institutes of Health, while the paper said there were no safety problems that could curtail further trials.The trial showed that 15 days after the first dose, all participants had produced antibodies. After 57 days, the participants had on average more antibodies than a group of 38 recovered patients, whose symptoms were mainly mild or moderate. There are other companies not far behind but the next stage will be wider trials and then wider ones. And only then will vaccines be produced after which the scramble to get the doses will start.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Cabinet seeks to apply muscle to address insurance costs and compensation payoutsHome carer group says plan creates safer option for people most vulnerable to virusHealth officials still concerned about resorts in countries with low virus rates, says doctorMinister for Housing denies rift with Attorney General, length of extension to be disclosedVanessa Job had months of anxiety ahead of Covid-stalled surgery to remove liver tumourKinahan cartel target had been shot as he sat in his car in a Topaz filling station in 2017Mr Justice White said matter is \u0026lsquourgent because of his impending release\u0026rsquoSome 1.4m flu vaccine doses for adults secured but no universal scheme plannedIncrease in numbers nationally reflected in numbers visiting doctors\u0026rsquo surgeriesT\u0026aacutenaiste understands people wanting \u0026lsquofreedom pints\u0026rsquo but says pubs closed \u0026lsquofor good reasons\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoNo other parent has the ability to deny their child access to their own birth cert\u0026rsquoJury heard man accused of murdering Adrian Donohoe submitted alibi on September 26th last yearDefendant has previous convictions for sexually assaulting another child\u0026lsquoLast few months have been so stressful and the worst thing is the uncertainty, all the speculationMan also accused of swinging baby overhead and to the ground, barely missing steel polePlan for orientation weeks may be cancelled, Irish Universities\u0026rsquo Association warnsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4307310.1595017122!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"reform of insurance sector targeted by senior ministers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIncoming Minister of State Sean Fleming will lead the reform project. Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsSenior Ministers have been drafted in to strengthen the Government’s approach to insurance reform after the previous administration’s efforts to bring down costs to consumers fell short.The  has learned that a high-level meeting took place this week involving five senior Ministers, as the Government seeks to bring extra political and departmental muscle to bear on the long-standing issue of high insurance costs and compensation payouts.Talks this week on how to reform the sector were attended by Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment Leo Varadkar Minister for Justice Helen McEntee Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Michael McGrath and Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman, who spoke to the meeting about the costs of insurance to the childcare sector.The insurance sector has traditionally been the responsibility of a junior minister in the Department of Finance, but sources said several Cabinet Ministers would play a “hands on” role in an effort to deliver on promises made in the programme for government.‘Competitive issues’The reform agenda will still be led, however, by a junior minister in the Department of Finance.This week’s meeting was chaired by Jack Chambers, who was since reappointed as government chief whip in the wake of Barry Cowen’s dismissal from Cabinet.Incoming Minister of State Sean Fleming will continue to lead the project, it is understood.The programme for government promises to “prioritise reform of the insurance sector” and to address high claim payouts and “competitive issues” to build an insurance system “which is affordable and reliable and underpins a vibrant economy”.Sources said that previous efforts to reform the sector had partially fallen flat due to a lack of political capital invested by Cabinet ministers in the reform programme.The previous government, with then minister of state Michael D’Arcy in charge of the brief, convened a costs of insurance working group (CIWG), which was composed of officials from the Department of Finance, Central Bank, Department of Business and the Department of Justice, as well as the State Claims Agency and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.Consumer-facing segmentsHowever, reform efforts often struggled to get purchase due to the lack of ministerial involvement in line with ministries directly associated with different aspects of the issue, figures involved in the last administration said.Government sources believe that delivering early on the issue in the new government’s term, especially in consumer-facing segments like motor insurance, would resonate with voters.While it is understood that this week’s meeting did not address specific policy proposals, the programme for government outlines a range of potential interventions, with an emphasis on motor, public liability and employer liability insurance.These include an enhanced and reformed role for the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, the regulation of claims management companies and claims harvesters.It will also consider the need for a constitutional amendment, and an associated referendum, which would enable the Oireachtas to set down guidelines on award levels.It also promises to expand the Garda Economic Crime Bureau and increase the penalties for fraudulent claims, and place perjury on a statutory footing, making the offence easier to prosecute.A spokesman for the Department of Finance said the Government’s intended work on insurance “builds and expands upon previous work done by the Cost of Insurance Working Group”.“The purpose of this week’s Ministerial meeting was to discuss how to take forward the implementation of this cross departmental insurance reform agenda.”Stay on

Photograph: PA WireMore than £700 million is to be spent on building new infrastructure, hiring staff and developing technology to ensure Britain’s border systems are fully operational when the UK leaves the EU at the end of the year.UK cabinet office minister Michael Gove said the major investment would ensure traders and the border industry are able to “manage the changes and seize the opportunities” when the transition period ends in December.The £705 million package includes £235 million for staffing and IT systems, and £470 million for port and inland infrastructure to ensure compliance with new customs procedures and controls.New border infrastructure will be built inland where there is no space at ports, while ports will get one-off financial support to ensure the right infrastructure is in place.Of the £235 million for staffing and IT systems:The funding relates only to the implementation of the mainland Britain-EU border, and the UK government is expected to publish specific guidance and measures for Northern Ireland in the coming weeks.Mr Gove said: “We are taking back control of our borders, and leaving the single market and the customs union at the end of this year bringing both changes and significant opportunities for which we all need to prepare.“That is why we are announcing this major package of investment today.“With or without further agreement with the EU, this £705 million will ensure that the necessary infrastructure, tech and border personnel are in place so that our traders and the border industry are able to manage the changes and seize the opportunities as we lay the foundations for the world’s most effective and secure border.”The transition period is set to end at the end of December 2020, when the UK will leave the single market and customs union.The funding package comes ahead of a public information campaign in which guidance will be given to traders and hauliers explaining what they may need to do to prepare for the end of the transition period.Meanwhile, the Sunday  reported that Chancellor Rishi Sunak is poised to introduce tax cuts and an overhaul of planning laws in up to 10 new freeports.Mr Sunak is said to be planning to open bidding for towns, cities and regions to become freeports – where UK taxes and tariffs will not apply – in his autumn Budget.The paper said the ports will be “fully operational” within 18 months of the UK leaving the customs union and single market at the end of this year. – PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states.

The final primary contest takes place on June 7th.

The US has consistently broken one-day records in recent days, but this is by a fairly wide margin.The US, by far the worst-affected country worldwide in terms of the number of cases and deaths, has 3,576,221 confirmed infections and 138,358 fatalities.Brazil is next highest with 2,012,151 cases (the country passed the sombre milestone of 2 million on Thursday) and 76,688 deaths.India’s cases of novel coronavirus crossed the million mark, the health ministry data showed on Friday, as infections spread out into the smaller towns and the countryside following the lifting of a vast lockdown.USMore than half of all states in the US – 30 out of 50 – have reported record one-day increases in cases this month.Florida reported a record increase of more than 15,000 new Covid-19 cases in 24 hours on Sunday, as the Trump administration renewed its push for schools to reopen.If Florida were a country, it would rank fourth in the world for the most new cases in a day behind the United States, Brazil and India, according to a Reuters analysis.Democratic officials have instructed senators, members of Congress and party delegates not to physically attend their national convention this summer, a sign of the ever-shrinking aspirations for their big campaign event in the face of a surge in coronavirus cases in the United States.The directive, issued Thursday, ensures that little will happen at the convention site in Milwaukee beyond speeches from former vice president Joe Biden, his vice-presidential nominee and a handful of other top party leaders. The remainder of the events – state delegation meetings, parties, voting on the party platform and on Biden’s nomination – will happen virtually or not at all.“We have been working closely with state and local public health officials, as well as epidemiologists, and have come to the hard decision that members of Congress should not plan to travel to Milwaukee,“ Chasseny Lewis, a senior adviser to the convention committee, wrote in an email to congressional aides. “No delegates will travel to Milwaukee, and Caucus and Council meetings will take place virtually.”The Democrat convention announcement came on the evening when Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, would have been delivering his acceptance speech for the nomination, underscoring how profoundly the coronavirus has upended the campaign.Earlier this year, shortly after the spread of the virus shut down many states across the country, the Democratic National Committee postponed its event by a month.Traditionally, conventions have marked the start of the heated autumn campaign season, giving parties a chance to energise their supporters and sway undecided voters with days of pageantry and largely uninterrupted media coverage.IndiaA surge of 34.956 new cases in India in 24 hours took the national total to 1,003,832. The health ministry also reported a record number of 687 deaths for a total of 25,602, adding that 635,757 people have recovered and the recovery rate was continuing to improve at 63 per cent.The development comes at a time when several Indian states are imposing focused lockdowns to stem the outbreak amid frantic efforts by local governments to protect the economy. So far, three states — Maharashtra, Delhi and Tamil Nadu — have accounted for more than half of total cases. But in India’s vast countryside, which is much less prepared and with weaker health care, the pandemic is clearly growing. The continuing surge has forced authorities to reinstate lockdowns in some cities and states.\u0026nbspBrazilCoronavirus infections in Brazil no longer appear to be rising exponentially but the country is “still in the middle of this fight” as new cases and deaths grow by thousands every day, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Friday.Brazil, at the epicentre of Latin America’s growing epidemic, on Thursday passed the mark of 2 million confirmed Covid-19 cases, amid growing anger over president Jair Bolsonaro’s handling of the outbreak.Only the United States has more infections worldwide.Mike Ryan, WHO’s top emergency expert, said that the number of new cases in Brazil had stabilised at 40,000-45,000 per day, with daily deaths hovering at about 1,300.“What’s not happening yet is that the disease has not turned, and is not heading down the mountain. From that perspective, the numbers have stabilised but what they haven’t done is started to fall in a systematic day-by-day way,” he told a news conference.“So Brazil is still very much in the middle of this fight,” he said.The reproduction or “R” - the number of people each infected person goes on to infect - now appeared to be between 0.5 and 1.5 across states in Brazil, Ryan said, down from more than 2 just weeks ago. “There is an opportunity once those numbers have stabilised to drive transmission downwards. I think that opportunity exists now for Brazil to do that,” he said. “But it is going to take a very sustained, concerted action in order for that to occur.”Some 11 percent of all infections in Brazil are among health workers, he said.Brazil on Thursday passed the 2 million confirmed coronavirus cases mark, with little sign that the rate of increase is slowing as anger grows over president Jair Bolsonaro’s handling of the outbreak.Brazil, the largest country in Latin America, is home to around 210 million people – roughly two-thirds the size of the US population.CanadaA recent spike in coronavirus cases in Canada is worrying and can be linked to groups of young people gathering in bars and nightclubs and at parties, a top medical official said on Friday.“When we examine recent trends in case reporting, there is some cause for concern. After a period of steady decline, daily case counts have started to rise,” Howard Njoo, the deputy chief public health officer, told a briefing.The daily case count rose to an average of 350 over the last week up from 300 a day earlier in July, Mr Njoo said. More than 430 cases were reported on Thursday.“This coincides with increasing reports of iniduals contracting Covid-19 at parties, nightclubs and bars as well as increasing rates of transmission among young Canadians,” Mr Njoo said.“Singing, mingling and dancing in close contact with others in closed spaces and crowded places is not the way to party this summer. These are ideal conditions for the spread of Covid-19.”Canada has reported 109,266 total cases and 8,827 deaths, far fewer than the United States.FranceFrance on Friday reported 836 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 within 24 hours to stand at 174,674, amid rising concerns over renewed flare-ups of the epidemic.The number of deaths in France from the new coronavirus rose to 30,152 on Friday from 30,138 on Thursday, the country’s health department said on Friday.The number of people in hospital with the illness fell to 6,688 from 6,796 on Thursday, continuing a weeks-long downtrend.–ReutersNew York TimesEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"no wonder thiscommittee thinksit runs country","story":"The sage has spoken! Sir Patrick Vallance, Chief Scientific Adviser, has declared that he can see “absolutely no reason” why people should be told to go back to work in their offices. Sir Patrick, as we can infer from this statement, neither runs a chain of city-centre hair salons or restaurants, nor works in one, nor runs a Government that relies on tax revenue from such establishments. If he did, he might admit there are some reasons – conceivable, imaginable reasons – why getting a bit more foot traffic into town centres is a good idea.Still, if Sir Patrick has somehow picked up the idea that he does, in fact, run the Government, it is surely not his fault. Ever since our senior-most ministers began to claim that they were merely “following the science”, the country has logically concluded that the people really in charge are the scientists, by which we mean the particular scientific committees convened by our bureaucracy to interpret the epidemiological runes. With names like Sage and Nervtag, their branding is a little mixed – Sage sounds alright, but Nervtag brings to mind some sort of laser game at the Trocadero – but this has not detracted from their assumed monopoly on wisdom.On the face of it, convening a single committee of all the best boffins to deal with a crisis sounds like a great idea. Surely we’ll reach the best outcome if we lock a group of experts in a room to thrash it out and then do as they say? It has a certain glamour to it, too, like a gathering of philosopher kings or a papal conclave, especially at the start when the list of participants was inexplicably kept secret.Alas, the sense of glamour is long gone. Inside government, there is a palpable sense of disappointment – even betrayal – that “the science” and its s, “the experts”, seem to have got things so badly wrong. Sage has already been effectively stripped of its dominance in favour of a special unit inside Downing Street, a setup that quite possibly repeats the mistakes of the old, highly centralised arrangement. Yet the argument now emerging does not seem to be one about whether Sage and its fellow committees were fit for purpose or how successful their method was, but whether or not the Government followed their advice slavishly enough. Why, the critics demand furiously, did the Government fail to lock down the country on March 16, when Sage said so, and instead do it on March 23?So if we are going to focus our post-mortem on a week in March, then we could just as well look at the week before March 16 as the week after it. This was the week in which the NHS finally gathered the data showing that its critical care capacity was nowhere near sufficient and when the data was finally obtained showing that the disease was spreading much faster than realised.Ultimately, however, we should not be asking about why the lockdown was not imposed sooner, but how the Government could have managed the crisis without needing such a severe lockdown at all? How could we have been more like Germany or Sweden, where normal activity fell by 30-50 per cent, rather than Spain and Italy, where it fell by 60-80 per cent?The current setup for scientific advice, especially Sage and Public Health England (PHE), will not survive this interrogation. It is not just that these structures resulted in inordinate amounts of time spent on the wrong questions, like whether China was screening passengers in Wuhan airport or even “when to stop contact tracing” (correct answer: never). It is not just that they spent very little time on contingencies in case their strategy was wrong by, for example, suggesting buying up PPE or testing reagents. It is also that they enabled politicians to pretend that major questions of values and risk were in fact questions of science, to be handled by “experts” – and then blamed on them if they went wrong.The experts were clearly under the same impression. For the entire month of February, for example, Sage members talked in terms of “when” the pandemic spread in the UK, rather than “if”. PHE produced a paper in mid-February suggesting that although “in theory ever increasing levels of resource can be allocated” to contact-tracing, it could not continue past “a reasonable limit”. It did not discuss what this limit might be, however, because “opportunity cost, cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness are out of scope”. If such essential questions were out of PHE’s scope – and they rightly were – then why exactly were our politicians outsourcing major decisions on how to allocate resources, whether to contain the virus and what risks to take to a small group of scientists and technocrats known as “the science”? Is it any wonder these technocrats panicked when their data was wrong?Last week, during a virtual event run by Policy Exchange, the German health minister Jens Spahn explained how his government handles scientific advice. They have a semi-equivalent of Sage, but this forms only part of the picture. From the start, Mr Spahn called in various experts to discuss different topics – vaccines, drugs, a second wave. “It’s very informal,” he said. “Once I see a professor giving an interview that has an interesting approach or a different view, I actually call him immediately.” He does not wait for a centrally compiled document to arrive with a stamp of approval called “the science” on top of it. He weighs up the trade-offs, negotiates with other politicians and agrees a strategy. As he said: “In the end, it’s politicians who decide.” After all, if we wanted a little coterie of sages to run the country, we would elect them. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"parents grandparents call clarity pm says grandparents can help","story":"Parenting groups and pensioner campaigners have called for urgent clarification after Boris Johnson said grandparents could provide childcare and ignore social distancing rules.The Prime Minister was asked whether he planned to scrap the one metre-plus rule when two households meet so that grandparents can provide childcare and help more parents return to work.Mr Johnson said that, in those circumstances, grandparents would count as part of the bubble formed with two households indoors.His comments appeared at odds with the official guidance, which says only iniduals living alone can form support bubbles with another household, meaning they do not have to observe social distancing within their group.Two households are permitted to meet indoors but must observe social distancing.Urging parents to return to work at a press conference in Number 10 Downing Street, Mr Johnson was asked by a member of the public whether he would scrap the one-metre-plus distance within households to let grandparents help with childcare.He replied: I think your grandparents, your children\u0027s grandparents, would count as part of the bubble that you\u0027re forming with two households indoors, so I think it\u0027d be ok to continue with those childcare arrangements within your household.Number 10 later insisted the support bubble rule had not been relaxed, saying: You could ask two grandparents to provide childcare, but would in doing so would be advised to respect the \u0027one metre-plus\u0027 rule.But Mr Johnson\u0027s comments sparked confusion among parents and grandparents\u0027 groups, and calls for more clarity.Justine Roberts, the founder and chief executive of parenting website Mumsnet, told The : Plenty of Mumsnet users are feeling particularly frustrated after Thursday’s statements, concerned about the lack of planning for – or even mentions of – childcare, and irritated by the confused messages about safe bubbles with grandparents.It’s impossible to help feeling that women\u0027s voices are missing from the table when it comes to planning these things, and that is just adding to existing anxieties about families\u0027 health, well-being and finances.Annie-Marie O\u0027Leary, the editor-in-chief of Netmums, added: Confusion reigns – and of course it\u0027s an issue that no women are advising on the policy.Boris\u0027s buddies have clearly never had to face the daily juggle of work plus childcare, and it shows. What are parents supposed to do? Lock their kids in their rooms for the day and skip off to work hoping for the best?Any sensible person knows that work and childcare are inextricably linked, and you can\u0027t plan adequately for one without planning adequately for the other. The comments from the PM show he clearly doesn\u0027t know anything about that, and hasn\u0027t read the guidance on grandparents and bubbles.Caroline Abrahams, the charity director at pensioners\u0027 group Age UK, added: It seems practically impossible for grandparents to provide childcare for their grandchildren if they are babies or toddlers, for as long as the \u0027one metre-plus\u0027 social distancing rule remains in place.This in turn is likely to leave families puzzling over how they can get back out to work if this depends on grandma and grandpa looking after their little ones for one or more days a week.Unless the threat from Covid-19 miraculously disappears, which no expert says we should expect, there will be some difficult trade-offs for us to make inidually and as a society in the next few weeks and months.It is, however, increasingly clear that older people are at much greater risk of becoming seriously ill if they contract the virus, compared to younger groups. For this reason, it looks like we will need to carry on being disciplined and cautious, if we\u0027re to protect the older people in our lives.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"people have lost sense humour blacking says tory mp dressed","story":"Blacking up your face is no worse than putting on fancy dress, Tory MP Sir Desmond Swayne has said as he claimed people have lost their sense of proportion and sense of humour over it.Sir Desmond came under fire in October when a photograph emerged of him with his face blacked up as James Brown at a Blues Brothers-themed party some years ago.In an interview with The \u0027s Chopper\u0027s Politics podcast (which you can listen to on the audio player above), he said: I am disappointed that people have lost a sense of proportion and a sense of humour, and that there are things you just can\u0027t say and can\u0027t do, even if they\u0027re done for the best possible reasons.Going to a party and having fun in fancy dress seems now to be something that one has to take great precaution about in these woke times, and we all do unless we want the opprobrium of the great and good.Asked whether he could see why blacking up was offensive, he added: Why is it offensive? Now my children tell me: \u0027Dad, of course it is offensive, of course you can\u0027t do that.\u0027 But why?Are you saying a black man can\u0027t get into a fancy dress party as a white man? That we must stay in our racial silos? That we can\u0027t interchange? I just don\u0027t see the world that way.There is not a racist bone in my body. I can\u0027t see why we have got to this stage where there are things that you can\u0027t touch and can\u0027t go to.Asked whether he likened blacking up to wearing fancy dress, he said: Indeed. And when people go on stage they put a lot of makeup on. Now what is the difference in it being dark makeup or light makeup?Sir Desmond said he had been inundated with support after he said in the Commons that being forced to wear a face covering to go shopping was a monstrous imposition.He told Chopper\u0027s Politics: I possess a face mask and I on occasion have worn it – but what a large number of people feel is a monstrous imposition is being forced to do so.We are quite happy to be asked to do things, to be encouraged to do things, but it is an outrage to be required to do it. If we were asked to mask up when going into a shop, most people would be prepared to do so.He said some Tory party members had ripped up their membership cards and told him that they would not vote Conservative again. He had received 360 emails in the 72 hours since his comments, of which they were in favour of his position by a factor of 20 to one.The decision had been driven by polling which suggested that people were in favour of making face coverings compulsory, he said, adding: The science on this is not settled. There is a disagreement among the scientific professionals as to the validity of this.I am quite confident that the Government made a political decision on the basis of polling because ... the polling is strongly in favour of masking up by about 60 to 40.Listen to the full interview on The \u0027s weekly political podcast, Chopper\u0027s Politics.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"queen thanks sir tom moore amazing fundraising tells hundred","story":"When he set off down the garden path a few months ago to complete 100 laps of his garden in time for his 100th birthday, Captain Tom Moore could never have imagined that his fundraising walk for the NHS would lead him here. But on Friday, as he crossed the immaculate turf of Windsor Castle\u0027s quadrangle, he took the final few steps in what has been a quite unbelievable journey.  The Queen was there to present him with a knighthood in her first face-to-face Royal engagement with a member of the public since the coronavirus lockdown came into force in March.Neither the monarch nor Sir Tom wore masks, although she maintained a suitable distance and held her father\u0027s ceremonial sword in a white gloved hand as she lightly touched each shoulder with the tip of the blade. There was no need for Sir Tom to arise – out of consideration for his age, courtiers had indicated that he was not required to kneel. The 100-year-old had jokingly warned earlier in the day that, if he did, I\u0027ll never get up again. As it was, he bowed his head before the Queen: two torchbearers of the wartime generation who have done so much to inspire the nation during the pandemic.The Queen has spoken previously of the resilience of her generation, and here was the best of it.After handing him the insignia of Knight Bachelor, the Queen congratulated Sir Tom for his efforts in raising more than £32 million for the NHS. Thank you so much, she said on behalf of the nation. An amazing amount of money you raised.The investiture was brief and informal, considering the grand surroundings of Windsor Castle, where the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh have been shielding throughout the pandemic.Sir Tom had arrived at the castle accompanied by his daughter, Hannah Ingram-Moore, son-in-law Colin and grandchildren Benjie, 26, and Georgia, 11. He wore a blue suit and the regimental tie of the Duke of Wellington’s Regiment, known as the Iron Dukes. At his advanced age, Sir Tom, who originally hails from Keighley, still exemplifies that Yorkshire grit.Earlier in the day, the family left their 16th-century home in the village of Marston Moretaine, Bedfordshire, where Sir Tom completed his fundraising walk. As he got into the car, he admitted to waiting journalists outside that he was somewhat overwhelmed at the prospect of travelling to Windsor Castle. It isn\u0027t everybody that gets the chance to see the Queen, he said.He arrived under bright blue skies and the sort of brilliant sunshine so familiar in Windsor for Royal occasions. Whatever nerves he might have felt were replaced by a broad grin which never left his face.The pandemic and Sir Tom\u0027s age hastened Friday\u0027s investiture, with normal protocol put to one side – especially as coronavirus has led to the postponement of all other honours being conferred. Typically, knighthoods are matters for the Queen\u0027s Birthday Honours and New Year\u0027s Honours lists. However, on May 20 Sir Tom\u0027s knighthood was formally approved by the Queen and announced by the Prime Minister, who praised him for having provided us all with a beacon of light through the fog of coronavirus. For a man who has lifted the nation\u0027s spirits in such a magnificent manner, the Queen was willing to make an exception. Protocol is being written as we speak, Sir Tom\u0027s daughter Hannah admitted in an interview earlier in the day. We will simply be doing as we are told.The Queen\u0027s arrival into the quadrangle, hours after attending the wedding of her granddaughter Princess Beatrice, was signalled by piper Major Richard Grisdale of the Royal Regiment of Scotland.The Master of the Household, retired Vice Admiral Tony Johnstone-Burt, carried the insignia of Knight Bachelor, while King George VI\u0027s sword, which belonged to the Queen\u0027s father when he was Colonel of the Scots Guards, was entrusted to a waiting page boy.After the ceremony, the Queen and the former Army captain chatted on the quadrangle. Perhaps with an eye on the Duke of Edinburgh reaching that same milestone next year, the Queen congratulated him on becoming a centenarian. One hundred is a great age, she told him. Sir Tom replied to the 94-year-old: Well, you’ve a long way to go yet.Pinned to his chest were the medals which tell his own wartime story: the 1939-45 Star and the Burma Star from when he fought in the Arakan Campaign in 1942 and came so close to the enemy on motorbike reconnaissance patrols that he recalled seeing the whites of their eyes. It was also while stationed in Burma where he watched Dame Vera Lynn perform. Sir Tom admitted recently that Dame Vera, whose funeral took place last week after dying at the age of 103, had written to him to praise him for his fundraising achievements.It has been a dizzying ascent. In a matter of months, Sir Tom has been elevated to what the Prime Minister described as a true national treasure. Among the wartime medals which he proudly wore was his honorary colonel\u0027s medal of the Yorkshire Regiment, which he had been granted on his 100th birthday in recognition of his fundraising achievements.He also had another prized possession pinned to his chest: a gold Blue Peter badge.The accolades may have come thick and fast, but meeting the Queen, he said, was the greatest honour of them all.Asked what meant more to him, raising the millions for the NHS or his audience with the Queen, Sir Tom replied without hesitation: The money is very useful, but you\u0027ve only one Queen.During an interview after the ceremony, he also revealed that the Queen had given him a private message delivered away from the cameras. But when pushed what that might be, the old soldier’s instinct kicked in and he refused to break rank. That, he said, is between the Queen and I.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"scientists identify six different types coronavirus increasing","story":"Six distinct types of coronavirus have been identified by scientists in a breakthrough that promises to save lives by flagging the highest-risk patients.Analysis of thousands of cases by artificial intelligence software has revealed different clusters of symptoms and ranked them in order of severity.Headache and loss of smell are common to all six groupings, but the range of symptoms varies widely after that.Scientists at King\u0027s College London (KCL) found that patients with the sixth type of Covid-19 are nearly 10 times more likely to end up needing breathing support than patients in the first group.This is significant because often patients only deteriorate to a critical stage several days after after showing symptoms. The new ranking system should flag up the highest-risk cases and give doctors the opportunity to intervene earlier.The findings, derived from KCL\u0027s symptom tracker app, used data from 1,600 users in the UK and US who have had confirmed Covid-19. The resulting algorithm was then tested on an independent cohort of 1,000 users in the UK, the US and Sweden.These findings have important implications for care and monitoring of people who are most vulnerable to severe Covid-19, said Dr Claire Steves from KCL.If you can predict who these people are at day five, you have time to give them support and early interventions such as monitoring blood oxygen and sugar levels, and ensuring they are properly hydrated – simple care that could be given at home, preventing hospitalisations and saving lives.The least severe categories of the virus were characterised by flu-like symptoms, either with or without fever.Gastrointestinal problems, such as diarrhoea, dominate the third category, whereas fatigue, confusion and ultimately respiratory problems are associated with the increasingly severe fourth, fifth and sixth categories.The team discovered that only 1.5 per cent of people with cluster one, 4.4 per cent of people with cluster two and 3.3 per cent of people with cluster three Covid-19 required breathing support. These figures were 8.6 per cent, 9.9 per cent and 19.8 per cent for clusters four, five and six respectively. Nearly half the patients in cluster six ended up in hospital, compared with just 16 per cent of those in cluster one.Being able to gather big datasets through the app and apply machine learning to them is having a profound impact on our understanding of the extent and impact of Covid-19, and human health more widely, said Sebastien Ourselin, professor of healthcare engineering at KCL and the senior author of the study.The study, published in a pre-print server called medRxiv, is yet to be peer-reviewed.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tale two hong kong dissidents challenging china opposite ends","story":"In Hong Kong’s ultra-humid summer of 2014, 21-year-old Nathan Law met 17-year-old Joshua Wong for the first time in an air-conditioned conference room, surrounded by the territory’s iconic glass-plated skyscrapers. As representatives of their respective student groups, the two young men were at a meeting to discuss the burgeoning pro-democracy movement that was spreading like wildfire through the territory. That autumn saw both Law and Wong rise to global prominence as leaders of the Umbrella Movement, when thousands of Hong Kongers took to the streets (many of them carrying yellow umbrellas to protect themselves from police pepper spray) to protest China’s interference in their electoral system.They later co-founded Demosistō, the pro-democracy party, and became inseparable political allies, rarely away from the megaphone at a street rally. In 2017, they stood side-by-side in the dock as they were sentenced to six months in prison for illegally occupying a public square, along with their activist friend, Alex Chow.But their paths erged in a remarkable fashion earlier this month. Whilst 23-year-old Wong has vowed to stay in the territory to fight “until the last minute”, Law, who turned 27 on Monday, said hasty goodbyes to his two adopted street cats and stuffed his backpack with clothes, before boarding a night-time flight from Hong Kong to London, where he is setting up a European wing of their pro-democracy movement. He could not even say a proper goodbye to his parents in case they were accused of aiding his subversion. After take off, he took a photograph of the territory, twinkling through the plane window – possibly the last time he will ever see it.The differing fates of the two anti-Beijing dissidents highlights the dilemma posed for Hong Kong’s seven million residents by the sweeping national security law enacted by China on June 30 June, without any discussion in Hong Kong’s legislature – to stay or to go? The deeply controversial law makes ambiguously defined crimes of seperatism, subversion, terrorism and “collusion with foreign elements” punishable by life in prison effectively banning, say opponents, any criticism of the government. If you’re reading this, Beijing says it applies to you, too: anyone around the world who criticises the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) could, in theory, be arrested upon arrival in Hong Kong.The law was swiftly condemned by the US, UK, and EU as an attack on human rights and a violation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, signed by Margaret Thatcher in 1984 (in preparation for Britain’s return of sovereignty over Hong Kong to Beijing in 1997), in which China promised the territory partial autonomy under a rule of “one country, two systems”. The very real risk of a life behind bars became too much for Law, who says he is “not optimistic” he will ever see his parents again –  if they visit him in London, they risk prosecution upon their return.“It’s a tough decision to leave behind your family and connections,” he tells me when we Zoomed this week from a London location that he asked to be kept secret. His eyes are tired but he greets me with a warm smile, and is chatty, charming, and meticulously polite, with no hint of the hubris you might expect from a Nobel Peace Prize-nominee (he was put forward for the 2018 award by a group of American Senators, along with Wong and Chow). “For me, it’s more than a personal choice – we’ve got our responsibilities, and I hope that my decision will make the movement more prominent internationally.”Over the phone, 6000 miles away in Hong Kong, Wong talks with similar sadness about the departure of his ally and friend, with whom he has shared many a geeky conversation about Marvel superheroes. In contrast to Law’s loquaciousness, Wong speaks with a brisk, almost-robotic matter-of-factness – a style honed from years of addressing street rallies. “I’ve known him since the Umbrella Movement and trust him a lot,” Wong says. “Based overseas, he will bring our voice to the global community.”Born three years apart in the Nineties, the pair are among the first cohort of Hong Kongers to have no memory of British rule, although both grew up reading Harry Potter. Besides their taste in books, their childhoods were markedly different. Wong has long been intensely political: at around 13, he remembers crying with frustration when his father Roger, an IT consultant, took him to volunteer at a home for destitute old people. “What’s the point of these visits if nothing ever changes?”, he asked.  His mother, Grace, was a family counsellor who helped Wong after he was diagnosed with dyslexia at seven. Both devout Christians, they cancelled their wedding celebrations in 1989 in solidarity with the victims of that summer’s Tiananmen Square massacre. By 15, Wong had already led a successful territory-wide protest against a new school curriculum that cast China’s authoritarian system in a glowing light.The young Law, in contrast, had little interest in politics and instead dreamt of becoming a professional e-sports player. His parents spent most of their life in mainland China, suffering under the famines of Chairman Mao’s Cultural Revolution and moved to Hong Kong – the “golden city” – when Law was six. But their time in China imprinted upon them a fear of the CCP they did not want Law to go into politics, and have spent the last six years “really worried” about what Beijing might do to him. Law stumbled into politics largely by accident, he says, as a result of China’s encroachments on the territory’s freedom.Indeed, it was a decision taken by the Chinese government in 2014, to row back on their promise of universal suffrage for Hong Kong, that eventually brought Wong and Law together, organising student boycotts and demonstrations on their university campuses. On September 26 that year, Law told Wong: “We need an escalation.” Scaling a 10-foot fence, they stormed Civic Square, triggering a 79-day sit-in dubbed ‘Occupy Central’. The pair were arrested and initially sentenced to community service. But, perhaps keen to make an example of them, officials appealed against their sentence and had it increased in 2017 to six to eight months in prison, plus a five-year ban on running for any political office.“It was a shock to me and also to Hong Kong, because we were in the first batch of political prisoners to receive prison for a peaceful demonstration,” remembers Law. “We didn’t intend to harm or damage anything, we were just crossing a fence.”Law was sent to Tong Fuk prison, where he shared a cell with 20 other inmates, most of them gangsters. He spent his time in the prison workshop, making clothes for other inmates, with the occasional trip to the outdoor yard. He shrugs off his time inside as “very routine, tedious, boring … it didn’t feel like a prison in mainland China where you get tortured and questioned all the time.”Wong was sent 30 miles away to Pik Uk prison, where he struggled with the strict 6am wake-up call: “I’m not a morning person”, he says. The highlight of the week came on Sunday, when inmates gathered around a television to watch re-runs of soap operas. He kept himself busy by sweeping the canteen floor, and writing letters to the outside world, in which he quotes Hagrid, one of JK Rowling’s best-loved characters. In one letter, published in his autobiography, Unfree Speech, in January, he writes, “So far the biggest source of discomfort is the bed. In fact, calling it a bed is an overstatement. It’s nothing more than a wooden plank with no mattress.”Although their paths have now taken them to opposite sides of the globe, Law and Wong share the view that the world needs to do more to support the people of Hong Kong. Both are pleased with Dominic Raab’s recent decision to offer a path to UK citizenship for the three million residents of Hong Kong eligible for a British passport – though Wong points out that this “lifeboat” is insufficient without “pressure on China”.  And both praise the Government’s decision this week to expel the Chinese company Huawei from the UK’s 5G network. “People have an illusion that these companies are not owned by the CCP,” says Law. “I think it’s a wise move.” Both, also, criticise China’s handling of coronavirus: “There is proof the Chinese government hid important information at the beginning,” says Law, “China has to take responsibility for spreading this deadly disease.”Together, the pair have already been through more in their twenties than many friends may in a lifetime. Do they think they will ever meet again? “I hope that day will come soon, but I’m not very optimistic,” Law says, with a sad shrug. Wong adds: “I wish to see him again – I hope for the best and prepare for the worst. It’s time for the world to stand up for Hong Kong.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/17/18/gettyimages-1150700176.jpg","title":"alyssa milano blackface allegations snooki ziwe fumudoh interview watch","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Actor is latest celebrity to be interviewed by comedian\u0026nbspZiwe FumudohThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Alyssa Milano says her past Snooki parody – which recently resulted in allegations of blackface – was a “political statement” on the portrayal of Italian-Americans on US television.The actor, who has denied the blackface claims and called them a “smear campaign”, was asked about the allegations in a new interview with comedian Ziwe Fumudoh.Fumudoh hosts the programme, titled Baited, every Thursday on Instagram Live. Past guests have included food writer Alison Roman, influencer Caroline Calloway, playwright Jeremy O Harris, and Milano’s former Charmed co-star Rose McGowan.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDuring the latest interview, Fumudoh asked Milano: “Have you ever worn blackface before?”Milano responded: “I’ve never worn blackface.” She then said that she once did a “parody of Jersey Shore” for the comedy platform Funny or Die, which involved being transformed into Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi, one of Jersey Shore\u0027s stars.Mad Men keeping blackface scenes to preserve ‘historical accuracy’Alyssa Milano urges Redskins to change team name“There are pictures of me all over the Internet in tanface,” Milano added. “And that’s what people are saying – that I did blackface.”Milano, who comes from an Italian-American family, said she felt moved at the time to comment on Jersey Shore\u0027s portrayal of Italian-Americans. Polizzi was born in Chile and adopted by Italian-American parents. Jersey Shore was a topic of controversy at the time of its release in 2009, as some criticised its portrayals of young Italian-Americans, deeming it offensive and stereotypical.In her interview with Fumudoh, Milano added: “There are a lot of people that have done blackface, though. And I don’t know that, in hindsight, that maybe making fun of Snooki’s tan wasn’t the greatest move, especially with the Internet.“But I did feel like at that time I was making a political statement about how Italian-Americans are depicted.”Back in June, Milano responded to the blackface allegations on Twitter, writing: “Hey, a*******. The below picture is me parodying Jersey Shore and Snooki’s tan. Snooki’s tan (she is a sweetheart by the way) is worthy of parodying as is Trump’s ‘tan’.

As a result, prior to our work, wireless vision has not been possible for small robots or insects.”The camera weighs about 250 milligrams, which is about one-tenth the weight of a playing card, and was placed on the back of two beetles: a death-feigning beetle and a Pinacate beetle.It transmits images at one to five frames per second and sits on a mechanical arm that can rotate 60 degrees.Using this mechanism, researchers can get a high-resolution, panoramic shot of the beetle’s environment.The challenging in developing the cameras was not image quality or weight, but battery life.Smartphone cameras, while small, require batteries too big to be carried around by insects. As such, the researchers had to use a tiny, low-power black and white camera which moves when a high voltage is applied to it.During social distancing could these Japanese robots be the answer?They turn their heads to steer where they want to see with extra clarity, such as for chasing prey or a mate. This saves power over having high resolution over their entire visual field.”The benefit of using this method is that the researchers can track an object without having to expend excess energy moving the whole robot.The camera system was also used to design what the University of Washington say is the “world’s smallest terrestrial, power-autonomous robot with wireless vision”.It uses vibrations to move, and uses as much power as a Bluetooth radio. It can move at a rate of two to three centimetres per second – apparently faster than any other tiny robot which uses vibrations to move - and has a battery life of 90 minutes.These cameras could be used to explore previously-unreachable environments and, in the future, could potentially be solar-powered.“This is the first time that we’ve had a first-person view from the back of a beetle while it’s walking around. There are so many questions you could explore, such as how does the beetle respond to different stimuli that it sees in the environment?” Vikram Iyer, a electrical and computer engineering doctoral student who also authored the research, said.“Also, insects can traverse rocky environments, which is really challenging for robots to do at this scale. So this system can also help us out by letting us see or collect samples from hard-to-navigate spaces.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This can reach temperatures of more than a million degrees Celsius.That is 300 times greater than the surface of the star, which is a comparatively chilly 5,500 degrees Celsius.Despite decades of study, the mechanisms that heat the corona are still not fully understood, but such discoveries are vital in the study of solar physics.It is possible the nanoflares could be the key to unlocking this mystery.NASA shares time lapse footage of the sun over a decadeYannis Zouganelis, Solar Orbiter deputy project scientist at ESA, said in a statement: “It’s obviously way too early to tell, but we hope that by connecting these observations with measurements from our other instruments that ‘feel’ the solar wind as it passes the spacecraft, we will eventually be able to answer some of these mysteries.”“We are all really excited about these first images – but this is just the beginning,” said Daniel Muller, ESA’s Solar Orbiter project scientist. “Solar Orbiter has started a grand tour of the inner solar system, and will get much closer to the Sun within less than two years. Ultimately, it will get as close as 42 million km, which is almost a quarter of the distance from Sun to Earth.”The temperatures of the campfires will be tracked using a tool called the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (Spice), which takes images using ultraviolet light.“Spectroscopy is a powerful tool for the diagnostic of fundamental processes in hot plasmas. Each spectral line gives us a piece of the puzzle – combining information from all lines reveals the amazing complexity of the atmosphere,” said Dr Andrzej Fludra, the Spice Instrument Consortium lead.The Solar Orbiter has ten sensors: six to monitor the Sun and its surroundings, and four to monitor the environment around the ship itself.These include the Orbiter’s Solar Wind Analyser, which measures heavy charged atoms of carbon, oxygen, silicon, and iron in the solar winds from the Sun’s inner heliosphere. By comparing the data between the sensors, scientists will also be able to better understand how solar winds are generated. Solar winds are charged particles sent from the Sun that can affect the entire solar system.“Already our data are revealing shock waves, coronal mass ejections, phenomena called ‘switchbacks’ and fine-scale waves in the magnetic field that we are only able to see thanks to the extreme sensitivity of our instrument,” said Professor Tim Horbury from Imperial College London.Nasa delays trip to Mars after rocket problemNASA shares time lapse footage of the sun over a decadeNasa asks for ideas for toilets for astronauts to use on the MoonNasa plans to fly a helicopter on MarsOn occasion, the Sun pushes out a great number of particles into space. These are called “coronal mass ejections” and, when they hit the Earth’s magnetic field, they can cause a huge surge of electrical current.On Earth, these events can disrupt and damage satellites, affecting people’s mobile phones, GPS signals, and electricity networks.The largest one to hit the Earth happened in 1859 and caused telegraph wires to short out, sparking fires. If the same event happened today, it could potentially cause continent-wide blackouts and severely damage the electrical grid.Such damage could take months or years to repair, at a cost of up to £300bn to the UK economy.The Solar Orbiter itself was part of a combined effort by many countries: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, as well as Nasa in the United States.It was built in the UK by Airbus Defence and Space, and launched from Nasa’s Cape Canaveral site in Florida on 10 February.The Solar Orbiter will eventually get closer to the Sun than the planet Mercury, the solar system’s closest planet to the Sun.Gravitational forces from Venus and Earth will be used to direct the craft. By November 2021, it is expected to be in operational orbit.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Cycle the New ForestWhether you discovered a love of cycling thanks to the lockdown or have been a convert for many years, the traffic-free and waymarked trails of the New Forest make it an enticing spot for all levels of rider.If you want to leave your wheels at home, there are plenty of local bike-hire options, which can also provide advice on the best routes for your party – from easy family jaunts to long-distance challenges.See thenewforest for information on cycling routes.3. Hike through the Chilterns Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingChef Tom Kerridge on reopening his Michelin-starred pub safelyAn area of outstanding natural beauty with rolling hills (such as Coombe Hill, above, the highest vantage point in the area), the sparkling chalk streams and ancient woodlands right on London’s doorstep sounds too good to be true, but the Chilterns offer precisely that.With over 300 square miles of scenery and attractions to absorb the crowds, a quiet route is also a walker\u0027s goal. The Chilterns Conservation Board and Chiltern Society have developed a series of 23 walks across the Chilterns which are social-distance-friendly, taking in hill climbs and gentle ambles.Visit chilternsaonb.org for more details about their social-distance-friendly walks.4. Kitesurf at Camber SandsCamber Sands has over two miles of beach to absorb the post-lockdown crowds. The eastern end, marked with black and white flags, is reserved for activities such as kitesurfing, and there is plenty of space for novices to learn how to handle a power kite on land or water.An introduction from The Kitesurf Centre covers the fundamentals and can be booked as one-to-one coaching, as a single group from the same household, or in groups of up to three people from separate households.The nearest train station is in Rye, four miles away. A six-hour introduction to kitesurfing course starts at £99, minimum age 12. See thekitesurfcentre for details.With the pools closed and the seaside crowded, many swimmers are looking elsewhere to take a dip. Far from the chlorinated confines of the local swimming bath, a fresh water reservoir, lake or river can be an exhilarating alternative, but there are many safety issues to consider before getting wet in the wild, so make sure you read up on the hazards first.​See outdoorswimmingsociety for advice and a directory of open-water swimming lakes to explore.6. Learn to jet skiThe beaches could be busy, but you can leave the crowds in your wake after completing a Royal Yachting Association (RYA) personal watercraft course that, in just one day, provides you with all you need to safely helm a jet ski inland or on the coast.There are plenty of places in the UK that can teach you – such as Jetski Safaris in Poole – and no experience is necessary.Visit jetskiandpowerboattraining for more information. Single-person RYA proficiency course for jet skis from £180.7. Ride on an Olympic bike trackThe Hadleigh mountain bike track hosted the London 2012 Olympics and has evolved since then into one of the premier cross-country destinations in the UK.Hadleigh Country Park also provides one of the largest green spaces in Essex, with plenty of opportunities to explore the coast from Southend-on-Sea to Benfleet. The nearby castle ruins offer panoramic views of the River Thames and Kent on the opposite shore.Leigh-on-Sea or Benfleet stations are the closest to the country park. It’s a 10 to 20-minute ride from there to the track. See explore-essex for details.Meet the kayaking instructor...Having been cooped up during lockdown, it’s safe to say that large numbers are wanting to experience the great outdoors like never before now businesses are reopening.“We\u0027ve been ridiculously busy,” says Adrian Fall, below, owner of Brighton-based The Kayak Coach. “People have been so excited about being on the water.”Fall\u0027s passion is teaching people how to kayak, canoe and paddleboard – then leading them on trips up Sussex\u0027s beautiful estuaries and rivers.He set up The Kayak Coach almost 12 years ago and has just taken on two extra staff to add to the three he already employs teaching and guiding on the water: “I love being outside and now\u0027s the time to meet people again and introduce them to the sport I love,” he says.Reopening the business required important changes, as per Government guidelines. Group sizes have been reduced from eight to five to comply with social distancing – “It\u0027s actually a nicer experience for everybody,” Fall adds – and all equipment (boat, buoyancy aid, helmet) is cleaned and sterilised after each use.A one-way system has also been added to its training centre at Ashurst. “We\u0027ve made changes to what we do. But we\u0027re almost back to normal in terms of what we can offer,” Fall explains. Additionally, barrels of water are provided for sailors to wash their hands before and after each session. Fall admits that the past three months of enforced closure have been tough for the business and lovers of the outdoor life, but that people are “having to look locally because they\u0027re not going to France or America”. He adds: “They didn\u0027t know we were here, but they\u0027re excited about accessing the river on our doorstep.”See thekayakcoach for more detailsTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You Go Please keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Leicester may have been the first, but it was never going to be the last. After a recent spike in Covid-19 infections, Blackburn with Darwen has become the second local authority to have taken preventative action and tighten certain restrictions as the country continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic. The Lancashire council has not gone as far as its East Midlands counterpart in imposing a lockdown – residents have instead been told to limit the number of people they accept into their homes, and to wear face coverings in all enclosed public spaces – but the leaders and people of this northwestern region know what is waiting around the corner.“We do not want to end up like Leicester,” councillor Paul Marrow tells The Independent. “It’s all about being proactive, which is the approach we’ve taken.” Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFor now, the resurgence of the virus in these parts appears small by comparison. Whereas Leicester recorded roughly 155 cases per 100,000 people prior to its lockdown, Blackburn with Darwen has, to date, reported a peak rate of 47 infections per 100,000. But all fires start from a single spark – and authorities here are doing what they can to put out the growing flames.Focus has turned to the danger of household transmission across Blackburn and its neighbouring towns. Unlike in Leicester – where officials have struggled to pinpoint the source of the city’s outbreak – local health authorities for Blackburn with Darwen have managed to develop a clear picture of the way in which the disease has spread within the region.“It seems to be household clusters where a person who has been infected may not know it, they may be asymptotic they return home and then pass it on to four or five family members,” Denise Park, chief executive of the local council, said.“We do have a higher than average number of large households – five or more people – so we’ve been looking at that. The most recent data testing shows that the majority of cases are from our south Asian heritage communities.”What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyAround a third of Blackburn with Darwen’s 148,000 population are from ethnic backgrounds, with a large Pakistani and Indian heritage population, and according to Professor Dominic Harrison, the council’s director of public health, 97 of the 114 cases recorded across the past two weeks derive from these minority groups. To help protect these communities, and prevent the situation from escalating across the region, authorities have tailored their measures accordingly, telling people they can now only accept two visitors into their homes beyond their immediate families.“With it being household transmission, we didn’t think a Leicester-styled lockdown was the right answer,” explains Ms Park. “It’s about being targeted with the action we take.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe response of Prof Harrison and his team has so far been met with positivity and optimism, on account of its specified and proactive nature. “Dominic Harrison has been absolutely on the ball with Covid-19 and he’s doing his job very well, keeping a good eye on the local community,” Gabriel Scally, a member of the Independent Sage board and professor of public health at the University of Bristol, said.“I think the council is handling it extremely well. This is the sort of approach that will work well nationally, because it’s generated by the local community, their representatives and the director of public health – trusted figures that the people can be sure they’re acting in the interest of the towns and the population.”It’s rare praise in these troubling and ided times, when the overwhelming narrative of the Covid-19 pandemic has been one of chaos and confusion. And there’s certainly hope to believe that the strategy adopted by Blackburn with Darwen proves effective.Leaning on the side of caution, authorities have announced that the current measures – which also recommend against hugs and handshakes – will be in place for four weeks before the council considers easing them. In the meantime the region’s caseload is expected to rise due to increased testing, says Ms Park, but after that it’s hoped the numbers will drop again.The story of Leicester’s lockdown – and the lessons to be learntAnd thankfully, access to data has not proved an issue, as was the case with Leicester. Ms Park said that the information provided by the local government to Prof Harrison has contained details on ethnicity, postcodes and ages, ensuring authorities have the means to develop a more comprehensive understanding of what’s going on in and around Blackburn.Additional testing units have been deployed in the local community, allowing more people who are carrying the disease but not displaying symptoms to get easily tested. “Let’s not wait till people have got symptoms,” says Ms Park. “Let’s do asymptomatic testing, do some case finding and then say to people they need to isolate.”Equally, the council has said that footways in the centre of Blackburn will be widened, to further promote social distancing, while some parking bays will be removed to help separate people queueing for takeaways and pubs. Council workers have meanwhile been visiting local religious and community centres to spread the message, and providing advice to smaller shops as to how they can protect their customers.Still, for all the encouraging work of the council, and the sense of “stoicism” that it has drawn from the local population, as Mr Marrow put its, the situation in Blackburn and Darwen has not passed by without the dangerous, racist rhetoric which marked many conversations concerning Leicester and its outbreak.“The danger is people see the data and say it’s one section of society to blame, and that is absolutely not what we’re saying,” councillor Saima Afzal said. “There are are a cocktail of factors at play here.“We are aware there are problems in the south Asian wards but I want to make it clear that they are not less or more likely to follow the rules. That’s not what my experience shows. From what I’ve seen and images I’ve been sent, there are groups gathering from a whole range of backgrounds.” She warned against analysing the statistics inaccurately as “they can be twisted any way you want to portray them”.Against this backdrop of tension, Blackburn with Darwen holds its breath as it takes another step into the unknown. Lessons have clearly been learnt from the Leicester episode, with the Lancashire council well poised to fight the virus, but there’s still a long way to go for the region.Blackburn with Darwen\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.For a town already caught in a slow and painful state of decline, the coronavirus pandemic has brought Blackburn to its knees. Decades of de-industrialisation and growing economic deprivation have left the area struggling to find its purpose – while larger, more prosperous neighbours have reinvented themselves – but the economic damage wrought by Covid-19 could prove to be the final straw.“We’ve been here for 32 long years,” said Maria Elder, the owner of Sudell Sandwiches, a small cafe in the town centre. “Lots of loyal customers over the years. We’d serve students from the college too. We even had a contract with the police to feed the officers when the football was on. That’s all gone, for now at least. We’re barely coping.”The worry for Ms Elder and other independent businesses is what a second lockdown would mean for the town. After a recent surge in cases, Blackburn finds itself walking a dangerous line. The region’s seven-day rate currently stands at 47 infections per 100,000 people and is expected to rise in the coming days.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAuthorities have already tightened restrictions this week, urging residents to limit the number of visitors to their homes and to wear face coverings in enclosed public settings, but the plunge back into full lockdown would likely drive many companies to the point of no return.“I think it’d shut us down,” said Ms Elder. “People are extremely scared and worried, because there’s a lot of places that only opened on Monday – beauticians, hairdressers. And it’s still very quiet.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safely“We’ve been here a long time, we’re an established business, but it has seriously impacted us, it really has. I’ve had to lay off one girl as a result.”Asad Jalil, who has run a dry cleaning shop in the town centre since 1989, said a second lockdown would push his business “over the edge”.“If there’s another lockdown for two or three weeks, it’s going to make it worse. People are already scared. There’s not enough money for going out, buying new stuff, people are making do with what they’ve got. “I can’t see my business returning. I doubt I’ll be here next year. Many of my usual customers are at home, working in their pyjamas. They don’t need to go into the office anymore. They don’t need to get their suits cleaned. I only came back yesterday but I don’t think it’s going to pick up again.” No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSome businesses never made it to the end of lockdown, laid low by the sudden arrest in economic activity across the country. Although trade has been good for Anna Green and Emily Yates since they reopened their salon earlier this month, they are one of the few to have come through this period of turbulence.“In this building alone, there’s one room empty next door and upstairs there’s six empty,” Ms Green said. “They’ve had to fold. It’s not the most affluent of areas. A lot of people have packed up and gone.”The pandemic has only added to Blackburn’s problems. The local council has seen its spending power decline by nearly one-third since 2010, losing out on tens of millions of pounds, while the region has one of the lowest life-expectancy rates in the country.Some buildings in the town centre have stood empty for 10 years or more. Unwilling to take a risk on Blackburn and its struggling economy, business has been turning elsewhere in the northwest.“Blackburn was a booming town,” said Mr Jalil, the dry cleaner owner. “People used to flock here from all around, but now they don’t even bother. They either go into Bolton or Preston. There’s no footfall in Blackburn anymore.”Deprivation is also a serious and growing issue. Last year, the charity End Child Poverty revealed that half of all children in Blackburn lived in poverty, with this rate up to two-thirds in the ward of Bastwell.Nonetheless, stoicism runs deep in these parts. Residents are aware that everyone has a role to play in getting through the pandemic.Blackburn holds its breath after recent spike in Covid-19 cases“Everyone is putting on face masks, all our customers are taking it on board,” said Marcus Gannon, director of Hobkirk Sewing Machines, which can trace its history in the town back to 1903. “No one has got anything against it. They all appreciate it. And in a way, it gives customers who want to come in here the confidence to do so. People are just getting on with it.”Ms Elder, the cafe owner, echoed these sentiments, saying that “the majority of people are now wearing masks” and abiding by the rules – at least in public. “Everyone is taking it seriously,” she said. “I think the new restrictions are a good thing but we’ll have to see how it goes.”The council has also been working hard with small businesses to ensure they can operate under the current system. “I know some of our officers have been out and helped put the new guidance in place,” said Saima Afzal, a councillor. “Everyone has been really proactive. I think we’ve got a really resilient community in Blackburn so they are carrying on.”“My company has been here for 100 odd years,” said Mr Gannon. “I want it to be here another 100 years. We can’t give in.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Lockdown restrictions in some parts of Leicestershire will be lifted as early as this weekend following a review by public health experts, the government has announced.Areas outside of Leicester City and the borough of Oadby and Wigston will align with the rest of England from Saturday 18 July.It means that non-essential shops, bars, restaurants and hairdressers will be permitted to open, along with schools and childcare centres.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever people living inside the restricted zone will have to wait until 24 July to use non-essential shops and schools because “prevalence of the virus is higher”.Bars, restaurants and hairdressers will stay closed, with another review due to take place by 1 August.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said: “I know the past two weeks have been difficult for those living in and around Leicester, especially those who have been shielding for so many weeks.“While we are not yet in a position to lift all the restrictions in place, we are now able to take cautious steps to allow areas outside of Leicester City and the borough of Oadby and Wigston to fall in step with national guidelines and introduce some relaxations within the City of Leicester and the borough of Oadby and Wigston.“I realise that this will be frustrating for those areas that remain under additional restrictions and I am determined to be straight with you all, we will ease restrictions as soon as the data shows that it is safe to do so.”Shielding advice remains in place for the entire area of Leicester, including where restrictions have been lifted.The government said the decision follow a fall in the seven-day infection rate in Leicester from 135 to 119 cases per 100,000 population, with 4.8 per cent of people testing positive.Mr Hancock’s initial announcement on Thursday that the Leicester lockdown would last for another two weeks was met with anger and disappointment.Leicester mayor Sir Peter Soulsby accused the government of making a “party political” decision to keep city-wide restrictions even though data showed only 10 per cent of the city had higher infection rates.“They have chosen to focus on the city geographical area, effectively the area of the county that votes Labour, and that’s just scandalous,” he said.Additional reporting by Press AssociationNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The coronavirus pandemic has taken a toll on the health of the nation’s relationships, according to research which suggests bonds between couples, friends and colleagues have all been strained by the UK’s lockdown.One-fifth of people feel friendships with others outside of their household suffered in the last four months as social distancing kept people apart, UCL’s Covid-19 social study found.But the lockdown seems also to have impacted on those who live together, with 20 per cent of respondents saying friendships with their housemates were now worse. Couples fared little better, with 18 per cent reporting their relationship with their partner had suffered since March.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRelations between co-workers deteriorated the most as many UK workplaces adjusted to remote working and video conference calls. One-quarter of people surveyed for the non-peer reviewed observational study said they were getting on worse with colleagues since the start of lockdown.“Our study shows that lockdown measures are having a significant toll on people’s relationships, both with people locked down together and those who have been unable to see each other over the lockdown period, said Dr Daisy Fancourt, a professor of psychobiology and epidemiology at UCL.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyShe added: “This is especially true of people with diagnosed mental health issues and younger adults, as well as those with lower household incomes, key workers, those living along and those living with children, all of whom may be facing greater financial or mental pressures which have been exacerbated during the lockdown period.”Worsening relationships were most common among younger adults. Of the 12 per cent of people who reported the breakdown of a relationship, most were aged under 30 and the fewest were over 60.However, researchers found relationships between neighbours had improved since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, particularly among people aged between 30 and 59.  Cheryl Lloyd, head of education at the Nuffield Foundation, which is funding the ongoing study, said the finding “suggests a resurgence in community spirit” during the pandemic.But she added it was “cause for concern that the survey also show that people who are more vulnerable - those on lower household incomes and those with diagnosed mental health issues - are more likely to report worsening friendships and relationships during lockdown”.Launched the week before the UK entered lockdown on 23 March, the UCL study is the largest into the UK public’s attitudes, health and wellbeing during the coronavirus pandemic.Researchers found complete compliance with lockdown measures continued to fall over the past fortnight, particularly among young adults. But 90 per cent of all adults and 80 per cent of under-30s said they were still complying with most rules.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A teenager has donated more than 3,000 face coverings to The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign to protect volunteers delivering food to the most vulnerable people.Business student James Eid, 19, has given thousands of protective coverings to our appeal partner The Felix Project, which is delivering up to 30 tonnes of food every day to those hit hardest by the pandemic.Mr Eid, who lives in Radlett, was inspired to make face coverings because his grandmother, Anna Ross, 68, has Behcet’s disease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe condition, which causes blood vessel inflammation and has various side effects, also lowers the immune system meaning she is more vulnerable to Covid-19.Mr Eid struggled to obtain low-cost face coverings to protect his grandmother and so, spotting a gap in the market, decided to import specialist production machines and make them himself.How to support our campaignFamilies face ‘summer of hardship’, food charities warnWhat it’s like to volunteer on the frontline during a pandemicUsing money donated by his father, who is joint CEO of food company Signature Flatbreads, the Lancaster University student imported a production line of four machines, naming his new company Signature Masks.The entrepreneur has since opened a factory in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, with production beginning in earnest at the end of the month. To start with, he will make 36,000 face coverings a week, but the size and scope of the factory means he will be able to scale up production and make up to 500 million coverings annually.The coverings are disposable and made up of three-ply non-woven plastic material – meaning they are water resistant and can be worn for up to 24 hours. He will sell the coverings from his website – they will cost £3.79 for 10, or £2.99 if consumers subscribe for weekly deliveries.On donating thousands to The Felix Project, the teenager said: “I want to support those who are helping others in this crisis.” Mark Curtin, of The Felix Project, said: “These Signature Masks will help protect volunteers and staff in our food redistribution warehouses.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As well as two Michelin-starred pubs – The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach – he also opened a traditional butcher and founded Pub in the Park, the biggest food and music festival tour in the UK.During lockdown, staff from Kerridge’s businesses were volunteering to help a new charity called Meals from Marlow which delivers free food to NHS staff, key workers and people in need. This started small in early April and with support from over 1,000 donors, it recently ended up serving its 75,000th meal.From 4 July, both The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach have reopened fully in Marlow to welcome back hungry diners.7 great summer days out for the familyThe team have prepared a comprehensive Covid-19 policy document with a number of measures to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers.

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Help is desperately needed to support wildlife rangers, local communities and law enforcement personnel to prevent wildlife crime. Donate to help Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbspHEREThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Boosting businesses that protect nature but also bring benefits to people and governments is the best way to prove the value of conservation in Africa, two of the continent’s leading economic thinkers have said.  The economic value of every acre of land in countries with some of the world’s fastest growing human populations needs to be proven, they say. Quick wins like logging or farming have so far won out over conserving wildlife habitats.  But nature-based businesses can compete against extractive industries if governments and people grasp their economic as well as ecological benefits, according to Fred Swaniker, a Ghanaian entrepreneur and education pioneer, and Clare Akamanzi, the head of the Rwanda Development Board. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThat will help protect wildlife species, conserve habitats that provide clean air and water, and keep human development distant from animal species that carry deadly diseases, they said.The pair took part in the second in a series of webinars hosted by The Independent as part of its Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign, in partnership with international conservation organisation Space for Giants. “Poverty in Africa is often so high we can’t do conservation for conservation’s sake,” Mr Swaniker said. “We need to show people how nature benefits them and how it’s the pathway to the prosperity that they need.” Conservationists warn of poaching pandemic due to coronavirus crisisHis African Leadership University’s campus in Kigali, Rwanda, was dedicated to mentoring a new generation of young Africans aiming to transform conservation into a growth sector. “As an economic sector this is one that has tremendous unfulfilled potential,” Mr Swaniker said. “As we look at developing Africa we can’t just copy the rest of the world, we have to look at what we as Africans have that is unique to the continent. One of the things that we have that is a true competitive advantage is nature, some of the unique bioersity in the world that can therefore really be leveraged for growth.” Rwanda has transformed itself into one of Africa’s fastest-growing and modernising economies. That growth has in huge part been driven by wildlife tourism, Ms Akamanzi said. Tourism and conservation contribute 7 per cent of Rwanda’s GDP and bring in more foreign business than any other sector, she said. Tourism investors had opened the way for other enterprises to follow. Key to that success was strong leadership, transparent laws, and making it easy to do business, Ms Akamanzi added.Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They share a year-old chihuahua called Luna, which Anne-Sophie is believed to have kept in the split.A source close to the DJ said: “Roman loved Soph and things had been going really well for them. But being in lockdown is tough for any couple and they just weren’t able to make things work, which has been upsetting and tough for them both.“His pals have encouraged him to move on and have got him on Raya, which is packed with attractive and creative women. He’s set up a profile with his best photos and has set the music on his page to the song Gold, by his dad’s band. He’s having fun with it.”Roman’s career has gone from strength to strength in the past year, having finished third in the TV jungle, landed an ITV talk show with his pop star dad and become a regular on Celebrity Gogglebox.But in December he was hoping to start a family and thought Anne-Sophie was the girl he would do it with.He said at the time: “Every time I see a child, I get broody.”Plenty more fish in the sea, Roman.DESPITE not ­seeing each other for four months, The Pussycat Dolls are now closer than ever, according to Carmit Bachar.The singer, who posed in a patterned bikini and floral blue shirt for the cover of Lapalme magazine, said of bandmates Nicole Scherzinger, Kimberly Wyatt, Ashley Roberts and Jessica Sutta that absence really has made the heart grow fonder.Carmit explained: “We’ve been going through similar things. It’s more important than ever now to show that women can support each other and hold each other up.”But there is one person for whom Gemma will always open her purse – her mum Joan.The reality star, left, said: “I like to treat her. I am massively independent and I do like to pay my own way.” Thinking out loud on her BBC Radio  podcast, Gemma mused: “Could we ever get rid of money “I don’t think we could.

Cara, who spent lockdown in the US, joined American Kaia, her model mum Cindy Crawford and dad Randy Gerber in a social bubble when restrictions relaxed last month.This included joining the family for dinner at swanky Malibu restaurant Nobu in June, with Cara having split from her long-term girlfriend, Pretty Little Liars actress Ashley Benson, the previous month.With Kaia quickly becoming the model of the moment, I couldn’t think of a better pal than Cara – named the UK’s highest-earning catwalk queen last year – to help her navigate the industry.I can reveal she is dating rapper Jonathan Kabamba, who she posted this photo of on Instagram yesterday.She captioned it: “My Love, my King. Thank you for all the light, strength and joy you have brought into my le. I feel capable of anything with you by my side.”The pair are believed to have been dating since last year.Jonathan, who hails from the Congo, is the first man she has publicly dated after splitting from rapper HYPO in .Before that she was married to scientist Adam Gouraguine but they split after ten years, just a year after tying the knot.Jonathan headed up a community centre with recording studio in Chad-well Heath, North London, to give kids skills to stay out of gangs.

Im now .In the past, Id hear people say this or that place could cure him, so Id bring him there. I spent all my money, but nothing worked.If he isnt cured and I die, who will take care of him Mr Lis successful surgeries were followed by half a year of intense rehabilitation. He was able to stand with the help of a walker but can now walk on his own for short periods.He said: Im just very happy to be able to sleep lying flat again. I hadnt slept on my back for more than  years.The first time I saw my mother after surgery, I suddenly realised how much she had aged while taking care of me all these years.She couldnt take care of me forever, so I wanted to cure this disease and reduce her burden.To me, Professor Tao is my saviour.There wouldve been no cure for me without him.Professor Tao, who said he had never treated such as severe case of spinal arthritis in his career, called Mr Li strong-willed.A video shows him training to lt his right leg while grasping on to a walking frame after securing his the limb to his hospital bed.Another recent clip from the man shows him walking slowly outdoors, also with the help of a walking frame, and doing gentle exercises with his arms.Prof Tao Huiren, Director of the Department of Spine Diseases, said that Mr Li was discharged from the hospital last month after largely recovering from the surgery.It’s now reported he has ed home and opened up a shop to earn a living while he continues his recovery.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Today’s government claim is an attempt to ert attention from the threat to the NHS and the Tory party links to Russian oligarchs expected to be revealed in the long-buried parliamentary Russia report.The former Labour boss refused to answer questions from journalists outside his home in North London this afternoon.Mr Corbyn was asked by a journalist: Mr Corbyn, Do you have anything to say about Russian disruption  Were you complicit Did you help those who attacked our election, Mr Corbyn Mr Corbyn then shut the gate and said: Goodbye.The reporter continued: Do you have anything to say at all, Mr Corbyn, about whats happened today Do you regret whats happened Are you complicit with Russian interference in our elections, Mr Corbyn Would you do it again, Mr Corbyn Do you have anything to add about what happened, Mr Corbyn Do you regret your actions, Mr Corbyn, do you regret taking that document The ex-Labour leader then shut the door after wheeling his bike inside, followed with another goodbye to the reporter.The Government said today:The dossier of leaked minutes from trade talks, which Mr Corbyn claimed was evidence Boris Johnson would sell the NHS to Donald Trump, was ripped off the website.Analysts at the time claimed the papers, waved by Mr Corbyn at an election rally, bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign called Secondary Infektion.Mr Corbyn has been repeatedly accused of being soft on Russia, even refusing to blame them for the Salisbury Novichok attack.The ousted hard left Labour leader would only go as far as saying “the evidence points strongly” to the Kremlin.In March last year Mr Corbyn sparked a furious backlash after warning Theresa May against “rushing way ahead of the evidence” on Salisbury.His spokesman at the time said memories of the Iraqi “dodgy” dossier meant it was “problematic” to accept the Government’s position.Labour today distanced themselves from Russia.A spokesman said: “We condemn any attempt by Russia..to interfere in our country’s democratic processes.Labour stands ready to work cross-party to protect our nation’s security.A senior Russian politician said today that allegations that Russia tried to meddle in the  General Election are anti-Russian nonsense which undermine UK-Russia relations and the UKs own authority.The Russian Foreign Ministry added: “The statement is so foggy and contradictory that it is almost impossible to understand it.If it’s inappropriate to say something then dont say it. If you say it, produce the facts”.The online forum Reddit confirmed the leak was linked to the Kremlin in December last year.It came as Vladimir Putins Russia was today blamed for being behind repeated cyber attacks to try and steal a coronavirus vaccine from Britain.The UK has been able to point the finger at Russia for the very first time in explosive claims President Putin knew about attacks on Britains coronavirus vaccine project.A joint operation with the US and Canada has uncovered a malicious campaign to steal information uncovered by Britains top scientists on coronavirus with targeted attacks since March.No said today they believe the attacks came from a group known at APT - part of the Russian intelligence service.The clandestine group of hackers is also known as “the Dukes” or “Cozy Bear”.The PMs official spokesman said today: The attacks which are taking place against scientists and others doing vital work to combat coronavirus are despicable.Working with our allies, we will call out those who seek to do us harm in cyber space and hold them to account.Heres what we know about the attacks:The National Cyber Security Centre have thrown every protection they have at Britains vaccination projects to keep them safe from attempts to steal information.British research projects are at the forefront of the effort to find a vaccine with scientists at Oxford University and Imperial University London leading the charge to prevent thousands more from dying.Britain is expected to publish a long-delayed report into Russian influence in British politics next week.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was a foot away from her and there was nothing.“I didn’t see a single bruise, redness, mark or red-tinted cellphone imprint. Nothing, not a thing.”He added: “She filed for a fraudulent domestic violence order to extort and blackmail Johnny in the orce.”The court was previously told how Depp was angry and spoiling for a fight when he showed up at the apartment.Sasha Wass QC put to Depp: You immediately launched into accusations that Ms Heard had defecated in the bed. You were ranting and raving.“You grabbed her phone, wound your arm around like a bowler and threw the phone hard at Ms Heard’s face. It made contact with the right side of her face.”Ms Heard was on the phone to a friend at the time, TV host pal iO Tillett Wright. The call was still active and Ms Heard asked her to call , the court heard.Ms Wright texted their mutual friend Rocky Pennington saying: “JD attacking Amber. She told me to call . I’m doing it.”Ms Pennington, who lived in a neighbouring flat, arrived a few minutes later and put herself between Depp and Ms Heard, it was claimed.Ms Wass told Depp: “You pushed Ms Pennington out of the way, then Ms Heard collapsed on the sofa. You asked how she would like ityou pulled her hair back.“You then grabbed a magnum of wine and started swinging it around and smashing things with it.”Depp said the incident did not happen, and the texts between Ms Heard, Ms Wright and Ms Pennington were “a carefully choreographed hoax”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Police chief Sir Steve House, Deputy Commissioner, described the footage as extremely disturbing and said some of the techniques used cause me great concern – they are not taught in police training.. Scotland Yard has asked the police watchdog to investigate after the footage showed a police officer kneeling on the neck of the man. One officer has been suspended and another removed from operational duty. Police were called to a fight in Isledon Road, Islington, north London, at around .pm on Thursday.  They arrested a man at the scene, who a Met spokesperson said matched the description of one of those involved, on suspicion of affray and possession of an offensive weapon. The Met said a video showing part of the incident looks very concerning and have referred it to the Independent Office for Police Conduct . Footage posted on social media on Thursday evening shows two officers holding a handcuffed man, who is black, on the pavement in Isledon Road. At the start of the two minute and  second clip, one of the officers appears to be using his knee to control the suspect and has his hand on his head.  The struggling man on the ground can be heard shouting Get off me ... get off my neck, I ainapost done anything wrong, get off my neck. One of the police officers is heard to ask him Are you going to behave yourself  before telling him to Stay down. He then stands up and asks onlookers who are filming the incident to move back, while another clip shows more police officers arriving at the scene. The Met said its directorate of professional standards carried out an assessment and the force has referred the incident to the IOPC.  Scotland Yard said the man detained and arrested at the scene remains in police custody as inquiries continue. An earlier statement from the force said: We are aware of a video showing part of this wider incident where two officers have detained the man on the ground and appreciate this looks very concerning. This footage has been viewed, along with body-worn footage from the officers who attended. Both officers involved have also provided statements. The officersapos initial interaction with the man and the events that led to him being detained have also been analysed. Our officers carry out their duty on a daily basis across London in often dficult circumstances. Where force is used, officers must be able to justy this as lawful, proportionate and necessary.

Most changes will come into force in England in weeks amid fears over the economic hit to citiesworkers stay at home. The PM said the Government is “planning for the worst” in case of a possible second wave but insisted the UK “should also hope for the best”. He said the timetable hinged on social distancing – and warned he would halt new freedomsthere was a risk of a second spike. As lockdown measures are eased, hereaposs how our lives could change in accordance with the road map to a new type of normal. Nightclubs and dance venues Nightclubs and dance halls are among the venues that remain closed due to concerns about maintaining social distancing measures to keep their customers safe. Indoor play centres, including soft play areas, must also stay shut for now due to infection risks. Weddings  Receptions for weddings and civil partnerships can go ahead from the beginning of August – as long as there are only  guests. Tens of thousands of weddings were postponed under lockdown. Ceremonies with up to  guests have been allowed since July  but only six people could enjoy an outdoor reception. If the party was indoors, only two households were permitted to attend. Now couples can invite family and friends to watch them tie the knot and celebrate afterwards. Sport  Spectators have been banned from live events under lockdown, leading to matches being played in empty stadiums when the Premier League ed last month. Trials will begin in August for fans to make a socially-distanced“with a view to a wider reopening in the autumn”, the PM said. Snooker, racing and cricket will be tested first, with the World Snooker Championship, Glorious Goodwood and two county cricket friendlies to act as pilots. Restricted numbers of fans couldfrom October . Work  The government has ripped up advice for employees to work from home wherever possible, which has been in place since the beginning of lockdown. Instead, bosses will decide whether staff shouldto the office from August  - as long as their workplace is Covid- secure. The PM said: “It is not for government to decide how employers should run their companies and whether they want their workforces in the office or not - that is for companies.” But his advice clashed with Chief Scientic Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, who said there was “no reason to change” the guidance on Thursday. Transport  As of Friday July , people can use public transport again for non-essential trips. But commuters must wear a cloth face covering while travelling. People are still urged to avoid peak times and to continue to obey social distancing measures by keeping two metres apart from other commuters. Buses and trains have been eerily quiet during lockdown as the public was told to avoid travelling unless absolutely necessary. Key workers such as NHS staff and people in the emergency services were allowed to travel but the rules have been relaxed to try to get more people back to work Beauty treatments  Beauticians will finally be able to offer a range of services from the beginning of August. Salons were allowed to open from July  to allow people to get a much-needed hair cut – but a lot of popular treatments were still banned. The PM said that “close contact services such as beauticians” will be allowed to resume treatments that involve close face-to-face contact, which were previously banned. Popular treatments such as threading, facial waxing and brow tinting will now be available. Social distancing  The Prime Minister suggested the UK could move away from strict social distancing measures “by November at the earliest”.The current rules in England say people should stay two metres apart wherever possible to prevent the spread of coronavirus among the population.If staying two metres apart is impossible, the government advice says “one metre plus” is acceptable,people take extra precautions, such as wearing face coverings or sitting side by side rather than face to face. In Wales, the two-metre rule remains in place. In Scotland, stricter physical distancing has been eased in some venues, such as pubs and restaurants.

In paperwork submitted to the High Court, she responds to an imputation that she didnapost help her father out with cash despite him assisting to pay for her education.The legal documents claim that Meghan began giving her dad money in January , however this stopped in May  - when she married Prince Harry.They also say that Meghan has always cared deeply about her fatheraposs health, and that the money he got from selling stories and photo ops about his royal daughter would appear to exceed and offset the excess medical cost of roughly ,. The documents say claims that Thomas paid for all of Meghanaposs education are , adding that even though Thomas helped her financially while she was studying she also got a grant and took part time jobs to make ends meet. The papers state: In any event, it is admitted and has never been denied that the Claimant’s father supported her throughout her childhood and as a young adult.  Mr Markle did not pay for all of the Claimant’s college tuition. The Claimant’s mother also contributed towards her university costs. In addition, the Claimant received scholarships for academic achievement, which reduced the payable tuition fees. The Claimant also undertook a work-study programme whereby income she made from working on campus after class was applied directly to supplement and lower her tuition costs, thus personally contributing to her tuition as well.  The papers also go into further details about Meghanaposs paid-work, explaining: The Claimant always maintained full-time jobs while auditioning, both as a professional calligrapher as well as working in a restaurant. The Claimant’s father gave occasional financial support to the Claimant, just as she provided reciprocal financial support to him once she began earning. Referencing how Thomas got the money to assist Meghan, they state: The facts are that Mr Markle opted to take out a loan from Northwestern University for tuition costs for his daughter. From the moment the Claimant began to earn sufficient income, she began making voluntary financial contributions to her father. These contributions were not towards loan paymentsbut purely to give her father personal financial support.

While leaving, the Prince got into a car in a secluded street behind the hospital and sat in the front passenger seat. He did not respond to photographers as he was driven away from the private hospital but he did wave at a nurse as he was escorted to the car.  But today the -year-old and the Queen, , were among a small group of close family and friends who attended the intimate ceremony at All Saints Chapel, Windsor Great Park, this morning. The couple were driven from Windsor Castle, where they have spent lockdown, to the wedding three miles away. Before his appearance today, Buckingham Palace released a commemorative photo to mark Prince Philipaposs th birthday on June . The photo showed the Prince and the Queen at Windsor Castle in Berkshire, where the couple had been shielding since March , days before the UK went into lockdown.  The Queen’s favourite residence, dubbed Operation HMS Bubble, had a reduced household of around  staff. The snap was taken a week before the Princeaposs birthday and showed the Duke in a military Household Division tie and double-breasted jacket, stood beside the head of state wearing an Angela Kelly dress with the Cullinan V diamond brooch first worn by Queen Mary.Philip has spent much of his retirement at his cottage, Wood Farm, on the Sandringham estate, more than  miles away from the Queen, , who was usually at Buckingham Palace or Windsor. Beatrice and Edo announced their engagement last year and planned to marry in May.  One of Beatriceaposs friends told The Sun : They were obviously very keen for the Queen to come so the wedding had to happen before she goes up to Balmoral so this was a great opportunity.So many guests were disappointed not to make the big day but understood the reason for it. They are just like a normal family and had to make sacrices like many others have up and down the country and looking forward to having a wonderful celebration when the time is right. Beatrice and Edoardo began dating in autumn  reportedly getting back in touch at Princess Eugenieaposs wedding to Jack Brooksbank.

The -year-old became a national hero during the Covid- pandemic when he raised a record sum of £million by walking  laps of his garden with the aid of a walking frame.His fundraiser touched the hearts of Brits everywhere and inspired people across the globe, resulting in Prime Minister Boris Johnson nominating Sir Tom for the award. During the unique ceremony today, which took place outside to lower coronavirus risk, the Queen and Sir Tom exchanged a few words.The Monarch said: “Thank you so much. An amazing amount of money you raised” “A hundred is a great age. “Anyway it’s a nice day. Best of luck to you.” She also called his family forward and chatted to them before ing to the castle. The Queen used a sword that belonged to her father, George VI, for the ceremony and presented him with the insignia of Knight Bachelor.  Other investitures have been postponed because of the coronavirus, along with all of the Queenaposs face-to-face engagements. The Queenaposs first engagement came on the same day she watched her granddaughter Princess Beatrice marry her fiance Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. The Queen, , and Prince Philip, , were among a small group of close family and friends who attended the intimate ceremony at All Saints Chapel, Windsor Great Park, this morning. The Queen left promptly after the ceremony as she wanted to get back to get ready to present Captain Moore with his knighthood. Speaking about his knighthood, Sir Tom tweeted: I could never have imagined this would happen to me. It is such a huge honour and I am very much looking forward to meeting Her Majesty The Queen. It is going to be the most special of days for me.  The ceremony took place entirely within the confines of Windsor Castle, with no viewing positions for the public. Members of the public were asked not to attend Windsor town centre or gather in the hope of seeing any of the ceremony, which will not be visible from any external viewpoint. Captain Tom had set out to raise £,, but his incredible gesture won him fans around the world and saw his fundraising efforts soar. In honour of his incredible achievement, he was given a flypast on his th birthday.

In an astonishing statement Tasnime Akunjee called for herdespite saying “nobody can be sure...she is still a danger to the UK”. His admission came after British judges green-lighted Shamima’s appeal to re-enter the UK to try to win back her British citizenship. On ITV’s Good Morning Britain Mr Akunjee was askedshe could be a terror threat or groom others following her extremist past.  He said: “No one can be sure including her family that won’t happen – but that is pure speculation.” Akunjee claimed that Begum, , cannot properly try to overthrow the stripping of her citizenship because of a “lack of technology” in her Syrian camp. If she does make it back to the UK, Ms Begum faces being arrested and charged with terror-related offences, but is unlikely to be removed again in the future. Colonel Richard Kemp, a former terrorism adviser to the UK Government, said: “This is a very skewed judgement, that the human rights of terrorists are viewed as being more important than those of their victims.” Yesterday the Mirror told how the decision could open the floodgates for dozens of pariah ISIS fighters to come back to live in the UK. It could also cost millions of pounds in constant monitoring by the Security Service.

Chloe Lythgoe received an alert on her phone that a delivery was arriving, when she said she saw the driver walking up the path and smiling to himself. As she signed for the package, she realised the name of the X-rated sex toy inside was printed on the label - right next to the barcode the postal worker had to scan first. I opened the door and he handed it over, smirking ashe knew what was in the box, she sad. It was awful, I looked at him asto say aposplease, I hope youaposve not seen itapos and he looked back to say aposI know whataposs in thereapos. The -year-old ordered the £ adult toy from Amazon, with the product delivery details promising to make discretion aposa primary considerationapos. But Chloe, from Warrington, says she now feels aposmortiedapos every time she has to answer the door to face her postie. I went bright red, just closed the door and thought apostypical meapos, she said. I just wanted the ground to open up and eat me, it was less than discreet.

The woman - who wanted to remain anonymous - first met her boyfriend when she was  through mutual friends and they hit it off straight away. He showered her with love and affection and was nothing like her past boyfriends. But nine months in, he told her that he had slept with his ex six months prior, and of course she was devastated. She forgave him because she wanted the relationship to work but she never understood why he told her. Fast forward eight years and everything changed. One night, she and her boyfriend were woken up in the middle of the night by a loud knock at the door of the home they shared together. After they refused to open the door the person stopped knocking and left. But then her boyfriend got out of bed, told her he knew who it was and that he was going to sort it out - but gave her no further details. He ed the next morning and told her that the person at the door had been his ex and that she wanted him to buy her out of the property they shared together. Of course, she knew nothing about any of this. Instantly she knew he was lying, because none of what he had said added up - why would his ex turn up out of the blue after eight years of being with someone   When she pushed him on the subject he told her he was tired and just wanted to go to sleep. It was only later that evening that he came clean.  She told news.au. : I think it was only because I guessed and I guessed right – that he’d been seeing her the whole time.The person on the other side of the door that night was a woman who happened to be his girlfriend, not his ex.  And they had been dating not just for the entirety of their eight year relationship but also for the seven years prior. After she found out that her entire eight year relationship was a lie, the woman left him and never went back.

The celestial rock, which has been named Asteroid ND, is one and a half times larger than the London Eye. NASA scientists warn the asteroid is flying towards Earthaposs orbit and will come within just . astronomical unitsof our planet. The asteroid measures in at m tall and is set to make its close approach to Earth next Friday, July . The space agency said: Potentially Hazardous Asteroidsare currently defined based on parameters that measure the asteroidaposs potential to make threatening close approaches to the Earth. Specically, all asteroids with a minimum orbit intersection distanceof . au or less are considered PHAs. The asteroid could have been nudged into an orbit that will bring it into Earthaposs region of space by the gravity of other planets. NASA said on its Jet Propulsion Laboratorywebsite: NEOs are comets and asteroids that have been nudged by the gravitational attraction of nearby planets into orbits that allow them to enter the Earthaposs neighbourhood. The scientic interest in comets and asteroids is due largely to their status as the relatively unchanged remnant debris from the solar system formation process some . billion years ago. Its statement added: The giant outer planetsformed from an agglomeration of billions of comets and the left over bits and pieces from this formation process are the comets we see today. Likewise, todayaposs asteroids are the bits and pieces left over from the initial agglomeration of the inner planets that include Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.  To come within . AU of our planet is close in space terms, but is roughly ,, miles from Earth in our terms. It comes as a new space race between NASA, China and the UAE started with all competing to send probes to Mars to prove le exists.

The woman was named as his “partner in crime” during raids in  - the same year British toddler Madeleine vanished. She allegedly called him after pinpointing the best properties to rob before he raided the homes, according to Portuguese media. It comes as police continued to probe who spoke with paedophile Brueckner, , during a -minute phone call before Madeleine was taken on May . The woman has been interviewed by police about Brueckner in her own country but was not believed to be a suspect. Details of their friendship were revealed by Portuguese broadcaster Sandra Felgueiras – who also claimed they staged a , Euro theft together.  She said: “The victims contacted me and I have now confirmed it with the court files. I have evidence that Christian committed burglaries with her. “It was always the same modus operandi. She called him saying the house was free. Then it got robbed.” She added: “And I know she was investigated by police over it. It is an unbelievable story.” Brueckner – currently in Germanyaposs Kiel jail on drug offences – was named as the prime suspect in Madeleineaposs disappearance last month. German prosecutors say they found evidence that he received a -minute phone call before the British toddleraposs disappearance. The call - which placed Brueckner in the Praia da Luz area - was made just before Madeleine went missing on May , .  It was received on a mobile phone belonging to the suspect at .pm and finished at .pm. It has been claimed Brueckner was carrying out a burglary when he found Madeleine asleep in her bed and snatched her. Now fresh reports from Portugal claim the German woman helped him carry out a string of robberies across the Algarve in . Itaposs claimed a family was targeted in Praia de Gale – a -minute drive from the holiday apartment where Madeleine was snatched – of , Euros. Brueckneraposs pal worked as a babysitter for the family between June  and October  looking after their grandchildren. In November of the same year they say they were robbed of , euros kept in a suitcase at their house.  They say she was in the car looking after their granddaughter when they had tried to deposit the cash at the BES bank. The Portuguese victims told RTP that they had been unable to deposit it at the bank and brought it back into the car and took it home. “She somehow realised that it was not possible to make the deposit,” said one of the victims. The family say they reported her to the police and she was brought in for questioning. They insisted she was the only person who knew they had the money in the house. They told the RTP show they then revealed how they had heard her speak in German to a man, who they now believe was Brueckner.  Neighbours say they saw a man – later named as Brueckner – lurking around outside the home on the day of the burglary. It comes after it was revealed by Brueckner’s best friend Michael Tatschl that he was a prolic burglar while he lived with him in Praia da Luz in  and . The Austrian revealed that he kept hundreds of passports, expensive watches and jewelry in a secret hiding place in the so-called ‘Yellow house’ they shared just outside the resort. He said he particularly targeted British and German tourists, as they were easy pickings.

We just have one or two that won’t be available for a week or two.“Benji’s been sent for a scan and we believe he’s going to be a few weeks.“We can only guess right now but it’ll be a minimum of a couple of weeks.“As it unfolds we’ll get a better picture.”The -year-old was a key figure as United romped to the Championship title last season, keeping  clean sheets.He will be a huge miss but Mellon is convinced, between Deniz and new kid keeper Jack Newman, the Tangerines can cope without Siegrist for now.Mellon continued: “In an ideal world we’d have them all fit but you have to deal with injuries all the time.“At the minute we just get on with it. If it became a problem for me I’m sure we’d be able to sit down and try to organise something.“I don’t think we’re in that place yet.”As for the rest of the squad, Mellon has been happy with what he has seen from them so far, both in training and against the Steelmen.He added: “We’ve been getting some good work done, getting to know the players better and they’re getting to know me.“Of course you can watch them on video but building that relationship between you is important and we’re getting there now.“The group is really responsive and we’re in a good place.“I think the important thing was everybody got match time and we came out of it with no new injuries.“For me to be able to see them on a football pitch rather than in training was good for building that picture in my head of what we’ve got in terms of how we’re going to play.“That was important and I learned more coming away from the game than I knew before.”What has particularly impressed the -year-old is the attitude of the players and the standards they set for themselves.That is giving Mellon cause for optimism with the new top-flight campaign just over two weeks away.He commented: “From the outside looking in I expected it to be like that because they’d had success and you’d imagine the team spirit would be very strong.“That’s not surprised me. They work really hard every day in training and I don’t have to ask them or stop training to up the tempo, they hit it on their own all the time.“That’s a great credit to them and their professionalism. That’s certainly very pleasing to have.“I’m happy at the minute but we’ve still got a lot of work to do moving forward in achieving our aim of winning games of football.“We’re in a work in progress but we’re moving forward.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

As there are fewer cases, the hubs are no longer needed.Hubs in Perth, Montrose, Arbroath and Forfar have been stepped down.Patients can still be seen at the regional assessment hub at Kings Cross in Dundee as well as assessed by their GP.NHS Tayside has been working with local GP practices to allow them to see patients with Covid- like symptoms.Practices have been encouraged to set up dedicated isolation areas to assess patients who may have the virus, and these have been set up in many GPs across Tayside.Medical Director Professor Peter Stonebridge said: #This move is in line with the Scottish Government’s route map to recovery. Our assessment hubs have been seeing very few patients each day, which is why we have taken the decision to move to the next phase of our coronavirus response.#By enabling GP practices to see patients with Covid-like symptoms, this allows GPs to maintain continuity of care for their patients, which is known to improve overall outcomes.#We would like to reassure the people of Tayside that plans are in place to step our community assessment centres back up should coronavirus infection rates increase.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

It shows contempt for those in the NHS who have risked their lives to save others. It shows contempt for those who have died without their loved ones by their side. It shows contempt for all of us who have stuck by the rules to protect our lives and the lives of others.Boris Johnson has asked us to #move on# but this issue will not go away. This is a wound that will continue to fester.Dominic Cummings continues to be a major player in government decisions and rules, those rules he so shamelessly flaunted without even an apology.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future.

Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary.

Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

Fe Zoo suffered a devastating fire just days after reopening after the Covid- lockdown, but no animals were harmed and owners have said they hope toto normality as soon as possible thanks to support and fundraising from the local community.Stately homes and gardens have also reopened, with several National Trust for Scotland properties now open to visitors.These include Culzean Castle and Country Park in Ayrshire, Threave Garden in Dumfries and Galloway, Brodie Castle’s garden and grounds, Arduaine Garden in Argyll and Crathes Castle’s garden and estate in Aberdeenshire. Historic Environment Scotland has said that it will monitor the situation and reopen properties in due course.Unstaffed outdoor sites are already open, so visitors can enjoy walks around Edinburgh’s Holyrood Park and West Lothian’s Linlithgow Peel among others.Edinburgh’s historic Royal Mile.Walkers and climbers are now welcome to visit the country’s national parks to enjoy some outdoor exercise. Guidelines remain to avoid touching surfaces or opening gates where possible, to follow signs and avoid coming into contact with farm workers where applicable, and to keep dogs on leads and avoid areas known to be busy. Pubs and restaurants without door space have also been allowed to reopen. Glasgow’s The Cranside Kitchen, near the Rotunda, has claimed to be the country’s largest beer garden, with a free-to-enter area seating more than  guests with social distancing measures in place.The beer garden offers a range of drinks alongside food from five popular Glasgow restaurants, Rioja, Halloumi, Pickled Ginger, Kilmurry  Co and La Rotunda. In Edinburgh the Corn Exchange has billed itself as the largest beer garden in the city, having transformed the car park into a space where people can enjoy drinks as well as play darts, ping-pong, swing ball and watch sport, all while observing the necessary hygiene routines. With hundreds of smaller beer gardens open around the country – including Dundee’s The Kilted Kangaroo and Aberdeen’s Siberia Bar and Hotel – there is no shortage of options for enjoying this summer safely and enjoying good times in Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"pioneering oyster plan seeks schools support","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsA call is being made for schools to take part in a native oyster restoration project in Loch Craignish.Over the next five years the charity Seawilding is planning to restore the native oyster beds at the loch with an exciting plan to reintroduce one million native oysters.The protected species was once prevalent in most of Scottish sea lochs but predation, disease and bottom trawling have destroyed most populations.It is now recognised native oyster beds are an important part of the local marine eco-system. Each oyster can filtrate and clean up to  litres of water a day, and the native oyster reefs enhance bioersity by becoming fish spawning grounds and nurseries.Back in March Seawilding secured a National Lottery Heritage Fund grant to grow young native oysters over a five-year period in floating baskets on the loch. When they are semi-mature, the oysters will be moved to trial seabed sites around Loch Craignish, where it is hoped they will become a self-sustaining population.Project co-ordinator Danny Renton told the Advertiser: #This is a pioneering project, driven by the Craignish community. Loch Craignish was once a rich environment for native oysters and scallops in particular, but bottom trawling since the s has destroyed much of the seabed. Our community wants to reverse that. We hear a lot about rewilding, but there’s little action been taken so far with restoration of marine habitats – so what we are doing at Loch Craignish is an exciting opportunity to show that marine rewilding and reintroduction of priority marine species is possible.#The project is teaming up with Scottish Association of Marine Scienceand the Department of Aquaculture from Stirling University to enable  marine science students to monitor, survey and research the restoration efforts over the next five years.To kick off the project, the charity along with local partner Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and the Ardfern Yacht Centre, has been introducing native oysters in suspended cages under the pontoons of the yacht centre.Each Oyster Hoister houses  mature oysters which will help clean up the marina water as well as releasing spat, adding to the wider restoration effort in the loch. The hoisters are sponsored by members of the community and boat owners, and the plan is to suspend around  cages by the end of the year.When schools open in August, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation will be working with pupils to monitor the oysters in the cages, measuring their growth and recording bioersity.Oly Hemmings and Pete Creech, the organisation’s rangers, initially want pupils from five local primary schools to get involved in this exciting project. This is an opportunity for pupils to actively take part in valuable research that will be added to data already being collected from other oyster reintroductions throughout the UK.Oly said: #We’ve been interacting with oysters in Argyll for around , years and it is fantastic to be able to get future generations involved in ensuring this relationship continues.#Any schools interested can email Oly and Pete at info@heartofargyllwildle.org for further information. A teacher’s resource pack that can be used in conjunction with school visits or as a standalone resource is available. The educational objectives are fully funded by the project’s funders, the National Lottery, and this includes travel to and from the project venue at Ardfern Yacht Centre. Oly and Pete also intend to engage with older schoolchildren and community groups as the project progresses.For further information about the Loch Craignish Native Oyster Restoration Project, please visit www.seawilding.org or email info@seawilding.org"},{"url":null,"title":"support local call as argyll eases out of lockdown","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsPubs and restaurants have opened, tourist attractions can now be visited # and those wild and woolly lockdown locks can finally be tamed by a visit to the hairdresser.As the easing out of coronavirus lockdown continues in Scotland, this week has seen the most signicant relaxation of restrictions imposed as the coronavirus pandemic arrived in March.Among other steps, places of worship and childcare providers can now all reopen.There is also a partial relaxation of  restrictions on attendance at funerals and marriage ceremonies, while closer working may now be permitted in the building trade.All of the above, of course, comes with strict safety requirements which must be adhered to # but they are steps in the right direction.And with many Argyll business ready to re-open, residents are being encouraged to support Argyll and Bute by buying local.#Post COVID-, we should support our local businesses as they have supported us during the pandemic,# said Councillor Alastair Redman, Argyll and Bute Council#s policy lead for economic growth.#With lockdown in place,# continued Councillor Redman, #our food and drink producers had to change the way they did business – often in imaginative ways.

visiting the seaside, because they spend longer there than on trips to the countryside and urban green spaces.And those who live by the sea have better mental health than those who are further inland and do more physical activity in what is known as the ldquoblue gym effect, the analysis said.The review is led by Defra and UK Research and Innovation, in collaboration with Plymouth Marine Laboratory and Exeter University.Domestic marine minister Rebecca Pow, said: ldquoWhether it is to enjoy a sport, take a walk, watch the wildle or to simply admire the landscape, for many of us spending time by the sea is not only hugely enjoyable, but it has a welcome impact on our wellbeing too.ldquoThis realisation makes it all the more important that we take care of our environment, and our ever-expanding national lsquoBlue Beltrsquo, protecting more than % of English waters, is helping to safeguard these precious habitats for future generations.Professor Nicola Beaumont, head of science for Sea and Society at Plymouth Marine Laboratory, said: ldquoOur research demonstrates that marine and coastal areas play an important role in supporting peoplersquos wellbeing.ldquoHowever, we have also shown that these benefits are threatened by marine pollution, coastal development, climate change and exposure to extreme weather.ldquoWith millions of us visiting the coast every year, it is our collective responsibility to ensure that we have the right measures in place to allow our marine environment to thrive, she said..push,i[r].l*new

Social distancing is in ndash and seat reservations are outThe interior of the cinema has been redesigned with the typical arrows, stickers and temporary fences wersquove all gotten accustomed to.There are many minor changes ndash for example, staff will no longer take your tickets for inspection ndash but the most noticeable one is that staff will now chaperone you to your screen from the foyer and assign your seats in order to maintain a safe distance between groups.For the Odeon, this meant two seats apart within a checkerboard formation. Consequently, you can no longer reserve specic seats in advance, so itrsquos down to luck whether you end up with good seats or not. Itrsquos arguably better than everI was pleasantly surprised to realise that no longer did I run the risk of being seated next to any matter of unpleasant cinema-goers: chatty teens, habitually coughing oldies, or worst of all, those who insist on answering phone calls whilst in the theatre ndash all three of which Irsquom sorry to say Irsquove experienced before.And with barely any adverts running, and classic films such as Star Wars on show for cheap, the experience at the moment is arguably far better than it has ever been.Its cheaper, too.

Irsquove looked out my monthly cinema pass in anticipation of re-opening around July .I appreciate not everyone feels this way, but Irsquom ready to start living again. Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus.

Matt Hunt, the CEO of Free The Bears, who is in the programme, I met him when I lived in Australia in  and we started a friendship and have grown stronger ever since. And probably up until  when I took the position, every year for the last six to eight years he must have sent me a job description or a position opening, trying to encourage me to work with or do something for Free The Bears.I was just never in the position in le where it was manageable or achievable until last year - and then I was incredibly lucky, incredibly fortunate in my sort of personal position, that I could effectively take  months out and not get paid very much at all, and go and work for Free The Bears and Matt.HOW WOULD YOU SUM UP THE EXPERIENCE It was one of the most incredible, uplting, and yet challenging periods in my le. I dont even like to call it a career because all Ive ever done since I was  is work for with animals and try and do something to have a contribution to conservation. But in all of that time, living there across  months definitely had its ups and downs to say the least.TO SEE PEOPLE FREELY ILLEGALLY TRADING THE PRODUCTS IN THE LOCAL MARKETS WOULD BE FRUSTRATING That market we went to was not a very prolic one when it comes to wildle. It was frustrating and again, not the first time and not the last time Ive seen wildle in markets... I think the frustrating thing is that the wildle trade is a very, very complex trade, and thats really now starting to become a focus in peoples minds because of the current situation that we face with coronavirus and the fact that its origins have probably come from the wildle trade.But regardless, that was definitely one of the points where I felt very low and very down afterwards because at that particular time I didnt have the authorities with me. And I dont have the authority and I dont have the place to be able to go into a wildle market and start taking wildle without the proper system to be able to back me up.So I had to walk away knowing full well that by the time Id informed the authorities and theyd been able to mobilise, the chances are the next day that those particular inidual animals would have not been there and not made it.YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT THE BEARS AS INDIVIDUALS...When we talk about conservation, and when we talk about the wildle trade, and when we talk about bears as a species, it is ultimately about them as a species... but for me its also about them as an inidual.Because Mary the sun bear, when we confiscated her from the trafficker, or David and Jane, or any of the bears, they dont know that their species is now starting to become endangered in the wild andthis continues in another five years time it could be past the tipping point.What they know of is what they feel as iniduals, which is they feel fear and they feel stress and theyre hungry because quite often most of the bears that we come across are never fed properly. It comes down to balance. I want to help that animal as an inidual, but I also want to be able to help the bigger picture when it comes to species conservation.GIVEN THE CURRENT SITUATION, WHAT DO YOU THINK WE CAN LEARN FROM THIS SERIES I really feel, whether its organisations like Free The Bears or programmes like Bears About The House, for me its about having that respect and compassion and kindness towards the natural world and the animals that are part of that.The most important thing that hopefully will be the bigger context of the situation,we take one thing from it, it should be that we are completely interconnected to other species and the environment around us. If we dont treat that with respect, it will be to our detriment.Bears About The House starts on July  at pm on BBC Two."},{"url":null,"title":"author-patrick-baker-five-scotlands-evocative-wild-places","story":"THERE are certain places that exist at the edge of our collective memory. Ruins and relics which are scattered across Scotlandrsquos landscape, forgotten, overlooked and often hidden by dint of sheer geographical remoteness. I have come to think of them best described as wild histories. Wild, certainly, in that they are located in wilderness areas, but wild also in an almost anthropomorphic sense: feral, uncared for, mostly unknown or nameless, and outside the boundaries of public consciousness.When thought of in this way, the landscape of Scotland becomes a vast diorama: the setting for countless narrative scenes, lives and stories overlaid, some more vivid than others. These wild but often unseen histories define us more than any iconic building or national monument, for they are records of things inconsequential and commonplace. It is this compelling and contradictory mixture of secrecy and signicance that over the years some has led me to become fascinated with some particular wild places.THE GLEN LOIN CAVES, SUCCOTHAlthough I cannot say when or how I first became aware of the Glen Loin Caves, it feels like they have always been there, hard-wired into my imagination. Most people will never have heard of them, but I have come to think of them in near-mythical terms ndash a place of refuge for drovers, brigands, outlaws and even royalty.Among other claims, they were most famously the supposed resting point for Robert the Bruce and his routed army in  after his defeat at the Battle of Methven. More recently, the maze of fallen rocks on this Argyll mountainside was the focal point of a unique, sporting counterculture.It was here for almost two decades from the s that groups of working-class young people, mainly from the poverty-stricken tenements of Glasgow and shipyards of Clydebank, congregated to climb the huge rock walls of the Arrochar Alps.They created an almost permanent weekend residence in the caves. Small groups arrived at first, each with its own particular rules and hierarchies, then more established affiliations evolved. Clubs formed here whose names still resonate with modern mountaineers: the Ptarmigan Club and the infamous Creagh Dhu. The influence of these pioneering climbers was immense, providing a surge in climbing standards and techniques that was unequalled anywhere  at the time. They also redefined the sport, dismantling existing class barriers and creating a makesht society in the Glen Loin Caves whose values and ethics became imprinted on generations of climbers that were to follow.Yet the caves and their whereabouts have managed to remain largely unknown for decades. Hidden partly by the obscurity of the landscape, but also by an unwritten code of fraternal discretion.lsquoThe lad with the clinker-nailed boots and the rope in his rucksack who told me how to find the cave made me promise to keep the secret,rsquo wrote Alastair Borthwick in , in one of the earliest and most detailed descriptions of the caves.lsquoI was to follow a track to a foresterrsquos cottage, pass through a gate . . . and there search for an old sheep fank. Behind it I should find a faint track leading up the hillside andI followed the scratches on the rock it led to, I should find the cave and good company.rsquoEven at close proximity, however, the caves are frustratingly hard to locate. In  it took the writer Rennie McOwan, an accomplished outdoorsman, several attempts to pinpoint the exact position of Borthwickrsquos earlier description. lsquoYou can trace these historic cavesyou know where to lookrsquo, McOwan advised matter-of-factly, lsquobut it can be both time-consuming, and exasperatingyou do not.rsquoTHE NAVVIESrsquo GRAVEYARD, NEAR KINLOCHLEVENAt the start of the th century, in a remote glen in the West Highlands, thousands of navvies were at work on a huge hydroelectric scheme: a massive civil-engineering project near Kinlochleven, which included the construction of the reservoir, a six-kilometre aqueduct and an aluminium-smelting plant.For some of the men that worked there all the inherent danger of their job would suddenly coalesce in a single instant. With a sudden evaporation of luck ndash the misplaced sledgehammer blow, a momentrsquos loss of balance or the abrupt death-strike of unseen rock-fall ndash lives were ended in the wind-torn reaches of the moor.They were laid to rest near where they fell, in a small, improvised burial ground situated below the steep walls of the reservoir. This was the place that the author Patrick MacGill described in his radicalsemi-autobiographical novel Children of the Dead End ndash the navviesrsquo graveyard. It is still bleakly visible in the middle of the vast moor: three rows of headstones sectioned off by a low picket fence, the wood weathered to bone-grey.Even at a distance, its appearance is surreal. It has a strangely filmic quality: dramatic and out of place, like a set design ready to be used in a High Plains western. The gravestones, which were made with concrete from the dam, sit low in the ground, blotched with lichen and listing at angles in the soil.A few have been etched with simple decorative borders, and some carry names ndash all either Irish or Scottish. One in particular stands out, the grave of a woman, buried alongside the men. It challenges perceptions of the place as an exclusively male working environment. The thought of both men and women working here suggests perhaps something more civilised, than the lawless encampment described in MacGillrsquos book ndash a settlement or even a community.Despite the lack of embellishments, the inscriptions on the headstones are exact: neat letterings carved with considerable care. The same effort has been applied to all of them, including one ndash an anonymous grave ndash which, in the absence of a name, simply has the words lsquonot knownrsquo traced delicately across its centre. The gesture is touching. The stonemasonsrsquo precise work, their attention to detail and unbiased craftsmanship, even for an unidentied colleague, still feels like an act of considerable compassion.BELNAHUA, THE SLATE ISLESThe Slate Isles take their collective name from their geological renown. Fine-grained slate rock is found in abundance here in several rich deposits and has been mined since prehistoric times. By the th century the area was held in such importance it was mentioned by Donald Monro, High Dean of the Isles, in his landmark account of the Western Isles.In the centuries that followed, small-scale mining evolved into massive commercial harvesting of the mineral resource. In , the Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant recorded that slates of lsquomerchantable sizesrsquo were being exported in quantities of lsquoabout two million and a half . . . annually to England, Norway, Canada and the West Indiesrsquo.By the middle of the th century this number had grown as much as seven times, and the Slate Isles found themselves at the centre of a global industry, providing jobs to hundreds of workers and supplying roofing materials for buildings all around the world.All that, however, would change. A series of natural and economic calamities, beginning with a storm surge of epic proportions, rendered the mines unworkable and the area destitute. Large swathes of the population left, never to , and the land assumed a look of devastation, houses abandoned and machinery left to rust.The most beguiling of all the islands is the uninhabited Belnahua, the furthest outlier in the small archipelago. A ghost village now exists there rows of empty workersrsquo cottages that still look out over the slate quarry which has long since flooded to form a deep, stilled lagoon.I journeyed there by sea-kayak across some of Scotlandrsquos fastest tidal races, making landfall in front of hollow-eyed buildings with window and door spaces showing light-filled interiors.The best view comes from climbing up a prism-shaped knoll in the middle of the island. From up high you can see the structures that once housed the small community. As well as the terraced workersrsquo cottages, there are a scattering of other buildings: pump houses and engine rooms, coal sheds and outhouses. On the eastern side are two more substantial-looking buildings ndash a two-storey house and a bothy.What is most remarkable though is the slate mine itself now a single flooded quarry of dark water that fills the centre of the island like an ink well. The gouged area is so large that in places only a narrow boundary of land has been left to buffer against the sea.EL ALAMEIN REFUGE, THE CAIRNGORMSNo other mountain area in the British Isles can claim to have had such a large proleration of bothies and high-level shelters as the Cairngorms. By the mid-s, a constellation of these refuges existed across the range, providing a basic form shelter for climbers and mountaineers to overnight on their expeditions in and around the plateau.The names of the old Cairngorm sheltershave always held an undeniable mystique for me. They seem redolent of a bygone, pioneering era of mountaineering. A time, it seemed, when enthusiasm and exuberance appeared to outweigh adversity and a lack of proper equipment.Most of the shelters have long since disappeared: Bob Scottrsquos Bothy destroyed by fire, Jeanrsquos Hut, and the Sinclair Hut run into dereliction or dismantled the Curran and the St Valery demolished. There is one, however, that has for the most part been largely forgotten about. Situated at over , feet somewhere on the steep western flank of Strath Nethy, the El Alamein hut is dficult to find, it walls constructed entirely from rocks barely visible amid a hillside of boulders.The positioning of the El Alamein refuge was a mistake. It was never intended to be built on the northern spur of Cairn Gorm Mountain, tucked literally out of sight and notionally out of mind in a rarely ventured-to part of the Cairngorms. The story goes that its placement was a navigational error. Built by members of st Highland Division and named after one their most famous battles, a mix-up in grid references lead to its construction not on the high plateau, like its sister hut the St Valery, but on an incidental ridgeline.In , the El Alamein and the other two high-level shelters of the Cairngorm plateau became implicated in the Feith Buidhe disaster ndash to this day, the worst, single tragedy in British mountaineering history. Following recommendations of the subsequent fatal accident enquiry, a decision was made to remove of all three of the shelters. Their presence on the plateau was deemed an unacceptable risk. Notoriously hard to locate, it was thought they created a  sense of security, inviting the inexperienced and unprepared to rely unrealistically on finding their protection ndash an often impossible task in winter.After several years of highly publicised and emotive debate, two of the shelters were pulled down. But for whatever reason, the El Alamein never followed suit. Its obscurity and lack of purpose perhaps became the reason for its survival: a barely known mountain refuge, located high on a quiet ridgeline, where it remains to this day.INCHKEITH ISLAND, FIRTH OF FORTHBlack and brooding in the Firth of Forth, Inchkeith Island is easily seen, but often overlooked. I have flown over it many times. On homeward-bound planes which bank low over the coast, you get a gullrsquos eye view of the island.It gives you the chance to survey its complex, post-apocalyptic townscape: deserted roads and decaying buildings, greenery threading through concrete, shrubs emerging from the rubble. Itrsquos a contradictory but compelling mix. A strange scene of urban dereliction in an elemental and unconnected place.That the architecture and edices of dferent times could still exist so forgotten and untouched, yet so geographically close to Scotlandrsquos capital, seems paradoxical, but also makes perfect sense. For centuries, Inchkeithrsquos wild form and isolated position ndash a craggy, kilometre-long, hill-topped rock in the wide, storm-blasted waters of the Forth ndash has both alternatingly defined its importance and rendered it a landscape that can easily be cast aside.Over the centuries it has served a multitude of purposes. Fortress, garrison, farm, lazaretto, prison, religious settlement and even the venue for a bizarre linguistic experiment. As backstories go, it can certainly claim an eventful and troubled past, and more than conforms to the writer Patrick Barkhamrsquos contention that lsquoa few square miles of island loom far larger than the equivalent pocket of land on the mainlandrsquo.The same is also true for the other islands scattered in the Forth, the lsquoemeralds chased in goldrsquo of Walter Scottrsquos epic poem Marmion. Each, I have found out, have their own rich narratives, outsized stories that are much bigger than their contained landmasses would suggest. They are tales of human and natural history ndash warfare and piracy, extinction and regeneration ndash that are intimately entwined with the lives of people far beyond their immediate watery domains.One of Inchkeithrsquos most interesting histories involves its role as a staging post for an attempted invasion of Leith. On  September, a flotilla of privateer warships had reached Inchkeith Island and lay anchored off its shores waiting to attack the port. The small fleet was led by the infamous naval commander John Paul Jones, a Scot by birth who had joined the Continental Navy of the American Colonies and was wreaking havoc around Britainrsquos coastline. Jones was about to mount his offensive when he was suddenly stopped by an unexpected and ferocious storm. Leith was spared by the skin of its teeth, marking a curious historic footnote ndashperhaps the only time Scotland has ever been close to invasion by a military force of what would become the United States.The Unremembered Places: Exploring Scotlandrsquos Wild Histories by Patrick Baker is out now Follow @WildHistorianAs Scotlandrsquos wild places become accessible again, enthusiasm to discover wild histories should always be accompanied by the principle of lsquoleaving no tracersquo: please tread lightly, leave no litter, do not disturb historical relics and respect Scotlandrsquos natural environment."},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Rosemary Goring  Hurrah  The pubs are reopening     here  39 s why I love even the worst of them","story":"This drastic remedy would probably not meet with Health and Safety approval, yet Mr McFadden might have hit on a winning tactic, as the pubs reopen. ldquoPeople are like sheep, he said, explaining the fencersquos effectiveness.

One broiling summerrsquos day my husband, having trekked what felt like the entire Southern Upland Way, finally reached its doors.

When he began babbling his gratitude, and describing the arduousness of his passage over the hills, she cut him short. ldquoNobody told you to do it, she said.The British tradition of outrageously hostile hospitality stretches back long before Basil Fawlty. It seems some of us donrsquot merely tolerate curmudgeons behind the taps but actively enjoy being insulted. The title of Norman Balonrsquos memoir of his years as a Soho publican ndash Yoursquore Barred, You Bastards ndash sums it up. Balon was celebrated as Londonrsquos grumpiest landlord, treasured for his unaccommodating persona. The Coach and Horses, over which he presided irascibly for -plus years, was the haunt of the writer Jeffrey Barnard. His Low Le column in The Spectator was a droll but tragic depiction of a man whose every waking thought led to the next tipple. When Keith Waterhouse turned the column into the play Jeffrey Barnard is Unwell, he immortalised Balon as well as Barnard. These days, I see that The Coach and Horses claims to be the first London pub to offer vegan meals. For a brief spell it even enjoyed a nudist licence. What Balon would have thought about this development would likely be unprintable.Over the years Irsquove spent more hours in pubs than I care to remember, but while the occasional off-taking quip is amusing, serious rudeness makes me head where. Willie Ross, of the Oxford Bar in Edinburgh, was in a class of his own when it came to abrasiveness. Photos show him presiding over his fiefdom, with a face like a hanging judge and a fag in his mouth. Described as instilling ldquosomething close to a sense of terror in customers, he apparently wouldnrsquot serve the English or women. Food was also verboten. Legend has it that when one hapless customer, a QC, askedhe could see the menu, Ross took him by the arm and led him out into the street. Pointing up at the pubrsquos signboard, he said, ldquoWhere does it say f***ing restaurant .No fan of the Edinburgh Festival and its luvvies, he once put up a sign saying, ldquoClosed due to Festival. When I first visited, however, the Oxford Bar was under new management, and far more inviting. By this time Ian Rankin had placed it on the tourist map as Inspector Rebusrsquos local. The countless sightseers who troop into this literary landmark would have got a taste of an altogether grimmer Scotland had Ross still been in charge.The real-ale pub where I used to live was the ideal establishment. The owner had a wicked sense of humour, and tolerated peculiarities on both sides of the bar. On St Patrickrsquos Day hersquod offer a two-for-three deal on all drinks. Other than crisps and peanuts, food was not available, no matter how hard we pleaded. He did, however, allow taxi drivers to bring in their slow cooker after a morning sht, and ladle out chilli con carne while they played cards. In the early evenings, one bloke would bring in a cheese board, and invite everyone to pile in. A mountaineering bicyclist often arrived smelling of woodsmoke and handed out tinfoil parcels of delicious trout, cured in his garden shed. Another old-timer used to produce leeks from his allotment, which he passed beneath the bar in paper bags, like smugglersrsquo contraband. When one night I was cornered by a man who could bore for an hour without drawing breath, the landlord paraded around the crowded room, waving a white flag to summon a rescue party.In an era where the customer comes first, the days of martinets like Ross or the lady of the loch are numbered. I canrsquot say Irsquom altogether sorry. Yet although a good bartenderrsquos manner is part of what draws people back, they canrsquot be bland or dull. Itrsquos a demanding job, and a touch of authority and steel is essential. People capable of handling humanity at its most outspoken, vocal and occasionally insufferable, are rarely naturersquos sweet sherry. I like to think of those with the saltiest personalities as an acquired flavour, like a peaty Islay malt. Ideally, a publican sits midway between the two: a New Zealand sauvignon, perhaps, or dry GT.Itrsquos a job I certainly couldnrsquot handle, especially in a busy city centre. My husband recalls that our wedding ceremony in a Glasgow registrarrsquos office took less time than ordering a drink in the Horseshoe bar.

The UK Government will publish legislation on the rules that will govern the UK single market to replace the EU single market, which we leave in six months. This will replicate, in theory, the economic level playing field that used to be overseen by the trade regulators in the European Commission.:Opinion: Ian McConnell: Whether European Research Group chairman Mark Francois sees value of EU is neither here nor there amid this Brexit shamblesNow, in his time as a Brussels correspondent, Boris Johnson made his name by traducing these regulations. He pilloried Brussels bureaucrats trying to ban British prawn cocktail crisps, adjudicating on condom dimensions or the degree of curvature on cucumbers. This was mostly journalistic invention. However, there was an element of truth in his Bonkers Brussels stories.To create a single market you have to have common trading and hygiene standards,only to prevent countries using them as ldquonon-tarf barriers to free trade. So there is poetic justice in Mr Johnson now finding himself in the position of the maligned eurocrats and trying to dictate the self-same rules for Scotland through the ldquopower grab.Perhaps Nicola Sturgeon should dust down some of his riper columns. For Mr Johnson also railed against state aid laws that prevented countries supporting their key industries. Mr Johnson suggested that was just in the interest of German exporters. Now the PM is dictating state aid rules to Scotland ndash essentially that we shouldnrsquot have them.Ms Sturgeon calls this a ldquofull-scale assault on devolution. Nor is she willing to accept ldquomutual recognition of trading and health and safety standards regulations which might expose Scotland to American chlorinated chickens and hormone-fed beef.Rather like the unbent bananas, the chlorinated chickens are a bit of a myth, and unlikely to appear on British shelves. The UK Government negotiators have made that clear to their US counterparts.But the Cabinet Office Secretary, Michael Gove, has also made it clear that a new UK internal market regulatory body will call the shots on state aid. It will also alter regulations on food standards and the like without consent from the Scottish Government. So the chemical fowl do perform the politicalof reminding people that the Scottish Parliament does at present have, at least in theory, a veto power over things like health, environment, animal welfare. This is because these matters were not included in the powers reserved to Westminster under the  Scotland Act.Of course, Holyrood only exercised these powers on behalf of Brussels it did not actually set the trading standards or state aid rules itself. However, it did and does exercise a degree of latitude in applying the standards and allocating state aid.For example, the Scottish Government was able to funnel more than poundmillion to Amazon under Selective Regional Assistance and other grants. These are EU-compliant forms of state aid permitted in order to attract companies to unemployment black spots ndash in this case Dunfermline. Ms Sturgeon might be a little shy of referring to that particular exercise in state aid since it emerged that Amazon was paying less in tax per year than it was receiving in ious forms of UK Government subsidies. It was also paying workers rather less than the Scottish Governmentrsquos Living Wage.But the principle is clear: Scotland has a strong case to retain powers over state aid, and not just because of a narrow interpretation of the devolution legislation.In America, supposedly land of the free market, devolved jurisdictions have state aid policies that would delight Jeremy Corbyn. San Francisco gave tax breaks and subsidies to attract Twitterrsquos HQ that could never have been allowed in Europe. In Delaware you can set up a business and pay no tax at all.No one is suggesting that Scotland should become an international tax haven, of course. But it can make a strong case for continuing to have a role in state aid policy, in areas like ferry services to island communities or a public sector bid for rail franchises.Holyrood is also on firm ground insisting that it retains powers over food standards. Scottish beef producers are understandably worried about imports of cheap meat from non-EU countries. Salmon farmers have been getting stick from environmentalists over standards in their ponds, but things could become immeasurably worse were existing animal welfare and food safety standards to be relaxed.Of course, this is what ldquomutual recognition should mean in practice: flexibility on both sides. It would be very stupid for the UK Government to refuse to recognise ersity in trading standards across the UK. And not just in order to avoid y court actions over the Sewel Convention.The convention that the Scottish Parliament should pass a consent motion on any UK legislation cutting across its powers was effectively revoked by the UK Supreme Court in . The ldquospider lady Lady Hale and fellow judges ruled that the Sewel Convention had no statutory basis and didnrsquot limit Westminster sovereignty. So there.Read more: Does Nicola Sturgeon still want independence But with an election in May, the UK Government would be ill advised to deny Scotlandrsquos right to exercise residual powers of devolution after we leave the EU.

Mr Gove himself proposed this before the Brexit referendum.Mind you, Nicola Sturgeon might be wise to tone down criticism of the ldquoracist policy of Priti Patel.

Pick out the juicy tidbits. Is that not the tabloid way, the branch of journalism with which he is most closely associated Look closer, however, and all is not as it seems. The Farage story is fresh, but the Church tale was first aired at the Leveson Inquiry and the Succession point is mere observation. Yet that mix of modes, slipping between fact and fiction, objective and subjective, is the Murdoch way too.Hard man to pin down, Mr Murdoch. This three-part series, a sort of Dynasty without the shoulder pads, was the latest attempt to unravel the enigma, and it showed promising signs of having the chutzpah to go further than its predecessors. Or at the very least make a decent fist of a fascinating story.Made by  Films, the production company behind  , a six part series on the attacks on the US, the first episode featured many of the usual suspects ndash Piers Morgan, once a Murdoch editor, Alastair Campbell, ex-press secretary to Blair, etc ndash saying pretty much what you would expect.The strength of the piece lay in the way it built a story about power: who had it and who did not, and what that meant for the rest of us.So the first episode laid bare the great Blair-Murdoch bromance, begun in earnest when the Labour leader flew to Australia to woo the media boss and his executives. According to Campbell, Murdoch said his rapprochement with Blair was like two porcupines making love: it had to be done very slowly and very carefully. ldquoBit f****** weird, said Campbell.It got weirder. Once New Labour was in government, having secured the backing of the Murdoch empire, the relationship became ldquoalmost incestuous, said Andrew Neil.How close they became was illustrated by the tale of Blair and the euro. In a piece for the News of the World, Blair promised that the UK would not join the EU currency without a referendum. This, according to Nigel Farage, was the price of Murdochrsquos support for New Labour ndash asked and granted.ldquoIf Rupert Murdoch had not done that we would have joined the euro in  and I doubt Brexit would have happened, claimed Farage.What happened next in the programme was more remarkable. The interview over, Faragersquos lapel microphone was taken off. But the main mic was still running.ldquoTo be honest, said Farage, relaxing into off camera mode even though the recording was still going on, ldquoI did ask him whether he wanted me to do this, andhe said no I wouldnrsquot have done it. But he said yes, do it.Now, presuming ldquohe was Murdoch, did this mean the media boss was trying to spin a documentary about himself, to make himself look even more powerful That the filmmakers included the Farage \"extra\" was a promising sign that they were ready to engage in some journalistic rough and tumble of their own to get the story. One fancied Mr Murdoch,he was watching, might have approved.The film had promised to look at the ldquorise and fall and rise again of the dynasty, and by the end of episode one we had entered the phone hacking saga, the point at which the empire quaked.Throughout, the most fascinating segments were those looking at the Murdoch heirs. Much of the material on that subject came from an ABC Australia series, Dynasties: The Murdochs. Whether there will be anything new to add on this, and any other matter, depends on those who have worked most closely with Murdoch speaking out.Thus far, no dice. The most noteworthy thing said by Les Hinton, who worked for Murdoch for  years, concerned a get-to-know you dinner between his boss and the Blairs. ldquoCheriersquos a bit strange but I like him, was Murdochrsquos assessment.

The last man to be hanged here was Henry John Burnett, who murdered his girlfriends husband. As a child, Burnett spent time in borstals and later tried to kill himself the case also happened before legal aid, so he was defended by somebody with virtually no experience of criminal defence. He was executed in Aberdeen in , aged .If any good did come out of the case, it was that it probably expedited the abolition of the death penalty in Britain ndash it happened two years later. But whatrsquos striking is that, despite the abolition, public support for capital punishment was strong in this country and remains relatively high. The most recent Scottish Attitudes Survey shows about half the population supports the death penalty for some crimes.Itrsquos interesting that opinion is ided in this way at a time when it feels like almost every subject, including independence, is split into a binary yes or no, but the breakdown is dferent. We know therersquos a strong socially conservative streak in Scotland but it cuts across all the parties. In the case of Labour, part of its traditional working class support is hard on criminal justice, and in the SNP, the less progressive wing of the movement partly explains the creation of new pro-independence parties led by voices whorsquove been sceptical on issues such as trans rights.:Mark Smith: Anti-Scottish  I think Irsquom finally facing up to my prejudiceWhat all this means is we should remember wersquore not really as progressive as we think we are and that, while support for the death penalty has dropped from about two-thirds in the s, it is still extraordinary that half the Scottish population thinks itrsquos a good idea for the state to kill people. They may even have a preferred method: injection, electrocution, who knows.We should also note that, although therersquos no realistic prospect of the death penalty ing in Britain ndash or in an independent Scotland for that matter ndash it has become a little bit easier in the last few months. As a member of the EU, the UK was banned from reintroducing the death penalty but now that wersquore out of the EU no such ban applies anymore. So, in theory, it could happena future government wanted it.The hope must be, surely, that Scotlandrsquos changing attitudes on capital punishment and other liberal issues such as sexuality would prevent anyto the death sentence. But itrsquos worth remembering that governments do not always follow public opinion.

Nationalists came closer, much closer, than unionists like to admit to victory in the  independence referendum. Far from accepting that defeat, support for independence has grown steadily from that  percent base to at least a dead heat.And, although I think it is risky for nationalists to invest too much stock in any polling conducted during an unprecedented crisis such as coronavirus, there is little doubt that, in this snapshot in time, nationalists are winning. Even No voters think that Nicola Sturgeon is doing a good job.Scottish nationalism is in the jaws of victory. So why, three times in the last week alone, have dferent parts of the movement taken steps which risk snatching defeat Victory for nationalists is not a complicated route to chart. It has three elements: win a majority based on a clear manesto commitment at a Scottish Parliamentary election obtain agreement from the UK Government to allow a referendum to be held persuade enough  No voters to vote Yes.So the question for nationalists, it seems to me, should be lsquodoes what I am doing make any of these elements more or less likely to happen rsquo. If we look at the output from the nationalist community over the last week, the answer has to be lsquoless likelyrsquo.Let us take it in turn. The creation of another pro-independence party ndash the Alliance for Independence or AFI ndash has been discussed for some time amongst those seen as agitators against Ms Sturgeon. They are, very broadly speaking, more fundamentalist about the route towards a second referendum and independence, set against the gradualist and more consensual approach of the SNP.On the face of it, AFI is a clever concept, exploiting the SNPrsquos strength in constituencies, peeling off the wasted SNP regional votes, and scooping up a large proportion of the  regional seats.The legitimacy or otherwise of lsquoplayingrsquo the Additional Member Systemvoting method is for another column, but as an exercise in maximising the number of seats for pro-independence parties the AFI proposal has solid logic.However, this is not solely about electoral success in May. The entire purpose of the exercise is, I presume, to lay the foundation for a second independence referendum. However, without the consent of Westminster, nationalist parties could win  seats and there will still not be a second referendum.There remains a debate in the Conservative party about the granting of indyref. The official line remains that there will not be one. Wersquove had one, we said no, we meant it, you said ldquoonce in a letime and so on and so on.

On the fringes of the nationalist movement, yes, but nonetheless attracting national publicity. The  percent who voted No last time have, by definition, at least some affinity with the Union, and with England. It may be social, cultural, economic it doesnrsquot matter what it is, it matters that it is there. Irsquod place a bet that precisely none of the two million people who voted No in  will be persuaded by the Hazmat brigade. Indeed, it has more chance of pushing Yes voters the other way.Similarly, the decision by AUOB, a more mainstream nationalist group, betrays a lack of understanding of who lsquosoftrsquo Unionists are, and what they think.The -or-so percent of voters who might go either waythere is another referendum are, self-evidently, moderate, pragmatic, and unbiased. Their choice is likely to be clinical rather than emotional. They probably voted No last time because they felt the nationalist arguments on the economy were too weak, too left-wing.Tell me, then, how a march of thousands of highly committed, flag-waving leftist nationalists is going to persuade the persuadables If I were a nationalist, looking to achieve independence forthwith, Irsquod be sticking by the SNP strategy.

Here in the UK, we have also witnessed a signicant decline in our annual CO emissions compared to pre-lockdown levels.While it is highly questionable whether these specic benefits will be maintained, a longer-term environmental consequence of the pandemic is its likely impact on speeding up the global transition from fossil fuels to clean energy. This transition, which was under way long before the pandemic took hold, is likely to be propelled forward as we emerge from lockdown and look to revive the global economy. It will be driven by a change in consumer behaviour as we enter the ldquonew normal and see increased pressure for nations to get serious about addressing environmental concerns.Many of the post-pandemic economic stimulus packages about to be introduced across the world will also be guided by environmental considerations, including Paris Agreement obligations. We can therefore expect a spike in measures, including funding for offshore wind projects, expanded rollouts of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, grants for development of clean aviation fuels and the further expansion of cycle works, to follow.Here in the UK, there is already signicant support within the business community for future government stimulus measures and corporate bailouts to take account of our net zero climate target. Wersquove already seen a group of  business leaders pressing the Government to align its economic recovery plans with the UKrsquos legislated target of net zero emissions by  at the latest. Meanwhile the UK Government is understood to be working on a net zero sector deal, which we expect to be announced later this year.This comes as we are witnessing a changing culture within the energy sector where major operators, including Total and BP, have announced high profile low carbon investments since the recent oil price crash. While a number of energy firms have cut their overall near-term investment due to current financial pressures, in many cases the reduction in this expenditure is far more signicant on oil and gas projects compared with those which are low carbon.The energy transition has never been about journeying entirely from fossil fuels to clean energy but rather finding a balancing point somewhere between the two. Fossil fuels still have an important role going forward as part of a wider energy mix. In addition, the petrochemicals industry will also remain relevant going forward ndash as an example the petrochemicals required for face masks and other PPE used in the fight against Covid- are not easily replaced. Similarly, as the infection risk falls and people resume travel, from an energy perspective we will see an initial increased demand for petrol and diesel in advance of longer term investment to promote electric vehicles.Although consumers may face higher energy prices in the short term, over time they will benefit from greater choice and easier access to the market through digitalisation and from the further development of domestically generated wind and solar power which empowers people to operate as energy producers.Overall we can expect to see a faster rise in the development and use of green energy due to the catalyst of the global pandemic which has indeed brought much adversity as well as opportunity.Norman Wisely is Aberdeen Managing Partner at international law firm CMS"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-doug-marr-era-male-leaders-maybe","story":"Itrsquos dficult to tie down the distinguishing qualities of statesmen women therersquos just something about them that creates trust and respect.

A public health campaign was thus born, and the first of many I think, in the Scots language.Whilst Irsquom not sure how far to the front of some peoplersquos heids government campaigns are after a few pints, most people seem to have quite enjoyed this foray into Scots. A cursory look on Twitter at the ldquokeep the heid hashtag confirms that, with someone from East Anglia saying it was the perfect phrase for these times, and another north of the border proclaiming that hersquod never felt so patriotic.The use of Scots somehow brings momentary respite to what has been a heavy, bruising time, it lightens our moods, makes us smile, whilst at the same time carrying an important message to behave ourselves. Therersquos something about ldquokeep the heid that feels inclusive, and is perhaps not quite as paternalistic as the UK governmentrsquos ldquoStay Alert slogan, although arguably they mean almost the same thing. Whatever the reasoning behind it, Sturgeon seems to have got it right with both choice of language and messaging.

As a second generation Asian, rolling words like \"glaikit \", \"dreich\" and \"scunnered\" around my tongue gives me the same joy as speaking Punjabi instead of the more formal Urdu of my parents. For me, the Scots language brings me closer to those who may perceive me as dferent. It unies and ameliorates, strengthens and deepens those human bonds.But slogans in whatever language wont be enough to see us through the trials ahead.

Weve been together for  years and, oh, the things we have seen, the places we have been.Shes due an MOT soon, I mention to my mum. \"That might be her last,\" she replies. I pat at Stellas air vent, as though it were an ear, so she doesnt hear. Ma Stewart softens and suggests I could keep Stella parked in her driveway, I wouldnt have to trade her in, nothing so brutal.But the thing about Stella is, she may be an old girl of  but she only has about , miles on the clock because, while I love her like a sister , I do practice what I preach. I do go on public transport as much as possible. I do ride my bike everywhere I can.We take a trip to Doncaster once a year to visit our friend Stephanie and we drive to Coatbridge from Glasgow every second week. Other than that, she largely sits in the carpark patiently waiting a next outing.I used to take the train to Doncaster every year, incidentally, until the fares went up wildly. For several years you could get aticket for about pound but then it became cheaper to fly to Europe than to rail southwards, so it was Stella to the rescue.Wed get lost every year, usually going awry somewhere around Scotch corner. One year I was delighted to find a practical application for my English Lit degree. Entirely lost, I stopped at a service station and clocked a red rose above the entrance. A rose  War of the Roses! Red  Bloody hell, Im in Lancaster. Wrong side of the country entirely and thank you Shakespeare.During the coronavirus, however, Stella has never been busier. When le started to slow down but we were still commuting in to the office, I started to drive to work every day due to, at first, a fear of coming in to close contact with people on the bus, and then due to reduced services.The bike was parked because I was having to carry a load of equipment back and forth, for boring reasons, and it was too heavy and didnt fit in my panniers. Friends who were still commuting did likewise, dropping public transport for the private car.While very much staying at home for the vast majority of the time, very rare trips that would normally be done on public transport have been done by car. Again, reduced services and reluctance to be close to strangers.As lockdown has eased, the car has become a focal point for allowing a slightto some normality. First it was drive thru food and drink outlets. Whereas you might previously have sat in, now driving through was the only option.Edinburgh and Glasgow city councils have now reintroduced parking charges, in an attempt to ease congestion and get back on track with carbon emission reduction aims while encouraging greener travel.This is the right thing to do, though it makes it tricky for workers while public transport is still reduced. It also reintroduces the conumdrum of how to encourage people to use our city centres and local high streets now that out-of-town shopping malls with their ample and free parking have reopened.Its not only commuting, shopping and dining that have become car-centric.Ato social and leisure activities is focusing on private vehicles too. There are drive-in comedy shows planned, drive-in movies and a drive-in gig - though this was cancelled due to concerns about localised lockdown restrictions.Its straightforward enough - being in a private vehicle is the most socially distanced place you can be while still enjoying pre-pandemic pursuits.Glasgows plans for a low emission zone in the city centre had made me start to think about what to do with my car. Is it more environmentally friendly to keep a relatively low emissions vehicle or to buy, say, an electric car but have that offset with the emissions generated producing it I hadnt started to look into that yet but had planned to, as well as trying to work outI could manage without the car and join a car club instead.Yet being in an emergency situation has turned all that on its head and made owning a vehicle, once again, the most attractive option, especially with the added boon of the tourism sector opening this week and the five mile travel limit lted.The oft repeated sticking point when pushing for increased levels of active travel has been the suboptimal public transport were faced with.Now, theres really no defence for public transport because its unarguably reduced. It wasnt good enough or joined up enough before, and now there is less of it.Our environmental concerns havent diminished during the Covid- pandemic, they are very much still there and very much in need of relentless, persistent addressing.Its now a bigger ask than ever before to urge people to embrace greener travel, an ask the transport minister made earlier this week. Reflecting on phase three of lockdown being the most dficult transition phase yet, Michael Matheson said, \"The obvious temptation for households with access to a car will be to take that option. However, we know many journeys are less than a few miles and could be covered via active travel, especially over the summer and autumn months.\"Using a car, though, isnt merely a temptation now. Its a common sense, understandable option for many. With a reduction in public transport and so many new car-based activities on offer, there are real additional issues of inequality for those households without a vehicle.The surge of people cycling in lockdown for leisure will, hopefully, be sustained and see those who are biking for exercise start commuting too.Id count myself as an active travel advocate but Im certainly going to have to wean myself back off driving as we move through the pandemic response. Car use is now predicted to rise to % of pre-covid levels. We dont want it any higher.

Since the NHS is devolved in Scotland our First Minister had the political power to stop, test and trace people entering Scotland via sea and airports from the time the virus first revealed itself to be on its way.Scotland likes to compare itself with similar-sized countries such as Finland, yet it has had  deaths similar-sized Denmark has had  deaths. I suggest that it is an invalid argument to say that we all are wise in hindsight. We do not vote into office governments who learn on the job. The horrendous risk of a pandemic was well known, yet it appears the UK nations were unprepared for the robust action which was needed months ago.However, the creation of the Alliance for Independence is good news for unionists as it reveals a growing sense of disorder, frustration and confusion in the ranks of separatists.Bill Brown, Milngavie.IT is perhaps unsurprising that a number of commentators on the performance of the Scottish Government in managing the coronavirus pandemic have appeared \"underwhelmed\" in spite of plaudits from across the UK for the First Ministerrsquos personal performance. The fact that the BBC produced a misleading documentary related to the Nike conference and even ITV has based morbidity figures for the UK on tested outcomes while figures persistently presented for Scotlandinclude ldquopresumed or suspected deaths related to Covid-, has only helped to engender confusion. Further adding to this confusion is the additional fact that Covid--related deaths registered for England have been consistently \"under-reported\", as noted by the London School of Economics and the Financial Times . Belgium by comparison attributes all lsquoexcess deathsrsquo to Covid- so has a disproportionately high morbidity rate.What we can be certain of is that England, with a relatively younger population, has suffered a Covid- morbidity rate, confirmed from actual tests, nearly  per centhigher than that of Scotland. We also know, from genome sequencing, that the infamous Nike conference did not lead to the spread of the coronavirus across Scotland and that as the UK Coronavirus Act was only introduced on March , the Scottish Government could not have effectively moved into lockdown relatively even earlier than England, irrespective of subsequent postulations.In other words while Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have suffered many more deaths in comparison with countries of similar populations across Europe and around the world, with limited powers the devolved governments, including the Scottish Government, have apparently managed the pandemic considerably better than their much larger neighbour which dictated most of the major actions leading to the UKrsquos invidious position atop of confirmed international Covid- death rates.

We are also having to arrange to clean them more often, and so we are discussing with our staff and contractors about how this will be done. This is why we can’t open all the toilets on the th, but we are aiming to have all public toilets open during August. There will be physical changes both outside and inside the toilets. You will be asked to follow physical distancing markers outside the toilet, and not all the facilities inside the toilet will be available. Because of this, please allow a little longer for your visit as you may need to wait for the toilets to be free.

Trade Unions have been provided with the risk assessments and given the chance to make any comments. We are currently working with our cleaners, including those who do relief cleaning for the council, as well as our contractors to assess their availability.

There are plenty of places to go and things to do to suit every budget. Here is our guide to the numerous great days out in across our region.WITH BEER gardens entering their second week of opening in Scotland and the five-mile restriction on non-essential travel lted, the country has begun to look forward to a summer of fun.While social distancing measures are still in place and it is important not to take undue risks, there are plenty of things to do safely.Zoos and animal parks around Scotland re-opened on June , and now that the five-mile restriction has eased they canwelcome visitors from near and far. Edinburgh Zoo, Five Sisters Zoo in West Lothian, Blair Drummond Safari Park in Stirling and the Highland Wildle Park in the Cairngorms National Park have all reopened, with customers asked to book in advance. Fe Zoo suffered a devastating fire just days after reopening after the Covid- lockdown, but no animals were harmed and owners have said they hope toto normality as soon as possible thanks to support and fundraising from the local community.Stately homes and gardens have also reopened, with several National Trust for Scotland properties now open to visitors.These include Culzean Castle and Country Park in Ayrshire, Threave Garden in Dumfries and Galloway, Brodie Castle’s garden and grounds, Arduaine Garden in Argyll and Crathes Castle’s garden and estate in Aberdeenshire. Historic Environment Scotland has said that it will monitor the situation and reopen properties in due course.Unstaffed outdoor sites are already open, so visitors can enjoy walks around Edinburgh’s Holyrood Park and West Lothian’s Linlithgow Peel among others.Walkers and climbers are now welcome to visit the country’s national parks to enjoy some outdoor exercise. Guidelines remain to avoid touching surfaces or opening gates where possible, to follow signs and avoid coming into contact with farm workers where applicable, and to keep dogs on leads and avoid areas known to be busy. Pubs and restaurants without door space have also been allowed to reopen. Glasgow’s The Cranside Kitchen, near the Rotunda, has claimed to be the country’s largest beer garden, with a free-to-enter area seating more than  guests with social distancing measures in place.The beer garden offers a range of drinks alongside food from five popular Glasgow restaurants, Rioja, Halloumi, Pickled Ginger, Kilmurry  Co and La Rotunda. In Edinburgh the Corn Exchange has billed itself as the largest beer garden in the city, having transformed the car park into a space where people can enjoy drinks as well as play darts, ping-pong, swing ball and watch sport, all while observing the necessary hygiene routines. With hundreds of smaller beer gardens open around the country – including Dundee’s The Kilted Kangaroo and Aberdeen’s Siberia Bar and Hotel – there is no shortage of options for enjoying this summer safely and enjoying good times in Scotland.Five Sisters Zoo in West Lothian opened up to the public on June , with a number of new measures in place to help prevent the spread of the virus. These include mandatory advance booking to avoid crowding and queues, a oneway system around the zoo, hand-washing stations and the cancellation of any activities which involve the public touching or feeding the animals. The soft play area and restaurant are also closed, but food kiosks are still open.Keeper talks have been cancelled, but several videos of the talks have been made available online.The zoo is currently opening at about one third of capacity to ensure space for social distancing, and owners say they will monitor the situation and review measures in place after the first couple of weeks. “It’s been good so far, the feedback we’ve had has been really positive,” said assistant manager Gary Curran. “The past few months have been quite dficult financially, so it was a relief to be able to open safely.” He added: “We’re looking forward to the rest of the summer and hopefully some more good weather! “People really enjoy it here and they’re having a good time so far.”Summer is here and our colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens beckon. Many attractions are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and prebooked time slots, so the UK Government recommends looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations you plan to visit before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go. To make your days out as enjoyable as possible, we encourage you to plan your trip in advance and to check all of the important facilities and attractions, while looking after our great outdoors.To ensure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, here are a few simple steps to help make planning easy. When planning your trip, check that important facilities – like toilets and car parks – are open before you travel so you’re not caught short. If you have an attraction in mind, please check online to seeyou need to pre-book a time slot.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem that you can brag to friends about. Keep two metres apart from anyone outside your household where you can. This applies to walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing too. Wear a face covering at all times when on public transport like buses, trains, taxis and minicabs.Make sure you have a bank card because many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments and you don’t want to miss out on that ice cream.And take hand sanitiser with you – you don’t know where will be open for you to wash your hands.Leave the car behind where possible and visit attractions by walking or cycling.Please remember that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for re opening tourism.To help you enjoy summer safely, please check the respective official sources for information prior to travelling by using the website visitbritain gb en knowbefore-you-goWith many of our favourite attractions now beginning to reopen their doors, Scottish tourism bosses have teamed up with Tourism Northern Ireland, VisitEngland and VisitWales to come up with a way for people to check whether they are “good to go”. The We’re Good To Go initiative was developed jointly by the four UK Visitor agencies. The UK-wide industry standard and consumer mark will provide a “ring of confidence” for visitors as the tourism sector works towards reopening.The We’re Good To Go mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective Government and public health guidance, have carried out a COVID- risk assessment and checked that they have the required processes in place, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence. The scheme is free to join.UK Government tourism minister Nigel Huddleston said: “I want to encourage the public to experience a great holiday this summer and be confident that they can do so safely.“This new industry standard will show people that tourism businesses, destinations and attractions are adhering to the guidance. “It puts safety first and is an important move in getting this industry back up and running.”VisitScotland chief executive Malcolm Roughead, said: “We are pleased that after a very dficult few months Scotland’s tourism industry are starting to welcome visitors.“However, it’s important to remember that things may be a little dferent now, there may be reduced facilities available orbusy, a greater need to follow physical distancing restrictions to protect yourself and others. “Planning and researching will also become an important part of the holiday experience and we really want visitors to ‘know before they go’ when it comes to travel checking what is open and pre-bookingrequired.”To obtain the mark businesses must complete a self-assessment through the online  https:goodtogo.visitbritain your-business-good-to-go-scotland including a check-list confirming they have put the necessary processes in place, before receiving certication and the We’re Good To Go mark for display in their premises and online. Businesses across the UK are assessed according to their respective national guidance including the social distancing and cleanliness protocols that must be in place. vw, px\"  For more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotlandcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In order to allay concerns regarding public safety, VisitScotland, alongside the national tourism bodies of England, Northern Ireland and Wales, announced a new UK-wide industry standard and consumer mark to provide confidence for visitors, communities and tourism businesses alike, as the sector works towards reopening.Since its launch, last month, over , businesses have signed up to the ‘We’re Good to Go’ scheme. A new visitor charter was also created by the national tourism organisation aimed at encouraging safe and responsible travel around the country. Businesses are currently updating their listings on visitscotland with opening information to make it easier for visitors to plan ahead.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive said: “Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover.#The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen. It’s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.“July  marks a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this ‘new normal’, so it’s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.“We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone — visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.“For more information on travelling in Scotland visit visitscotlandcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

More information on testing is available on the PHA website.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3236563.jpg--.jpg?1594988997000\n","title":"royal irish ceremony is postponed","story":" A ceremony to honour the Royal Irish Regiment, which had been due to be held next month in Ballymena, will now take place in Spring , elected members on Mid and East Antrim Borough Council have agreed.A ceremony to honour the Royal Irish Regiment, which had been due to be held next month in Ballymena, will now take place in Spring , elected members on Mid and East Antrim Borough Council have agreed.The Laying of the Retired Colours of the First Battalion of the Royal Irish Regiment had been planned for August when the regiment would also have exercised their right, as Freemen of the Borough, to parade the town.However, due to the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic, plans have been placed on hold until Spring of next year.Speaking at the monthly meeting of Full Council, Mayor Cllr Peter Johnston, said:“This ceremony had been scheduled to take place during August this year.“Unfortunately, due to the onset of the Covid- pandemic, and the critical role which all the services in the Armed Forces have and continue to provide, as part of the UK Government’s response to the pandemic, it has been agreed with the Royal Irish Regiment to postpone the Laying of the Retired Colours to .“Planning will now commence with the Royal Irish Regiment to hold the Laying of the Retired Colours ceremony in Spring .” "},{"url":null,"title":"25 rise in kids calling childline for counselling during lockdown in","story":"Concerned: Childine’s Mairead Monds FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappConcerned: Childine’s Mairead MondsLauren HarteTwitterEmailJuly   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailMore than  children in Northern Ireland with mental health concerns reached out for help during lockdown.Childline reported an increase of more than % in kids getting in touch about their mental health and emotional wellbeing.The charity said it had delivered  counselling sessions with local children since the beginning of lockdown.Childline is growing increasingly concerned that children are the hidden victims of the crisis.The charity provides a vital leline for youngsters, for whom mental health is among the primary concerns.Throughout the pandemic, young people have told counsellors they are feeling low, unhappy and overwhelmed.

Mr Hancock told the Commons there had been a problem with swabs, but there was no suggestion test results were affected.Mr Hancock told MPs: We#ve identied some swabs that are not up to the usual high standard that we expect, and we#ll be carrying out further testing of this batch as a precautionary measure.And while we investigate further, we#re requesting that the use of these Randox swab test kits are paused in all settings until further notice.Clinical advice is that there is no evidence of any harm, the test results are not affected.There is no evidence of issues with any of our other test swabs, and there is no impact on access to testing.Shadow secretary of state for health John Ashworth asked Mr Hancock what was wrong with the Randox test kits - and how many had been used.Is there a health risk to anyone who has been tested with these kits  the senior Labour MP said.And how many people have these unsafe kits been used on and why weren#t the certications checked before these kits were used These kits tend to be used in many care homes.We want care home residents to be tested regularly, we want care home staff to be tested regularly - can he guarantee that those care homes will now get alternative kits rapidly Mr Hancock replied: The reason is that they had a CE stamp and upon investigation of the certication of that stamp, the certication was not forthcoming, and therefore physical checks were done and we found that the swabs weren#t up to the standards that we expect.This is limited to the Randox element of the testing system, not the broader testing system that we have.And I explained the clinical position, which is that there is no evidence of any harm having been done and that there is full access to testing because we have plenty of other test kits available.A statement on the Randox website said: As an immediate precautionary measure we have temporarily suspended distribution of home sample collection kits using one particular batch supplier of swabs.This is a temporary measure and does not apply to our private business, which uses a dferent supplier of swabs.Test results from Randox kits are not affected.Belfast Most ReadLimavady Covid- spike linked to microphone passed around at house party karaoke sessionModel #caught with €, at Belfast airport# made  flights out of the UK in four yearsHeartbroken husband of Co Tyrone crash victim Andrea Hackettpays emotional tribute to #love of his le#Success is sweet: Belfast mother’s chocolate bar recipe entered for Cadbury competition is in running to become permanent productCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No further deaths but  new cases confirmed,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is precisely why hymns have been banned at church services.And so, the number of diagnosed cases is now beginning to rise again - as of Friday, there were  more confirmed cases in Northern Ireland, with  people testing positive for the virus in the Causeway Coast and Glens area over the past seven days.It is clear that Limavady and the surrounding areas are now at the centre of Covid- spike, the full effects of which cannot yet be predicted.It#s certainly a matter of consternation for people living in the area who are regarded as extremely vulnerable to the virus, coming just weeks before shielding is paused.Experts have conceded that it isn#t always possible to track everyone down and so we must be prepared for the possibility that the number of positive cases may continue to rise in the coming days - even beyond Limavady itselfIt is also fair to surmise that the virus may have travelled over the mountain towards Coleraine, Portrush and potentially beyond. This will, of course, have implications given the fact the North Coast is a popular day trip destination for people from all over.Health officials are currently undertaking a trace, test and isolate programme to try and halt the spread of Covid-, but the system itself has limitations.Experts have conceded that it isn#t always possible to track everyone down and so we must be prepared for the possibility that the number of positive cases may continue to rise in the coming days - even beyond Limavady itself.And with an increase in cases, there is a growing likelihood that more people will require hospital treatment.Of course, we don#t know the ages and medical history of all of those who have been infected, but it isn#t too far a leap to say that someone may even lose their le.It is a sobering thought, but it is the tragic reality now that Covid- is endemic in the community.Looking back, the Health Minister and Chief Medical Officer have warned that complacency cannot be allowed to set in and commenting on the Limavady cluster on Thursday, Robin Swann said he was not surprised by the outbreak.Health officials have said repeatedly that this would happen as social distancing measures were relaxed and on Friday, Dr Tom Black, chair of the British Medical Association#s NI Council, said we will continue to see similar outbreaks in the coming months.However, the future is very much in our hands it is our responsibility to keep each other safe.There are so many measures we can adopt to stop the spread of the virus.Frequent handwashing, maintaining an appropriate distance from others, and wearing a face covering in an enclosed space - they will all go some way to slow the spread of Covid-.No one wants toto the full lockdown that was put in place in March butwe can#t bring clusters like these under control, then that is what we are heading forThe cluster in Limavady is a warning shot and it is welcome that some local organisations are taking it seriously, with  Derry GAA clubs suspending activity as a precautionary measure.There has even been talk of a local lockdown, and it is a very real possibilitythe number of cases diagnosed in the area continues on the same trajectory.No one wants toto the full lockdown that was put in place in March butwe can#t bring clusters like these under control, then that is what we are heading for.Doctors and scientists have warned that this is a potentially more dangerous period than during the original outbreak.There is no doubt that complacency has set in, there is a certain fatigue with social distancing.The fact that we haven#t experienced the predicted thousands of fatalities has to some extent contributed to this.However, the cluster in Limavady should act as a reminder that Covid- is as dangerous and as insidious as ever.

The offences each carry a maximum penalty of up to  years imprisonment.The respondent had booked  international flights into or out of the UK between May ,  and May , . On  occasions, the outward andflights were within a matter of hours. The European Arrest Warrantstated that Mr Adams was stopped at Belfast International by Border Force officers on May ,  travelling with only hand luggage. The warrant said Mr Adams confirmed to Border Force officers that he had packed the bag himself.When asked whether anyone had given him anything to take out of the country, he replied: Yes, €,.The warrant stated that Mr Adams was interviewed under caution on May ,  and made no comment to questions asked in relation to the cash, his personal background, his employment status and financial position. Counsel for the State, Aoe Carroll BL, previously made an application to the court for Mr Adams# surrender and asked the court to let the chips fall where they may. She submitted that the respondent#s objections to surrender were speculative, vague, unsupported by evidence and were subject to innumerable iables so that the court could not refuse surrender on foot of same. Ms Carroll said she was satisfied surrender to the UK would not give rise to an unfair trial. She said nothing in the warrant was defective, nothing arose in relation to Brexit as the status quo remains in place, so surrender was not prohibited.Furthermore, Ms Carroll said thatan order for surrender was made against Mr Adams, she would be asking the court to postpone handing him over to the authorities in Northern Ireland until domestic proceedings had been determined.The court has heard that the respondent#s position was complicated by the fact that he has been ed for trial before the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on separate money laundering charges, and his trial is due to take place in Dublin in June . Mr Adams had contested his surrender at the High Court, with his lawyers saying that he should not be extradited to Northern Ireland due to Brexit. Counsel for Mr Adams, Paul Comiskey O#Keeffe BL, had argued thathis client was convicted and sentenced in the Republic first, there would be an infringement of his rights to a fair trial in Northern Ireland in the future.He claimed this is because the UK would no longer be in the transitional period provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement between the UK and the European Union. He further submitted that there was a real risk that the fundamental rights of the respondent would not be respected. Ordering his surrender to the UK yesterday, Mr Justice Paul Burns said he was satisfied that the extradition of Mr Adams was not prohibited by part three of the European Arrest Warrant Act . In light of the domestic offences brought against Mr Adams, the judge postponed his surrender to the UK until a later date.He remanded him in custody until July , .

A spokesperson from SONI denied the payments in Northern Ireland were excessive, and said a long-term strategy including progressing the North-South interconnector in Ireland would steadily reduce costs for customers.Mr Wells, a DUP MLA who has had the party whip withdrawn, said: This is basically wind farm owners being paidto do nothing. In the initial surge to get people signed up to wind farms and green energy, the incentives were extremely attractive.He said operators should no longer be compensated for quieter periods, given the relatively low costs after start-up. Each farmer gets a payment of £, per turbine a year for  years for the land they rent the turbines on.He added: I do think it#s time to review these contracts to make sure they meet the needs of the real world.REF director Dr John Constable pointed to a weakness in Scotland#s grid system that has already caused an excessive expansion in wind farms, resulting in large constraint payouts. Mr Constable added: I agree these constraint payments should never have been paid at all, it#s just a mistake. One thing you could say is that constraint payments are just getting going in Northern Ireland.Wind farms are still being built so it#s only going to get worse and the scale of the problem is very large.The constraints so far in the GB system in  has already cost £.m. You really don#t want to head that way in Northern Ireland.SONI spokesperson Natasha Sayee said it was necessary to limit wind energy on occasions for safety and security reasons, with windfarms owners compensated for the electricity they planned to sell.She explained that a signicant amount of work has taken place to improve Northern Ireland#s grid system and minimise constraints.At present, the grid carries up to % renewable energy at any one time, with a target to increase this to % by .There has also been investment in the Curraghmulkin project in Tyrone and the Brockaghboy kV line near Garvagh which connects clusters of windfarms to the transmission grid. During the first three months of this year, she added there was % more wind generation in Northern Ireland and % more available wind energy than in the same period last year.She said the North South Interconnector would also be a game-changer in maximising efficiency.In doing so it will also reduce costs to consumers across the island of approximately £m annually, rising to £m in savings by .She added that investing in technologies such as battery storage to hold excess wind energy would allow more upgrades for future generations.Steven Agnew, head of the NI Renewable Industries Group , said renewable energies had saved NI consumers £m since .With % of its electricity coming from renewables, Northern Ireland is a leader in the type of low-carbon energy generation that will play a key role in our green economic recovery, he said.He called constraints an unfortunate consequence of a small island system that was paid to all forms of generation.In renewables, he said this was more than compensated for due to reduced wholesale prices.

My kids love coconut and white chocolate and my wee girl has Rice Krispies every day for breakfast. And I just thought Cadbury#s don#t really have a bar that has coconut in it, she explained.It was also a case of second time lucky for the BT telecoms employee. She previously entered her recipe idea, but was not selected.The first time I had entered the same bar and never heard anything, until I got an email to say I hadn#t been chosen. But I thought I#m going to enter that again. So probably last August I picked the three same flavours, she recalled.Then last September or October I got an email from Cadbury#s to say that I was down to the final . I just thought: #Is this a joke #The -year-old said she was shocked and delighted to then learn she had been selected as one of the three finalists who would travel to England to pay a visit to Cadbury#s headquarters in Bournville and witness their recipes being made into chocolate bars.I just couldn#t believe it. The smell of chocolate when you get in there... it just hits you. It#s amazing! I met the team and the other finalists. I had a brilliant wee day, she said.Going up against Gillian#s Coconutty is #Out of the Blueberry#, which has blueberry flavoured nuggets and white chocolate-coated cereal balls, and #Crunchy Honeycomb#, a mix of milk chocolate and caramel flavoured fudge cubes, chopped hazelnuts and honeycomb pieces.Gillian said she loved popping into the supermarket to see the bar on sale for the first time. It#s very exciting. Already I#ve had loads of people tagging me on Facebook, saying that they can#t wait to try the bar, or they#ve already tried and loved it, she added.Having tried it, I recommend taking a couple of bites, that way you get the full impact of the coconut.The chocolate bars are exclusive to buy in Tesco until July , when they go on sale at other retailers. At that stage, added Gillian, three mystery celebrities will champion each of the flavours online. I did get a buzz seeing it on the display, she said. The kids are over the Moon, saying: #Are you famous now, mummy  And I say: #I wouldn#t go that far, but everyone knows my signature now#.The overall winner will be decided by a public vote at www.cadburyinventor, which accounts for % of the vote, with the remaining % split between other online polls and sales.

Mr Middleton said: ‘‘The restrictions placed on pregnant women and their partners at the height of the first wave of Covid- demonstrated the serious threat posed by the virus and the disruption it caused to even the most cherished aspects of le in Northern Ireland. The guidance that took effect on  July was therefore extremely welcome, once again placing the onus on Trusts to facilitate birth partners seeking to accompany women to a range of maternity appointments. This included, but was not restricted to, dating and anomaly scans, induction of labour, the duration of labour, for birth, and visits to antenatal and postnatal wards. googletag.cmd.push I am becoming increasingly concerned that these rights have not been restored in a consistent or fair fashion. Whilst some Trusts appear to have honoured the guidance in full, the Western Trust have been limiting relaxations to -week scans only. This has led to a perception of a double standard. It is wrong that some birth partners are granted greater access than others simply because of where they live. Every pregnancy and every partner should be treated equitably and fairly. I would urgently call on the Health Minister to take steps to recty these concerns and issue clearer guidance.’’ googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Derry is a city with a deep-rooted musical heritage and over recent years a superfluity of talent has emerged, each of them dferent, but making their own mark in the industry. Amongst the current crop, you’ve got young established singer-songwriter SOAK, alternative pop artist ROE, the ambient soundscapes of Elma Orkestra, three-piece punk rockers TOUTS, indie folksters Reevah and PORTS, fuzzed up alt-rockers Waldorf  Canon and all female pop-rock courtesy of CHERYM. googletag.cmd.push Then there’s the masterful Our Krypton Son, rockers Wood Burning Savages and resurgent local legends Red Organ Serpent Sound - whose gigs were once described by Eamonn McCann as ‘low instinct, high art and so sexy’ they are ‘reserved sins in certain dioceses’. Unfortunately, those musicians have been unable to entertain audiences since March, except via Zoom, which is no substitute for the interactive and much more personal live experience. For musicians, performing is their leblood, it is not only what they love to do but live shows are the most dependable source of income. Leading artists in the country recently wrote a letter to the Department for Communitiesin a plea to provide urgent financial support to save the local music industry. googletag.cmd.push It is not only the musicians but the likes of producers, sound engineers, stage crew, management, live venue staff, photographers and freelance workers in the industry who are struggling. ‘STALLED’ Speaking to the Derry News, PORTS bass player and vocalist, Steven McCool, shared the dficulties experienced during lockdown but also about the welcome prospect of festivals and gigs on the horizon as restrictions have eased. He said: “At the start of the year we had begun working on a release schedule for our first new release in four years. “This includes, making music videos, touring etc. We had been finishing the last few songs of our next album. Then came the pandemic. “All our plans were stalled. We couldnt releasewe couldnt tour. We couldnt get together to finish the album or music videos. “We play live to build up the finances to release new music so that was another wall for us. “As things have started to open up, we have been able to roll out a bit of a schedule again and with Stendhal Festival going ahead, we can use that to coincide with a release. “Hopefully now as things start to open up we can get back on-board and out playing again.”  Hannah Richardson vocalist and guitarist in CHERYMechoed Steven’s view saying it’s ‘definitely been a dficult’ time for musicians. “With no furlough, no other source of income and a lot of uncertainty surrounding when it’s safe for us to get back to work,” she explained. A grant from Help Musicians NI at the start of lockdown her going for a while, Hannah said. “Spoty and the Arts Council have also been trying to issue grants to musicians which is extremely helpful but nothing compared to what we would be bringing inwe were allowed to work, especially now around festival season. “I just hope the live music scene is able to sustain itself once we see the other side of this and hope people continue to support local musicians and music venues so we can get back as quickly and safely to doing the thing we love most,” she added. Aoe Boyle, known by her stage name Reevah , had been planning to embark on her first headline tour to accompany the release of her EP A Dferent Light in April  May, followed by a busy summer of gigs and festivals. All of these plans have now been put on the back burner. As things stand the future for the arts is very uncertain, she explained. As anindependentartist the financial impact has been quitedevastatingand has affected not only our plans for the immediate future but for the next year. However, were so aware of the vast number of artists who are in a similar or even worse positions so are trying to remain as positive as possible about the future.  SOCIAL DISTANCING Stendhal Festival captured the attention of a worldwide audience after announcing the first socially distanced festival in Northern Ireland on August - aptly named ‘UNLOCKED’. It will take place at Ballymully Cottage Farm in Limavady where numbers will be limited but the audience will be treated to the very best talent on the island as well as beer gardens, delicious food and ‘perhaps best of all, over  acres of socially distant outdoor scenic countryside to enjoy’. Most festivals have however cancelled and are already trying to regroup for next year. Bars have also begun to reopen but in an effort to maintain social distancing live music has been actively discouraged. Theatres will open their doors at the end of the month but with large gatherings prohibited and social distancing mandatory for the foreseeable future there are uncertain times ahead. Strength N.I.A and Red Organ Serpent Sound frontman, Rory Moore, said it came as a ‘hefty blow’ to find out that all of their shows were cancelled for . “Live shows go hand in hand with releasing new music and sustaining oneself as a musician both financially, spiritually and emotionally. “It has been a pretty hefty blow. But working alone and self-isolation is something I have been used to for many years, the abnormality of the situation is something that comes with the turf of being a songwriter and performer,” he reflected. “Radio and social media are very important at this time for sustaining a career in music. “We hope that our fan base will pre order our album that is set for early release in  and fingers crossed we will be out playing again towards the middle of next year.” GOVERNMENT RESPONSE The Department for Communities said it is aware of the ‘immensely challenging’ situation currently facing the local music industry. The department has been in consultation with local industry representatives and further discussions are planned in the near future. In advance of the reopening of theatres and seated venues, the DfC is working in partnership with the Arts Council NI and key stakeholders, with officials having established a Consultative Arts and Culture Recovery Forum to help them in assessing the priorities for funding the sector in its entirety. A spokesperson said: “We are currently working at pace to develop our plans to ensure the future viability and resilience of the sector. These will be published as soon as possible. “The Arts Council NI currently have open funding programmes for both inidual artists and organisations. “Theatres have been provided with an indicative date for opening of  July. It is, however, recognised that it will be some time before venues such as theatres can operate as normal.” “There are a number of reasons for this. A number of venues have indicated that it will not be economically viable to open while social distancing remains in place. “We also need to consider the additional requirements for live performances including social distancing back stage and on stage, singing and wind instruments etc. “The Arts Council also are working with the sector to develop specic guidance for reopening theatres.

Holidays abroad may be off the agenda for many of us this year, but that offers a great opportunity to discover what lies on our doorstep in Northern Ireland. Tourism chiefs are asking everyone to “embrace Northern Ireland’s giant spirit” and experience it through the eyes of a tourist. googletag.cmd.push This summer presents an opportunity to check out great hotels and tourist spots that have been on the list to explore for years.

The tourism industry is eager to welcome back visitors and by planning your next vacation at home, you will be playing a pivotal role in supporting local businesses, historic sites and areas of natural beauty as they implement all required measures to protect people from Covid-.  RELAX: Galgorm Spa and Golf Resort Take time to ensure that you are in the know before you go Summer is here and our colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens beckon. Many attractions are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and prebooked time slots, so the UK Government recommends looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations you plan to visit before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go. To make your days out as enjoyable as possible, we encourage you to plan your trip in advance and to check all of the important facilities and attractions, while looking after our great outdoors. To ensure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, here are a few simple steps to help make planning easy. When planning your trip, check that important facilities – like toilets and car parks – are open before you travel so you’re not caught short. If you have an attraction in mind, please check online to seeyou need to pre-book a time slot. Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem that you can brag to friends about. Keep two metres apart from anyone outside your household where you can. This applies to walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing too. Wear a face covering at all times when on public transport like buses, trains, taxis and minicabs.  Take time to know before you go Make sure you have a bank card because many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments and you don’t want to miss out on that ice cream. And take hand sanitiser with you – you don’t know where will be open for you to wash your hands. Leave the car behind where possible and visit attractions by walking or cycling. Please remember that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. To help you enjoy summer safely, please check the respective official sources for information prior to travelling by using the visitbritain website. Mark that shows we are good to go in Northern Ireland With many of our favourite attractions now beginning to reopen their doors, Tourism Northern Ireland has teamed up with VisitScotland, VisitEngland and VisitWales to come up with a way for people to check whether they are “good to go”. The We’re Good To Go initiative was developed jointly by the four UK visitor agencies. The UK-wide industry standard and consumer mark will provide a “ring of confidence” for visitors as the tourism sector works towards reopening. The We’re Good To Go mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective Government and public health guidance, have carried out a Covid- risk assessment and checked that they have the required processes in place, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence. The scheme is free to join. “I want to encourage the public to experience a great holiday this summer and be confident that they can do so safely. This new industry standard will show people that tourism businesses, destinations and attractions are adhering to the guidance, saidUK Government tourism minister Nigel Huddleston.  READY: We’re Good To Go in Northern Ireland “It puts safety first and is an important move in getting this industry back up and running.” Tourism Northern Ireland chief executive officer John McGrillen said: “The rolling out of a UK wide industry standard and consumer mark is good news for the many tourism businesses across Northern Ireland who are gearing up to reopen their doors in the coming weeks. “They will be putting every possible measure in place to operate safely and provide reassurance to staff and customers alike that they have complied with official health guidance.” “We are acutely aware of the dficulties faced as the tourism sector reopens and the challenges ahead as we rebuild. However, we are confident that with the right measures in place and with ongoing support, the tourism industry in Northern Ireland can regain lost ground andto growth. “We have been delighted to partner with the national tourism agencies in Wales, Scotland and England to create a common approach. To obtain the mark, businesses must complete a self-assessment through the online  goodtogo.visitbritain, including a check-list confirming they have put the necessary processes in place, before receiving certication and the We’re Good To Go mark. _CoronavirusPHutm_mediumdisplayutm_sourceMediaForceutm_contentxframingdclidCP-boqqGOoCFVHHQodAIExg\" target\"_blank\" rel\"noopener\"    --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Greyhound tells the story of aUS NavyCommander on his first war-time assignment in command of a group of vessels defending a merchant ship convoy crossing the Atlantic. The convoys destination is Liverpool, a city which also played a key role in the war. The film was released this week on Apple TV and Derry gets a number of mentions in it. This is being seen as recognition of the importance of Derry to the allied forces during the war. Its importance increased massively after the US entered the conflict. googletag.cmd.push As Derry was the first major port in Europe for ships travelling from America, it was seen as a vital location. Thousands of US soldiers were based in Derry during the war, living in several camps built in the city. During World War , Germany deployed a large number of submarines into the Atlantic to disrupt convoys of supply ships travelling between the US and Britain. Although the US convoys were protected by shore-based military aircraft when sailing near the shore, most of the voyage was in theMid-Atlantic area, known as the Black Pit beyond the range of Allied air support, where the only protection for the convoy were the assigned naval escorts. googletag.cmd.push In Greyhound, Tom Hankss character, CommanderErnest Krause, is in charge of the operation to escort a convoy of  Allied ships headed toLiverpool. The films focus alternates between the combat between the escorts and U-boats. Greyhoundwas initially scheduled to be released in cinemas in June but was delayed due to theCOVID- pandemic. The distribution rights were then sold toApple TV which released the film digitally last weekend.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In a statement, they said: Testing and contact tracing is being conducted to identy people who may be potentially affected to help prevent any further spread. With lockdown restrictions being eased this type of occurrence is to be expected, which is why the Test, Trace and Protect programme is in place. At present anyone who tests positive for COVID- in Northern Ireland will be contacted by the contact tracing team to be given advice on what to do about managing symptoms and of the need to self-isolate to prevent any wider spread of the virus. googletag.cmd.push They will also be asked who they have been in contact with so that we can follow up with those iniduals to give them advice to help prevent the further spread of infection. Contact tracing is an established method to help prevent the further spread of infections such as COVID-, and we are using this approach to target potential clusters which could spark new outbreaks. Limavady councillor, James McCorkell, appealed for people not to panic, and to co-operate with the contact tracing teamthey are contacted. This highlights the fact that we are by no means over this troubling time and people must take this serious when out and about, he said. googletag.cmd.push I would ask that people dont panic - the Test Trace  Protect system is there to help identy these pockets that will inevitably flare up whilst we continue to go through this pandemic. I would appeal for people to cooperate with the Contact Tracing Team, should they be contacted, as this will help get any clusters under control on the area. Please also ensure you know the symptoms of covid- and take every precaution when out and about to social distance and follow at the guidance the Government has asked us to follow. If the team identies a potential cluster or outbreak this will be reported through the PHA’s normal outbreak management channels and the appropriate infection control advice actions carried out. PHA will continue to monitor all cases of COVID-, look for trends and linked cases and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. We will not comment on inidual cases as this could lead to people being identied and deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested. We would ask everyone to be mindful of this risk. This virus has the potential to make its presence felt in any district. Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in their neighbourhood right now. That’s why following the public health advice on regular hand washing and maintaining a social distance of two metres remains vitally important.

The Ulster Council gave clarication in relation to parents ‘attending’ underage games . In this respect where a parent is transporting a child to play in a game they are deemed to be ‘assisting with’ the fixture and are therefore permitted to attend, stated Ulsters Friday update. The GAA calls on all of our units to help us adhere to these restrictions to ensure that public health is not jeopardised. Similarly, we remind all of our clubs about the protocols shared recently for spectators attending games and we ask you to share these protocols with your members and distribute them on your communication channels, the statement continued. googletag.cmd.push The GAA have also given the green light to counties to stream games live.

One of the most familiar faces in youth football in Derry, McLaughlin has seen it all and done it all since taking the reins at the club in the early s, and in his time there has, with the help of others, elevated Celtics standing in the town to considerable heights. Yet with his partner Aisling, children Niamh , Cara , Caolan , Aaronand Rionato look out for, a degree in Community Youth Work and a job with Hillcrest Trust, Eamons plate is more than full. googletag.cmd.push The recent th anniversary celebrations of the club, plus the Covid- lockdown, gave the -year old plenty of time to reflect on both his past, and his future. So it was that McLaughlin took to Facebook earlier this week to announce his retirement, prompting hundreds of messages of support and congratulations. “It was a really dficult decision,” he admitted. “The timing however has been right for me and my family and the club. “I have been involved for  years and we have never been in a healthier position. We have more coaches than we have ever had, I think around  or  and in the last months, we have put a new committee in place, so we are in a really strong position. With that I felt the time was right for me.” googletag.cmd.push Its all a far cry from the day when he was thrust into the top position at the club, just  years of age and with little experience of coaching. “We were in the middle of a season and we had three or four matches in the league and we still had a cup run,” he recalled. “I was  years of age and I was helping Mousey Gallagher out and when he stepped away I was thrown into the deep end because there was no-one  there. “We kept it going and the likes of Oxy and Damien Doherty gave me a hand to fulfil the fixtures. We actually reached a cup final that season, but we were beaten - by Ashfield in the Brandywell. It was a brilliant season – I was hanging around with the boys as well as managing them – boys like Ryan Coyle, Eamon Morrow and Colm Fleming and a lot of those boys are now back coaching at the club, so its gone full circle for a lot of those boys as well as myself. There are so many sides to running a successful football club – but at its heart is the development of youngsters, on and off the pitch, and it is here especially where Top of the Hill has excelled according to McLaughlin. “The talent in Derry is unbelievable and thats one of the reasons I have always stuck by it,” he continued. “Its been great to see. Top of the Hill came in  years ago, but clubs like Oxford, Trojans and Don Boscos were already established. The talent is out there. For me, hand on heart, I got as much enjoyment from seeing a young fella who never got a kick as I do as someone lting a cup. Its about development. “Were slightly dferent to most clubs - because were living on the Interface, its more than about football. Im a youth worker as well so Ive always tried to tie the two in together. At this time of year we would have had trips and interventions to keep young people off the streets and away from rioting. “I got a text the other day from a young fella in Claudy saying that, more than football, he missed the trips we would do through The Whistle and Hillcrest. Its brilliant to hear that its not just about football because there are only so many young fellas who will make it as footballers. Its the community spirit and its the family atmosphere and I hope that continues on. Thats a big thing for me.” Celtic have had their share of big names come through their ranks in McLaughlins time – Rory Holden , Josh Daniels, Michael McCrudden and Darren McCauley some of those to build careers in the game.  Current Derry City midfielder Jack Malone also has his roots in Top of the Hill and McLaughlin admits that seeing a player reach his potential is the best kind of reward. It was in fact, McCruddens transfer to Newcastle United  years ago, coinciding with the tragic death of friend and fellow coach Keith Roddy, which lit a fire in McLaughlin. “Michael, at  or , was the first ever Top of the Hill Celtic player to go across the water,” he explained. “At the same time, in , Mickeys mentor, Keith Oxy Roddyhad died, and at that point I made the conscious decision that Im grabbing this by the horns and take the club where it needs to be, with the help of the likes of Paddy Logue, Higgs, Gerard Dunlop and boys like that.  “There were a very small amount of coaches but we had teams at every age group. You were out five or six nights a week. In the last two or three years, that has changed because now we have two or three coaches at every age group. I dont know for the le of me how Jon Clford and boys like that did it on their own. They deserve every credit that they get. “When I was starting out, boys like Jon Clford and Noel Crampsey, thats the boys you spoke to and asked advice of. Even though they were your competitors on the pitch, they wrere all in it for the same reasons, and they guided me, but no-one more so than Mickey Hutton in the DD. Any problems that I had ever with football, he was at the end of the phone, and the support that the DD have given us as a club hasnt gone unnoticed over here.”  is the first year that the Foyle Cup has not run in the city since its inception in , and while it is a loss for every club throughout the city, McLaughlin cannot wait for its– with the tournament holding a special place in the Top of the Hill calendar. “We try to get at least one team in every age grouppossible,” he said. “Some teams arent great, some are better than others, but they still get the opportunity to play in the Foyle Cup, and that, for me, is amazing. If youre winning - or getting beat -, your family are there supporting you during the Foiyle Cup, savouring the atmosphere and meeting new people. The buzz about the whole city throughout the week is phenomenal.” His time with Top of the Hill, for now, has reached an end, but the green and white will remain in his blood, and when football s, he will likely be the first on the sidelines cheering on his team. “Top of the Hill has been my le for  years, without a shadow of a doubt,” he stated.  “Its meant absolutely everything and will continue to mean everything to me. “It has given me some amazing memories and it will always be one of the proudest things that Ive done in my le. “Without the help and support of so many people – even the likes of my mother and sister, it all runs in their veins. Seeing the club celebrate its th anniversary last year probably sparked off my thinking that maybe it was time to move this on. The Covid thing gave me time to reflect and think – we are in a healthy spot at the minute and we need to have every faith in the boys who are going to take up the baton and run with it. “The amount of coaches we have now is credit to where people see us. You mightnt be as big a club as Tristar or Oxford, but were well up there. The respect that Top of the Hill Celtic has throughout the city is phenomenal.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Many businesses had to close for over three months as a result of coronavirus lockdown measures and are on the slow road to recovery. It is essential that they have the publicrsquos backing and support at this critical time, he said.ldquoIt is more important than ever that we support our local shops, cafes, bars and restaurants who collectively provide signicant employment, supporting many families.Cllr Andrews said local businesses and ious retail outlets ldquohave all gone the extra mile, working to implement guidelines and regulations designed to keep staff and customers safe at all times.He added: ldquoCrossgar is one particular part of the district where businesses have worked hard to ensure that people are safe, whether shopping or out for something to eat.ldquoThe village is home to a number of businesses, many of them family-owned, and it is important that we support them at this time, alongside other businesses across the district.

I would like them to get in touch.William said he has heard many reports about the disaster, including one relating to men from Portaferry who allegedly took a piano off the ship.The Georgetown Victory was a lsquoVictory Shiprsquo and was built in  at the Fortfield Shipyard at Bethlehem, Maryland, in the United States. She weighed in at , tons and was powered by two steam turbine enginesSays William: ldquoThe vessel was registered at Baltimore and when it left Fremantle for Glasgow with , Royal Navy men and marines due for demob. The crew mistook Strangford Lough for the River Clyde and the ship ran aground  yards off Killard Point, with her back breaking just forward of the bridge within a few hours of stranding.The Georgetown Victory had been converted from a cargo ship to a troopship able to transport up to , troops, with her cargo holds converted to bunk beds and hammocks stacked three high for hot bunking. In the cargo hold, mess halls and exercise areas were also added.Entering service near the end of the war, the Georgetown Victory and  other Victory troopships were given the task of transporting the troops home as part of Operation Magic Carpet. The vessel was operated by the American Export Lines.The ship departed Sydney with , troops steaming to Glasgow, stopping for water and fuel at Fremantle in Australia, Colombo in Sri Lanka and Aden in Yemen via the Suez Canal.On April , , just before midnight, the ship ran aground hard, at near top speed,  yards south of Killard Point.All of the servicemen aboard were rescued by leboats and breeches buoy to a tug started at about am.William said local people can remember some men wading ashore through heavy fuel oil from the stricken vessel to be cared for in nearby homes. The Cloughey and Newcastle leboats were also launched to help.Winter storms subsequently broke the wreck into two parts with all remaining portable gear not already taken by looters removed and the ship abandoned. The ship sections were salvaged in  and consigned to a breakerrsquos yard at Troon in Scotland.With his resplendent model now complete, William could be forgiven for sitting back on his laurels. But he has no intention of doing so.His next project will be making a model of the SS Bereby, a British merchant steamer built in  and owned by the Elder-Dempster Line.In , the vessel, which was carrying military stores and general cargo, was wrecked at Ringvad Point, near Gunnrsquos Island, while en route from Liverpool for Takoradi.Anyone who can assist William with information about the Georgetown Victory is asked to contact him on    or pop into his shop in Quay Street..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Call to be vigilant of seals  ","story":"VISITORS to Minerstown beach are being urged to tread carefully to protect seals and the arearsquos rich ecology.The appeal has been issued by Newry, Mourne and Down Council with officials particularly keen for boats and jet skis to stay away from key areas.Minerstown beach mdash popular with locals and visitors alike ndash is located within the Strangford and Lecale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and, along with neighbouring Tyrella, is part of the Murlough Special Area of Conservation and area of special scientic interest.Noted for its honeycomb worm reefs and harbour seals, Minerstown was particularly busy over recent months with many people furloughed from work as part of sweeping coronavirus lockdown measures visiting the beach where harbour seals which are protected by law.Then animals use the rocky outcrops just offshore as so-called haul-out and pupping sites with the peak pupping season running from the end of June to mid-July.Pups wean from their mothers approximately four weeks after birth and, for this reason, council officials are asking all watercraft owners to stay away from the haul-out areas until the end of October.Council staff say that with seals very sensitive to disturbance, it is important for people to leave them alone.They say the area between the beachrsquos high and low tide marks is an important site for sand flats with boulders containing the honeycomb worm reef, a Northern Ireland priority marine feature.The worm lives in tubes constructed from small pieces of sand and shell fragment cemented together forming reefs between pebbles and boulders in the middle shore.Council officials have explained that these delicate reefs are under threat from beachgoers walking in the area and from vehicles driving on the beach.ldquoUnderstanding the impact that our actions can have and following simple advice will protect the health of the wildle at Minerstown beach and protect it for future generations, said officials.Council chairwoman Laura Devlin said people were spoilt for choice when it came to local beaches and the waterways, with Minerstown one area which has seen an increase in use during the lockdown period.ldquoUnfortunately, an increase in the use of the beach and its surrounding waters can cause some problems for the local wildle, he said.ldquoThe council is asking beach goers to help it protect these beauty spots and the associated plants and animals by being mindful of how their actions can impact on the environment.Describing Minerstown as a ldquovery special place, she said it was important for local wildle.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoWhile we want our residents and visitors to enjoy the wonderful coast that our district has to offer, we also want to protect the habitats and species that make this place so special.ldquoPlease help us to protect this area by not taking vehicles onto the beach, stay away from the seal haul-out sites, always keep dogs under control and not allow them to chase birds.

I hope it is not obeying the tune of centralising services in Belfast. The local population deserves better.The former South Down MP said that as Northern Ireland was being reopened for business following a reduction in the number of Covid cases, ldquonormal services at the Downe hospital should resume.Lady Ritchie said anything which falls short of what was previously in the hospital would ldquorepresent a lack of faith and trust.She added: ldquoIt is important to remember that the real ing of the Downe Hospital with its suite of services and consultant physicians is directly linked to the AE provision.ldquoI have told both the health trustrsquos chief executive and health minister Robin Swann that anything that falls short of that requirement will be unacceptable and present our community with an intolerable position.Last week, health officials insisted that emergency services removed from the Downe as part of sweeping changes to help tackle the coronavirus pandemic will be reinstated. In addition, officials branded claims that the service will notand be replaced with a daily minor injuries service as ldquoinaccurate and misleading.The health trust says that it hopes to be in a position to confirm a date for theof AE services to the Downpatrick hospital by the end of July and that it remains totally committed to the Downe and its staff..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11587982.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

balances.\"Itrsquos ironic in some ways as when we were setting the budget for this financial year, some of our members wanted to use them and reduce the council tax levels.\"If we had done that, we would not have the buffer we have now.\"Itrsquos fortuitous that at that time I resisted, because I didnrsquot want to be in a position where we would not have finances available to respond to an emergency.\"I didnrsquot know that the coronavirus was going to hit us, but clearly it is having an effect.\"Wersquore not collecting business rates because wersquove given lots of businesses a payment holiday and wersquove also issued a considerable number of grants to businesses.\"We have paid out more than pound million in grants to businesses, which we will get back from Welsh Government, but therersquos no guarantee that all businesses will survive this.\"Wersquove also granted some rent relief for businesses who operate in council-owned premises for the first three months of this year, but who knows how long this pandemic will last \"Whilst Welsh Government has been able to provide some additional funding to local authorities, they have not got a bottomless pit of money either.\"Wersquore also paying out grants to charities and amateur sports clubs.\"\"Covid- is also having an effect on the council tax relief scheme,\" Cllr Moore said. \"The Government currently provides money to help people on low incomes claim a discount.\"The level of funding was set prior to this pandemic and the call on this funding is already increasing.\"This may not be sustainable and we may have to fund it ourselves.\"Applications for that fund have gone up immensely since the covid- situation.\"The Welsh Local Government Association believe there could be a spending increase of around pound million across Wales.\"For us that would equate to around pound,.\"At the moment, we can code spending against the pandemic and make claims to Welsh Government, as is every other local authority in Wales.\"But I emphasise, therersquos no guarantee that it is going to go on forever.\"The virus has also seen internal costs increase in certain areas.\"We needed to upgrade our IT facilities and expenditure on waste and recycling is also rising.\"Wersquove had to increase our investment in IT because a considerable number of staff are now working from home.\"Originally, we thought we were going to get all of that back, but now wersquove been told wersquore only going to get  per cent.\"Thatrsquos an expense we didnrsquot anticipate and itrsquos an expense we will have to absorb.\"The other added expenditure is due to people being out of work or furloughed.\"We have seen increases in applications for universal credit and thatrsquos going to have an impact on us in terms of the ability to collect rents and council tax.\"Exactly what that impact will be is unclear.ldquoDespite that, we are continuing to run services, as far as possible and we have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is having a massive impact on the council and the community.\"The exact extent of this impact is very dficult to estimate, but we will continue to support the community until it is defeated.\"He added: \"Everyone has a responsibility in keeping themselves and others safe until this pandemic is over.\"We do not know when that happen, but it certainly will not be in the short-term.\"Until then, take

Commenting proprietor Brian Jardine said: “It’s been a pleasure to welcome our customers back to the Pot Belly and to hear their positive feedback on our distancing and sanitising measures.“Part of our measures to keep everyone safe includes our two Gel-Gem sanitising units which are front of house and at the entry to our separate upstairs restaurant and a new external covered space, our Terraced Bar.”Gel-Gem came about at the beginning of lockdown when most businesses were closed said Raymond Fegan of construction and property maintenance company d Property Services. “The amount of enquiries we received from business of all sizes led us to develop a solution to help the fight against Covid-. “One of the early issues we identied and worked to overcome was the fragile nature of some sanitising systems being installed into entrances which took up considerable space and required regular monitoring and replacement. “We wanted to design a hands-free unit which was locally produced, high capacity and which was built to last.Studying the market we believe that in offering a sturdy, solid and safe stainless steel construction which includes a gel level monitoring window, we’ve done just that.“Gel-Gem comes in three dferent sanitising gel capacities - ,  and a mammoth  litre version for higher footfall areas.They can be used outside and we are also producing bespoke ‘all ability’ models and models which include provision to store contact tracing details, order to meet the specic needs of our clients. “Working to provide solutions for our clients across the local area, from small shops to the Bouled Outlet and from churches to sports clubs we have been delighted with the feedback we have been receiving not only for our Gel-Gem’s but also for our new hand-friendly sanitising gel which we can supply wholesale. “We are also delighted that every sale of a Gel-Gem unit supports the work of charity Kidney Care UK as they support local kidney patients which highlights the need to sanitise not only for ourselves but for those who are clinically vulnerable and at higher risk of infection.”Concluding Brian Jardine said: “At The Pot Belly we are very proud of our historic roots and excited about once again welcoming our customers back to enjoy our locally sourced menu’s while at the same time taking the steps to keep everyone safe.”If you want to find out more about the Gel-Gem units visit www.d-ps gel-gem or contact Raymond at gel-gem@d-ps\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"these are  most desirable dogs breeds do you have one them ","story":"These are the  most desirable dogs breeds -
