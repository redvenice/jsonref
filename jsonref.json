He added that fellow vegetarians would be ‘appalled’ to discover Quorn items being made alongside meat ones.Quorn Foods said more than 90 per cent of its products are made at manufacturing sites that are completely meat-free and that it followed stringent segregation procedures approved by the Vegetarian Society and the Vegan Society at its mixed production sites.It added that the production line at the undisclosed site in the North East is separate from those used for meat products and is always thoroughly cleaned down to prevent cross contamination.A spokesman confirmed that the firm had interviewed staff and reviewed CCTV footage but had been unable to trace the source of the chicken nugget.She added that its policies meant accidental cross-contamination would be impossible and conceded it was feasible it was ‘introduced deliberately by a factory employee’. Quorn has offered Mr Barlow compensation. "},{"url":null,"title":"Leopard decapitates baby snatching cot India","story":"Share this article That leopard was blamed for two other attacks in the area over a two-month period. Official estimates suggest there are between 12,000 and 14,000 leopards in India. There are no figures on the number of humans killed by leopards, but experts say there are hundreds of deaths each year.

The experiment was inspired by William Atkins, 14, who in February told the Daily Mail how he hatched a duckling in a £40 eBay incubator              Step one in this experiment was to buy the white duck eggs from a supermarket. After that, step two was to put them in an incubator and see which would hatch‘No one took much notice when I started incubating the egg. They were stunned that I hatched one though.’ As for names, William was considering Jeremy or Jemima and would choose when he knew what sex the duckling was.Which goes to the heart of how it is possible to buy fertile eggs – ones from a hen that has recently ‘enjoyed the company’ of a male bird – from a supermarket at all.First things first. For my experiment I bought a selection of eggs via the online delivery service Ocado and some from my local Co-op. I placed eight chicken, seven duck and 18 quail eggs into the incubator.I really didn’t rate my chances. The eggs had been stored, transported and kept refrigerated for some time and those from Ocado were particularly cold to the touch.Although an egg that is kept cold won’t automatically ‘die’, its chances of developing into a chick are substantially reduced. Nonetheless, into the incubator they went. As well as keeping them warm, it turns the eggs through the day, something that is essential for their development, and which birds do on the nest.I’ve kept chickens for 15 years and have hatched hen eggs in the past so I know it’s possible to check what’s going on inside the shell during the incubation period. The technique is called ‘candling’ and involves holding a bright light – a torch nowadays – directly underneath the end of the egg. In this way you can see the embryo starting to develop.         Martha woke her parents up at 6.30am on a Saturday to announce the arrival of the two quailBut, as I discovered, it’s easier to do this with some eggs than others. The quail eggs were thick-shelled and mottled and so small that I couldn’t make out anything at all.The chicken and duck eggs are more transparent. While it was obvious there was nothing going on in the chicken eggs, a week later I got the shock of my life when one of the Ocado eggs appeared to have something growing inside.Two quail chicks were to emerge from their eggs, tiny but perfectly formed. Martha’s first response was: ‘Can we keep them?’ Ten days later it was the duck’s turn. I found a bedraggled orange-billed bird staring out of the incubator.As with the quail, I transferred Lucky to a box with a heat lamp, food and water where it will stay for the next couple of months.The plan was that he or she will be rehomed with a friend who has a smallholding. But Lucky is adorable and my three daughters are already reading up on how to teach it to swim. It can only be a matter of time before the nagging begins to let Lucky join our family.So how did any of the eggs hatch at all? Egg producers work hard to ensure their farms are ladies-only because consumers may be put off by the thought of eating an egg that could potentially turn into a bird (although, before incubation, if you crack a fertilised egg into a frying pan, it’s impossible to tell).My duckling came from free range eggs produced by a company called Clarence Court. Their eggs come from a breed known as Gladys-May’s Braddock Whites and are sold by Ocado for £2.25 for six.A Clarence Court spokesman told me: ‘It is possible that our flocks occasionally and accidentally have a drake among the ducks. The separation of males from females relies wholly upon the skill of a very few qualified people – the sexer who examines the day-old duckling in the hatchery. Inevitably, the odd sexing error is made.’The other alternative is more exciting: That the ducks, which have access to the outdoors, have had a male visitor drop in.‘In this open-air environment, while it is infrequent, our ducks may attract the attention of wild drakes,’ the spokesman said.As for the quail, they came via Ocado at £2.89 a dozen from The Traditional Free Range Egg Company. Managing director Dan Wood said the fact that some of the eggs are fertile comes as little surprise.‘We as a farm concentrate on high welfare birds and it does mean that to reduce the stress of the flock we do sometimes put males in there with them,’ he said. ‘Quail are easily scared and if having a fellow wandering around helps keep them calm then that is a good thing.’The fact that none of my chicken eggs hatched does not surprise the British Egg Industry Council. ‘Males and females are separated at a day old,’ said a spokesman. ‘The birds are sexed by their distinct feather colour – yellow for males and brown for females.‘This ensures there is minimal likelihood of an error. Even if it were to, as the bird matures the sex would become clear quickly and the bird would be removed.’As for sexing my quail, Mr Wood says: ‘Good luck with that. The boys are slightly bigger. And, obviously, they won’t lay eggs. Any girls will start laying at six weeks.’And, who knows, if I’ve struck lucky and got a boy and girl, Martha and I could soon go in to full-scale quail production.Lucky, meanwhile, remains a gender-neutral enigma. At some point heshe will decide what sex shehe is and whether any passing members of the opposite sex will be welcome to come hither. Maybe then we can go into duck production too – this time, without having to put in an order with Ocado. "},{"url":null,"title":"The creator Downton makes movie Louise Brooks Hollywoods voracious maneater","story":"Share this article Aged nine, Brooks was molested by a house painter, an ordeal she blamed for her subsequent incapacity to ever feel real love and, instead, seek simple sexual pleasure.\u0027Nice, soft, easy men were never enough — there had to be an element of domination,\u0027 she said. \u0027The men who were the worst in bed were the men I liked the most.\u0027At 17, she became a chorus girl in a Broadway show notorious for nudity (publicity pictures of Brooks wearing only a carelessly flung scarf and a pair of sandals came back to haunt her when she was a film star).         Before Brooks she left for California, she had a passionate two-month affair with Charlie Chaplin (pictured)Many showgirls — including her — were glorified prostitutes, as she later admitted: \u0027There was a hand-picked group of beautiful girls who were invited to entertain the great men in finance and government.\u0027 The girls — screened by two film producers, Walter Wanger and Englishman Eddie Goulding — had to be \u0027fairly well bred and of absolute integrity\u0027, she said.\u0027At these parties we were not required, like common whores, to go to bed with any man who asked us, but if we did the profits were great. Money, jewels, mink coats, a film job — name it.\u0027One of these powerful men with film industry connections was Daily Express newspaper tycoon Lord Beaverbrook, who Brooks described as an \u0027ugly little grey man who went directly to his object with no finesse\u0027.She would later say that her \u0027sexual education had been conducted by the elite of Paris, London and New York\u0027. She got noticed by the right people.Brooks had no acting training but, aged 18, accepted a five-year contract with Paramount Studios.Before she left for California, she had a passionate two-month affair with Charlie Chaplin. The British star was twice her age, married and at the height of his fame. They moved into New York\u0027s Ambassador Hotel and spent much time with Peggy Fears, Brooks\u0027 17-year-old best friend, and Peggy\u0027s fiancé, financier Alfred Blumenthal.Brooks told friends the foursome once had a three-day champagne-fuelled orgy in Blumenthal\u0027s suite at the Ambassador, rarely bothering to get out of bed. Brooks later claimed she and Fears had been lesbian lovers and that Blumenthal had his butler secretly photograph them together.She caused further scandal by revealing that Chaplin was so scarred by his mother contracting syphilis that he never had sex without first painting his sexual organ with iodine to try to prevent any possible infection.Brooks hated Hollywood and the shameless sexism of the studio system which regularly tossed aside established female stars for younger, more malleable starlets.She treated Tinseltown with the insouciance she felt it deserved, never bothering to see her movies and, between takes while filming, burying her face in books by German philosopher Schopenhauer.When journalists came to interview her, sometimes she couldn\u0027t be bothered to get out of bed. One described her as \u0027exquisitely hard-boiled\u0027. Brooks told a biographer: \u0027I was always late. But too damn stunning for them to fire me.\u0027By the time she was 19, \u0027Brooksie\u0027, as she was known to friends, had married British-born playboy and director Eddie Sutherland. They rarely saw each other and neither bothered to be faithful.Their relationship was so fraught that when Hollywood was shaken by a small earthquake one night, Brooks thought the tremor was her husband making a move on her as she slept. She walloped him on the jaw, vowing that if he did it again, she\u0027d move into a hotel.When, a year into their marriage, Brooks returned to visit New York, she renewed her dalliance with Peggy Fears and Alfred Blumenthal. This time, the fourth member of their menage was Brooks\u0027s new lover, laundry millionaire George Preston Marshall.In 1928, less than two years after their wedding, she orced Sutherland after falling \u0027terribly in love\u0027 with Marshall. Sutherland claimed Brooks\u0027s insatiable sexual demands drove him to impotence and to seek psychiatric help.The actress, who resented being branded a nymphomaniac, said she had affairs simply to stave off boredom and \u0027pass the time waiting for the studio to call\u0027.Englishmen made the best lovers and Irishmen the worst, she said.Yet Brooks didn\u0027t say \u0027yes\u0027 to everyone. She turned down a director who pursued her for 15 years when \u0027hundreds of less attractive men succeeded in the hay\u0027 with her. The reason? He had bright pink rims around his blue eyes.She encouraged her reputation as a lesbian, saying women had pursued her since she was 15. This was simply another outlet for her endless sexual curiosity.She claimed she had one night of passion with Greta Garbo, her screen idol, when they were both in their early 20s. She described Garbo as masculine but a \u0027charming and tender lover\u0027.Always perverse, Brooks would later insist she was strictly heterosexual and that her Sapphic dalliances \u0027did nothing for me\u0027.Short-changed in Hollywood contract renegotiations and fed up with being cast as a \u0027pretty flibbertigibbet\u0027, Brooks flounced off to Berlin in 1928. There, she wallowed in the city\u0027s notorious debauchery and made some of the best films of her career.In Pandora\u0027s Box, she played Lulu, a sexually uninhibited showgirl whose thoughtless behaviour leads to prostitution and ruin. The role could have been written for her.She also made a film in Paris, where the director said she would have been the \u0027ultimate actress\u0027 were it not for her industrial alcohol consumption. She was almost continually drunk on cognac and champagne, he said, and had to be carried to the set each morning because she was asleep.She even had her make-up put on while she was sleeping and was woken \u0027only to shoot a scene, after which she returned to drinking\u0027.Her method of overcoming a hangover was to take three big swigs of gin.Returning broke to Hollywood in 1930, still just 24, she\u0027d left behind a host of enemies after haughtily refusing to dub dialogue on an earlier picture which had been shot as a silent.Columbia promised her a contract but its boss, Harry Cohn, made it clear he expected her to sleep with him, appearing shirtless at all their meetings.When she refused, he ensured her career sank in a succession of B-movie roles.Brooks sealed her fate when she rejected the female lead alongside James Cagney in the 1931 gangster film The Public Enemy because she wanted to visit a boyfriend in New York. It was one of the decade\u0027s most successful films.Her second marriage to industrial heir Deering Davis lasted five months. As with her first rich husband, Brooks was too apathetic towards money to seek a penny from him when they orced.As her career disintegrated, she continued to play the field in Hollywood. One of her numerous one-night stands was with Humphry Bogart. They were so different, she said: he could only love a woman he had known a long time while, for her, \u0027love was an adventure into the unknown\u0027.Brooksie left Hollywood for good in 1938. She ended up in New York where she got a job as a salesgirl in a department store.She still indulged her prodigious sexual appetites, sometimes joining the actress Tallulah Bankhead at sex parties to which Bankhead invited boat-loads of sailors.As she descended into alcoholism, Brooks became, at 36, a call-girl for three rich Manhattan clients for almost a decade.\u0027It was very discreet and, all things considered, infrequent,\u0027 said a friend. \u0027She did what she had to do.\u0027From 1960, she became a recluse, living in a spartan flat in the New York town of Rochester. She was \u0027rediscovered\u0027 by film buffs and had a second act as an acerbic writer, astutely critiquing actors and Hollywood. She converted to Catholicism and died of a heart attack, aged 78.Though recklessly blunt and free-spirited, even she could be embarrassed by her own outrageous behaviour. She wrote a tell-all autobiography, Naked On My Goat, but was so appalled that she threw it into an incinerator. "},{"url":null,"title":"Homebuyers deposits low 5 choice 405 different mortgages research reveals","story":"Share this article          It suggests the banks are desperate to attract first-time buyers with little money stashed away\u0027I certainly wouldn\u0027t recommend anyone buying a property unless they are planning to stay there for at least three years.\u0027However, if you\u0027re ready to settle down and the alternative is renting for years more while you build up a bigger deposit, then it may make sense to buy because every payment you make on your mortgage will reduce your debt.\u0027A splurge in risky lending helped cause the 2007-2008 crisis when £14.6billion was lent to customers who had deposits of less than 10 per cent. "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3866231.1555697679!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"luas closure would have lasted 2 years","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFollowing opposition to potential lengthy closures to the Luas Green line during the metro construction, the National Transport Authority last month announced it would shelve the southside section of the line. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillParts of the Luas Green line would have been closed for 2½ years if the National Transport Authority (NTA) had gone ahead with its plans for the complete link line.In March of last year, plans were published for the €3 billion rail line which would run from Swords to Sandyford, serving Dublin Airport and the city centre.However, following strenuous opposition to potential lengthy closures to the Green line during the metro construction, the NTA last month announced it would shelve the southside section of the line.Minister for Transport Shane Ross had said the proposals for link, “which would result in the closure of the Green line for up to four years”, would be “unacceptable”.However, a newly-published engineering report commissioned by the NTA shows that this four-year time frame applies to the cumulative total closures on the line during the period of construction.The longest section of the line to close – from the Ranelagh to Sandyford stop – would have been out of operation for up to nine months, while the longest duration of a closure would have been at a section between two adjacent stops – Ranelagh to Beechwood – which would have closed for up to 2½ years.During the last nine months of this 2½-year period, the closure would be extended from Ranelagh to Cowper, the stop after Beechwood on the line.The report, by London Bridge Associates Ltd, found that all the stoppages needed for the Green line “tie in” to the metro line, would cumulatively add up to 47 months, just under four years.Local zonesHowever, it said the full closure of the Luas for this duration would not be required as the works could be “staged within a local zone, or blockade, breaking the service locally and affecting two or three stations”.The main reason for the lengthy closure at Beechwood was the decision to continue tunnelling past Charlemont, and the construction of a tunnel “portal” where the line would emerge to the surface near the Beechwood stop.The NTA last month announced the metro would run from Swords to Charlemont, and that the rest of the line to Sandyford could be developed at “an appropriate point in the future” but would not be required “for some time – perhaps 20 years or so”.The engineering report said extension of the line to Sandyford at a later date could be done with cumulative closures of the Luas line of two years and nine months.This 14-week saving could be achieved because the tunnel boring machine would be left in the ground from the first phase, the entire works phase would be shorter and the commissioning and running of trials would take less time, the report said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3866044.1555701439!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin bus plans driving headlong into local election issue traffic","story":"Residents in Rathgar and Jobstown will both be affected by Bus Connects from losing direct connections to part of their properties.  \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Locals at a community meeting in Christ Church, Rathgar, in relation to the Bus Connects proposals. Photograph: James FordeSix bus routes – the 15, 15a, 15b, 14, 65 and the 65b – pass by Christ Church, the Presbyterian church in the heart of Rathgar village in Dublin 6, bringing commuters in and out of Dublin city centre.On Tuesday, 80 or so people attended a public meeting there, organised by local election candidate Deirdre Conroy to complain about the impact the BusConnects reforms will have on the village, and to push for a metro, instead.“They’ve already destroyed Georgian Dublin – do they want to do the same with Victorian Dublin? That’s the question we have to ask ourselves,” said Michael Daly from Rathgar in south Dublin.Daly and his wife have been living on Terenure Road East for the last 30 years. Their home, as well as their legal firm Cogan-Daly \u0026amp Company, is among the more than 1,400 properties in Dublin that stand to lose part of their front garden to accommodate bus and cycle lanes under the BusConnects plan.The 65b begins in Citywest, travelling through Jobstown, Killinarden, Knocklyon and Templeogue before going through Terenure Road East, Rathgar Road, Rathmines Road, and on to Aungier Street, before finishing at Poolbeg Street. The church is just metres from the pharmacy owned by Fine Gael TD Kate O’Connell, who wrote to constituents in recent months stating that the current BusConnects plan is “not the upgrade the residents of Dublin city need”.The Dublin Bay South TD said the National Transport Authority (NTA) had looked at potential changes to Dublin’s bus network “from a cold, technical perspective and have forgotten the human element”.NimbyismDaly dismisses claims that he and other affected Rathgar residents are motivated purely by nimbyism. “Really you can call it what you like. I see it as much as protecting the heritage for the future as a personal interest,” he said.He claims any disruption to his front garden would affect “clients as well as the family – some of our clients are quite elderly, car parking is off street and is very convenient for them”.“It is definitely going to hit our business and home.”BusConnects aims to overhaul the current bus system in the Dublin region by creating 230km of dedicated bus lanes and 200km of cycle tracks along 16 of the busiest corridors, along with a redesign of the network.The NTA has said the project will deliver journey time savings of up to 40-50 per cent on each corridor.“It’s all they’re focused on at the moment, especially around Rathgar and Terenure, people are very angry,” said Ms Conroy, a planning specialist and practising barrister.This is evident travelling along the 65b bus route, where “communities not corridors” signs are on lampposts, on gates and in shop windows.They become noticeable as you leave the city travelling on to Rathgar Road, Terenure Road East and Templeogue Road.However, once you get past Templeogue village and towards Knocklyon, the signage and public meeting posters about bus services largely disappear. While there are no proposed bus corridors for Knocklyon Avenue, Ballycullen Road, Killinarden, Jobstown or Citywest, the network redesign will affect all bus users.“For me personally, I struggle with public transport,” said Mary Doyle, from Jobstown. “As in, when a bus is very crowded I have to get off it, so I tend to travel at off-peak times if and where possible.“So for me personally it is a big deal getting on a bus, so with this new BusConnects it’ll mean I might have to get on two buses, so my stress levels will be even higher.”Others in the west Dublin suburb and neighbouring area of Killinarden admit they have heard little about BusConnects. Jobstown resident Jim Lovett, a regular bus user, favours it.“Everyone should be happy with improvement . . . If it improved the service and gave us a faster time period, why wouldn’t you? You would want to be foolish not to,” he said.Local solidarity councillor Brian Leech said there was “a lot of anger” at public meetings organised by his party alongside People Before Profit late last year in relation to the redesign. However, it is less of an issue in the run-up to the local elections in May.“A few people have mentioned it to me,” he said. “What’s really come on the doors is housing though, or case work. People saying they want a transfer or their daughter is homeless, that kind of thing, rather than BusConnects.“The environment itself is a big issue though, people talking about dumping and trees being cut down.”Cllr Leech thinks it is significant that Fine Gael is not represented at a local level either in Tallaght South or Tallaght Central.“Tallaght South has six councillors, Tallaght Central has six councillors. Not one of those is Fine Gael. They’re not represented at all up here and they would be the ones trying to push BusConnects through,” he adds.CriticismWhile BusConnects is part of the Government’s Project 2040, it has received criticism from a number of Fine Gael TDs including Catherine Byrne, Colm Brophy and Noel Rock, as well as local councillors and candidates.Dr Eoin O’Malley, an associate professor in political science at DCU, said political leaders at local level tended to “pander” to opposition to the BusConnects plan rather than question it.“They sort of follow what they think is public opinion. So when they hear a couple of people complaining about losing a bit of their garden or some issue like that, they tend to follow that rather than take a lead,” he said.“One of the things that’s quite surprising is how much the left has gone down the road of trying to reject what is essentially an effort to improve public transport and you think they would be in favour of that.”Some Fine Gael TDs warned last September that BusConnects had the potential to become the next water charges debacle.“I doubt it would, because it’s the sort of thing that affects too few people,” Dr O’Malley said. “The small number of people whose gardens are going to be lost, they’ll probably be well compensated, and while they might seek to raise objections, it’s not an issue that other people will care about. Because if my neighbour loses part of her garden because of BusConnects, that’s fine with me because I’ll benefit from an improved public transport system.“I’d be very surprised, because it just doesn’t affect enough people for it to become a water charges-type issue.”Aside from local activists and politicians, the Dublin Cycling Campaign has begun to hold its own public meetings in relation to BusConnects.The NTA has also been holding information sessions and has established community forums on each of the corridors, as well as offering one-to-one meetings with affected property owners.Kevin Baker, of the Dublin Cycling Campaign, said: “The project is huge, and trying to get your head around it can be quite difficult. We have been explaining to members in plain English how it will affect them, how it might make their commute easier or harder.” He added that the group “broadly support” BusConnects.“There are lots of things to fix, there’s still a lot of outstanding issues, but we’re early on in this project.“It’s a huge opportunity for cyclists, there’s 200 kilometres of cycle track in there. It could transform the city for cycling if we get it done right.”Commuter coalitionA separate group, Dublin Commuter Coalition, formed last January “to act as a much-needed voice for public transport users in the Greater Dublin region”.Kevin Carter, acting chair of the coalition, said the group began as a “reaction to misinformation” being circulated in relation to the BusConnects project.The NTA has previously said property owners who lose a portion of their garden to make way for the corridors will, on average, receive a compensation payment of €25,000.“Some people will get more, some people may get less,” said Hugh Creegan, NTA deputy chief executive.Commenting on the proposed compensation, Sharon Crosadell from Jobstown joked: “Do they want some of my garden?”However, as far as Michael Daly from Terenure Road East is concerned: “Some things you can’t compensate for.”The meeting in Christ Church on Tuesday is possibly the seventh or eighth local meeting he has attended in relation to BusConnects, he said. “I’ve been organising and involved since the start, so I intend seeing it until the end,” he added.While it’s not clear where this journey will end, next month’s local elections might help indicate the destination."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3866306.1555707068!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord healy rae s delaney devotion reaches fever pitch","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer FAI CEO John Delaney pictured this week after a meeting with the board of the FAI. Photograph: Colin KeeganCollinsThe bunting will be out next Saturday in Castleisland for the official opening of the much-anticipated Georgie O’Callaghan Park.But will John Delaney, former custodian of the FAI credit card, be conveyed triumphantly through the streets by a host of hosanna-singing Healy-Raes as he processes to the Kerry town’s new all-weather football pitch?If Michael Healy-Rae’s lavish praise for the embattled celebrity administrator at the Oireachtas sports committee two weeks ago is anything to go by, Delaney will be greeted by hordes of grateful locals and accorded the “mother of all welcomes” when he arrives in the Kingdom.The Kilgarvan TD’s passionate words of praise and support for Delaney, who, sadly, could not account for himself at the time because he was cruelly gagged by a self-imposed speaking ban, were as surprising as they were out of place at a meeting focused on serious questions to do with financial governance in the FAI.His stirring tribute might have left some listeners under the impression that the former CEO – this week he took himself up on his own offer to temporarily step aside from the newly created role of executive vice-president – goes around the country bestowing bounty out of his own pocket on deserving soccer clubs. In the same way, some listeners might mistakenly assume that public representatives who go out of their way to very publicly plant themselves up close and personal to a John DelaneyFAI grant must have had something to do with the awarding of it.“At the end of this month Mr Delaney is to come to Castleisland AFC to open the new Georgie O’Callaghan Park,” Deputy Healy-Rae told the committee. “Forty-five years they wanted for this park to be there, and what I’m reliably told is that if it wasn’t for John Delaney and the FAI, that park wouldn’t be being opened at the end of this month. You will be most welcome to Kerry. You will get what I would call ‘the mother of all welcomes’ when you come to Kerry, because your reputation and your respectability will precede you down the road before you land and we will be there to welcome you.”That was before the fascinating detail of Delaney’s FAI credit card was reported by journalist Mark Tighe.The astroturf pitch in question is in the grounds of Castleisland Community College and it was financed through a combination of local fundraisers, the Kerry Education and Training Board, a €59,000 grant from the Department of Sport and that welcome allocation of €100,000 from the FAI.The prime mover behind the project was Georgie O’Callaghan, a football man to his fingertips who founded Castleisland AFC in 1973. He worked tirelessly to promote soccer in the region and was very well regarded within the FAI at the highest levels. He died last year and will be hugely missed next Saturday afternoon when the ground named in his honour officially opens with a charity match between a team of “Irish legends”– including Paul McGrath, Kevin Sheedy, Ray Houghton, Ronnie Whelan, Mark Kinsella and Stephen Hunt – and a squad of local galácticos.Back at Leinster House, there was no appearance from either of the Healy-Raes for round two of the committee’s hearing into the FAI. This week’s main attraction was minister for sport Shane Ross, and there was no chance that either Michael or Danny would darken the threshold to say anything nice about Winston Churchtown.Some members were still rather puzzled about that strong defence of John Delaney which made big headlines nationally and in Kerry. Michael had waited for hours to be heard – as a non-committee member he was well down the speaking order – while his brother Danny waited around for a time at the back of the room. Was there a particular reason for such a grandstanding declaration of support for John Delaney?The politicians, it turns out, are taking a somewhat jaundiced view of the Delaney Appreciation Society’s unusual performance. Apparently the new local electoral area of Castleisland comes into play next month, with four seats up for grabs. Twenty-three-year-old Jackie Healy-Rae jnr is hoping to win a seat and join his cousins Maura and Johnny (who are both expected to storm home in their respective districts) on the county council. Jackie jnr knows the political ropes, having worked in Leinster House for the last five years as his father Michael’s parliamentary assistant, while Uncle Danny is also on hand with advice.No doubt local Fine Gael TD and junior sports minister Brendan Griffin will be at the opening of Georgie O’Callaghan Park. Will John Delaney, who is sure to be warmly welcomed, be there beside him? And who else, we wonder, might be close by, basking in Delaney’s reflected glory and that €100,000 grant?Speaker out of turnOn Wednesday morning, a large group of TDs and Senators went on a jaunt to Farmleigh House, the old Guinness mansion where the Government billets and entertains important guests. They went to meet Nancy Pelosi and members of the US Congress, who were midway through their trip to Ireland.The day begins with Mass and then a colour party and pipe band marches to the cemetery for the commemoration.Michael’s colleagues expressed surprise. But Moynihan pointed out, in compelling detail, that Nancy Pelosi’s roots have been traced back to north Cork.Strange as it may seem, but there was a pocket of Pelosis in the area many generations ago. In fact, there were two branches of the original Italian family. “The big mistake is that people think she is one of the Pelosis from Knocknanaugh, whereas in fact her people actually come from Meentifluck.”As the passengers in the minibus tried to get their heads around the news that Nancy is one of the Meentifluck Pelosis, Micheál looked a bit doubtful. He wasn’t sure if putting Ms Pelosi on the spot like that and asking her to speak at the Seán Moylan commemoration was a good idea.“She won’t be able to say no” was Moynihan’s confident reply.Then he told them he was only making it up and his relieved colleagues laughed and said they knew all along it was only a wind-up . . .Meanwhile, photographic evidence of Wednesday’s Bono-worshipping outrage in the Dáil chamber (which then spilled over into the Oireachtas restaurant, where the rock star lunched with Ms Pelosi as the politicians lay in wait for more photos for the election leaflets) have been surfacing in the social media feeds of TDs and Senators.Fianna Fáil Senator Terry Leyden, who pushed in beside the singer in the distinguished visitors’ gallery and took a selfie with him, is absolutely delighted with the outcome of his efforts. He has scooped the entire front page of the Democrat, a free newspaper serving “all the breaking news from Strokestown, Roscommon, Longford and Leitrim”.There he is, Senator Leyden, staring out at traumatised readers as they wonder who the lad in the sunglasses is beside Terry. The answer is in the headline: “Stuck In A Moment: When Terry Met Bono.” The “exclusive story” is on page four.Judge dread“An absolute fight to the death between Ross and McDowell” is how one Senator described the ongoing battle over the Judicial Appointments Bill between minister for transport Shane “Winston Churchtown” Ross and Senator Michael McDowell SC.The controversial Bill is Winston’s baby and he is determined to drive it through the Oireachtas before the Government falls and his legislation with it. Ross, who has no ministerial responsibility in this area, says there is a commitment in the Programme for Government to see the legislation passed, and he has been piling on the pressure in this regard, from the Taoiseach, through to minister for justice Charlie Flanagan and on to Fine Gael’s Seanad leader, Jerry Buttimer.But the McDowell filibuster is still going strong. The Seanad had talked about the Bill for exactly 88 hours and 25 minutes, but on Wednesday it looked like the game was up when the Government decided on a vote to guillotine the debate.Shane Ross was spotted buttering up a number of Independents before the vote, working hard to convince them to support the guillotine. There were also reports of him trying to win some Fianna Fáil Senators to his side. With Sinn Féin having struck a deal with Fine Gael on the issue, it looked like McDowell and his supporters were doomed.In dramatic fashion, the Cathaoirleach, Denis O’Donovan, gave his casting vote to the Government when the first electronic ballot was tied 25-25, but in a subsequent walkthrough vote the Government lost by 26-24. In the subsequent postmortem, everyone wondered who had deserted Winston Churchtown’s side. But, in fact, the first vote was wrongly reported by the Senators acting as tellers. They became confused when the Green Party’s Grace O’Sullivan said she mistakenly voted the wrong way and requested, as is her entitlement, to have her preference correctly registered. But they counted her as voting for and against.This meant that the chairman had to give a casting vote on an incorrect result. McDowell had won the initial ballot.But Winston will not be denied. A second guillotine attempt is on the cards."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3865921.1555684160!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"does the world have eyes tell the world we are humans not animals","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMembers of Libyan internationally recognised government forces evacuate a family in the al-Swani area of Tripoli. Photograph: Ahmed JadallahIt was night when the baby girl came into the world, in a big hall surrounded by hundreds of refugees and migrants cowering with fear, as fighting between rival Libyan militias echoed outside. Women pulled plastic bags on their hands to help her young Eritrean mother through the labour, as men prayed and panicked about whether aid would come.The baby was born last September, in Abu Salim detention centre in southwest Tripoli. Afterwards, she was locked up for months: one of thousands of refugees and migrants trapped in indefinite detention in a country without a stable government.Most of them, like the baby’s mother, tried to reach Italy in the last two years, but were returned to Libya as a direct result of European Union migration policy. Since 2017, the EU has been spending tens of millions of euro to train and equip the Libyan coastguard, which intercepts refugees and migrants trying to escape on flimsy boats across the Mediterranean.“I just want to get my baby in a perfect place, a good place, and live as a normal person,” the new mother told The , using the messaging service WhatsApp. She had escaped Eritrea with her husband, and said she was hoping to secure freedom from a country where human rights abuses are rampant. Like other detainees, she didn’t want to be named for security reasons.This month, fighting has raged again in Tripoli. On April 4th, eastern renegade Gen Khalifa Haftar ordered his self-styled Libyan National Army to advance on Libya’s capital. For a second time in eight months, Abu Salim was on the front lines. It was the third time for Qasr bin Ghashir detention centre, further south.Illegal migrationAbout 6,000 refugees and migrants are being held in centres run by Libya’s department for combatting illegal migration, in conditions the former UN human rights chief, Zeid Ra’ad al Hussein, has called “an outrage to to the conscience of humanity”.Some are willing to be repatriated to their home countries, but many come from places such as Eritrea, Somalia, and Darfur, in Sudan, where they fled war or dictatorships, and say they can’t go back. They have little chance at evacuation because of a scarcity of resettlement places. With the escalation in conflict, more than 3,000 are now in areas affected by fighting.Roughly 400 children are locked up in the Tripoli area, though the United Nations children’s agency (Unicef) says it’s impossible to get an exact number: newborn babies in Libyan detention don’t receive birth certificates, while boys over 14 are treated as men.“The living conditions in the detention centres are appalling and in no way suitable,” said Unicef Libya spokesperson Mostafa Omar, who also confirmed children in detention receive no education. “Unaccompanied and separated children are living together with adults in the same hangars, with hundreds of people squeezed into a room with poor ventilation, sub-standard food and services.”Until they were moved to a safer location this week, there were about 20 children under five years old in Abu Salim detention centre, several pregnant women and many more minors.For months, adult detainees have worried about them growing up damaged or traumatised because of what they have witnessed. “There are small children in this place who should get a basic education,” said one Eritrean who was held there. “They are learning bad things. They don’t even know alphabet letters.”He said he sometimes sees young children re-enacting abuse, hitting each other with sticks and saying “pay dollar you son of a bitch”.The past two weeks of fighting has added to the detainees’ fears.An Eritrean man in his 30s described the impact two nights of missiles landing close by had on the children he was looking out for. “I asked one of the kids ‘why don’t you go outside to play with your friends?’ She said to me: ‘I don’t want to die because I want to go to my dad. I miss him.’”Like many others, the six year old’s parents had made the journey separately, and the girl’s father is now in Germany.He is one of dozens of refugees and migrants, held in detention centres across Tripoli, whom The  has been in regular contact with for the past eight months. Most use hidden phones to communicate, and many have sent GPS locations, photographs, videos and audio recordings to support their stories. Details have been confirmed with international organisations on the ground.All that time, detainees have repeatedly said it’s inevitable that another conflict will break out in the city, while appealing for evacuation to a safer country. For some of the most traumatised, their prediction proving true has been too much.Torture and detentionOn April 11th, a week after Haftar’s forces began their assault on Tripoli, a 17 year old in Abu Salim died by suicide in a septic tank. Friends described Meron as a sweet person, who loved singing and dancing, but said he had become depressed and mentally stressed after torture by smugglers and months of detention. “We will die one by one, either by war, by suicide, by starvation,” said a man who knew him.For the past two weeks in Qasr bin Ghashir detention centre, 20km south of Abu Salim, about 44 children and 115 women have been among 728 detainees trapped on the front lines, in territory held by Haftar’s forces, surrounded by gunfire and missiles. “About the war, yes, it is still going on and we can hear it,” said a refugee. “It is very much close to us. Heavy weapons fired just outside of our fence.”A week into the clashes, Libyan authorities and the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) made a failed attempt to move the group out of Tripoli. Detainees refused to go, saying they didn’t want to be taken from the city to a place where services are limited and there is little access to international organisations.The suggested location was Daher al-Jabal detention centre in Zintan, 180km southwest of Tripoli. A child died there late last year from appendicitis, because of a lack of emergency medical care, according to Unicef. He was one of at least 10 detainees who perished after being relocated during conflict last year.“Does the world have eyes? Tell the world we are humans, not animals. We need help,” said an Eritrean refugee in Daher al-Jabal detention centre, when asked what the conditions are like.Military baseTeenagers trapped in Tripoli’s detention centres in the latest outbreak of fighting face the additional risk of being forced to assist fighters. Two detainees in Tajoura detention centre, south Tripoli, said a 14-year-old boy from Darfur, Sudan, was among dozens of people taken from locked halls in the past few weeks to work on a nearby military base, for a militia fighting in support of the UN-backed Tripoli government.Others previously held in Ain Zara, southeast Tripoli, said underage boys had been made lift and load weapons there.When asked about the danger for children trapped in Libya’s migrant detention centres, a spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs said it was monitoring “the extremely worrying situation around Tripoli”.“Both Ireland and the EU provide financial support to UN agencies, which have a presence on the ground, and are providing assistance to refugees and migrants. UNHCR has been able to move some refugees and migrants to areas of safety, but they are working in very difficult conditions,” he said.In Qasr bin Ghashir, refugees said things were at crisis point. “The problem we face with women and children is serious. Mothers can’t breastfeed their infants because their breast doesn’t have enough milk,” said an Eritrean. “The reason is a lack of drinking water and enough food to do so.Read more on how Europe attempts to deal with the migrant crisis"},{"url":null,"title":"notre dame ablaze pictures","story":"A huge fire has consumed Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris.Officials in Paris said the fire, which started around 7pm local time, could be linked to renovation works being carried out at the cathedral. French media reports, citing police sources, added that the fire started by accident. Comment: There is hope to be found in the climate protesters\u0026#39 youthful desire to change the futureComment: A more competent US President would never have blundered into this messOverwhelming majority back jail for social media bosses who fail to protect children, poll findsJean-Claude Juncker: Economic turmoil after Brexit will be UK\u0026#39s faultSocial media bosses should be prosecuted for breaching child safety, public demandsDiane Abbott apologises after drinking alcohol on public transportLyra McKee murder: Police release CCTV of suspect Boy, six, injured after group of men open fire on a house UK weather: Mercury soars as Britain braced for record-breaking Easter SundaySuperdry founder only reads emails if they are printed out for him by his staffComment: After my own dark night, the importance of love, renewal and redemption have never been clearerTory Leavers most in danger of losing seats as MPs endure Easter \u0026#39recess from hell\u0026#39 at hands of voters over Brexit Comment: Tories and Labour in jeopardy as new voting \u0026#39tribes\u0026#39 seek alternatives to the status quoTheresa May \u0026#39boxed in\u0026#39 as voters punish the Tories for Brexit delayFarming charity criticised for hosting vegan festival with \u0026#39aggressive anti-farming agenda\u0026#39Gardeners persist in using peat, despite environmental pleasJohn Bercow must let Donald Trump address Parliament to bolster special relationship, ministers sayTheresa May faces threat of new confidence vote after European elections amid Brexit backlashExtinction Rebellion protest: Police finally \u2028get organised as pink boat sails for eco warriorsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/royal-family/2018/12/18/TELEMMGLPICT000183496098_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqejMVNjZ2Bv6EA7I5e4mELy5twttbUiN55rbZOKJP4mY.jpeg?imw","title":"easter inspiring see people can find light even midst terrible","story":"The Prince of Wales and the Duke of Sussex (both centre front) pose for a photograph following a discussion about violent youth crime at a forum held at Clarence House in LondonEaster and Christmas are the two most important celebrations in the Christian calendar.

If someone emails him, he will not read it unless a member of staff prints it out.“I watch people everywhere, all looking at their iPhones, and I think I’m lucky that I can take a step back and watch and think without this constant interference that everyone else has.“My brain is probably freer to comprehend what is actually happening around me and make better decisions because it’s not clogged with rubbish,” he told Tatler magazine.“Picking up a phone takes a second, whereas writing an email takes 10 minutes, which is a wasted nine-and-a-half minutes.”Dunkerton retired from Superdry a year ago but returned earlier this month following a boardroom battle. He started out with a market stall in Cheltenham in 1985, setting up the Japanese-inspired Superdry in the 1990s.Dunkerton netted £440 million from the sale of his fashion labelIn the magazine interview he appears alongside his wife, Jade Holland Cooper, who runs her own fashion company producing country clothes suitable for the races and horse trials.Ms Holland Cooper, 32, met Dunkerton, 54, met in the bar of one of his hotels and married last summer with a reception featuring a DJ set from Idris Elba. Along with their invitations, guests received ‘mood boards’ illustrating the ‘boho glamour’ theme so that they could select their outfits accordingly.Ms Holland Cooper said she was drawn to Mr Dunkerton because they share a work ethic and a “drive to conquer”. She explained: “If Julian put his feet up he would die. I’m the same… It can be very wearing but thank God we are exactly the same. I can’t imagine being any other way.”She made the news last year when she gave an interview detailing how she built her business with no outside investment, only for her aunt to post a public message that read: “Some of us know the truth about you, your family and your money. Please don’t take us all for fools.”The full feature is in the June issue of Tatler, available on digital download and newsstands from April 25It emerged that her two aunts were unhappy that they had received £50,000 from their father’s will while her uncle was given £100,000 and her father inherited the family’s 415-acre farm and a Grade I-listed house.A spokesman for Ms Holland Cooper said: “As far as the story Jade’s aunts have put out, Jade has nothing to say. She has maintained a dignified silence, and that’s her position.”The full feature is in the June issue of Tatler, available on digital download and newsstands from April 25Please review our commenting policyComment: There is hope to be found in the climate protesters\u0026#39 youthful desire to change the futureComment: A more competent US President would never have blundered into this messOverwhelming majority back jail for social media bosses who fail to protect children, poll findsJean-Claude Juncker: Economic turmoil after Brexit will be UK\u0026#39s faultSocial media bosses should be prosecuted for breaching child safety, public demandsDiane Abbott apologises after drinking alcohol on public transportLyra McKee murder: Police release CCTV of suspect Boy, six, injured after group of men open fire on a house UK weather: Mercury soars as Britain braced for record-breaking Easter SundayComment: After my own dark night, the importance of love, renewal and redemption have never been clearerTory Leavers most in danger of losing seats as MPs endure Easter \u0026#39recess from hell\u0026#39 at hands of voters over Brexit Comment: Tories and Labour in jeopardy as new voting \u0026#39tribes\u0026#39 seek alternatives to the status quoTheresa May \u0026#39boxed in\u0026#39 as voters punish the Tories for Brexit delayFarming charity criticised for hosting vegan festival with \u0026#39aggressive anti-farming agenda\u0026#39Gardeners persist in using peat, despite environmental pleasJohn Bercow must let Donald Trump address Parliament to bolster special relationship, ministers sayTheresa May faces threat of new confidence vote after European elections amid Brexit backlashExtinction Rebellion protest: Police finally \u2028get organised as pink boat sails for eco warriorsDemocrats split on impeachment as controversy rages over Mueller reportWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/04/19/11/Extinction-Rebellion-emma-thompson-3.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-3905566  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= 19 April 2019  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/04/19/11/Extinction-Rebellion-emma-thompson-3.jpg","title":"accountancy firms big four kpmg pwc competition watchdog","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

This cannot be allowed to continue.”Under the CMA’s proposals, competition would be encouraged by the introduction of\u0026nbspmandatory joint audits, which would force the big four to work with smaller partners when checking accounts.Big Four accountancy firms should be broken up, say MPsKPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY currently sign off the accounts of\u0026nbsp97 per cent\u0026nbspof FTSE 350 companies and 99 per cent\u0026nbspof FTSE 100 companies.Their dominance has led to allegations of a “cosy” relationship with some of the firms that they audit. Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee chair Rachel Reeves has accused the big four of using mundane audit work as a route to “milk the cash cow of consultancy business”.The CMA called for a regulator to hold company “audit committees more vigorously to account”, including public reprimands for those that fall short of adequate scrutiny from auditors.Lord Tyrie added: “Conflicts of interest cannot be allowed to persist nor can the UK afford to rely on only four firms to audit Britain’s biggest companies any longer.”Business groups criticised the CMA’s proposals, with the Confederation of British Industry warning that they risk damaging Britain’s reputation as a leader in the accountancy business.“Mandating joint audits will add cost and complexity for business with no guarantee of better outcomes,” said John Allan, the CBI president.“Operational splits could restrict access to the skills required to carry out complex audits.”Dr Ian Peters, chief executive of the chartered institute of internal auditors, added: “We welcome the proposal to separate external audit from non-audit services to raise standards, eliminate potential conflicts of interest and ensure the independence of external auditors to reduce the risk of another Carillion-style collapse.”Competition and Markets AuthorityOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Numerous summary articles and ruinous posts are littered across the internet, and you might even come into contact with one without trying.That means that any fans should be advised to take proactive measures if they don\u0027t want to find out what happens in the film before it comes out at the end of the month.Thankfully there are a whole host of tools that can make it easier to ignore anyone trying to ruin 2019\u0027s biggest film for you.Created with Sketch. Show all 27Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.With the potential to be the most frustrating of platforms – links can fly into your feed without you realising – it\u0027s helpful that Twitter offers built-in tools to make it easy to mute just about whatever you like.Every Avengers character ranked from worst to bestHead into the settings on desktop or mobile and find the Muted Words option. You can then add all the words you want, and they\u0027ll be banned from showing up on your Twitter, even if you then move to other devices.Last year, Facebook finally added the option to mute keywords, something that previously could only be done with fiddly extensions and a lot of work. The relatively new feature, called Keyword Snooze, is made for exactly this kind of situation.The unfortunate thing is that you\u0027ll have to wait until you see an Avengers: Endgame post before you can actually mute them, by which point you might already have fallen victim to the spoilers. If you do see something that includes keywords that you want to mute, you can click the option in the corner of the post, which will give you the option to snooze a selection of the words included in there for 30 days.Instagram doesn\u0027t let you mute specific words in your feed. Helpfully it\u0027s probably not all that likely that anyone will actually ruin a film through their posts, though of course it\u0027s always possible someone will post the leaked footage or some other annoying spoiler.It does however let you mute topics in the Explore tab, which might be useful, since they come from strangers and are so more likely to include surprises in them. Do that by long pressing on any of the topics that pop up there, which should let you mute that channel.Remember, too, that Instagram does have the option to mute\u0026nbsppeople, as well as topics. So if there\u0027s someone you\u0027re worried about spoiling it for you, you can head to their profile and select the mute option – either pre-emptively or in anger.It is possible to pick the nuclear option and, Thanos-like, remove the half of the internet that is threatening you with spoilers.\u0026nbspSearching through the extensions available for your browser should give you a whole host of options that will let you mute certain keywords, in a variety of different ways.Always be vigilant about doing so. First, you might miss important information if your keywords are chosen too widely: you\u0027re probably safe muting Avengers, but Endgame might get in the way a little more. And secondly, these extensions work by reading through the pages you\u0027re browsing on, so make sure they\u0027re made by someone dependable.Keyword muting and vigilance will only get you so far: the fact is, there are some people out there desperate to share spoilers, whatever the cost. And if they\u0026nbspare sufficiently clever about it, they are always going to be able to get around keyword filters, by using unexpected or very generic wording.The only foolproof way to avoid spoilers entirely is to leave the internet. But even then you are faced with the possibility that someone might mention something in person, or that you\u0027ll accidentally stumble into an annoying billboard or magazine cover...As such, avoiding spoilers entirely and without any risk at all might be impossible. It is probably best just to take the advice above and adopt a mindful approach towards anyone who does happen tor ruin everything for you.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s why they need such fancy salary and bonus packages.\u0026nbspBucher singularly failed to live up to the hype in almost every respect bar one: keeping Ashley at bay.\u0026nbspThere are still\u0026nbspplenty who will thank him for that but\u0026nbspit\u0027s probably not enough to save his retailing rep, at least in this country.\u0026nbspDebehams said that a search is now underway for his successor, to which the obvious reaction is to say, “good luck with that”.\u0026nbspHaving been through an administration process, the retailer is now owned by its lenders. In the short term\u0026nbspit still needs restructuring. That inevitably means store closures and job losses. In the longer term, they’ll want to sell it to someone. Lenders are in the business of lending to businesses, not owning them.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee chair Rachel Reeves has accused the big four of using mundane audit work as a route to “milk the cash cow of consultancy business”.The CMA called for a regulator to hold company “audit committees more vigorously to account”, including public reprimands for those that fall short of adequate scrutiny from auditors.Lord Tyrie added: “Conflicts of interest cannot be allowed to persist nor can the UK afford to rely on only four firms to audit Britain’s biggest companies any longer.”Business groups criticised the CMA’s proposals, with the Confederation of British Industry warning that they risk damaging Britain’s reputation as a leader in the accountancy business.“Mandating joint audits will add cost and complexity for business with no guarantee of better outcomes,” said John Allan, the CBI president.“Operational splits could restrict access to the skills required to carry out complex audits.”Dr Ian Peters, chief executive of the chartered institute of internal auditors, added: “We welcome the proposal to separate external audit from non-audit services to raise standards, eliminate potential conflicts of interest and ensure the independence of external auditors to reduce the risk of another Carillion-style collapse.”Competition and Markets AuthorityOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The average UK home cost £226,000 during the month, £1,000 more than a year ago but the slowest annual rise since September 2012.Despite declining prices in the capital, it remains the most expensive place in the country to buy a home with an average of £460,000, followed by the South East and the east of England, at £316,000 and £290,000 respectively.Across England, house prices in the North West grew fastest at 4 per cent followed by the West Midlands which saw a 2.9 per cent annual increase, according to the figures released jointly by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Land Registry.Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: “Growth in Wales and the west of England was offset by a sustained fall in London and falling prices in the South East for the first time since 2011.”London again out of step with the nation as its house prices tumbleAverage prices in Wales jumped 4.1 per cent over the twelve months to reach £160,000 while in Northern Ireland, average increased even faster with a 5.5 per cent rise to £137,000. Scotland registered a decline of 0.2 per cent to reach £146,000 on average.The lowest average house prices are in the North East at £125,000 and is the only English region where house prices remain below their peak reached before the financial crisis.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY ITEM Club said the figures “very much fuel the overall impression that the housing market is being hampered as buyer caution amid already challenging conditions is being reinforced by recent heightened Brexit and economic uncertainties.\u0026nbsp“Although there are significant variations across regions with the overall picture being dragged down by the weakness in London and the South East“.He predicted a 1 per cent rise for the coming year but said he “would not be at all surprised” if they stagnate.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Scotland Yard did not rule out the existence of other bombs. “The packages – all A4-sized white postal bags containing yellow Jiffy bags - have been assessed by specialist officers to be small improvised explosive devices,” a spokesperson said. “These devices, at this early stage of the investigation, appear capable of igniting an initially small fire when opened. “The Met Police Counter Terrorism Command is treating the incidents as a linked series and is keeping an open mind regarding motives.”Large waves crash over the sea walls at Cleveleys near Blackpool, as the remains of Storm Freya, which has battered Britain with gales, heavy rain and snow causes widespread travel disruptionChristopher Hepworth with partner Tanisha Prince (right) on their way to victory in the annual UK Wife Carrying Race at The Nower in Dorking, SurreyPolice officers search near the scene on St Neot\u0027s Road in Harold Hill, east London following the fatal stabbing of a 17-year-old girl on Friday night.

The proportion of people in work is at its highest since comparable records began in 1971, boosted by an increasing number of women entering the labour market.A significant proportion of consumer spending growth has also been fuelled by cheap credit with growth in unsecured debt outpacing wage increases. New Bank of England data suggests borrowers will find it more difficult to access\u0026nbspnew debt in the coming months.Lenders said they had tightened their credit scoring criteria for loan applications in the first three months of 2019, with the proportion of loans being approved also falling.Interest-free periods on new credit card lending shortened significantly in the first quarter and further reductions are expected in the next three months.Ed Monk, associate director for personal investing at Fidelity International, said the latest numbers were good news.“Even accounting for the Beast from the East, which kept shoppers at home a year ago, today’s retail sales data show households willing to spend more,” he said.“That reflects a slow recovery from a decade-long wage squeeze and, perhaps, a willingness to look through the apparently never-ending uncertainty that is Brexit.“Higher retail sales contribute to a picture of the economy beginning to show more positive signs. Growth is low, but falls in inflation appear over and real wages are rising, suggesting a little more steam in the economy.”Consumer behaviour is in stark contrast to that of businesses which are cutting investment as the terms of Britain’s departure from the EU remain unclear.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And Sats for Year 6 pupils are here to stay.Labour will abolish Sats exams in primary schools, Jeremy Corbyn saysIn fact, children in primary schools will also face a times-tables check next year on top of the already unpopular phonics tests under the government’s assessment system.So why do the controversial primary school tests still exist? Nick Gibb, the schools minister, argues that the exams raise standards and improve children’s reading and maths before secondary school.Ministers say that pressure shouldn\u0027t be\u0026nbspplaced on\u0026nbspchildren\u0026nbspas the exams are there only\u0026nbspto measure schools.Created with Sketch.Back to school: children attend class around the world Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A student stands in the ruins of one of his former classroomsUnicefClarke for UNSitan Doumbia, 5, plays with her friends at the Early Childhood Development Center in Mali330 Democratic Republic of the CongoTeacher Edouard Kabukapua, 28, accompanies his students as they sing on their way to their class in a temporary tent school in Mulombela village, KasaÃ¯ region, Democratic Republic of the Congo.

There’s a lot we don’t know about the origins of Easter, and we’re learning more every day.”It is not clear how, when or why the rabbit became linked to the Easter festival, although it could be due to the spread of Christian religious beliefs.The folkloric figure of the Easter Bunny bringing eggs for children is closely linked to German traditions.Additional reporting by PAOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s the very last thing I expected.“The immigration officer was aggressive. He was pointing out problems but not why things were problems. They were saying that just because she was born in the UK it didn’t mean she had a right to stay but would give no explanation as to why, just, ‘sort it out’.\u0026nbspIt’s the public services restriction that worries me, as babies should make fairly regular visits to the\u0026nbspNHS. In a sense that’s denying the child healthcare.”Dr\u0026nbspKriel\u0026nbspsaid that while he “loved” being in the UK, the environment and attitude had “changed with regard to immigrants”, to the point where his\u0026nbspfiancee had begun to question whether the family should stay in Britain.“If I, who am lucky enough to have worked for the BBC and worked in parliament, am getting this level of aggression, what must many other immigrants in this country be suffering from?” he added.Kriel was told his 15-week old baby Viola did not have the right to reside in the countryKriel and his fiancee are both British residents but were told their UK-born daughter had no right to live in the UKHuman rights lawyer\u0026nbspShoaib\u0026nbspKhan questioned the legitimacy of the decision, saying it was “not just shameful and unacceptable but potentially unlawful”.“A child born to a person who has indefinite leave to remain in the UK is a British citizen by birth. If, as seems to be the case, the father had indefinite leave to remain when the child was born, this child is British,” he said.\u0026nbsp“The fact that she was travelling on a US passport does not affect her rights as a British national. The mother is an EEA national residing in the UK, so the child will likely have a right to reside in the UK on that basis too.”He added that the case was “one of hundreds of similarly absurd and inhumane decisions\u0026nbsptaken by the Home Office daily”.“While inhumane and appalling, the way this three-month-old baby has been treated is par for the course for the Home Office. This is no accident and no mistake. This is the hostile environment that Theresa May created and her successors have continued,” he added.“The Home Office must apologise to the family immediately and finally put an end to the open hostility towards any inidual who dares to be in this country without a British passport.”The government has been approached for comment.Asylum and ImmigrationOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The average UK home cost £226,000 during the month, £1,000 more than a year ago but the slowest annual rise since September 2012.Despite declining prices in the capital, it remains the most expensive place in the country to buy a home with an average of £460,000, followed by the South East and the east of England, at £316,000 and £290,000 respectively.Across England, house prices in the North West grew fastest at 4 per cent followed by the West Midlands which saw a 2.9 per cent annual increase, according to the figures released jointly by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Land Registry.Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: “Growth in Wales and the west of England was offset by a sustained fall in London and falling prices in the South East for the first time since 2011.”London again out of step with the nation as its house prices tumbleAverage prices in Wales jumped 4.1 per cent over the twelve months to reach £160,000 while in Northern Ireland, average increased even faster with a 5.5 per cent rise to £137,000. Scotland registered a decline of 0.2 per cent to reach £146,000 on average.The lowest average house prices are in the North East at £125,000 and is the only English region where house prices remain below their peak reached before the financial crisis.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY ITEM Club said the figures “very much fuel the overall impression that the housing market is being hampered as buyer caution amid already challenging conditions is being reinforced by recent heightened Brexit and economic uncertainties.\u0026nbsp“Although there are significant variations across regions with the overall picture being dragged down by the weakness in London and the South East“.He predicted a 1 per cent rise for the coming year but said he “would not be at all surprised” if they stagnate.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The proportion of people in work is at its highest since comparable records began in 1971, boosted by an increasing number of women entering the labour market.A significant proportion of consumer spending growth has also been fuelled by cheap credit with growth in unsecured debt outpacing wage increases. New Bank of England data suggests borrowers will find it more difficult to access\u0026nbspnew debt in the coming months.Lenders said they had tightened their credit scoring criteria for loan applications in the first three months of 2019, with the proportion of loans being approved also falling.Interest-free periods on new credit card lending shortened significantly in the first quarter and further reductions are expected in the next three months.Ed Monk, associate director for personal investing at Fidelity International, said the latest numbers were good news.“Even accounting for the Beast from the East, which kept shoppers at home a year ago, today’s retail sales data show households willing to spend more,” he said.“That reflects a slow recovery from a decade-long wage squeeze and, perhaps, a willingness to look through the apparently never-ending uncertainty that is Brexit.“Higher retail sales contribute to a picture of the economy beginning to show more positive signs. Growth is low, but falls in inflation appear over and real wages are rising, suggesting a little more steam in the economy.”Consumer behaviour is in stark contrast to that of businesses which are cutting investment as the terms of Britain’s departure from the EU remain unclear.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And by slashing the work allowances and taper rates, people can keep more of what they earn.Andyou are disabled, further financial support is here. From today the maximum Access to Work grant – which pays for equipment or for interpreters to help disabled people to do their jobs – is worth nearly £,, an increase by £, a year.We are also increasing many of our benefits for pensioners, mums, carers and disabled people by . per cent and the State Pension by . per cent.I know The Sun has campaigned vigorously for Universal Credit to be fairer and more flexible, which is why since becoming the Secretary of State I have taken steps to do just that.And the changes we have made mean that every child born before April  will be supported by Universal Credit.I’ve also committed to touring the country to investigate how Universal Credit is working in dferent communities. It’s taken me across Britain from Warrington to Harlow and Cardf to Stoke.And the results of that review are already taking shape.For example, I’ve said that by the summer a new specialist domestic abuse worker will be in place in every Jobcentre, all part of our commitment to ensuring the welfare system works for women.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. Along with Women’s Minister Penny Mordaunt we are absolutely determined that women get all the support they need.That’s also why I’ve set out steps to ensure Universal Credit payments will go directly to a households main carer – often, but not always, the woman of the household.With the employment rate is at a record high and . million people taking home a wage, I know Sun readers are working hard to improve their lives and you can be assured that we too are working hard to help you on every step of the way.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We demand the Government makes the following changes to help hard-working famililes before its too late. We want you to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Things have not improved for the former housekeeper, who has been forced to borrow money to pay for furniture and did not have enough cash to celebrate her eight-year-old son’s birthday.“I got my son a little truck for his birthday but that was it, she said. “He was happy to get something as I’ve had to sell the toys he has just to charge the electric and the gas,”Charlotte charges men £ for sex and other favours - bringing in around £ every week. She sees one client whenever she can as she appreciates the “regular” work.In fact, the mum feels so let down by the Government she claims her clients are the only people she can trust.Charlotte, who lives on an estate, had to give up her job when she had her son because she couldnt afford childcare.She moved onto Universal Credit in January  but fell £ behind on her rent while waiting for her first payment and was threatened with eviction.She says: “If I didn’t have to wait so long for my first payment, I would have been OK.“Something always goes wrong - five weeks is too much.

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord.

You can find your nearest one on the Trussell Trust website.Women like Charlotte are often too ashamed to tell their families that they have resorted to prostitution to survive.“I can’t talk to anyone. It’s the guilt mainly. My family don’t know - they wouldn’t be happy. They’d be angry, furious, upset. They would be so judgemental.My son still doesn’t know about what I do for money either.”“And I’m sure there are other women out there in worse situations than me.”Charlotte is struggling with her mental health at the moment and is having therapy for a second time – but she hasn’t admitted what she “does on the side” as she doesn’t think her counsellor would understand.She is considering going to college to do a course as she wants to be an author, but feels things are stacked against her.“I know I’ve got lots to work on, but it’s too much sometimes,” she says.“I keep thinking, why is this happening “They say Universal Credit is working, but who is that for Why are people getting poorer but the government don’t care  Evensomething changes, I can’t erase what I’ve done now.Officials say that advances are available from day one on Universal Credit - and that Brits can get up to  per cent of their cash upfrontthey need it.But delays getting the welfare payments are causing women to rack up debt and some are selling their bodies while they wait for help, charities have said.We know from the stories of women that have contacted us that the delays in processing universal credit and the drop in benefits is financially crippling.It is essential that the vulnerable are protected and their welfare is paramount.”A representative for Beyond The Streets, which works to help women who have suffered sexual exploitation, said: We welcome the investigation in to failures in universal credit and the increase in survival sex.In October, MP Frank Field shocked the House of Commons when he revealed women in his Birkenhead constituency were selling themselves for sex for the first time as a result of hardship caused by the introduction of Universal Credit.After The Sun shared Charlottes story with Mr Field, he said he would write to Department for Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd about her case.Here we have yet another awful example of Universal Credit pushing vulnerable mothers, who are trying to protect their children, to rock bottom and beyond, he told The Sun.The DWP insists safeguards are in place to make sure all repayments are affordable and sustainable.It also aims to give people help to find routes out of the sex industry, with personalised work coaches in place to help people looking for alternative roles.The department insists it has responded quickly to feedback on Universal Credit by continuing to pay Housing Benefit for two weeks after people move on to the new system. Other legacy benefits will follow suit shortly.Ms Rudd has responded to the Suns campaign, saying shes listening to Sun readers as she tries to improve Universal Credit for working families.A DWP spokeswoman told The Sun: We’re committed to getting help to people when they need it most, and advance payments and budgeting support are available.Work coaches are trained to spot vulnerable people, including those working in the sex industry, and offer appropriate support.”*Charlottes name has been changed.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Any blaze has destructive power. Yet the Notre Dame disaster leaves a greater sense of obliteration. Just look at the crowds of Parisians, many of them youngsters, who wept and clutched one another and sang mournful hymns as they watched Monday’s devastation.Their grief, and the awed horror of countless millions around the world who saw events unfold on TV, was not the normal reaction of onlookers rubber-necking at an accident. The loss of that old building left a deeper anguish. Why James Mates, reporting for ITV’s News At Ten that night, proved his value when he reached for an explanation.“Our time here is brief,” said Mates. “These structures — the greatest creations of mankind — are supposed to be permanent. Few can have imagined seeing one destroyed before our eyes.”These were good words. Notre Dame dates to the th and th centuries. To stand beside such an edice reminds us of our human smallness.The great cathedrals of Western Europe took centuries to build. Beside such projects, the longest human le feels butterfly-short. You run a hand over the old stones of a place like Notre Dame and you are struck by a sense of your own impermanence.You don’t have to be churchy to feel this way. There are other forces at work in our Notre Dame agony, emotions that a modern broadcaster might hesitate to mention. Notre Dame contained more than altars and crosses and pews.Its walls sheltered things far greater than the priceless artworks which burned. Notre Dame was a repository of the concepts of civilisation and nationhood and beauty and Christianity.It may be politically incorrect to say so but Monday’s fire, to many of us, felt like a metaphor for the recent conflagration of those precious moral concepts. French president Emmanuel Macron, who rushed to the scene, had this to say: “Notre Dame is our history, our literature, part of our psyche, the place of all our great events, our epidemics, our wars, our liberations, the epicentre of our lives.”Macron announced a national project to rebuild the cathedral because, “it is our profound destiny”. All this was noble and fair. But measure it against the record of the liberal political class he embodies. The Macrons and Merkels of this world — like the Blairs and Camerons and Cleggs and so many other equivocating cultural cowards — have long preached secularisation. They have diluted Christian values in our laws and public le.One recent Archbishop of Canterbury even told us it might be a good idea to have sharia law in Britain.These political leaders have imposed education systems that fail to teach youngsters to be proud of Western art and religion. They have scoffed at national pride and national flagsand lied to us about the federal element of the European Union.Out of sheer political dogma, post-war politicians bigged up modernist architecture, even though the public hated it. Much-loved vistas were destroyed and our capital cities’ skylines were wrecked when mayors approved show-off skyscrapers.We were told to be ashamed of past national historical triumphs such as the British Empire, which was allegedly racist and supremacist. Tradition was bad. Dferent was good. How come such leaders appreciate antiquity and the values represented by a great cathedral such as Notre Dame only when it has gone up in smoke One of the defining images of the Second World War was that photograph of St Paul’s Cathedral at the height of the Blitz, the dome standing proud amid Hitler’s bombs. The picture captured an idea of British defiance, of our country’s decency withstanding a Nazi dictator’s barbarism. It still makes one’s neck prickle with patriotism.What will we in future feel when we see that image of Notre Dame ablaze on Monday night  Might it come to represent the torching of Christendom in Europe It is said that the Paris fire brigade was slow out of the traps. Might that be a metaphor for a wider carelessness by politicians who have seen our culture in peril and failed to act It is no great secret that churches in France and other continental countries have been in a spiral of neglect for decades. A few years ago I visited a major church in Coutances, northern France, and found dead pigeons on the floor and broken panes in the windows.We have done better in Britain where, despite financial problems, our cathedrals and parish churches continue to be a great glory. The Church of England gets plenty of things wrong but it deserves credit for this.That Notre Dame and some of her treasures have been destroyed in Holy Week, as though roasted in the very fires of Hell, is a challenge to our already-dented morale. It seems cruel and may leave churchgoers agape as they try to identy the Almighty’s purpose.If God is working his purpose out, He has an odd way of going about it.But Easter is about renewal. Maybe that should be our pointer.Let this ghastly fire act as a spark to our resolve to relight a sense of pride in Europe’s Christian tradition.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This letter to the people of the UK was written in a police cell, where I was held for six hours.The information is from my memory, having spent the past  years following climate science. I have never been an activist, nor have I been arrested before.I came to London to join the Extinction Rebellion and was camping at Marble Arch and protesting at multiple London sites until my arrest on Wednesday afternoon.The Extinction Rebellion aims are: For the Government to tell the truth about climate change, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by  and to form a Citizens Assembly to determine how we achieve this.Preventing climate catastrophe is the most important political, social, environmental and technical problem humanity has ever faced.The Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Changeis the United Nations body which assesses all available science related to climate change. It suggests a number of routes to limiting the rise in global average temperatures to .C. It also tells us that an increase of C will have much worse effects.All pathways to a maximum .C rise require cuts of around  per cent in global emissions within about  years. To have any chance of achieving this, we need to take immediate action to drastically reduce emissions.So far we have caused global average temperatures to increase by .C since the end of the s. We are already seeing the spread of wildfires, hurricanes, drought, melting icecaps, sea levels rising, ocean acidication, coral reef die-off and the largest scale extinction of animal and plant species since the end of the dinosaurs.The IPCC is predicting C to C of warming based on our current trajectory. With these changes, the Earth will not look like the one we recognise today, but rather like the planet of million years ago. Then there was no ice, temperatures were inhospitable and sea levels much higher — dferences that would totally destabilise ecosystems and society.As climate change continues, human-induced effects are amplied by earth processes, such as methane from melting permafrost and reduced reflection of light back in to space as polar ice sheets shrink. These processes will make global heating worse and are sometimes called tipping points, as they can lead to runaway climate change where the human effects are no longer the main drivers — and they are impossible to halt.Since human climate change was first predicted by Swedish physicist Arrhenius in , thousands of scientists, working for decades in dozens of countries and disciplines, have come to a consensus that climate change is real and the effects catastrophic. There is no scientic debate to be had.The Government is complacent about the UK’s emission reductions, while failing to meet its own targets.Given the situation, I feel the Extinction Rebellion is our last best shot at getting governments to listen and start telling the truth.Once the truth is being told I believe that YOU will be urging the Government to act fast and vote accordingly.My involvement in the rebellion and my arrest are my heartfelt attempt to do whatever I can to help prevent the worst effects of climate change and the social, environmental and financial costs it will cause.I am sorry for the disruption caused to local businesses and commuters.I also apologise to the politan Police for the ersion of resources. My experience of the Met is that there has been an atmosphere of mutual respect between them and protesters.I ask that you, the people, become properly informed about climate change. I also ask that Government, businesses and public bodies start taking transformative action now to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to zero.Finally, I ask for a Citizens Assembly, a representative group of the population which will determine the direction we take to get to zero carbon and will take decisions out of the electoral cycle and political and financial influence.The protesters in London represent a broad church of opinion but I would say my opinions and background are typical.If you have read this far, thank you very much.PIERS writes his letter from a police cell – and for that reason, I cannot take him seriously. He and his fellow protesters might think their cause is noble, but breaking the law is not.Equality before the law is one of the most important principles of British justice. The expectation has always been thatyou commit a crime, you will do the time.Yet for days now, parts of central London have been overrun by a rag-tag band of climate change activists, Piers among them.Setting up makesht camps at Oxford Circus, Marble Arch, Waterloo Bridge and Parliament Square, members of Extinction Rebellion have blockaded roads. And they appeared to be doing so with the support of the politan Police and the force’s boss, the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan.Their cause is an important one, but like every good hostage taker, Extinction Rebellion has come armed with a list of demands, and protesters are prepared to be arrested to secure them. Yet even Extinction Rebellion must have been surprised the blockades were not removed for four days.Hundreds of thousands of Londoners have been suffering on a daily basis. Commuters cannot get to work as buses have been erted. Shoppers have had to abandon some of the busiest streets. Businesses can’t get essential supplies. Emergency vehicles are unable to take the quickest routes. The blockades have cost London millions.Nobody denies the activists are committing a crime by obstructing the streets. Until yesterday, police could be found helping them by acting as picket-line cheerleaders and traffic controllers. We have been told the police presence hasn’t detracted from usual police business. Which of us believes that Excusing their behaviour because it is an important and righteous cause ignores the problem that we are setting a precedent.The liberal, metropolitan elite cheering on the protesters should be careful what they wish for. Paris has been convulsed by violent protests that began in a similar way. Failure to apply the law of obstruction when the Yellow Vest movement started has cost France dear.Others with cause to be angry about politics will have learned the lessons from Extinction Rebellion’s successful action.Remain-backing Londoners may feel very dferently about the taking over of public spaceLeave supporters annoyed at the failure to secure Brexit hit the streets in peaceful protest.

Until now, its often been described as pointless.Dr Michael Berthaume, from Imperials Department of Bioengineering, said: We dont know what the fabellasis - no one has ever looked into it!The fabella is a sesamoid bone, meaning it grows in the tendon of a muscle - the kneecap, for instance, is the largest sesamoid bone in the human body.The fabella may behave like other sesamoid bones to help reduce friction within tendons, redirecting muscle forces, or, as in the case of the kneecap, increasing the mechanical force of that muscle. Or it could be doing nothing at all.In the study, published in the Journal of Anatomy, authors used X-rays, medical research and MRI scans to analyse , knees from  countries, including the UK, dating back to .The researchers admitted the link with osteoarthritis but say it cannot yet say whether it causes the condition, andso, how.It can cause pain and discomfort on its own, and can get in the way of knee replacement surgery.Dr Berthaume said: We are taught the human skeleton contains  bones but our study challenges this. The fabella is a bone that has no apparentand causes pain and discomfort to some and might require removalit causes problems.Perhaps the fabella will soon be known as the appendix of the skeleton.The bone may have had a more important role in history, acting as a kneecap in animals before evolution made it redundant in our ancient human ancestors.Its resurgence is thought to be a result of improved nutrition, which means humans are taller, stronger and heavier than ever before in history - and this all places a strain on our frames.Dr Berthaume said: The average human is better nourished, meaning we are taller and heavier.This came with longer shinbones and larger calf muscles - change which both put the knee under increasing pressure.

Yet it is now leading in the UK polls for the European elections and is favourite to win them.Its meteoric rise is testament to both public anger at the delays to Britain leaving the European Union and to Nigel ­Farage’s skill as a campaigner.But would the Brexit Party winning the European Parliament elections actually change anything There are three ways in which it would have an impact.First, it will make some MPs more wary of a second referendum. Support for this has grown in Parliament in recent months, in part because more MPs have become confident that Remain would come out on top.Butthe Brexit Party wins the European elections, it will show that another referendum would be anything but a cakewalk for Remain. This might make some of these MPs more inclined to compromise.One group whom a Farage victory won’t make more inclined to compromise are the Brexiteer holdouts against May’s deal. They’ll argue that his ­success proves that the public supports No Deal.But I suspect that what it would show more than anything  is voters’ frustration that Brexit hasn’t happened yet.It is the delay — that these MPs must take their share of the blame for — which is so infuriating the public.Success for the Brexit Party will come at the expense of the Tories more than any other party.Debate will quickly sht to how the Tories can win these voters back, and that will boost the chances of the ­Brexiteer leadership contenders. Indeed, theof Farage has already led to ToryMPs taking a second look at Boris Johnson. The other great question is, what effect will a win for the Brexit Party have on Labour The cross-party Brexit talks will resume next week, but those close to them hold out little hope of success.The sense is that they will, in the words of one source, “drag on for a while” but it is “unlikely they will reach agreement”.Butthe Brexit Party is ­taking votes from Labour in its traditional heartlands, it will strengthen the hand of those in the party who just want to get a Brexit deal done so the issue is off the stocks before the next election.Some in government admit that this is unlikely to happen, as doing a deal with Theresa May on Brexit would cause bitter isions in Labour’s ranks.They do hold out hope, though, that it might lead to more Labour MPs being ­prepared to back the deal — a mere five Labour MPs voted for the withdrawal agreement last month.But with the DUP and hardcore Brexiteers determined not to back the deal, it would require  or more Labour MPs to come over — which is a hard ask — for the deal to pass.Perhaps the most signicant consequence of a Brexit Party triumph is that it would finish off Farage’s old party, Ukip.Ukip’s flirtation with Tommy Robinson street thuggery and YouTube stars who make light of rape has been a disaster for the party.The electorate will simply have no truck with such extremist nonsense and so Ukip won’t be the beneficiaries of the public’s anger at the Brexit delays.IF any government needed a reboot, it is this one. But the problem for Theresa May is that doing that requires a Queen’s Speech, and that could bring down her government.Ministers worry that any Queen’s Speech would have to include within it the Brexit deal. After all, that would be the biggest piece of ­legislation going through Parliament in the ­coming session.Butit did, the Queen’s Speech may well be voted down. Labour and Tory Brexit rebels could get together to defeat the Government.As one source at the heart of government points out: “If you haven’t got the votes for the deal, why would you have the votes to pass the Queen’s Speech ”A Queen’s Speech would also require the ­Government to do another deal with the DUP – the current agreement only lasts for this session of Parliament.Given the way the two party leaderships have fallen out over Brexit, this won’t be easy.One ­Cabinet minister tells me that the Tory DUP ­relationship needs “completely resetting” and that it will be a “pretty fraught negotiation”. Butthe Government doesn’t do a Queen’s Speech, it will become embarrassingly obvious that it is in office but NOT IN POWER.The Commons won’t have any government ­legislation to discuss. Rather, it will have to fill its time with pointless general debates.As one ­secretary of state frets: “What legislation do we have to keep bringing forward ”The Tories need to show that despite the Brexit impasse, they do have ideas on domestic ­policy – and that is going to require a Queen’s Speech.DON’T hold your breath for any Tory leadership dream tickets.A growing number of Cabinet ministers think that any contest is now six months away and therefore don’t want to commit to backing a candidate now.One minister close to the efforts to broker a dream ticket tells me: “Everything could look very dferent in October, so what’s the point in ­signing up now ”So all those ­waiting to seeAmber Rudd teams up with Boris Johnson or Michael Gove are going to have to keep on waiting.WITH the Tories in existential crisis, where was the party ­chairman  Pakistan.Ministers were incredulous at the fact that with the party trying to prevent catastrophic losses in both local and European elections, and grassroots activists threatening a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister, Brandon Lewis was off to Pakistan.Allies of the chairman point out that he was only there for  hours and that the trip was part of a Tory effort to strengthen ­community ties.It’s right that the Tories should want to speak to British Pakistanis more.But Lewis would surely be better off doing that here rather than leaving the country with his party in crisis.BREXIT Britain should reach for the stars. We need to put rocket boosters under our space programme.As research from the think tank Policy Exchange’s new Space Policy Unit highlights, the UK spends ­considerably less on space than every other permanent member of the UN Security Council.With space’s strategic importance only going to grow in the coming years, this needs to changethe UK is not to be left behind.The good news is we have the technical expertise we need in this country.We now just need the Government to get behind a space ­programme and ensure that the UK doesn’t get left at the starting line in this new and more important race.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So Jacob Rees-Mogg will tell us, “We must withdraw the power of the elite at once, as I recited this morning in Latin before my daily joust”. Theresa May said her Government would take away power from the elite, although  of them are millionaires. But that doesn’t make them elite, because they must have all got their money by winning it on scratchcards. Jeremy Hunt is said to be worth around £million, but he’s sick of the elite so he must have made that by winning lots of episodes of The Chase. Boris Johnson hates the elite, because during his humble ­beginnings at Eton, he was so poor that one of his imaginary friends didn’t have his own butler. Over the years we’ve heard many tales of Johnson being spotted with ious women, and this has been reported as a series of affairs. But the tragic truth is, probably, that he’s been so skint, he’s had to turn to prostitution to make ends meet.    Jacob Rees-Mogg has a sister, Annunziata Rees-Mogg, who is standing for the Brexit Party as part of her selfless struggle against the elite. Because as soon as you hear the name ­Annunziata Rees-Mogg, the first phrase that comes to mind is “that will be someone who understands the problems of the common man and woman”. Nigel Farage tells us he’s sick of the elite, which you can understand because as a child he had to struggle at rundown Dulwich College, where sometimes the deprivation was so great the students had to share one cricket field between two boys. Many leading Brexit campaigners have made a similar sacrice. Iain Duncan Smith is furious with the elite as he’s so poor he has to live in a relative’s house. It’s a Tudor mansion, owned by his father-in-law, for which he pays no rent, but the principle is the same as someone crashing on their brother’s settee. This makes him technically ­homeless, and maybe you’ve seen him stood in the aisle of a train, holding a plastic cup, saying, “Hello ladies and gentlemen, I’m sorry to bother you but I’m currently without a home and have to sleep in a four-poster bed and we only have two gardeners because I’ve been battling all my le against the elite, soyou can spare a few coins I’ll be ever so grateful. Thank you”.    But none of them can match the heartbreak of Donald Trump, who understandably despises the elite. This is to be expected, as he’s had to make one golden tower last all his le, unlike the rest of us who get through several golden towers a week. He must have faced endless abuse at school as his father was a ­billionaire, so all the kids whose fathers were trillionaires would whip him with towels in the showers and sing “Trump’s only a billionaire, and you can’t help stare at his baffling hair”. We must be thankful the time has come at last, for such common folk to speak for us all.

Isabella Evans is still wearing clothes fit for a newborn after she was delivered weighing less than a pound.At .oz she was so tiny her hands were smaller than p pieces, Gloucester Live reports .According to her parents she made the other babies in the premature unit look like giants. At birth Isabella weighed less than a can of fizzy drink and was smaller than a packet of baby wipes.    Thanks to the work of surgeons who steered Isabella through two operations and doctors who used bubble wrap to keep her warm, the tiny tot has been released from hospital to be with her family at home in Bishopaposs Cleeve, Gloucestershire. Mum Kym Brown told The Sun: We are going to wrap her in bubble wrap for the rest of her le. Realistically she shouldnapost be here. “There were so many times we could have lost her. But she never stops fighting. We love her to bits. Sheaposs perfect. Isabella was born four months early at  weeks following an emergency cesarean in June last year.   Restaurant manager Kym suffered with swollen ankles during her pregnancy but nobody spotted the pre-eclampsia - a potentially fatal condition for both mother and baby - until her blood pressure sky-rocketed.The next day Kym, , was transferred to Southmead Hospital in Bristol where doctors decided to operate because Isabella’s heart rate was dropping. Doctors told her and dad Ryan Evans, , that they should expect the worse. Isabella refused to be beaten however, and was big enough to be cuddled in a blanket a week after her birth.    “It was another week before we could do skin to skin and she was so light it felt like nothing,” said Kym. “Everybody was really shocked and she looked so much smaller than the other babies. “Some of them were around lbs, which is normally considered tiny, but they looked like giants compared to her. “The amazing thing is that even though she was so very tiny, she was so perfect in every way.” While Kym managed to keep quite calm during the stressful period, Ryan struggled.    It was worse for Ryan because he could see what was going on and how ill I was getting,” Kym said of her chef husband. He thought he was going to lose us both. At three weeks they found out Isabella had a hole in her bowel that needed surgery. Kym said: We prepared ourselves for the worst so when we got the call to say the op had gone well I just said, aposOKapos. I was in shock. The way I was coping was to expect the worst. When the good news arrived I couldnapost take it in.    A second bowel operation and laser eye surgery followed, with baby Isabella able to wear her first vest at three months old - evenit had to be shrunk in the wash until it was smaller than a mobile phone. After nine weeks in Gloucestershire Royal Isabella was allowed home on December . Isabella needs oxygen and does not like loud places, but is otherwise fine. As she nears her first birthday she weights just lbs - the same as a newborn.    When Kym is out and about in Gloucestershire with Isabella she sometimes gets strange looks. “She likes adult food better than baby food so I do get some strange looks when I’m out,” explained Kym. “She loves sandwiches and her favourites are the cheese ones. “I’m used to her being so tiny but I do get some looks when I sit her up in the pram and start feeding her sandwiches.”    Ryan was delighted when Isabella was finally allowed home and said: That was one of the best feelings in the world.

Mum Karolina Pisarska, , and -year-old Luiza Koniuszy were found face-down in bitterly cold water off Aberdeen beach at about am yesterday. It’s believed the alarm was raised by a taxi driver who had driven them to the beach and been asked to wait while they went for a swim.He watched in horror as they quickly got into dficulty, the Daily Record reports .A leboat crew pulled them unconscious from the sea and they were taken to the leboat station then Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. But despite desperate efforts by rescuers and medical staff, they could not be revived. They were pronounced dead at the hospital. Chief Inspector Martin Mackay, police commander for Aberdeen, told reporters: “From initial inquiries which include speaking to a witness, we understand they entered the water for the purpose of swimming but sadly underestimated the conditions. “My thoughts are with all of those who will be affected by this tragic incident.”  He said officers were investigating but their deaths did not appear to be suspicious. Mr Mackay added that “extensive efforts” were being made to trace next of kin of the women. They were both from Poland but it’s understood they had settled in Aberdeen after meeting while students at college. The women were pulled from the sea by the crew of the city’s new inshore leboat, which was on its first ever callout before being officially unveiled today. Coxwain Davie Orr said he and his colleagues had been deeply affected by the tragedy.  “We took them from the water on to the boats and took them back to the harbour,” he said. “It’s distressing for us. The RNLI ethos is to save le at sea.” The women were found at high tide, about metres from the shore, next to one of the groyne barriers that span the beach. Davie said: “When the water’s in, there’s not a ready escape to get out. You’ve got to remember the water’s very cold around our coast. “First thing that’s going to happen is cold water shock – you’re going to start gasping for air and taking in water, and that’s likely to start the drowning process very, very quickly.”  Coastguard teams from Aberdeen and Stonehaven and a Coastguard helicopter joined the operation. Ross Greenhill, a Coastguard commander, said crews found the women using searchlights, and described sea conditions at the time as choppy. He added: “It’s probably around C in the water at this time of year, which is rather cold. It takes you by surprise. There were quite substantial waves – it was reasonably rough.” Chief Inspector Mackay warned the public of the dangers “of entering the water at any time of the day or night when you’re not suitably prepared”.

It’s also known as the Egg Moon, Sprouting Grass Moon, Growing Moon or Full Fish Moon.    According to the Royal Museums Greenwich, the full Moon was set to reach its peak little after noon, at .pm, though it would not be easy to see until dusk. It occurs when the Moon is located on the opposite side of the Earth as the Sun, meaning its face is fully illuminated.    Stunning photos taken around the globe show the Moon looking striking, with some showing it appearing bright yellow and others a rich orange colour. The Pink Moon is particularly signicant because it is used to set the date for Easter, which is the Sunday following the first full moon after the spring equinox. In some other cultures, the Pink Moon is known as the Sprouting Grass Moon, the Egg Moon, and the Fish Moon. The next full moon is referred to as the Flower Moon, which takes place on May .

She wanted to make the world a better place, and since then she’s embarked on a -year career as an English and poetry teacher. “At leastI’ve done a decent day’s work in a school, I’ve made the world better and I still feel that,” the -year-old says. Over the years, what’s affected her most are not the lessons in the classroom but what she’s learnt of the troubles her children have suffered away from school, such as deprivation, depression and addiction. Now she has written a book about former pupils who have inspired her, such as Elsa, a keen poet who is so poor and neglected she has to wear school unorm from lost property. Kate, who now teaches at Oxford Spires Academy, says: “We see more extreme poverty coming into schools and schools are having to do more than they used to.” It is a sentiment which has been echoed repeatedly this week at teaching unions’ conferences. Here, in exclusive extracts from Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me, Kate gives a first-hand view of what teachers are really up against and the amazing things they do for our children...  aposElsa is small and freckled and mostly silent. She comes to Poetry Group very regularly, and writes small, sad poems. She is particularly keen on having her work typed out when she was absent once she brought me an extra sad poem on a sheet of A. Another teacher, Miss B, is very taken by this progress, and when we are offered a day trip to London by a charity, we agree: a place for Elsa. But we can’t get her mum to sign the form. Forms are an endless nuisance we expect delay. We anticipate it, in fact we photocopy extra forms, we dole them out several times, we nag, we write notes in planners, we phone home. Two days before the trip, this has worked for everyone but Elsa, and on my way home at nearly six at night, I spot Elsa walking away from the Co-op, holding a loaf of bread. I catch her up, and she is so alarmed, she walks faster, pulling her hood up over her heavy wings of dark, greasy hair. “Don’t you want to come on the trip ” I ask her. “Yeah,” she says, outraged. “What about the form then ” “I got it,” she says. “Well then, could we have it ” “I lost it,” she says, with equal conviction. We have stopped at the gated entrance to the flats behind the Co-op, where Elsa seems to live, and I have one of my brilliant ideas. I have a spare photocopied form right here in my bag. Why doesn’t Elsa just pop upstairs and get her mum to sign it  “You want to see my mum ” says Elsa. And I say no, it isn’t necessary, I can wait right there. There is a long pause. Elsa looks at her small, turned-in feet. “But,” I say, “I could come in. If that would help. If it would helpI explained.”    And so I find myself in a small red room with a loud television and an acrid, woody smell, where a woman in a velour dressing gown is huddled in an armchair, and a yellow bird bashes my face like a slap. “They like to fly about,” says the woman. And I see that there is a bird cage in front of her with an open door, and two canaries loose in the room, and seed and bird droppings everywhere underfoot. Elsa still has her coat on. She stands quietly by the door, feet pressed together. “I”m Elsa’s teacher,” I say nervously. “I just bumped into her and I thought... There’s this trip to London. I expect she told you ” “Ain’t heard nothing about it,” says the woman. “We can’t pay this month.” “It’s free,” I say. “I wondered – could you just sign this form ” And I hand her the form, and she takes it and studies it. “Uumph,” she says. “Dunno.” Suddenly, Elsa appears with a pen. “Mum,” she says, “just there, sign there.” And the woman puts down a scribble, and I realize she can’t read. “Miss has to go,” says Elsa. Afterwards I tell the story to Miss B. “You wouldn’t know,” I say. “Elsa looks quite normal in school.” “No,” says Miss B. “Lost property is a wonderful thing.”  And it turns out to be Miss B who greets Elsa every morning for breakfast club, and unlocks the shower in PE for her, and hands out clean unorm. It is Miss B who whizzes the clothes round the school washing machine, the one bought for PE kit, every week. Miss B says Elsa only ever misses one day of school each year, and that is Red Nose Day, when no unorm is worn. Unorm provides a safety net for children like her. Then there’s Tia. In her chosen corner, Tia is writing another poem for her sister. Tia’s sister died of heroin addiction last year, and Tia lives with her dad and her gran because her mum is also an addict. Tia copes remarkably well. Not only does she keep out of any kind of trouble or substance abuse herself, but she works hard in school, and is universally well liked: kind, thoughtful, calm, friendly, and balanced. Tia writes over and over again about her anxiety, about her pain and mourning, and about heroin, about whether she too will be addicted. She is friends with Kristell. “I used to be skinny,” says Kristell. “Not no more.” She did. When Kristell arrived in Year , she had a bosomy, curvy figure with a tiny waist and pretty ankles. She also had huge, fringed brown eyes, a pouting, sorrowful, half-open mouth, lush, waist- brunette curls, and a downy, newly hatched quality altogether. She looked like trouble, was my first thought. And she was trouble too.  I taught her English set, and she disrupted it. She wasn’t noisy, as such, but noise followed her, arose around her like thorns around an enchanted princess. “It ain’t me!” was one of her cries. “Miss, I ain’t doing it on purpose.” And she wasn’t. She wore less make-up than many other girls, sported no special iation of the school unorm. But each morning she got out of bed and brushed out her cloud of princess hair, and there she was, locked in a puddle of pretty, a bubble of trouble, and couldn’t get out any more than a fly can get out of milk. Once, when Kristell complained she couldn’t finish a poem, because it was so noisy, boys were bombarding her with paper balls, whispering her name, taking her drafts from the bin and reading them aloud, and she begged me to explain why, I said: “It’s because you’re very beautul, and they are trying to get your attention. Because they like you.” Her pretty face crumpled in pain. She dropped her pen. “Oh no, Miss,” she said, “you got that one wrong. They hate me.” And when I demur: “No, Miss, really, that’s hate. They hate me.” Kristell already had, then, at  a contraceptive implant in her arm, but no steady boyfriend. There was trouble in her family that’s why they moved town, why she arrived in our school mid-year. Just a few months later, she had a sort of breakdown. Now she is back, shakily, in school, but she has bleached her beautul hair a coarse yellow and cut it short. She is on anti-depressants. She has put on a great deal of weight, so that the pretty figure is blurred, so that she looks like her mum, so that she is not such a target of notice and noise.

Ellis Mahler, , set up boxing.media about  months ago after he was left wheelchair bound.The boxing fan, from Kimmel Bay, North Wales, first became unwell in January  - slurring his words and suffering from headaches , fatigue and loss of balance.After doctors originally thought he may have multiple sclerosis, Ellis was eventually diagnosed with Functional Neurological Disorder - which stops the brain sending signals to parts of the body.During his recovery, Ellis used his Instagram page as a distraction - uploading pictures of world famous boxers and clips from fights, reports North Wales Live .   Soon Ellis started gathering thousands of followers and now has an incredible audience of ,.Ellis is now in regular contact with superstars including American comedian Kevin Hart and has even been invited to watch boxer Tyson Fury train.He is also on texting terms with World Heayweight Champion, Anthony Joshua - who recently sent him a signed pair of gloves. Ellis, who is now studying for his A levels, said: I set up the Instagram page to stop thinking about my illness. I am obsessed with sport, especially boxing, and I tried to adopt that aposnever give upapos mindset that athletes have when I was ill. It really is amazing the way boxing.media has taken off. I now get footage sent to me and I post around four to six times a day. BBC Sport, BT Sport and a company in New York want to advertise on it.    I am in regular contact with Kevin Hart and Anthony Joshua, and I get invited to watch fights in Las Vegas all the time. Sometimes I donapost think people realise Iaposm only . My friends think itaposs all a bit nuts, and I think the teachers at school are a little shocked about what I was up to when I was in a wheelchair. Speaking about his success and original diagnosis, mum Anwen said: It was terrying as no one knew what was wrong with him and he was deteriorating rapidly. I thought he was going to die. I thought he had either motor neurone disease or multiple sclerosis, but all the tests we had were coming back clear. Things got so bad, Anwen used to drag her son up the stairs or help him shuffle on his bum down the corridor to his bedroom. Teachers would visit Ellis at home, and he went on to sit his GCSEs in a wheelchair. Anwen said: We werenapost supposed to see a consultant for a few months at Walton.    But he was in such a bad way that, in desperation, I asked for an emergency appointment, and thank God we met a dferent consultant who diagnosed Ellis with Functional Neurological Disorder. The condition, which can be caused by a virus or trauma, means the brain stops sending the correct signals to the body, and had been caused by a virus in Ellisapos case. The consultant said Ellis needed to have physio everyday and do ious exercises, which he did all day as he was so determined to get better and was so positive throughout his illness, said his mum. He never even let us get him a proper wheelchair. He just used the one we borrowed from the Red Cross. After three months of physiotherapy, Ellis was walking again.    He had to relearn everyday things like riding a bike and swimming, said Anwen. But he did it and succeeded and reached his goal last summer of walking round the top of the Burj Khala in Dubai. That was a really emotional moment. Anwen said Ellisaposs Instagram page is something good to have come from a horric year. She added: He recently went to the Drake concert on the guest list, spent the night in the VIP box with all his friends, and met the rapper Tory Lanez.

Until thataposs sorted, Catherine will continue to struggle. She was put in touch with volunteers at the Salford food bank through her housing officer.    Catherine says she gets payments for her gas and electricity bills through Salford Assist, a council scheme that provides short term support for people in crisis. For a while after losing her job, she says, she went aposdays and daysapos without eating. Iaposve probably lost a stone since all this started, Catherine said. Without [the foodbank] Iaposd be dead. The food bank is a leline for a great many people. But itaposs one of two centres at risk of closure due to a lack of funds. There were only two Salford food banks - at Mocha Parade and The Sanctuary - until  months ago, when a council grant meant Salford Foodshare Network volunteers, backed by the Trussell Trust, were able to expand into Eccles and Swinton.    The money was also used to buy a van to deliver food to the centres. Food bank bosses were expecting a further grant this year, but they havenapost received any money - meaning they may have to close the Swinton and Eccles centres. Catherine, who has applied for scores of jobs since January, says she wouldnapost be able to pay the bus fare to travel to Mocha Parade in Lower Broughton. Itaposs a -mile round trip. For now, she relies on handouts at the Eccles food bank for herself, her teenage daughter and her Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Catherine says she wouldnapost be able to survive without the service and thinks itaposs aposdisgustingapos it might have to close. Without this Iaposd have nothing, she added. Iaposve never been out of work in my le. My daughter is only on an apprenticeship, sheaposs not in a position on £ an hour to help. The food bank is very important.

Food bank coordinator Mervyn Gledhill drives the delivery van to drop off food at centres. At a guess, the -year-old says around  people rely on the Eccles and Swinton centres each week. The true number of people needing help is far greater - some people collect food and other items for large families. If you close those centres, it doesnapost mean the demand goes down, Mervyn said. It just means that the people who go to those centres would have to go to Mocha Parade. If people donapost have enough money for food, they donapost have enough money for buses. Alyson Entwistle, , has been volunteering at the Eccles centre since November. She says: I was shocked [when I heard itaposs at risk]. This is a fundamental service for the people in this community. If there wasnapost this service it would put people into real crisis. We canapost allow that to happen. Salford mayor Paul Dennett said: “Last year, via Salford Citizens Advice, Salford council gave a one-off grant of £, to Salford Foodshare Network which brings together a range of support services aiming to improve access to advice and support services for people in food crisis. This was to help develop long-term sustainable solutions to food poverty. “It was made clear at the time that the council could not commit to further funding beyond this but would continue to support the Network in any other way we could, which we continue to do. The council was completely unaware of the threat of closure. We are very happy to meet with the Salford Foodshare Network to discuss possible solutions. “Salford council is absolutely committed to tackling food poverty. This year we will spend £, on emergency food vouchers alone, as well as providing support for people in need of emergency heating, clothing and furniture through our Salford Assist scheme. We also offer people help to find long-term solutions to their money worries, including benefit checks to make sure they are claiming all they are entitled to and debt advicerequired. “We support school breakfast clubs and are considering ways to help families who rely on free school meals during holidays.” A spokesman for DWP said: To calculate Universal Credit, we take wages into account based on when they were received. “If someone believes they’ve had the wrong earnings reported they can provide evidence to HMRC to investigate.” "},{"url":null,"title":"vigilante dads viciously batter autistic","story":"NewsVigilante dads viciously batter autistic boy with metal bat and walking stickDaniel Street and Lee Perry, both , have been jailed after they inflicted several injuries on the cowering boy, including two fractured teethShareByAmy Walker:,  APR NewsLee Perry was one of two dads who battered an autistic boy of  with a metal bat and a walking stickLtd\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTwo vigilante fathers battered an autistic -year-old boy with a metal bat and an antique walking stick after they blamed him for a house break in. Neighbours Daniel Street and Lee Perry, both , tracked down the teenager and subjected him to a punishment beating after one of them vowed: Iaposm going to have to teach that little s**t a lesson. The victim, who had been cowering from the two men in a kebab shop in Denton, Greater Manchester, suffered bruising to his back, shoulder blade, face and head, along with two fractured teeth. He later told police he and his family have moved away from the area and added: This has affected my time at college and I have had to get dental treatment for my teeth. I am unable to go out as freely as I did as I feel in fear.    He continued: I stayed with my Mum four days after the accident for my own protection and I ed home to my Dads address after. Itaposs very stressful living in such close proximity with those two men. I have to be taken backward and forwards to college. I found the process of giving evidence to be distressing. Street and Perry denied wrongdoing and claimed the incident occurred following a break in at Perryaposs home. But both were convicted of assault following a trial and jailed for  months. Neither have any previous convictions. Sentencing Judge John Edwards told them: This was nothing short of a punishment beating on a -year-old lad with autism. I want to make it clear that you were not aware of his autism - however, you must have known he was a lad of  and you much have known how vulnerable he was.  He continued: He was struck to the face with a bat, striking the teeth and was said to be cowering in the kebab shop when unceremoniously he was pulled out onto the street and struck with a weapon causing bruising and abrasion and badly fractured teeth. A man eating at a Thai restaurant opposite recalls seeing both of you hitting him half a dozen times as he tried to protect himself. He was left with two fractured adult teeth, the left and right incisor, and he now requires root canal treatment and crowning. The hitting was described by one person as a stabbing motion. Whatever argument you had with him, you should not be dealing with the law in your own hands. This was a street beating where he was punched, kicked and struck with a metal bat. You, Lee Perry, were heard to say: aposIaposm going to have to teach the little sh*t a lessonapos and thataposs exactly what you did. You both thought giving him a beating would be teaching him a lesson. Immediate custody is unavoidable. The incident began at around .pm on September th of last year when the -year-old was getting a meal at the Denton Kebab Shop. Prosecutor Adrian Farrow said: He appears to have taken refuge in the kebab shop and the two defendants were seen looking for him. The boy has no real recollection of the events and he is autistic. His only recollection is being at home, then being in hospital. Both defendants were armed with a metal bat and a walking stick and they arrived at the kebab shop and saw the complainant inside. He was struck to the face by Lee Perry as he sat inside the kebab shop. Perry had use of a baseball bat. The complainant was then dragged out of the shop doorway where both defendants beat him repeatedly with their respected weapons.    He continued: He sustained bruising to his back and shoulder blade and damage to his two front teeth. He also sustained bruising to the back of his head. He was described as having intermittent confusion and was kept in the hospital for observation where it was confirmed he was made subject of a CT scan. During the course of the trial, the defendants account was that there was an attempted burglary at Lee Perryaposs home address and there was some disorder in the alleyway afterwards. The two defendants had armed themselves with weapons in order to seek out and find those responsible for what happened at the house. This was a sustained assault. In mitigation defence lawyer Robert Smith said: Both men in their own way, express some remorse for what they did. Daniel Street did say he expressed regret for what he did and he acted foolishly. Lee Perry expressed remorse in his pre-sentence report. Both grossly overreacted to what was going on and they werenapost aware he was autistic. The reality is they had both gone over the top. No matter what they believed that boy did, he didnapost deserve to be assaulted. For both of them this was a one off. This is the first time they have committed a violent offence.

When police arrived to investigate her  call claiming her  siblings had been kept captive and abused, they found the group so malnourished they did not at first realise some of the brothers and sisters were adults. Some of the siblings were found bound to their beds and furniture by chains and padlocks - telling police they were “starving.” Today, the parents who beat, starved, and shackled the children to beds were jailed for  years to le over  counts each of torture, dependent adult abuse, child endangerment and  imprisonment.  David Turpin, , an engineer, and housewe Louise, , had managed to cover up their childrenaposs miserable living situation for years by home-schooling them, when in reality they were sometimes chaining them up for one to two months and only freeing them to brush their teeth or use the bathroom. All the children had names beginning with aposJapos but cannot be identied and were not photographed as they faced their parents in court today. A court heard details of how some of the children claimed to have not bathed in a year, how their parents would bake them food and bring them toys - but they were not allowed to touch them.

One man, Ruben Enaje, was aposcruciedapos for the rd year in a row at the ceremony. Enaje, , portrays Jesus Christaposs crucixion and death on Good Friday in front of crowds of foreign and local tourists in San Pedro Cutud village in Pampanga province. Actors drove four-inch nails into both his hands and feet and lted him on a wooden cross for around five minutes. Enaje told reporters after his crucixion that he continues the tradition to remind the world about the plight of Jesus Christ, and said he has decided to stop after next yearaposs rites.    Two men and a woman, Mary Joy Sazon who was praying for good health and her motheraposs recovery from illness, were later crucied to wooden crosses after Enajeaposs act. A total of nine people in three separate crucixion sites took part in the extreme Catholic penitence, which the Church constantly rejects as unnecessary. Dozens of barefoot penitents whipped themselves and carried large wooden crosses in sweltering heat on Thursday as they participated in a ritual ahead of Easter in Asiaaposs biggest Catholic nation. Some of the men, wearing red robes with their faces covered and hands tied to the crosses, walked for hours along a highway in the northern province of Pampanga, about  miles north of Manila, the capital.    Others were half-naked, using bamboo flails to hit their backs, which had been nicked with blades before the ritual. The groups stopped to pray at several places along their route, while women recited religious verses. It is dficult yet rewarding, said sixteen-year-old Job Christian Ong, the youngest in his group of devotees, adding that he believed himself cleansed of sin after the event. He volunteered this year to continue a family tradition, he said, taking over from an older brother who is now abroad.  The Easter penance aims to secure forgiveness for sins, cures for illness, or blessings. We always pray for strength,health for our families, and thank God for blessings, said Roger Aquino, a -year-old village official who was among the penitents. People should understand that what we do is a traditionshould respect it. Re-enactments of the sufferings of Christ are a tradition in the Southeast Asian nation ahead of Easter, though the Catholic Church has always expressed disapproval of what it calls misinterpretations of faith.

McInnes is disappointed the SFA did not give Pittodrie legend Alex McLeish the opportunity to see out Scotland’s Euro  qualying campaign.The SFA axed McLeish just  months into his second stint as national boss following a poor start to the qualying campaign.Under McLeish’s guidance the Scots secured a play-off spot by topping their UEFA Nations League ahead of Israel and Albania.However, he paid the price for a disastrous Euro qualying opener as the Scots crashed - away to Kazakhstan.It didn’t get much better as they stuttered to a - defeat of San Marino, rated the worst national team in world football.The hunt for a replacement kicked off immediately with McInnes one of the names listed by bookmakers for the post.McInnes has consistently underlined his commitment to the Dons and would not be drawn on any speculation on who would replace McLeish so soon after the -year-old was axed.McInnes said: “This campaign is not over with and that is what I am disappointed in, that Alex has not seen it through.“There has been a lot rumour and innuendo about Alex’s position before now.“I am disappointed when any manager loses his job, especially when he has only been in the job for a short space of time.“On a personal basis I have got to know Alex well in the last wee while and I am disappointed for him as a person.“I recognised what a true patriot he is both as a player and a manager. Alex has been fully committed in any role he has had to get results for Scotland.“That is clear.“There is always that tinge of sadness when that is the case. My sympathies go with Alex.”McLeish was confirmed as Scotland manager for a second time in February last year.His sacking was confirmed yesterday with an SFA statement saying the decision was “agreed collectively in consultation with Alex” at a Scottish FA board meeting at Hampden.Under McLeish, Aberdeen’s Scott McKenna and Graeme Shinnie were both handed debut caps and have gone on to win multiple caps.Kilmarnock boss Steve Clarke, who will face the Dons tomorrow, is one of the names in the frame for the Scotland job.McInnes insists it still remains an attractive proposition for any manager at the right stage of their career.He said: “ It depends on where you are in your career but I would think managing your country would have to be up there with the majority of managers as some sort of ambition at some point. Whoever goes in will be aware of the scrutiny and pressures of the job but also the rewards.“The reward of qualying for a tournament would be fantastic for a manager out there.”"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit navel gazing and naval support","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe fraught question of Brexithas been exercising the thoughts of our contributor Ann Thomas.Tarbert artist Ann imagines a time in the not-too-distant future when we might have to resort to unusual means to export goods to the EU.Down in Westminster our politicians continue to squabble.

Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"john crawford ardrishaig","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowShinty in Mid Argyll has lost one of its great stalwarts with the passing of John Crawford of Ardrishaig after a short illness.John, aged , died in Mid Argyll Hospital on the evening of Thursday February .John was born and brought up in Minard in Argyll.

He also served on their committee for many years.John had served as a policeman for a short time before working in the quarry at Furnace, then going on to be a very well-known driver with Gleaner Oils, which supported many of his shinty activities with young players in Argyll.John was a great organiser and acted as goal judge in a number of senior shinty finals including the Glasgow Celtic Society Cup and notably the Camanachd Cup Final in Inverness when Gordon MacIntyre of Oban Camanachd scored his famous winner at the Bught Park.John apparently retrieved the ball from the net and lobbed another onto the park for the re-start before presenting the goal-scoring ball to Gordon after the match.John is survived by his brother Jim who played for Glasgow Police and he was pre-deceased by his we Donella.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"bank injects tens thousands pounds","story":"NewsBank injects tens of thousands of pounds to revamp Ayrshire branchGiant lodges application with councilShareByStephen Houston:,  APR NewsAyr High Street branch, Bank Of Scotland\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMajor investment is being made to spruce up the Bank of Scotland in Ayr.

And what better way to celebrate the religious holiday this year by visiting Ayr’s oldest church. Thought to be the oldest church in the town, St Quivox Parish, Auchincruive, is rich in heritage and history. Visible from the A, the ‘country church’ was originally a rural Parish church dating back to the late th   early th centuries. It has been a living, working church without interruption ever since. The Church of Scotland branch has seen many changes over the years. In , the church on the Auchincruive site was originally called Sanchar-in-Kyle and was described as a rectory. In , it was mentioned in connection with the founding of the Gilbertine Priory of St Mary at Dalmulin within the Parish and in  came under the ownership of Paisley Abbey when the monks left Dalmulin. At this time it was a Roman Catholic Church and after the Reformation in , and the movement away from Rome, the church became used for the Protestant form of worship.  In , a major restoration was carried out to the original long church with the addition of a T-shaped wing. A relic wooden ladle used for the collection and communion cups, said to have been presented in , are still in use today. The last structural change to the church was seen in the early th century when the Whitletts and Craigie Galleries were added above each end of the original long church. The outside gallery stairs, still in existence, speak of an older time when the landed gentry did not mix with the people seated in the body of the kirk. And it’s hard to believe that back in those days there was very much a ide among the congregation between rich and poor. But that’s certainly not the case now. Church member and Convener for Fundraising and Events, Margaret McConnell said: “It’s always been quite a poor church. “The members and residents were either miners or worked on the fields. “Of course, there were quite a lot of farmers in the area but they were the wealthy ones.”  Speaking of the upper central gallery, Interim Moderator Rev Ken Yorke said: “That’s where the lords and ladies sat. “There was a fireplace up there and the story goes that when the local gentry was sitting there,he didn’t like what the minister was saying, he’d get up from his seat and go over to the fire and sit and warm himself.” Session Clerk David McMahon joked: “We don’t have any original members left anymore.” Margaret has a long standing relationship with the St Quivox, Auchincruive. She originally went to the church as a young girl then lived overseas for several years. But she admits finding her aunt Elizabeth’s grave in the church’s graveyard brought her “back to her roots”. She said: “Faith is a journey. “I joined the church  years ago. “My family were local residents and granny came to the church every Sunday.  “They were from Whitletts and used to walk along the Low Road, but now that’s the bypass.” Her family sat in one of the galleries, to the left of the minister. She later married in the church in . And it seems ministry runs in the family for Rev Ken too, whose father was a minister at Prestwick South for  years. Rev Ken said: “It’s not all about the minister though– we have faithful people who help out. It’s a team effort. “People nowadays, their attention span doesn’t last for too long so I try to speak for a short time but get all the important parts across. “There comes a time more than ever where Christian people and communities need to come together– still do their own thing– but come together to further God’s work.” David added: “A lot of our work is trying to involve the community. “It’s about getting in touch with the people.” St Quivox Auchincruive will host Holy Week and looks forward to welcoming those who wish to celebrate the holiday.  Margaret said: “Hosting the Holy Week Services at Ayr, St Quivox Parish Church, Auchincruive provides a great opportunity for us to let everyone in the community know that the beautul old church is still open to all and welcomes everyone. “We would also like to extol the historical importance and the heritage of Ayr, St Quivox Parish Church, as two of its former ministers were Moderators of the General Assembly – one of whom, Rev Archibald H Charteris, began ‘Le and Work’ magazine and also founded the Women’s Guild.” And although very proud of their beautul and historically rich place of worship, the trio agreed “the church is the people – not the building”. Church members meet together and operate between Ayr, St Quivox two churches Auchincruive and Dalmilling Church on Dalmilling Road, Ayr on alternating Sundays. Holy Week Services will be held at Auchincruive each evening at pm until Good Fridayand Easter Sunday funwill begin at .am , with breakfast served in the Crypt at .am and Service start at .am.

But no action was taken due to a blunder.   The council admitted the mistake after the Ayrshire Local Democracy Service learned of the incident.   Laura McEwan who campaigned to keep the library open said the councilaposs paperwork error was of great disappointment to residents.   She said: Once again South Ayrshire Council make disastrous financial errors which come at great cost to our local community. After much campaigning, Coylton like so many other villages lost its library services and the building stood empty for many months.   She said the £, rent could have went to other vital community services and blasted council cuts at the Coylton Gala.   The mother-of two added: How can they justy raising the council rates while this continuous waste of money is allowed to proceed unchecked    A council spokesman said: “The council’s lease at  Main Street Coylton was terminated in August , annual payments of £, were made up to this point in line with the lease agreement.

It is feared either below par casting or a low quality bronze may be causing problems for Icarus. For the past  years the bronze sculpture has adorned the entrance to the Scottish International Aerospace Park at Prestwick. Thousands of drivers pass him every day - and some think he’s a double for former Celtic striker John Hartson. It was commissioned by the now defunct Enterprise Ayrshire and created by the firm where Kelpies sculptor Andy Scott was lead designer. An expert who brought his fears for the sculpture to the Ayrshire Post said: “This should not be happening and my eye can also see cracks that have obviously had some filler work done. “This should not be happening. Good bronze should last without issues for generations. I just wonderon a cost basis the foundry used low quality bronze.” Untrained eyes can see rust developing on the back of Icarus’s wings and on the globe he stands on. Between his feet the surface seems dimpled and stained. One theory is it could be bronze disease, similar to what rust is on iron-based material. The matrix of copper and tin that forms bronze is attacked by hydrochloric acid which can combine with chloride in sea water. On most days Icarus is hit by salty moist air from the sea just half a mile away. In Greek mythology Icarus flew too close to the sun and his wax wings melted. He fell into the sea and drowned. An academic at Brown University at Rhode Island said: “If left untreated, bronze disease will continue to eat away at the metal to the point of complete destruction of the artact.” A study into the condition of Icarus is now to take place. A spokeswoman for Scottish Enterprise said: “The statue at Prestwick Airport was commissioned some  years ago by the local enterprise company, Enterprise Ayrshire. “We have instructed an inspection of the statue and remedial work will be undertakenrequired.” Icarus sculptor Andy Scott now lives in the US and was keen to look at images of him. He said: “Icarus was sculpted by my former company Scott Associates Sculpture  Design and I was lead sculptor. “It was cast in bronze by Beltane Studios in Peebles. It was based, I remember, on a design drawn by a local school pupil. I’ve not personally seen the sculpture for some time. Last time I did it looked just fine. Bronze does not rust. It patinates with time, and the color does alter in the environment.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnJohn HartsonPrestwick AirportUniversities and CollegesEducationAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14418225.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_070319bypass_01JPG.jpg","title":"maybole bypass could create up","story":"NewsMaybole bypass could create up to  jobs, says the Scottish GovernmentThe official award of the construction contract has fired the starting gun on the long-awaited project.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  APR NewsAn overview of the bypass route \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe project to build a bypass for Maybole could employ up to , it has been claimed.

Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson, said: The local community will benefit from opportunities created for small and medium enterprises to bid for subcontractor roles and the provision of at least four vocational and seven professional, site-based training opportunities. The contractor anticipates that the project could employ up to  people during the months of peak construction activity, a number of which are created by the project. We recognise the strategic importance of providing good transport links on the major routes to the key port at Cairnryan. “Today’s announcement continues to build upon the signicant investment already delivered across  improvement projects since  on the A and A. “Delivering the Maybole bypass will provide better journey time reliability for road users as well as improved safety and environmental benefits for the local community.  South of Scotland MSP, Brian Whittle, added: After so many long years of waiting and so much hard work by local residents and campaigners, Iaposm delighted to see the Maybole Bypass moving forward. The new bypass will benefit drivers on the A and opens the way for new investment and redevelopment in Maybole.It is disappointing that the Scottish Government chose not to fully dual the bypass, missing an opportunity to futureproof the road, but it’s still a major step forward for the area.This is an important investment but there’s much more that could be done to improve the A along its entire . Instead of resting on their laurels with this investment, I’ll continue to challenge the Scottish Government to set out a long term plan for further bypasses and more dual carriageway that will bring the A up to the standard drivers expect from a trunk road and help grow the economy across Ayrshire.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish GovernmentAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish water insists ayrshire drinking","story":"NewsScottish Water insists Ayrshire drinking supply is safe following concerns over taste and odourBosses at Scottish Water say the supply throughout Ayrshire is still safe to drink.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  APR NewsScottish Water has ruled out health concerns \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyrshireaposs drinking water IS safe to consume, officials at Scottish Water insisted today.

The trainee paramedic was a size  and had a body mass indexof . when she was diagnosed with the disease at . At just ft tall and weighing st lbs, she was horried with the way she looked. Katy, from Troon, recalled: “When I look back, it feels like the big me with type  diabetes is a dferent person. “I was so self-conscious, and embarrassed to have type  diabetes so young and to have to inject in front of people.” Katy first attended a slimming group at , but struggled to lose any weight with it. And when doctors discovered her diabetes as she prepared for surgery to correct an underdeveloped jaw, she lost her confidence even more. She explained: “I was all geared up for the surgery. I’d been so self-conscious about both my weight and my jaw. I just wanted to get it sorted. “But, as the doctors were prepping me, they realised my blood sugar levels were sky high. The surgery was postponed as they ran tests, which showed I had type  diabetes. “Looking back, I’d had signs, like constant thirst, tiredness, and needing to go to urinate all the time, but I’d been too scared to go and have it all confirmed. “The diagnosis itself was devastating. I remember being shown how to inject myself, trying to do it and just sobbing, saying I couldn’t. “I then had to deal with going back to school and adjusting to this new le. I didn’t want anyone to see me injecting, and felt so embarrassed. “At that age, you just want to be like everyone . It was hell.” She went on: “I would eat rubbish – big plates of chips for lunch, then take-aways in the evening. “I did very little exercise too. I’d not long passed my driving test, so drove absolutely everywhere – including to the McDonald’s drive-thru most evenings.” Things changed for Katy when, in April , a Facebook post about WW – the new Weight Watchers – caught her eye. After initially trying out the plan, she was shocked to discover she had reduced her blood sugar levels to match those of someone without type  diabetes. She continued: “I saw these amazing before and after pictures and thought, ‘That’s what I want.’ “I knewI didn’t do it then I never would, so I contacted my WW leader Morag and went down to a meeting. “They explained how to use their SmartPoints system, which tracks food and drink to nudge users towards a more nutritious diet. “It made complete sense to me and I especially loved the app, enabling you to scan food in the supermarket and find out how many points it’s worth. “I’d tried other regimes in the past and hadn’t stuck to them, as they were so impractical. You can’t exactly go out to a restaurant and eat weight loss shakes or supplements. “But I liked WW as it didn’t bring attention to the fact I was trying to slim down. I could still eat the foods I liked, but it taught me about moderation and to stop pushing myself to eat when I was full.” Katy eventually hit her current weight of st lb and has never been happier. She no longer needs to inject insulin, she just takes two Metformin tablets a day – a drug often used to treat type  diabetes. The charity Diabetes UK says that though there is no guarantee that the condition has gone forever – it is possible to go into remission – and losing around kgincreases the chances of doing so. Katy now lives on fresh, home-cooked meals, prepared from scratch and hits the gym three times a week, where she does cardio and lts weights. She said: “My advice to anyone  out there feeling how I once did is just to take those first steps, go to that first meeting. “It doesn’t take long for change to happen. You can still go out, have fun and socialise too. “You don’t need to stop your le in order to feel dferent.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr NewsAyrBMIFacebookSupermarketsEducationSocial mediaTroon"},{"url":null,"title":"local-politicians-react-to-brexit-extension","story":"LOCAL politicians have reacted to the news that the Brexit withdrawal deadline has been delayed until October .The extension was approved by EU leaders following protracted talks in Brussels last night, averting the immediate threat of the UK leaving without a deal.Under the extension agreement the UK is now dutybound to hold European elections in May, although the country could still exit the EU before OctoberTheresa May can secure parliamentary support for her withdrawal agreement.David Mundell, Scottish Secretary and MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale, was pleased with the extension but warned of hard work ahead.

She started by telling us that her vaccination was in the thigh, as it was for other girls, so that it didnrsquot mar the upper arm, just in case that girl, might later in le, wear a sleeveless evening dress - how thoughtful of the doctor! We learnt that smallpox dates back to before , BC and came from the Middle East, that Pharaoh Rameses V died in , BC of smallpox. Isabel mentioned lots of other people well-known to history who suffered from smallpox or died of it, including Saint Nicasius, Bishop of Rheims, who, though he was decapitated by the invading Vandals in  AD, in the cathedral he founded, picked up his head and walked to the altar, reciting a psalm. He is the patron saint of smallpox victims.It was called smallpox in the th century to dferentiate it from syphilis, which at that time was known as the great pox. It is a crowd disease that passed by inhalation, though can stay active on clothes, blankets and other objects. So the North American Indian tribes, the Aztecs and the Incas were devastated by smallpox, and the native tribes in Canada were infected by missionaries and priests possibly through donations of bedding or clothes. Itrsquos clear that smallpox was a major disease in Europe from at least the th century, killing at least , people each year and leaving visible evidence of the disease on the faces of millions of others. Smallpox seems to have been taken as inevitable right up until the mid-th century in Britain and only a few lucky iniduals came through it, unspoilt. The Chinese had a defence against it, more than , years ago, by blowing powdered smallpox scabs up the noses of healthy people ndash a form of inoculation.

There is a big waiting list in the county and we hope to open a base here.But planning officers urged councillors to reject LARrsquos proposals, regardless of their own efforts to build housing there two years ago.Iain McFarlane, head of planning, said that two years ago the council did not have its Local Development Plan approved and faced a shortage of land for affordable housing.Now the plan had been adopted, he said there was sufficient land supply for the next five years.He said allowing housing on the site would set an ldquoundesirable precedent, adding it would be ldquoselling our employment plans down the river.Councillor Kenny McLeod, committee member, said he was ldquodeeply uncomfortable about refusing planning permission on a site the council had tried to develop in the same way two years ago.At the time, council officers said the landowner rejected their pound, offer as too low.Robin Holder, representing LAR at the meeting, said the council had given written reassurance it would consider the site, which has lain empty since , for housing.He rejected claims that approving the plans would set a precedent, saying: ldquoThis is a small area, this site is a quarter of one per cent of land identied for industrial use in East Lothian. The site has been vacant for many years and the evidence suggests it will remain so.But Councillor Norman Hampshire said: ldquoI cannot support the application: it would send a message to other owners of land designated for business use.The committee rejected the planning application by six votes to three.Following the meeting, Ms Leslie said: ldquoNaturally we are disappointed at the decision and are considering whether to appeal against it.ldquoWe have worked very closely with East Lothian Council over the last three years on a number of projects to enhance the provision of good-quality affordable homes in the area and have enjoyed a very positive working relationship with them.ldquoOur proposal for Prestonpans was a design and build project for  homes, very similar to our recently completed development at the disused site of the former boatyard in Cockenzie. This proved to be extremely popular and was vastly oversubscribed, so there is an urgent need for homes like ours.ldquoWe understand that this site in Prestonpans had been earmarked for commercial use but, in the absence of any confirmed interest, we had hoped that our plans, which would enhance the local environment and provide much-needed affordable housing, would have been

patients should have ldquono anxieties about being seen by the right professional at the right time.Through this new way of delivering patient care, it not only provided an increase in the number of patient appointments with practice GPs and other healthcare professionals, but also provided an increase in appointmentfor patients with complex needs.A recent survey conducted within the practice demonstrated that more than half of patients agreed that they did not always need to see a GP.Work is also under way by ELHSCP to implement a new telephone and IT system that will support call demand

other organisations to ensure that improvements are made and I would encourage anyone with any issues regarding the practice to get in touch with them and become involved with the patient participation group.ldquoI am hopeful that the improvements being made by the organisations will be seen by patients and a vastly improved service will be delivered.ldquoI will continue to closely

A local tradition claims that the name Markle is actually a corruption of the word miracle, a reference to this legendary intervention of the saint on that day.This event is now seen as the lsquobirth of the Scottish flagrsquo, the Saltire thereafter becoming the flag of Scotland the tale is well told by the Scottish Flag Trust in the doocot by Athelstaneford Kirk, which has been wonderfully adapted into the Flag Heritage Centre.But why was it St Andrew who came to the aid of the Picts and Scots on that day and not, say, St Columba  The answer to this question may begin in a ,-year-old crypt in Northumberland.This crypt lies underneath the abbey of Hexham, a town in northern England. The crypt is an amazing survival from Anglo-Saxon times, built in the seventh century, more than  years before the Battle of Athelstaneford is said to have taken place.The crypt was part of a monastery built on the orders of the then abbot Wilfrid and it had a special purpose.Wilfrid was a passionate devotee of St Andrew. He had travelled to Rome and ed with a relic connected to the saint. Christianity at this time had not yet fully established its dominance, and Wilfrid was determined to create a great Christian holy site to encourage the spread of his faith.And what better way to do this than use a relic of St Andrew, an Apostle of Jesus himself So he established St Andrewrsquos monastery at Hexham in AD , and in the crypt below there was a shrine, in which the relic of the saint was kept.Pilgrims began to flock to the site and, although small, the design of the crypt gave an intense religious experience.The entrance was by the high altar of the church, with dark passageways for the pilgrims to file towards and pay homage to the relic of St Andrew.Even today, the now-empty shrine has the atmosphere of a sacred inner sanctum. The ancient feel of it is added to by the fact it was constructed with stones taken from abandoned Roman buildings, as Hexham is close to Hadrianrsquos Wall and the Roman garrison town of Corbridge.But what is the connection with the miracle at Markle The connection begins with Wilfridrsquos successor Acca, who became the abbot of St Andrewrsquos in Hexham in AD . He had travelled with Wilfrid and shared his devotion to St Andrew. It is said Acca acquired his own relics of St Andrew and added them to the collection at Hexham.But Acca the abbot was an evangelising monk. In AD , he left Hexham and journeyed beyond the old crumbling Roman wall and further north.It was around this time that East Lothian became part of Northumbria. But the kingdom beyond the seawas the land of the Picts.The story tells us that Acca met with the Pictish king Angusat a place called Kilrymont in Fe. Here, we are told, Acca gave the Christian Pictish leader some relics of St Andrew he had taken from Hexham and urged the king to create a new centre of Christian pilgrimage for the saint.From the limited historical accounts available, it does seem that it was indeed around this time that the religious site of St Andrews in Fe was established, at the place previously called Kilrymont.Further evidence of this is the amazing St Andrews Sarcophagus, which was discovered at St Andrews in the early th century. It can now be seen in the cathedral museum, where it is described as ldquoone of the finest examples of early medieval sculpture in Europe. It dates from the mid-s and was almost certainly commissioned by Angus for his own burial. He died in AD .And so the veneration of St Andrew in Scotland had begun well before the miracle at Markle, with King Angus resting at St Andrews in his magnicent sarcophagus. No wonder, then, when a later King Anguswas in need of ine intervention in AD , the saint he prayed to was St Andrew, who is then said to have replied in such a legendary, dramatic fashion.Here is the connection between the crypt at Hexham and the miracle seen at Markle: the relics of St Andrew brought to Fe which began the Scottish attachment to the saint may well have been part of the Hexham collection.But wait a minute! Thatrsquos not the story I have always been told when I go to St Andrews. The oft-told legend is that it was St Rulewho brought the relics to Fe in the fourth century. He was the bishop of the Greek city of Patras, where St Andrew was crucied.The story tells us he had a dream in which he was told that the relics of the saint, which he was the custodian of, were in danger and he must set sail with them. The dream told him that wherever he was shipwrecked, there the relics would find their new home.After months at sea, his ship was wrecked at Kilrymont in Fe. And so he established a new shrine and re-named the place St Andrews. No mention of a Northumbrian abbot, or relics from Hexham in this story!What are we to believe  There is often a haze between history and legend and they sometimes meet in a place too misty for us to see. Historical truth can be an elusive creature. You think you have grasped it when suddenly it slips away, leaving you searching once again. And sometimes a lost historical truth is to be found hidden in a legend.In the tale of St Andrewrsquos relics, history will side with the abbot, I suspect, but the romanticised and dramatic tale of St Rule has become the more popular and well-known explanation.But the reason for this is another story in itself.With thanks to Anna Blair, whose tale lsquoSaint and Saltirersquo inspired my research into this story."},{"url":null,"title":"council-planners-accused-of-having-a-lack-of-knowledge-of-their-own-policy","story":"A planning application to build the three-bedroom home and a detached garage on the outskirts of Camptoun Holdings, a small hamlet two miles north of Haddington, was refused by the local authority for the second time in five years.However, the applicants have now lodged an appeal in which they claim the planning officer who turned them down did not understand the policyused to make that decision.They claim that the house, which would be built on land currently occupied by derelict agricultural buildings, should be classed as an ldquoenabling development because they say it would improve the area.In an appeal which will be heard by the councilrsquos Local Review Body next month, they state: ldquoThe planner, in the pre-application response, did not accept that the proposed development was an enabling development.ldquoHowever, it is submitted that this conclusion only serves to demonstrate the lack of knowledge of the development process.ldquoTo allow for the removal of derelict buildings and reclamation of an unkempt siterequires third-party intervention.ldquoThe applicant is submitting a proposal for a single dwelling house and garage absorbing the costs of demolition and reclamation.ldquoThe development will bring substantial improvements to this rural brownfield land and improve landscape quality as well as visual and residential amenity.East Lothian Council has a planning policy which bars new housing in the countryside unless exceptional circumstances can be established.The plans for a house at Camptoun Holdings were first lodged with the council in .On that occasion they were refused and the Local Review Body rejected an appeal.Agents for the applicants this time around will argue that there has been a change in circumstances at the site, which has deteriorated further over the years.The Local Review Body meets in Haddington on Thursday, May ."},{"url":null,"title":"new-exhibition-highlights-history-of-musselburgh-athletic-fc","story":"The display was officially opened by Billy Brown, a former Hearts and Bradford City manager, who comes from Musselburgh and is a former Musselburgh Athletic manager, at a reception in the Old Town Hall.On show at the High Street museum is a iety of memorabilia relating to lsquoThe Burghrsquo, including trophies, medals, strips, pennants and photographs.

Even after the Damascene conversion of arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg, who used to described her deal as ldquovassalage, her final attempt to get a stripped-down Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament failed on Friday by a substantial majority. You have to give May full marks for her consistency: everything she touches turns to dust, even her own resignation.But thatrsquos by the by. As everyone has been saying: we are where we are. And where we are is extremely uncomfortable. Brexiters are gearing up to have a belly laugh at the opposition MPs, who will do their best throughout the coming week to find a compromise. Who do they think they are  Playing at being a provisional government  ldquoItrsquos like allowing the whelk stall to be run by the whelks, according to the Tory MP Sir Bill Cash. Butno-one  is able to run the eponymous stall, then all power to the whelks.Last weekrsquos indicative votes suggested that MPs are broadly in favour of a Brexit that keeps Britain in the EUrsquos economic loop while leaving the political institutions. Curiously, the SNP, who have been arguing for soft Brexit in two white papers and an election manesto, decided not to vote for the ious options, even the Norway model that they have long extolled. The SNP did, however, vote for the proposal from the Labour MP Margaret Beckett for a confirmatory ballot, and this option got the largest number of votes, much to everyonersquos surprise. This must be a serious possibility now that Parliament has failed to resolve the Brexit conundrum.However, this is not a Peoplersquos Vote as some have styled it. A confirmatory vote is not a rerun of the  referendum, but strictly a chance for voters to give their views on whatever deal Parliament agrees . The Kyle Wilson Amendment originally envisaged putting the Prime Ministerrsquos deal to a popular vote, assuming it was passed by Parliament. However, this confirmatory referendum might be dficult to schedule because it could collide with three other elections: a Tory leadership election, the European elections and a General Election. Brenda from Bristol will be in despair.EvenMPs fail to come up with a working compromise, they can still block a no-deal Brexit. The majority against leaving the EU without a deal is overwhelming. This means May, or her successor, will have to go cap-in-hand to Brussels in the next few days and request another, longer delay to Article . This would mean Britain participating in the European elections in May, which excites the Independent Group of Tory and Labour rebels, but is looked upon with dread by the main parties. Brussels too is worried about populist contagion spreading to other EU countries like Italy, but they are legally bound to make British participation a condition of any further extension to AVoter wrath, particularly in Labourrsquos leave constituencies, could lead to a dramatic revival of Nigel Faragersquos Ukip, or worse. The Svengali behind the  Vote Leave campaign, Dominic Cummings, is gearing up for the fight and reportedly suggesting a new party to fight for the right to leave. ldquoTell them again is the favoured slogan. The European elections might themselves turn into a kind of second referendum on Brexit.The Tories will presumably have a new leader by then, since Theresa May will surely go now there is to be the long extension she has resolutely opposed. Mind you, it is impossible to guess the Prime Ministerrsquos thought processes. She said she would goher withdrawal deal passed on Friday. But her gambit didnrsquot work. Even the opportunity to dispense with Mayrsquos services was not sufficient inducement for the Democratic Unionist Party to come on board. The joke doing the rounds last week was that she tried to fall on her sword and missed.But these things have a momentum of their own, and the Tory leadership election has already begun. Boris Johnson is the narrow frontrunner, but that could change. He might win the membership, but under Tory rules the parliamentary party has to agree the two candidates put to a postal ballot. The remainers in the Tory benches might use this as an opportunity to foil the hard Brexiters by keeping Boris off the list.Of course, what should happen when a government fails to get its most important legislation through Parliament is not a leadership election, but a General Election. The government cannot govern and, even with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, this should lead to a General Election via a vote of no confidence. Some Conservatives might prefer to fight a General Election than European elections they had promised would never take place. But events are now out of everyonersquos control.Everyone, that is, except the EU, which now holds Britainrsquos future in the balance. Itrsquos trying not to crow about Britainrsquos abject national humiliation, but the , not the UK Parliament, will now decide the UKrsquos immediate future: deal or no deal. If MPs agree this week to back a soft Brexit involving the customs union and alignment with the single market, Brussels has promised to fast-track it in a matter of days. But the alternative, a long extension, will also suit the European Union.That means more money from Britainrsquos budget contribution, and serves as a warning to other EU countries about the dangers of trying to leave the Union. It also holds out the possibility of Britain remaining in the EU,a referendum is eventually staged.Well, that remains to be seen. What is perhaps more likely is that Britain gets stuck indefinitely in a long extension. It emerged last week that the Democratic Unionist Party, which again voted against Mayrsquos withdrawal deal, could live with a long extension. Indeed, they signalled that they could live with a customs union ndash as long as it ensured no border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP may be Brexiters, but they are ardent Unionists first.A soft Brexit may now be the best way of keeping the UK together. But it should be put to the people in a confirmatory vote,for no other reason than this was not what most people thought they were voting for in . MPs have the opportunity to decide this tomorrow.How and why Theresa May failed to seek the only kind of Brexit that could get through Parliament will be left for historians to judge.

Not even in Scotland, as it turns out, where only coins have legal weight. According to the Bank of England, both coins and Bank of England notes are legal tender south of the border, with anything  a ldquomatter of agreement between the parties involved.

For Hunter, though, the emptiness of the strath, north of the Dornoch Firth in Sutherlandrsquos east, is plain wrong. He points to the fields below us.ldquoYou could live herethere was a house you could afford, next to the loch with a beautul view, he says. ldquoThe Arsquos four miles away, so is the railway ndash this isnrsquot the back of beyond. If effort was put in, it could happen.He points again, to Carrol, a couple of cottages across Loch Brora. In , months after the once-thriving township was cleared and its homes destroyed, the Countess of Sutherland came here, then wrote to her husband, the Marquess of Stafford, of her ldquomelancholy at the sight. The couple would later become the Duke and Duchess of Sutherland, and were the most notorious proponents of the Clearances.ldquoI find it extraordinary, says Hunter. ldquoThe countess writes about it almost asitrsquos an act of God that the place was devastated and in ruins but it was that way because she and her husband had ordered to it to be.Hunterrsquos a historian and a Highlander, and has a deep knowledge of the dark blot on Scotlandrsquos story when much of the population was removed from the land to make way for sheep but for him itrsquos much more than history: the Clearances are something which can at least in part be undone. Land such as this has only been deserted for  years after millennia of occupation, and to him that means it can and should be inhabited again, a process which has become known as ldquore-peopling.He is an influential figure: author of  books on the Highlands and islands, he was the first director of the University of the Highlands and Island Centre for History, and from - was chairman of government development agency Highlands and Islands Enterprise.Now the idea of re-peopling is gaining traction, with substantial Scottish Government backing, and potential changes to planning rules.But can people be brought back to stabilise fragile communities, re-inhabit deserted glens and islands, and bring them to le again As the crow flies itrsquos  miles from Brora to the island of Ulva, off the coast of Mull. What they have in common is near-emptiness, and whatrsquos happening in Ulva is seen as a test case in re-peopling.Rhuri Munro shows me the rented home he shares with his we, Rebecca, and their children Matilda and Ross.ldquoThe walls are starting to crumble, and therersquos constant damp, he says. The leaky roof brought the ceiling down in the childrenrsquos bedroom, and they were moved to the spare room, done up at the familyrsquos expense.They donrsquot need the Raeburnrsquos heat in summer butthey donrsquot run it condensation builds up. Rhuri stabs a finger at a flaking wooden window frame: ldquoTherersquos no insulation. All the windows need replacing. You have to keep pumping your own money in and it got to the stage where we werenrsquot going to do that again.The only other inhabitant of Ulva, pensioner Barry George, lives in a cottage with its own maintenance problems. The Munros say other inhabitants left the island in recent years because of poor rented housing.If the remainder had left it would have completed a process started in . That was when Francis William Clark bought the island. In  years he reduced the population of  to . Roofs were burned to stop families ing Clark carried out evictions in person, acquiring a reputation for callousness.His family sold Ulva in  to the Howards, and it was the Howardsrsquo alleged failure to maintain homes, and lack of security of tenure, that made the Munros back a community buyout when Jamie Howard put it on the market in . For the Munros it was simple: they feared being cleared out by a new owner, like their predecessors. Rebecca says: ldquoWe saw the buyout as our only real option of control.The Duchess, the Highland Clearances, the housekeeper ... and a story to make you weepWhen, after a year of worry for the islanders, the Scottish Governmentrsquos Scottish Land Fundmade a pound.m grant, the buyout could go ahead. On June , , a couple of hundred people gathered on Ulva to celebrate its completion.The grant put the island at the forefront of the re-peopling movement. The SLF, set up to help community buyouts, paid it to the North West Mull Community Woodland Company , the organisation that actually made the purchase.To get the grant it put forward a plan for a major increase in population. As well as proposing to reinhabit existing island houses, the plan says new crofts can be established, and self-builders can have plots, with a long-term target of  people living on the island.One of the people who drew up the plan was community land consultant Calum Macleod, now policy officer for umbrella group Community Land Scotland, and a leading proponent of re-peopling.For him, spending public money to let people live lives many urban dwellers would envy is a matter of maintaining important ersity, vital to stop the inexorable draw of towns and cities.He believes Ulva is a test case: ldquoIt offers an opportunity to show where the potential can be realised for re-peopling and repopulating, he says. ldquoItrsquos not somewhere that is a wild area, there are existing houses, but itrsquos a good example of what can be done.Yorkshireman Ian Hepburn is one of the people charged with re-peopling Ulva. Hersquos a director of NWMCWC, which has forestry land and woodland crofts on Mull, and also chairs CLS. He lives at Dervaig on Mull, eight miles from Ulva.Hepburn meets me at the Ulva jetty a few months after the buyout and we roar off on a quad-bike tour of empty properties the company now owns.Plans to regenerate lost townships decimated by the Highland ClearancesAs well as cottages, there is the big house, with five main bedrooms plus ldquoservantsrsquo quarters. It echoes and the decorrsquos tatty but the property is sound: one idea is to lease it as a small family-run hotel. The old Manse, last lived in eight years ago, is decaying but Ardalum House, used briefly as a tourist hostel, could almost open for business tomorrow.Hepburn says more than  people have expresed interest in living on Ulva. ldquoThe reality and the ambition are not always in line but we will get people for sure wanting to live here when we get houses redeveloped.ldquoThe key thing is they wonrsquot be holiday homes, we want families in them, living and working. With modern telecommunications the location doesnrsquot make much dference to what you do for a living, so wersquore confident we can end up with a ing, living island relatively quickly.Many of the ideas for creating work here are tourism based, but crofts based on the productive land could each provide part of a living.ldquoWe donrsquot want to be modern-day lairds, Hepburn adds. ldquoWe want to create the potential for other people to run a business here to bring the le back.Back in Strath Brora, Jim Hunter points out that re-peopling has happened before, with the creation of crofts by the Government for former soldiers after the First World War, in Skye, the outer isles and where.Hunter says Strath Brorarsquos farmland, neglected for two centuries could be revived, and like Hepburn, believes other work will follow, with internet links a major factor.Pointing to a growing population on Skye, Hunter says when homes are available, people will come and then find or create work.Up the strath at the remains of the former schoolhouse ndash two long, tumbled walls overgrown with bracken ndash Hunter looks south to a wind farm. That kind of development too can provide funds to underpin a community, ldquo it is owned by the community, the money stays here and doesnrsquot go to an outside company.Could more community buyouts, of the Ulva type, foster more re-peopling  The islands of Eigg and Gigha have seen populations grow by % in recent years, as has Knoydart: all three are community owned. On Eigg people who want to live there do find work: some incomers farm but others are journalists, run tourist accommodation, bike hire and craft businesses, recording studios, a brewery...Hunter is a community land enthusiast but he acknowledges a problem with Ulva, Eigg, Gigha and Knoydart as templates for his ideas. ldquoCommunity buyouts can only happen where there is a community, and in places that were comprehensively cleared there are no communities.So, he says, while ownership is an issue, and a change can bring more people in, more fundamental is planning regulations.ldquoOur planning regime tends to the view that a locality such as this in Strath Brora where there is nobody living, should remain one where no-one is living, and houses and businesses are only to be encouraged where there are houses and businesses already.ldquoI can understand that but I think itrsquos not impossible to envisage these things happening in localities where people lived not all that long ago in historical termsldquoIf you look around us here there is no lack of land, there are millions of acres in the Highlands doing not an awful lot, producing not very much. When you think a very small plot where the planners have said you can build a house in many parts of the Highlands now would sell for pound,, there is something completely bizarre about it when there is so much empty land.ldquoIn any real sense that landrsquos real worth should be pound to pound ... We need to revise the planning system and make it easier for people to get house sites.He says to make it easier for people, especially young people, to live in the Highlands the Scottish Government must put together legal and planning frameworks to ensure housing can be built and the system gives priority to social and community need, not private gain.ldquoThe mechanics are not rocket science. Whatrsquos required, but what sometimes seems to be in as short supply as affordable homes, is the political will.That political will is developing: amendments agreed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos proposed Planning Bill by Holyroodrsquos Local Government and Communities Committee include giving Scottish Ministers a duty to take into account the importance of resettling rural Scotland, and of making land available for resettlement. Others, including one to let local councils include re-population as an aim in their planning blueprints, are still on the table.Historian Sir Tom Devine on what really happened during the clearancesWhen I test Hunterrsquos ideas on Brora local history enthusiast Nick Lindsay, another student of the Clearances, he is sceptical about re-population, for Strath Brora at least. He says there are few jobs in the area, adding: ldquoThere would be a huge cost of infrastructure: I donrsquot see where the money would come from. Itrsquos a romantic notion but I think the practicalities are too hard to overcome.Hersquos not the only sceptic: Ulvarsquos Jamie Howard, now a flat-dweller in Edinburgh, says of re-peopling: ldquoIt has become a bit of an obsession with the government and an exercise in flag-waving, with this willingness to wind the clock back to the Clearances. On Ulva, the SNPrsquos ideal would be an island full of people with the right accent, singing from the same hymn sheet.But Sarah Jane Laing, chief executive of landownersrsquo group Scottish Land and Estates, takes a conciliatory tone, saying her members are the biggest housing providers in the countryside and would be happy to see more homes: ldquoWersquove got members all over the Highlands and Islands desperately trying to get planning permission for housing, she says.ldquoThose of us working in land management and land reform are not that far apart ndash what we and Community Land Scotland wants is to have sustainable rural communities.Hunter says resettlement of now-wild areas can go hand-in-hand with better environmental stewardship, pointing to estate records showing wildle was more ied and prolic when Strath Brora was heavily inhabited.Perhaps surprisingly the John Muir Trust wild land charity broadly agrees, even though re-peopling could mean homes on ldquowild land.The Trustrsquos chief executive, Andrew Bachell, says truly remote areas are unlikely to be re-inhabited: ldquoMost of what you would want to do to improve the ecology would involve having people there to manage it, he says. ldquoIf wersquore talking about more people in the north-west Highlands I donrsquot think therersquos any conflict with that and the rewilding agenda, in fact wild land will be one of the reasons people want to live there.While sceptics will always question the level of Government spending on near-empty Ulva when there are other pressing needs, the people at the sharp end donrsquot doubt the dference the re-peopling project will make.Rebecca Munrorsquos battered home on Ulva will be renovated as part of the drive to improve housing stock, and she can invest more in the Boathouse Restaurant next door that she runs with sister-in-law Emma McKie.I catch the strength of emotion in Rebeccarsquos voice when she talks of a future with other children to play with hers in the evening after the ferry has stopped running. Therersquos emotion there too when she speaks of the buyoutrsquos place in history.One of her favourite places on the island is known as Starvation Point, where th-century residents cleared from their old homes and too old or too sick to leave were left to fend for themselves.ldquoItrsquos sad but itrsquos also a really inspirational place, Rebecca says. ldquoA couple of times when things got really dficult with the buyout process I went down there and I thought, lsquothese people didnrsquot have any of these opportunities wersquove had, so just suck it up and get on with it, because you can do something and they couldnrsquot.rsquoldquoItrsquos very dficult not to get upset or angry about at what was done. The villages and townships are still very visible. When the Clearances happened those people had no rights and they had no comeback about what was happening, so there was definitely a bit of righting the wrongs that were done then, in our buyout.Where did the money come from The grant of pound. million by the Scottish Government to buy Ulva was a statement of intent about re-population. But how did it come about, and did connections between Government, grant-givers and the buyout group play a part After Ulva went on the market in , the Government, unusually, put the sale on hold. Then, in October , it allowed North West Mull Community Woodland Companyto register an interest in the estate as a community buyout objective, to allow it a clear run at a deal. This is normally done before any suggestion of a sale.A bid for pound.m went to the Scottish Land Fund , which can give pound million a year of Government cash to community buyouts. Its normal upper limit for single grants is poundm, but the fund backed the bid and referred it to ministers. It was approved in May .The chair of the SLF committee, which decides grants, is John Watt. He emphasises the SLF is run independently of government.ldquoWe had to take quite a few things into consideration, the impact on the budget, the wider land reform policy, as well as the intrinsic merits of the case, he says. ldquoOur decision was that given all the factors and given our understanding of the policy context for Government objectives to ersy the land ownership pattern ... we should recommend that this should be approved.He says the fund was aware a huge grant for Ulva could hit worthy smaller projects, but the government indicated extra money would be availableUlva went ahead.In fact, the Scottish Government says, a poundm underspend on the SLFrsquos budget in - was allowed to be carried over into -, to cover most of the Ulva cash.Meanwhile those involved in the bid say they maintain a professional distance between dferent aspects of their work, and no undue influence was brought to bear on the Scottish Government or the SLF.Calum MacLeod was a member of the Scottish Land Fund committee from its start in  until March . In July  he was engaged as one of three consultants to write the feasibility study submitted to the fund by NWMCWC to support the Ulva bid.Since then he has become part-time policy officer for Community Land Scotland , the prominent umbrella group that makes much of its income from work for the Scottish Government. He previously carried out projects for CLS, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the Scottish Parliament. He says there is no suggestion his connections helped propel the Ulva grant application.Duncan MacPherson, who has worked extensively with community buyouts and was another of the Ulva consultants, is a member of the SLF committee, and was when the Ulva application was submitted.He declared an interest and took no part in discussions about Ulva, saying: ldquoI went on the committee to make sure people with experience of the sector took part in decisions ... The committee met separately to discuss the Ulva bid and I wasnrsquot even in the building.Ian Hepburn, a director of NWMCWC, also chairs CLS.Hepburn says: ldquoIn terms of did I take an active part in [the SLF grant application] or speak to anyone at the Scottish Government about it, I absolutely did not."},{"url":null,"title":"15-best-family-days-out-this-easter-across-scotland","story":".

Named Trix ndash after the former Dutch queen Beatrix ndash it is among three of the most complete T. rex skeletons to exist anywhere in the world, with between - per cent of its bone volume recovered.There are only about  known specimens in total, so any tyrannosaur material found is pretty exceptional. Some of the earliest ones, for instance, only had a partial jaw. Trix is considered to be female. There is a lump just above the eye socket and it is believed that the larger the lump, the more likely the animal is female.Trix would have eaten other dinosaurs such as Triceratops. T. rex probably didnt run very fast, only about mph because the femur to tibiain the leg are very similar. Fast-running animals tend to have a much shorter femur to tibia ratio. It could have caught some of the smaller dinosaurs that didnt run very fast and would probably have scavenged and eaten dead animals too. The T. rex had a well-developed part of the brain allowing it to smell things precisely.Many early depictions of dinosaurs were as slow and lumbering creatures on four legs. Even the Megalosaurus, a big meat-eating dinosaur, was depicted as a lizard on four legs. Because the tyrannosaurus had such short limbs at the front, there is no way it could have walked about on four legs.Why T. rex had such short arms is one of these things that is unsolved. But it probably did have reasonably bulky muscles on those arms. They werent just passive and useless. They may have been used to rip flesh apart once prey was killed or while scavenging the meat off another animal. T. rex had a huge head full of teeth which were very sharp and serrated which suggests it was a meat-eater. If you compare its bite to a crocodile, it would have had roughly  times the snapping power.There are interesting pathologies about Trix, including some in vivo damage to bones such as fractures that may have occurred as it battled with other T. rex or during mating. There may have been injuries caused during its early development or from a birth defect. If you look closely on the skeleton, there is what could be a small bite to the lower jaw that has healed over. On the ribs there is distorted growth, probably due to a fracture when it was younger.It may be that Scotland is the birthplace of the tyrannosaurs. I found a tailbone of a theropod dinosaur in  and a tooth in  on Skye that may be from primitive tyrannosaurs. That was from the Middle Jurassic period, roughly  million years ago. The early ancestors of tyrannosaurs could have evolved in Scotland. And then evolved much later in the US and Russia as Tyrannosaurus. Trix is from the Cretaceous period, which was around  million years later than the Middle Jurassic.Interview with Dr Neil Clark, curator of palaeontology at The Hunterian in Glasgow University.T. rex in Town is co-organised by Glasgow Museums and The Hunterian.

To most others it was a modern tragedy born of mere happenstance. And to grateful newspaper editors it was a gorgeous picture that would carry a poster front page beneath a ser font and look magnicent the next day on a thousand news stands.More than one billion euros have been pledged to the cost of rebuilding this stricken icon of France. Among the offers of help came one from the custodians of Glasgow School of Art which has encountered its own trials by fire. Presumably, this kind gesture did not include advice on how to fit a sprinkler system.Some of the quantums were eye-watering and included  million euros from the LrsquoOreal cosmetics house as well as donations from Nissan and Prince Albert of Monaco. The worldrsquos most anointed people were rising, almost as a single organism, to come to the aid of Notre Dame, this ancient icon of timeless beauty and an emblem of all that they have tried to capture in their global brands.It would be churlish and cynical to talk of tax-breaks and virtue-signalling here but the decision to spend a few hundred million euros for the privilege of being forever associated with the repair of such a grand place will not have encountered much resistance from their marketing directors. If you required proof of how quickly very rich people can be parted with their money for the right kind of cause then you had it right here. That re-roofing a church administered by the Catholic Church, one of the richest organisations on Godrsquos earth is the lsquorightrsquo type of cause remains open to debate.The Catholic Church has lost so many of its adherents over the last few decades that it now finds itself the custodian of some highly desirable, but very empty real estate throughout western Europe. In my own neighbourhood, just north of Glasgow, a single priest administers three dferent parishes, each with a house that ranks among the grandest in the vicinity. There are thousands of these barren properties across the continent, desolate tokens of lost power and authority. If sold on the open market they would raise a sum not far away from that required to undertake the task of repairing the roof of Notre Dame .The residence of the archbishop of Edinburgh in Morningside sits amidst properties owned by JK Rowling and the most affluent scions of the capitalrsquos establishment. I visited it once and couldnrsquot tell you what purpose it serves beyond maintaining a pastor of a church that purports to represent the poor in the style of a prince. You may even wonderthe great whited sepulchre of the Vatican was what our saviour had in mind for the successors of Peter.Pope Francis has urged his clergy to adopt a much more austere and frugal lestyle as befits the successors of Jesus, a man born into poverty and persecution and who died unjustly, a wretched and forsaken man. In Scotland, as in other countries across Europe, the message of Pope Francis appears to have fallen on stony ground when you observe the splendour in which some of these princes of Rome reside. In the wake of the decades-long evil of clerical sex abuse and the iniquitous cover-ups that followed the pews have emptied but you couldnrsquot mark some of the necks of those who acquiesced in this with a blow-torch. Thus, appeals for them to live a more stripped-down existence and one closer to their flock are hardly likely to ruffle the folds of their gold-stitched vestments.In the empty space once occupied by the roof of Notre Dame and in its charred remains below itrsquos possible to see a metaphor for all thatrsquos befallen the Catholic Church. It has caved in on itself, brought down by the weight of its own arrogance and corruption. It needs reformed and re-constructed but not in the way that Notre Dame will be re-built to restore power and glory. Its renewal must result in a simpler, more humble church: one that will welcome the poor and the outcasts embrace sinners and not judge them. Those who will use it to denounce and to seek power and money should find this place to be a hostile environment.When Easter Sunday dawns tomorrow the faithful will proclaim that Christ is risen and that he is a real presence in the world today. We will also remember the  million Christians around the globe who, according to the Dutch charity Open Doors, are persecuted, suffer and die for their faith. This is a Church whose central message has prevailed over , years and which continues to be a force for great good in the world. Its humanitarian work in those places where governments fear to tread or consider beneath their concern is incalculable. It will always be hated and held to be contemptible by the ignorant the conceited and the materialistic. Its tragedy is that it has come to embrace these vices rather than abjuring them.It must re-discover unconditional love, humility and charity, those virtues that changed lives and improved nations. The world has never needed it more to be like this to resemble more closely the le of the messiah. This cannot happen though, until its priests and ministers take a long overdue vow of poverty, humility and obedience to the simple truth of the Gospel of Jesus."},{"url":null,"title":"transformed-wallace-monument-gives-new-perspective-on-scottish-hero","story":"In September , the forces of Andrew Moray and Wallace defeated the combined English armies of John de Warenne, the th Earl of Surrey, and Hugh de Cressingham, near Stirling on the River Forth.Now visitors to the National Wallace Monument can see for for the first time how the battlefield looked to Wallace as he prepared to do battle.A reconstruction of the original landscape is one of the highlights of the pound, refurbishment of the attraction to tell the story of Scotlandrsquos national hero ldquobetter than ever before.The state of the art transformation of the -year-old monumentrsquos three galleries includes the Hall of Arms, which now houses Wallacersquos medieval sword.Hundreds of visitors to the upgraded landmark on the Abbey Craig at Stirling can also experienced a range of new exhibits including a bespoke animated film, a digital coat of arms design activity and immersive displays.Brand-new sculptures of Victorian missionary Mary Slessor and the founder of the Maggiersquos cancer centres, Maggie Keswick Jencks, have also been installed in the attractionrsquos ldquoHall of Heroes.The two women were selected to be cast in stone following a public vote in  and are the first in the gallery depicting female figures.For over a century, the gallery has hosted only the busts of great Scotsmen including Robert the Bruce and the poet Robert Burns.The transformation has been managed by Stirling District Tourism , the charity that operates the historic attraction, and a team of specialist contractors led by Edinburgh-based designers Studioarc.Zillah Jamieson, SDT chair said: ldquoIn the monumentrsquos th anniversary year, we wanted to tell the story of William Wallace better than it has ever been told in the past.ldquoThe upgraded exhibition spaces will resonate with modern audiences from all over the world, through dynamic storytelling and digital enhancements.Lauren Drill, , a teacher from Philadelphia touring Scotland with a US rugby side, was among the first visitors to the newly reopened attraction.She said: ldquoThis is my first time ever in Scotland and we were watching Braveheart on the bus.

The dficult one is that they seem to see a new Boris, a more sensible and presentable Boris, made so by his latest lumber, Carrie Symonds, aged .At the time of going to press, I am far too busy to properly research what she does but a quick look on yon Google suggests it is something to do with elephants. Perhaps this is what attracted her to Boris. However, it turns out that, privately, she refers to him as ldquoBozzie Bear, after televisionrsquos Fozzie, an alleged Muppet.Not only that but she has made him less elephantine, putting him on a diet through which he has lost several tons and, for a while, looked lost in his capacious suits, which have now been replaced by svelte new ones.Hersquos also stopped drinking, which will have his hero Churchill spinning in his grave, but worst of all is what she has done to his hair. Therersquos no other way to describe it than with the horrible insult ldquonormal.Where before his barnet was tousled in a manner that made Worzel Gummidge look tidy, today it is shorter and unremarkable, making him look likewise. Indeed, the whole slim, teetotal, cofured mien has aged him about  years. Already, he looks more careworn than of old, possibly as a result of also affecting greater gravitas.

I canrsquot pretend thatrsquos been my experience.

I told him how strongly many local people felt about this, because of the impact of building a whole new road north and east of the town.“He revealed that Transport Scotland has no intention of looking again at the A options, despite the fact that they have made their case on the basis of completely out-of-date information.“Road users from Inverurie and further west know full well that the AWPR has had a major impact on the A at Inverurie, which only strengthens the case for upgrading that specic stretch of existing road.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Connie Sorrie with the award and the Greengrocer family team\"  National award for family firm viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“Ministers must listen to local people on this issue, and base any decisions on up-to-date traffic data.

Radiocarbon dating of the dog bones unearthed at Cuween has shown that the dogs were placed in the chamber more than  years after the passage tomb was built, suggesting that they were ritually buried.Steve Farrar, interpretation manager at HES, said: “Just as they’re treasured pets today, dogs clearly had an important place in Neolithic Orkney, as they were kept and trained as pets and guards and perhaps used by farmers to help tend sheep.“But the remains discovered at Cuween Hill suggest that dogs had a particularly special signicance for the farmers who lived around and used the tomb about , years ago.#Maybe dogs were their symbol or totem, perhaps they thought of themselves as the ‘dog people’.“While reconstructions have previously been made of people from the Neolithic era, we do not know of any previous attempt to forensically reconstruct an animal from this time.“Looking at this dog helps us better relate to the people who cared for and venerated these animals, people whose ingenuity and sophistication made Orkney such an important place in the Neolithic and who have left us with such a rich legacy of monuments today.”The canine reconstruction is part of a wider project to use cutting-edge technology to share the stories of Orkney’s Neolithic chambered tombs with visitors.Last year, HES published D digital models of these chambered cairns, created through photogrammetry to better reveal the sophisticated structure of these monuments with the public.This process involves taking hundreds of overlapping images which are then combined to create a D model, enabling users from anywhere in the world to explore the sites in detail online.All of this new research will form part of updated interpretation  for visitors to Orkney’s chambered cairns, including Cuween Hill, due to be installed this summer. The reconstruction itself will also be going on display in Orkney later this year.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Their guests are interested in all types of accommodation, from hotels and guesthouses, to BBs and self-catering, and most will arrive with their own or hired cars.#They have the flexibility to explore areas off the busy, well-beaten tracks and taking a local guide with them or booking a private or scheduled tour is a popular way to do this.#She added: #Once operators understand how much there is to see and do in Orkney and how many islands there are, in addition to the wonderful food, drink and crafts we have, they appreciate why we recommend three to four-night stays as a minimum for their guests.”Ms Tulloch said that Destination Orkney hoped to build on the opportunities the travel trade industry was now offering to Orkney by running future workshops for tourism members locally.“We’d like all our members to be aware of the potential this section of the industry presents and to equip them with the necessary tools and knowledge they will needthey would like to work effectively with the travel trade,” she explained.Joining Ms Tulloch on the Orkney stand at the Expo were travel trade consultant, Kathleen Hogarth, Destination Orkney members Hazel Aim and Fidra Sym of Orkney Heritage Tours, and Destination Orkney chairman and hotelier Gareth Crichton.Expo was also attended by Pentland Ferries, NorthLink Ferries, John O’ Groats Ferries and representatives from Shetland, forming a strong presence for the Northern Isles.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the event of any archaeological discoveries of interest, SSEN Transmission has said it is committed to ensuring these are fully documented, preservedpossible, with the findings shared with interested parties.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If part of the territory of a Member State would cease to be part of that state because it were to become a new independent state, the Treaties would no longer apply to that territory. In other words, a new independent state would, by the fact of its independence, become a third country with respect to the EU and the Treaties would no longer apply on its territory.”i.e we shall be automatically out of the EU # with #NO DEAL# # from Independence Day.Have the EU’s treaties changed, meanwhile  No.However, it#sjoining rules have changed. It will take us, at least, ten years to rejoin, accepting the euro, the Common FIsheries Policy and austerity invoking budget restrictions to manage our large budget deficit.So why is the SNP stamping about, #greetin der een oot#, about Scots #being dragged out of the UK against their wishes#, when their defining policy, independence, will take us out, unlikely, ever to rejoin Humbug!# EA_Scotland_and_the_EU#Whether or not one is in favour of Brexit, how many people truly knew what they were voting for in   Misinformation and disinformationflew about like panic stricken puffins and some politicians loved it.So much of what was involved came to light over the time which has elapsed and STILL confusion reigns. Thank goodness the leadership during the Second World War was not as pathetic as the present incumbents are.Meanwhile, those nations over the other side of the English Channel must be wondering why the Brits are allowing themselves to be so humiliated ..What about the  that stayed away# So very true today.Spot on Ian !! Voters don’t always get the chance to change the government, but they may want the chance to change their mind.You may be cheering the overturning of the democratic vote now, butthey get away with it we will all be losers. Be careful what you wish for you may just get it.Well, the #Put it to the People# march was in London in that there England, so I#m unsure why Quitters are making an issue of the numbers. The debate afterwards was billed as an open debate, and only one cockney Quitter spoke, so make what you like of that.Why go to the unnecessary effort of changing my mind  Parliament, the commentariat and most of the mainstream media seems perfectly happy to do that for me. And while they’re at it why not move the goal posts, change the game and rewrite the rules as you go along. Quintessentially EUropean modus operandi.Our major export markets are Japan and China. That is unlikely to change either.British markets of old will not be ing to the past and arguments made that this will happen is extreme naiveté.The commonwealth is far bigger than Australia. Much of it developing economies expanding far far faster than Australia is or ever will. You are right though Oz will have to keep selling to China because China owns vast swathes of Ozzy industry and mining. I for one will be delightedwe have a much closer links with Australia, New Zealand but they are hardly super stars of economic growth.I do not know of a single UK made item in any of my families ious homes.Ali says “ theyget away with itwe will all be losers”. Boo-hiss! Really  If Boris, Farage, Rees-Mogg and chums get away with it most folk will be worse off, with the few laughing all the way to their offshore banks. And that’s the point # them taking control to profit from their vision of a backwards looking low-tax-for-the-rich Britain of biddable serfs. Ali should be careful whose bidding he is doing by defending May’s hollow deal.Perhaps my previous point might distress Ali lessI rephrased it. Not all of the electorate who seek a change of government achieve this at election time. That’s parliamentary elections for you, particularly under first last the post. We get one day of enjoying the freedom of maybe changing the government and have to put up with the outcome for some years before the next time. However, in the terms of this referendum # brought on to placate those ideologues who bankrolled lawbreaking in their dishonest campaign, well # some folk might have changed their minds + days on. Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever. Why not make sure we really want it Peter, you so waffle on! Ignoring your obviously obsessive-compulsive dogma, reference Boris, Farage,biddable serfs and assorted socialist claptrap, I will take issue on one point only here. Your  statement,#Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever#, that is manest nonsense. After Brexit, Europe will still exist. The EU, on present developments, may well implode at any minute. Spain, Greece, Italy even Franceseem to be moving away from the suffocating mire of Brussels, Junker, Barnier and undemocratic cabals of theEU. Brexit would never be forever It is just the start of an equitable move towards democratic change and true democracy in Europe, not the present cartel of faceless unelected bureaucratic parasites and overpaid freeloaders.You keep harping on about Boris, Nigel and Jacob asthey were the only proponents of brexit. You steadfastly ignore the other . million people because of course you obviously are so much smarter and nicer than them so their votes don#t count. What I wonder is what will the political elites decide to ignore next time we votethey get away with it this time. How about we have a vote about the SCT andwe don#t like the outcome we vote again until we do get the result we want. Or may until they get the result they want which is contrary to what you want. How does democracy work in your fantasist mind Marc Petit, Superstars! I love Aus but economic Superstars, what planet are you on  Australia has a masive land mass, fantastic mineral resources yet is so outperformed financially by India, Canada, and with half the GDP of the UK . As my Aus brother would say, #A few stubbies short of a six-pack. A few sandwiches short of a picnic#. Now get real your comment marc,#we are superstars of growth # it must have been a petit and low starting point  years back.@Mark Petit,Thanks for that, very interesting. Do you think that the Australia-Japan Economic Partnership is helpful by removing tarfs from Japanese goods imported into Australia and vice versa for your agricultural exports to Japan  Whereas having no trade deal with the EU presumably means that goods from both parties are subject to tarfs  The EU is very protective of its agriculture.I#m assuming Australia would find a UK trade deal helpful by removing UK tarfs on your agricultural produce e.g. fruit and wine, and making British goods much cheaper to Australians than they are now What a wonderful attitude and comment from Marc Petit, #These goods Japan et al are cheaper and generally regarded as better .# as our goods are all manufactured under EU protocols and Marc claims are clearly poor quality, just another really good reason to move on. I quote, World Financial Review # Australia has become one of the first countries to finish signing off trade deals with Britain# and The Financial Times, #Australia to fast-track UK trade pact in event of no-deal Brexit# so you see petit comments from Mr Petit,are just that and no more.!!So, Boris Johnson has now changed his mind. Let’s respect his right to do so, but couldn’t the public have done so too And May took her deal twice to the Commons,but she won’t take it once to the commoners. At least you know where you are with the Tories # kind of.Only % of voters think May’s deal is a good deal, but we are meant to shut up and swallow it,her party can back it,she’ll go. How dare anyone speak up against this insulting nonsense Ali’s alt-right guided jibes are remarkably handy. Non-fantasist Ali draws a telling distinction between self-interested Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg on one hand, the “political elite” on another hand,and the millions who fell for the demonstrablelies of the Brexit campaign cheats on yet another hand still. I am not of course forgetting those voters. I’m pointing out who misled them and why.To adapt Roald Dahl: these laddies from the upper crust. Does he really not see that they are political and elite  It’s troubling.Ali might care to note I am not calling him a member of the alt-right here, buthe continues to unthinkingly parrot their offensive arguments conclusions will be drawn. Non-obsessivecompulsive Ian might similarly do well to dwell on the benefits of avoiding ad hominem arguments. Whilst he has managed at times to play the ball not the man, Ian sadly is more than habitually inclined to foul, and thereby be judged foul in turn. If he repeatedly takes the same self-defeating approach and expects a dferent result# well conclusions may also be drawn. Can’t these lads raise their game Again you only want democracypeople vote the way you tell them. That#s not democracypeter has got it wrong again there was no cheating in the leave side#What started out as a witch-hunt by the political establishment in what they thought was the largest political scandal investigating Cambridge Analytica and Goddard Gunster’s alleged involvement in the Leave.EU referendum campaign, has today been proven to be . Instead, the Electoral Commission fined us on technicalities and an overspend of £,, not the £, originally presented by them on £ million overall spend. The fines were reduced and the Judge accepted the technical breaches were ‘mistakes’ rather than calculated wrong-doings and crucially held there were ‘no findings that Leave.EU had been dishonest.#”#.Does Ian mean the .m who were lied to by self-serving cheats  Ian might be interested in this from the Chair of The British Medical Association’s Public Health Medicine Committee:The referendum result was NOT #the will of the people# # certainly not following the revelations since.Thank you for asking the people to vote again.Can we also put it to the people in Shetlandthey still want to live inside a windfarm  How many times do we get to vote Past comments on referendums from David Davis MP could soothe or enrage frustrated Leavers. Speaking to parliament in  he said: We should not ask people to vote on a blank sheet of paper and tell them to trust us to fill in the details afterwards. For referendums to be fair and compatible with our parliamentary process, we need the electors to be as well informed as possible and to know exactly what they are voting for.#theyworkforyou says former Brexit Minsiter Davis received £, for  hours work for JCB this year, and that he generally voted against a statutory register of lobbyists. Coincidence  Maybe not. Does Ian still insist rich and powerful Brexit-backers aren#t out for themselves #neo-fascist German AfD party leader# revolting female, but elected to the German Parliament, I repeat elected!!! Now, Peter, can you see the reason we need out. Even you must now see what the E Union is doing with its Proportional Representation and revolting political systems. Neo-Nazi elected into the German Parliament, enough said.Fascism cannot be defeated by nationalist-navel gazing. The far-right are cooperating across Europe, trying to heighten a sense of crisis and undermine confidence in the institutions which they hope to control. Ian#s approach isn#t simply ahistoric. It is dangerously naive. His phrase #revolting female# normalises misogyny.Recognising the threat, not allowing ourselves to be ided and working with our neighbours to the greater good is the only way to keep the far-right at bay internationalism, standing together, kindness, respect. It is less than two years since Farage was speaking at an AfD rally. Ian should be more skeptical about the real motives of the brains behind Brexit. The David Davis#s quote shows they knew what they were about. Rich financiers, newspaper magnates and populist politicians have schemed together to break electoral law, lie to and manipulate the public to bring Britain to this precipice. Meanwhile all some have had to add is jeers. That said, Ian did manage to make his last ill-considered contribution without needless insult. Hopefully, now that he can see who has been pulling his strings, he will be able to accept he has been had. The referendum wasn#t won. It was stolen. Dangerous days are ahead.##and who keeps the far left, or even just the left for that matter, at bay Extreme left, extream right. Two sides of the nastextremist coin There is no dference, the sad thing is what Alice Weidel said was and isperfectly true on this occasion. If the European Union#sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable , way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for. The reality #the brains behind Brexit# or rather the driving force, that would be Tony Blair, Osbourne, Cameron, Junkers, Barnier, Tusk, Salmond. Sturgeon et al. They are the ones that did so much to alienate the UK public. They are still doing just that.Aprime example today from Junker, # April is the ultimate deadline for approval of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons,# Juncker told the European Parliament. #A #no-deal# at midnight on the th of April is now a very likely scenario. It is not the outcome I want. But it is an outcome for which I have made sure the EU is ready.# Just food for thought does that mean Junker has a special place in Hell reserved as Tusk previously intermated !!!Er, dunno Michael. Of late the whiter-than-white far-right have distracted the nation away from dwelling on the harms of austerity with a isive, dishonest Brexit campaign that’s resulted in unparalleled spikes in hate crime, Muslims attacked at prayer, Europeans and U.K. born citizens told to go back to where they came from, malicious devices left of train tracks, a plot to murder an MP and the murder of another. The left largely seem intent on taxing the rich, investing in public services, ending poverty, housing thehomeless, reducing demand on food banks and educating the ignorant. If that ever becomes a problem I’ll give Michael’s question some thought. Until then equating the left with the far right doesn’t seem quite fair.Btw. has anyone heard Ian describe Farage as a repulsive male  Farage might be described a repulsive person or man but never a repulsive male.For some reason the term “female” in Shetland social media is chosen as a pejorative.There is quite a bit of work to be done before the repulsive elements of the present era are behind us.Meanwhile the rich are set to increase their share of global wealth from % to % by .So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Non-revolting Ian attacks the leader of German#s AfD, then agrees with her.He holds that Cameron wasn#t given enough concessions by the bad EU to feed his far-right Tories, and that Cameron is also to blame. You can#t weaken fascists by giving them what they want. Its not in the nature of the beast.Labour MP Rosie Cooper, target of a neo-Nazi murder plot, was praised in the House of Commons yesterday by the Home Secretary and the Leader of the House. In her speech she thanked the organisation #HOPE not hate# who campaign against racism and fascism, who helped to save her le.The title highlights the far-right#s aim to create the sense of alienation which Ian so willingly feeds. Ian has outed himself. Little more needs said, other than that at least with PR the far-right do their work in plain sight. In the UK they lurking within the Conservative Party and tell themselves they#re free thinkers.Dennis Skinner, Tony Benn, George Galloway, Kate Hoey etc etc etc according to Peter these are far right racists for wanting to leave the undemocratic euAccording Bernie Sanders,an open door immigration policy is incompatible with a welfare state. According to Peter this makes him a far right fascist.It is such a shame Peter Hamilton has to lie so. His words #So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Ian has outed himself.# Please, Peter, make an effort at simple honesty! The fact I agreed with a few words from Alice Weidel does not wed me to her views and rancid opinions which you are not so very stupid as not to know. So stop being so pathetic and be a little less disengeneous.O dear me, Peter is rather wandering off the point with his petit and puerile criticisms. I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I share some of his, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to John S Bercow#s comments on a repulsive male, Alt-Right football thug and ex-convict Tommy Robinson,. Bercow#s words in the House# Tommy Robinson as #a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent inidual#. Now there we have a repulsive maleon the right sadly there are more than enough violent and repulsive Marxist–Leninist terrorism, both male and female on the left. As I previously stated, extreme left and right, opposite sides of the same nasty coin. Revolting females and revolting male are plenty on both sides. Revolting people of both genders exist, only Peter with his pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation as,#Hisphrase “revolting female” normalises misogyny.Peter Hamilton, for your information, I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I indeed share some of his views, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to Alt-Right, football thug, Tommy Robinson. To mimic House Speaker, John S Bercow, #Tommy Robinson is#a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent male. There are repulsive males and females on both sides of the political spectrum. Gender is not an issue! Only you, Peter Hamilton with your pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation referencing my comment about a truly revolting female.. One whom is an active racist, white supremacist, elected to serve in a European parliament.What explains right-minded Ian’s double standards  Doesn’t he realise Farage and Weidel are both far-right extremists  It appears there is little to set Weidel and Farage apart except that one is a bigoted German woman and the other a bigoted English man.Hopefully Ian will want to reconsider his appreciation of Farage.I have no particular appreciation of any politician however I would just say I appreciate honesty, not your strongest gt Peter Hamilton!Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians as any reasonable person can see. Just because they do not share your own particular brand of left-wing zealotry does not make them right-wing bigots. I would advise you to look at the definition of a bigot and then take a long hard look in the mirror! Before anyone states the obvious, I am intolerant of racists, Islamophobics, sectarianism and anyone who subverts democracy with disinformation and dishonesty. Sadly there is plenty of all that sht around. If that makes me intolerant towards those holding dferent opinions,they are those as mentioned earlier, I rejoice in that.Will Ian really not condemn Farage’s racist anti-migrant poster   What evidence does Ian have to show Farage and Weidel are not the same brand  It’s a poster the AfD would have been equally proud of. Is Ian really now saying Weidel is not a right-wing bigot  It’s no time since he said she was “revolting”. It’s a word I’d rather apply to Farage’s poster and the views it represents. How does Ian justy applying it to Weidelnot for behaving in ways similar to Farage  I would not think any less of Ian were he to show himself capable of changing his mind about Farage as fresh information emerges. Any reasonable person would. Perhaps Ian yet believes Farage was never a racist. Presumably Ian doesn’t simply find Farage’s views tolerable because heas a white British nationalist is an all round good bloke  Where does Ian stand on Farage’s warm embrace of the views of Le Pen   Will Ian really not condemn that poster,not the man behind it  It’s ok to be intolerant of racism Ian, it really is.I consider your silly poster, I do not like it at all! I also dislike some of the dishonest troop on the photos on this blog. For example Gary Robinson for his dishonest campaign for the Council . Jonathon Wills for his dishonest statement that I alone held up Viking Energy . Yes Peter, it, however, takes more than one poster to show the merits of a person. I recommend Farage for his stand against Islamophobia and leaving UKIP, once UKIPbedded Tommy Robinson. If Farage is Xenophobic he has a strange choice for a we and girlfriendI condemn most of all your dishonesty and  statements above.Weidel, Farage and Tinkler all agree “If the European Union’sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable, way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for.“ Weidel, Farage and Tinkler have a shared appreciation of what is reasonable # giving the far-right what they want. Cameron got concessions, just not enough to appease the far-right ERG tail that’s been wagging the Tory dog and Farage. It’s really not the EU to blame for getting us into this mess, but that is what Tinkler, Farage and Weidel want us to believe. Cameron should have stood up to those on his right like John Major did before him. Instead he appeased them and somehow Europe is to blame  This buckpassing feeds into a neo-fascist narrative. Rees Mogg called Weidel’s speech “interesting”. What’s interesting is that Tinkler falls for an argument Rees Mogg highlighted and then tried to distance himself from. What’s interesting is that Ian blames mainstream politicians, not the far-right for alienating the public. Can he really not see their game  “Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians”. Really Ian  Do you still think that It is not yet clear whether politically correct Ian needs to learn more about Farage before he will condemn him in the same terms as he did “revolting female” Weidel. The facts suggest both deserve an equal opportunity to wither under Ian’s singular brand of enlightened scorn. Ian may or may not be revolted by Farage’s thoughts on the prospect of having Romanians for neighbours or on Farage’s anti-Semitic attacks on George Soros. Ian will likely recall seeing posters defaming that philanthropist during Ian’s own well publicised whoop whoop visit to Hungary. These posters, which portray Soros as an untrustworthy Jewish money lender, were paid for by Hungary’s far-right racist party which has taken control of the Hungarian media and parliament. Anyone wondering whether Farage dfers much from Weidel need wonder no more.If Ian is looking for revolting enemies of democracy he could look back at the ious characters I have provided him with information about over the last few months in the not quite Pygmalion hope that, underneath it all, Ian is a rational human being who can be reasoned with, and can therefore change both his mind and potentially even his unapologetically needlessly confrontational counterproductive approach.Peter@s obsession seems now to be about me now!. My #Whoop whoop# visit to Hungary was not an SOE mission but to a Hungarian friends wedding!Hungarian political posters, I understood not one all were in Hungarian! . Peter talks about antisemitic views. Peter#s beloved Labour party has well publicised anti-semitic views that appear far worse and more contemporaneous than any comment Farage may or may not have made. I note Peter claims thatHungary has a far-right racist party, well Peter that is all part a parcel of the EU and I understand was democratically elected. The thing that I find amusing here is Peter so compulsively obsessively references, his words, #neo-fascist#! It may interest him to hear I have received threats of violence from # neo-fascist right wingers online# of which a police response resulted. . Now Peter, just calm down a bit dear,I visited the USA also. I understood their posters and did not honour Trump, although I find him about as obnoxious as Corbyn, however an improvement on Salmond, Whoop whoop!!! Both have so very much in common.Trump, Salmond so very similar. just note their alleged courtship rituals . Trump pays the girls silence with his own funds, Salmond uses crowdfunding and sits on his own £millions, wonderful man to represent Scotland.Ian’s approval of Farage is the matter at hand. Farage attending an AfD rally should be enough to concern Ian. Farage distancing himself from Tommy Robinson scarcely makes Farage Mr. Clean. To be clear, it was Farage’s poster, not mine, and to call it “silly” trivialises Farage’s use of racist tactics in the referendum. This period saw a spike in racially motivated assaults and other hate crimes: a serious matter.Ian’s poster boy’s racism cannot be disproven by his choice in partners. The French and Hungarians are not regarded as lesser humans by those who think that revolting way. Farage’s abuse of Romanians # which even The Sun called racist # is another factor Ian chooses to ignore, and we don’t need to consider what Farage means by “defending Judeo-Christian values”.For Ian, Farage now saying Farage isn’t Islamophobic is good enough. Considered together with everything  Farage has said and done that is a pretty low bar. No amount of evidence will enable Ian to realise he has been taken in by a member of the far-right.Of course pointing all this out to Ian sees him again calling me obsessive. Doesn’t make him right about Farage though.A more positive role in the enacting of decisions on important topics of vital national interest needs to be found for the voters. Just casting our ballot once every few years for a representative of a political party and them going off to Westminster, Edinburgh or Brussels has been revealed by the present crisis to be nigh on meaningless. Once chosen and having shipped out the MP, MSP or MEP develops dferent priorities. The acquisition, maintenance and development of power takes precedence over local concerns and often personal ethical and moral concerns are sublimated to the service and survival of the Party. The present political stramash is the perfect example of what I am talking about. Mud slinging and arguing is getting us nowhere. Let’s look for the way forward.Careful Andrew. Well argued points are rarely welcomed here. Try being more extreme and ill informed, clueless but convinced YOUR opinion is the only correct opinion. Then tear the opposing opinion up for toilet paper.Mr Holt, this is the best on-the-button analysis that I have ever read on the Brexit process. The Brexit debate has laid bare a much deeperpolitical crises, that is ,the existential crises of future democracy in the UK itself and I do fear for that future .I am intrigued as to the motive behind Brexit, and what advantage this would be to the Conservatives and their agenda   What political advantage would there have been in leaving the EU as opposed to remaining for the Conservative Party, and is this the real reason why there was an EU Ref.in the first place Was the EU Ref. politically or economically advantageous to the Conservative Party regardless to what the people of the UK voted for      The people voted, but did they vote knowing what the aftermath would be in its entirety    The advantage to the Tories, in the short term at least, was to shut up those on the right who were agitating, causing a ided party defecting to further right associations attracting further right sympahisers support. It backfired on them though, they didn#t expect #Leave# to win, they were relying on #Remain# winning to silence the dissent. #Leave# winning caused the whole establishment to descend in to a silent panic they#re still in shock and denial from, hence the total pigs ear of the last few monthsI voted believing #Leave# in the belief it meant exactly that, close the door, walk away, build a wall up the middle of the North Sea Channel, call it what you like. Back to pre # status for everything, no exceptions, no bits and pieces held on to and dragged with us that have been conceived while part of the EEC EU.I did not know we were going to end up stuck in an eternal country destroying limbo that Westminster has dragged us in to and seem hell bent on keeping us in.Only politicians could try and convince the public they#re acting in the national interest while doing everything to destroy the country.I totally agree with your comments, Michael. It certainly has put the Conservatives into a situation where it has caused ision and political mayhem within the government as well as affecting, to a degree, other political parties. It has also weakened the basis for leaving the EU, and the aftermath, politically and economically, and the mess which has occurred thereafter. On the outset, from what I know, it did not make economic sense to leave the EU, based on the feedback, prior to the EU Ref from many British companies trading within the EU, and the possible damage it would cause  I believe % of British trade was directly with the EU, and now this figure could be vastly reduced as a consequence We are, the UK, in uncharted waters, so to speak, and it could, possibly, take years to smooth out or cause greater calamity with the EU. I hope the future relationship with the EU, does not have a negative impact on trading relationships######time shall tell, as they say. It has put the future of the EU in doubt, as other countries within the EU, also wanting to have referendums  A big problem was using a referendum to answer a complex question. Should we ban smoking in public places#  Yes No. Easy. Should we leave the EU  It’s not as simple as some pretended. Did it mean leaving in every respect  It wasn’t entirely a Yes No question. Were all the knock-on consequences clear from the start No. Some politicians are reluctant to harm the economy. Most believe Parliament is sovereign. Switzerland takes many decisions by referendum. Britain doesn’t. The public were sold a lie from the outset # that politicians would put the result above the national interest. They were sold others later, including by “trustworthy” Farage. For some, not cutting our nose off to spite our face is a matter of principle. For others, we can only get Britain back to its former splendour by going it alone # which might not turn out to be that viable. But there is financial itself interest at work for the pro-Brexit mega-rich who want a low-tax Britain, and they don’t mind turning up the volume on intolerant rhetoric to strengthen their position. Brexit or not, they’ve now strengthened their position # worrying given their aims and the repulsive means they willingly embrace.You mean the mega rich that made their fortune by evading tax and suing the NHS because they didn#t get a contract  folk like Richard Branson the prominent remoaner. Or geldof who lives in the UK tax free under non dom status Or Osbourne, Cameron, Salmond, Blaire!! I wish I was poor like them!It was a simple question. Only those who do not like the result try and pretend otherwise.#Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union #If #leave the European Union# somehow, as you try to convince us, can be interpreted as only leaving certain bits of the EU, then the same must also apply to the alternative choice of#remain a member of the European Union# and it be interpreted as only remaining within certain bits of the EU. Which would have made asking the question in the first place meaningless and pointless, as regardless which way anyone chose to vote it meant the same thing.#Leave the European Union# and #remain a member of the European Union# can only be interpreted one way, as per the dictionary definition, as the question contains no caveats. Besides, being the good old Socialists that they are in their mission to list, label and micro manage everything, you#re either a full member of the EU or you#re not. There is no mechanism or precedent to sorta half leave, but not leave everything, like you suggest. Fully in, or fully out, them be the choices.Anotherthe pro-Brexit mega-rich Torie Peter, # The former Respect Party leader and Bradford West MP tweeted that he would supporting the Brexit Party #for one-time only# as he wants to secure the UK#s departure from the EU.# Head out of tail end time perhaps!!!I think Michael will have to agree it doesn’t appear to be a question Parliament wanted this answer to! Fully in or fully out: thems not the choices no more. It’s a really big tangle because ultimately for the U.K. it is Parliament that is sovereign. For Scotland apparently it is the people that’s sovereign, so there may be a clash ahead. I’m not sure how many people voted to break up the U.K. Maybe the only solution now will be to have a confirmatory vote.#Fully in or fully out: thems not the choices no more#.Really  What are the choices then  Like I said above, those are the only two available where the EU is concerned. Which is a goodish chunk of the reason some of us voted out, you either accept everything that Brussels dictates, or reject everything Brussels dictates, participating in the things that work in your country and rejecting those which don#t isn#t an option. The EEC EU worked up to a point while some level of give and take was possible with such things, now that its not, the EU are on a fast track to implosion civil war, whichever arrives first.“What are the choices ” No idea, but, from the news, No-Deal is now No-Go.Sorryfolk were misled, but why is no-deal seemingly now no-go  Its because we vote for MPs, and they do what they think they should, not what we want. It’s a sair fecht, but most MPs seemingly want to spare the country needless economic damage the people didn’t knowingly vote for. That’s then doing their jobs btw.Lets wait and see nowa compromise emerges that Parliament can live with, orthey can agree a question they need to put to the people.MPs are our representatives, put there to do what they think is best. They are not our servents put there to mindlessly do our bidding. This key fact allows them the wriggle room they need to change their minds once the facts change. This reality behind our representative democracy illuminates the lie that was Cameron’s “advisory referendum” which, funnily enough, he promised to obey. You’ve got to love those Tories# or not. No-deal was a fake promise, which, happily for some, still distracts attention from the many harms of needless austerity. Let’s face it, Brexit never really meant Leave.Maybe the times really are changing. The Tories are in the process of self-destruction, Corbyn#s labour has never been more extream, proven racist anti-semitic with a gutless leader failing on so many levels. The Liberals more or less wiped out, the Greens one MP has a Ph, D in Elizabethan sexual practices and the SNP leader under investigation for breaking the Ministerial code and former leader and strong man on , charges of alleged attempted rape and multiple sexual assaults! All at the same time as the eco Lunatics are super glueing themselves to trains. Hard to make that lot all up.

And with the likes of midfielder Ciaran Kellett and goalkeeper Joe Russell having come off the back of impressive campaigns in the under-s league for Lochalsh, the mainland team could prove a tougher nut to crack this season. #We haven#t lost any players, which is a huge step forward, and we are very lucky to have so many young players.#After missing out on the title in a dramatic play-off against Mallaig, the  champions will fancy their chances of mounting another championship charge with a settled squad that is full of experience. Kyleakin will also hope to add to their trophy haul in the cup competitions having claimed the GF MacRae Cup with a - win over Mallaig in June .David Butcher has handed the captaincy to defender Chris MacLennan this season, while the Kyleakin coach will also look to blood youngsters into the side with the likes of Aaaron MacBeth and Nathan Stewart earmarked for inclusion.With a blend of seasoned performers and exciting young talent, Kyleakin are almost certain to be amongst the teams in contention for the title yet again.#It always has to be the league for me # anything  is a bonus.#Having entered the Skye and Lochalsh league as an unknown quantity last season, the reigning champions will start the  campaign as the team to beat.The side will have to adapt to the loss of outgoing player-manager Jamie MacGregor whose contribution on the pitch was understandably overshadowed by his abilities on the touchline as he guided his team to an unexpected championship title.Neil Cameron will take up the mantle of manager and, while the transition might not be an instantly seamless one, the Blues have a large squad of talented players to choose from including a solid spine of goalkeeper Mark Johnston, captain Jamie Young and the attacking talents of Ross Douglas and Andy Cunningham.Defending a title is iniably harder than winning one, but discount Mallaig at your folly. #The lads all know what they are capable of so it#s down to them to do the talking on the pitch.#Graham Campbell#s side look to be a stronger proposition this season having added two players to the squad as well as retaining the players from last season. The also have a goldmine of youngsters to pick from in the shape of the victorious under-s side.Midfielder Angus #Sconser# MacDonald s to the team after a period away in New Zealand last season and is expected to add energy into what is already a dynamic young team.The addition of Robbie Cameron could be a game changer for the Clan Donald Cup winners. Having caught the eye leading the line for Portree during a dficult campaign, Cameron#s killer instinct in front of goal and ability to play as a lone target man might be the perfect tonic for a side whose performances at times lacked a cutting edge. #We were disappointed with our sixth-place finish last season, although we did end strongly. We will be looking to move up the table this season, and will be targeting a top-four spot.#After an arduous season last year, Portree will begin the  campaign under the guidance of new player-manager Mark Macleod.Although the loss of Robbie Cameron will be felt by the side, MacLeod has added a raft of players such as Kenny Palmer, Billy Kehoe and Ali MacKenzie to boost the squad. Youngsters Aaron MacKinnon and Kyle Dick will also provide competition for places as the club look to embark on a new era. #We are obviously building a new team, so our main goal is to bring back those high standards that are expected of Portree. I#m confident there is a cup final in this team this season.#After an exciting end to the last campaign which saw them compete for the title right until the last day of the campaign, Portree Juniors are looking to rebuild their side with an accent on youth.First-team regulars Chris McNab and John Murphy have indicated that they are likely to be available # but pribably on a limited basis. While the loss of last year#s Skye and Lochalsh young player of the season, John Gillies, to Sleat will be keenly felt, Juniors are taking an exciting approach to reshaping the team for the future by blooding the next generation of players.Phil McCaherty says his side could have at least six of the under- team to call upon, including Ryan MacAskill and Connor Gilpin.McCaherty#s ability to bring players together and foster a good team spirit is likely to stand Juniors in good stead for the season ahead. #Our aim is to be competitive. However, the club is fully prepared for the potential inconsistency in performances that playing youngsters may bring.#Two cups and a title charge that lasted until the final day of the season constituted a very good  for Sleat, but DL MacKinnon#s competitiveness means the bar will be set even higher this season for the south Skye side.With the addition of John Gillies to a squad already containing the likes of Ben and Connaire Yoxon and Lachlan MacInnes, it is hard to imagine that Sleat will not go as closenot better than last year in their attempts to capture the league title.The loss of captain Martin MacKinnon, who is convalescing from a serious injury, is a big blow to Sleat. However, the performances of Fraser Graham and Peter MacCusbic mean there is no shortage of defensive quality in the squad. Having impressed with a glut of assists in the under-s league for Broadford, Alex Tully could be the pick of the youngsters emerging for Sleat. #My expectations are as always to win everything in our league and go as far as possible in the Highland Amateur Cup.#Mallaig v Portree # kick-off . pmGA United v Kyleakin # kick-off  pmPortree Juniors v Glenelg # kick-off pmSleat and Strath v North West Skye # kick-off pmGlenelg v Kyle # kick-off pm"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-visitorthebest-360px_Page_4.jpg","title":"skye resident tries to fathom naval","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA resident of Waternish on the Isle of Skye has reported seeing a submarine moving around in continuous circles in Loch Bay for several hours today. after spotting the submarine this morning from his home in Waternish.He said: “We have never seen one in the bay before, we noticed it at about  o’clock this morning and thought it was going out but for most of the morning it has just been circling around.“To be honest, I thought it might have been caught in a lobster pot # I know that sounds silly – now it is just virtually stationary.Michael, who lives in close proximity to Loch Bay, said the submarine was visible through the naked eye from his house but after spotting it he had been keeping tabs on the boat with a pair of binoculars.“I am not a marine expert, but it appears like the engine or whatever is propelling it is spinning, but it looks as though it’s stuck. “When we watched it earlier there were two torrents of water coming out the left and right of the rear astwo engines were running but now it would appear there is just one running and it is just throwing up a lot of water spray.”“I don’t know technically what is wrong with it, but I#m getting the feeling something is amiss here because I can’t see why it would just be where it is.”He added: “We have seen a lot of ships, so I was just assuming that it has something to do with the exercise going on just now.NATO has been carrying out the #Joint Warrior# exercise off the west coast of Scotland since Saturday th March.

The Ballymenawanted to know how Morris came to be in the band. Morris tells how his grandmother had a small hotel in Carnlough and every Saturday night a “Sing Song” was held in the bar. It was mainly Ballymena people attendance.  He remembers Johnny Mitchell, who worked in the Waveney Laundry, bringing his friends every week. Johnny also brought musicians from Ballymena to play including Nellie King on piano and George Kernohan on accordion. Morris said: “George, who had a barber shop in Harryville would leave his accordion during the week with his grandmother. He would let me try to play it, upside down as I remember my first attempts! “During the summer months George’s brothers used to visit as well. ACCORDION“They were great singers and often talked about how well other relations were doing who had emigrated and formed a group called the Irish Rovers in Canada. The first time I heard “Bonnie Kellswater” sung was by an older man called Jimmy Fullerton. Great days, great times and a great introduction to performing music.”He continued: “Eugene O’Dornan from the Braid and I played as teenagers in our first band together. Eugene’s sister Maureen entered, or more properly bluffed me into entering a talent contest as I was very shy and horried at the thought. “Anyway the competition went well and from it I joined a Ballymena based band called “The Countrymen” managed by Harry Lynn and George Dillon.  Leo McCaffrey was the compere at the competition. Leo became a great friend and mentor and a major influence on my music career.”In  Morris went with Leo to play in the famous “Blarney Stone” in Vancouver. Members of the Irish Rovers would come into the Blarney Stone as they knew Leo well. Morris said: “I became great friends with Wilcil McDowell, the Irish Rovers’ Accordion player. I was already a fan of Wilcil’s playing as he too occasionally visited my grandmother’s hotel in Carnlough.“It was through Wilcil that I started to play keyboards on Irish Rovers recordings and take part as a guest musician on some of their videos.” When Morris retired from his day job he was delighted to take up an offer in  by George Millar, the bandleader, to join the Rovers. He said: “When Wilcil decided last year to stop touring with the band I moved from keyboards to playing accordion. Touring Canada with the band also meant I was able to meet up with some other Ballymena musicians now living there.“Paul Fynes who was in the Countrymen with me, and Kevin Erwin who played with Leo. Kevin was ill during my last visit and sadly passed away last year. One of the most talented people I have ever played with.”CONCERTCommenting on the concert which took place in Ballymena on March  Morris said: “It was lovely to perform in what I knew as Ballymena Town Hall.“ It was a great concert and I was so pleased it was a such a success, especially for George and Ian Millar. “Never easy playing in your home town with your relations sitting in the front row!“It never ceases to amaze me that after  years the Irish Rovers continue to play to sell out shows throughout Canada and the USA. They are a fabulous band and brilliant people to work with. “George and Ian are proud of being from Ballymena and the town is mentioned at every show. “The Irish Rovers videos, which are broadcast on American television really show off the local area and the Antrim glens. I’m sure this has a real positive impact on Tourism here. “The warm reception in the Mayor’s parlour just before the concert I think is a well deserved honour for the Millar family and it was an honour to attend it.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1733279.jpg--.jpg?1555495975000\n","title":"ballymena young conquerors spring concert","story":"BALLYMENA Young Conquerors Flute Band will be holding its annual concert on Thursday, May  in the Braid Arts Centre Ballymena, commencing at . pm.The band is the town’s oldest surviving music group, having been formed in .

Fans of the Brooke-based Paddy ‘Raff’ have lapped up his BT alter ego ‘Nigel’ in online sketches such as ‘Nigel at the Christmas Market’, ‘Nigel the BT Tout’, as well as the storming stage performances of ‘Paddy and Nigel Act Their Postcodes’.Set for yet another sell-out run of four shows at the city centre’s Limelight venue, Paddy told the Andersonstown News that he is “gobsmacked” at the response to his on stage routines and that of ‘Bravo Tango er’ Nigel. “It’s class,” said Paddy, “I remember when the hosepipe ban was in full effect last year, thinking what kind’ve voice would go with someone who would tout on his neigbours and their over-use of their hose pipe. “The character of Nigel started with a Snapchat filter. This to me looked like some kind’ve posh dude, the mullet, the aviator glasses and moustache. Luckily it was one you could replicate easily as a lot of the filters are quite contorted. “The first one went viral and featured on BBC Trending NI. At the time I didn’t think it would be a recurring character but people really responded to it, they were like ‘you gotta do more with that posh guy’, I just kept going back to it, it’s a pure fluke how it came about,” he said. Since Paddy took to the stage at the Palm House in Belfast and Derry’s Nerve Centre, he has performed to thousands of comedy fans during a series of three sold-out shows at the MAC theatre in March.  “I remember when the MAC tickets went on sale, I checked the tickets and the map was completely grey, I thought ‘maybe I’ve got that the wrong away about ’, but a second show was penciled in and within two hours of that going onsale we put on a third one. “The Limelight is  people capacity and three of the shows are already gone, the fourth one is approaching sell-out. I’m blown away. Basically I’m responding to the demand that’s out there.”Paddy spoke of how he is working with producers to develop ideas for TV both here and across the water. “I’ve a massive, massive list of ideas for more sketches. I’m sort of a one man band, still a full-time dad and it’s like anything it’s getting the time. I’m making the time for it now, it’s not a nine-to-five job in that you are at the desk. My we and I have fantastic support from our families so that is great to have. “I’ve achieved more than I ever thought I would, it’s not even been a year since the first solo show. I’ve put a lot of effort into this show and want to let as many people come to see it before moving on. At the minute I’m looking at a bigger venue for a new show, possibly towards the end of the year.I’ve loads of ideas and it’s been great to have received the support and reception the show has so far to date had.”Paddy and Nigel at the Limelight takes place on Sunday May .

The President will deliver a speech to mark the historic occasion as the £. million three-storey building in the Gaeltacht Quarter prepares to open its doors to visitors for the first time. Director of Fáilte Feirste Thiar, Harry Connolly, told the Andersonstown News that it was an “honour” to have the President open the centre.“James Connolly lived on the Falls Road just yards away from the location of the new Visitor Centre,” he said. “He was a man of formidable ideas and remarkable vision. Over  years after James Connolly was executed, his values, his ideas and the example he gave us in le are as inspiring and relevant as ever.”Harry Connolly said: “It is entirely fitting and appropriate that the President of Ireland will officially open the James Connolly Visitor Centre and pay tribute to Connolly’s colossal contribution to our nation and to the lives of so many across the world.” As well as the President’s visit,  trade union leaders from  dferent unions have also arrived in the city to attend the opening including General President of the Labourers’ International Union of North AmericaTerry O’Sullivan and Rocco Davis, Vice President and Regional Manager of Pacic Southwest Region of . James Connolly travelled to the US and is strongly linked with the trade union movement in the States.Harry continued: “The realisation of Áras Uí Chonghaile is another major step forward for the success story that is West Belfast tourism. Supported by the Connolly family and funded by Belfast City Council and the US Trade Union Movement, this new visitor centre will have a major social and economic impact on Belfast’s Gaeltacht Quarter, attracting thousands of visitors from across the globe every year. “We are inviting everyone to take part in the James Connolly Parade, leaving Conway Mill at pm on Good Friday and parading along the Falls Road to arrive at Áras Uí Chonghaile at .pm. “Outside the front of the centre a number of guest speakers headed by President Higgins will speak, and Irish singing star Frances Black will perform live along with renowned Belfast balladeer Terry ‘Cruncher’ O’Neill. “We are saying to everyone, from the Falls Road, from Belfast, from across Ireland and from further afield, come along and take part in the parade and attend the opening ceremony outside Áras Uí Chonghaile. Good Friday will be James Connolly Day on the Falls Road and we aim to do him proud.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"taking the crooked glen to crumlin","story":"THROUGH a process of Anglicisation, Crumlin is among the thousands of Irish towns and areas whose place names are virtually lost in translation. Situated in Antrim’s hills, the Crumlin derives its name from the Irish ‘An Cromghlinn’, meaning The Crooked Glen, which is the name adopted by one the town’s most exciting new pubs.Headed up by North Belfast businessman Laurence Burns and his brother Damien, The Crooked Glen is bringing the original meaning of the name Crumlin back into everyday use in the town and breathing new le into one of the Main Street’s most prominent buildings.Laurence has spent the last -years leading operations at the popular city centre nightclub, Thompson’s Garage, and has also worked on a number of the city’s biggest events and festivals, including our own Best of the North awards ceremony. However, when the opportunity to run his own bar and restaurant arose he jumped at the opportunity, and while aiming to bring something new to the area he said paying homage to the town’s Irish-speaking heritage was vital.“I was always trying to keep my ear to the ground so that when a pub came up I would be in contention for it,” he said.“I had done that through Jeeves Limited and then the opportunity came up just before Christmas.“There was an opportunity for me to take it on – along with my brother who is my business partner – and give it a wee bit more care and attention.“It had been O’Connor’s twice before under two dferent businesses. The previous owner was O’Connor and the guy who took it on firstly was O’Connor, so I didn’t want to be the third O’Connor’s and that’s where the Crooked Glen came into it. There’s a big Irish speaking community up in Crumlin and I just thought they would appreciate that the name came from Irish origins. That’s where the name came from and it has gotten a really good response.“I got a logo and then used the boys from North Belfast Graphic to implement the artwork outside on the walls, the menus, and all the rest of it.”He continued: “I fell in love with it the first time I came into it. I just loved the character of it.“The first time I came in was as a customer, I sat downstairs and had a bit of craic with a few of the locals who are now my regulars. They were giving me a bit of stick and saying thatyou’re eating in here you have to keep the fire filled up. We were just having a bit of banter – I actually did get up and put a bit of coal on the fire. I hadn’t even seen upstairs at that stage, but I had my lunch and said to Damien that I had a really good feeling about the place. I knew I liked it right away, I had a feeling for it and I could see the potential.”In terms of its space, The Crooked Glen has it all – a cosy fireside bar, a beautul upstairs restaurant and a fantastic outdoor area. In the short six weeks since taking over the venue, the Burns brothers have implemented an exciting new menu, improved service standards and have lined up a number of talented artists for their weekly live music sessions.“The responses and reviews that I’m getting is that we’ve taken a bit of creativity from Belfast and brought it up into Crumlin – that’s no disrespect to anything that was already up here,” Laurence said.“It’s the first time that things have been done in this way up here. In the restaurant it will be a bit more of a service led experience, downstairs is your good hearty pub grub with the music, the fire and the pints, upstairs you have a bit more of a refined dining experience.”By offering everything from food to live music and sports, The Crooked Glen aims to have “something for everybody” in the town.“I don’t think Crumlin has had that calibre of musician here on a regular basis. We want to bring the best of what we can afford here, we can’t charge on the door, but we’ll put on the best music possible with a ied selection on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.”He added: “Crumlin sometimes feels like you’re in Donegal because it has that country village feeling, but you’re also on the doorstep of Belfast, so people are used to going in and out of the city and sampling what it has to offer.“We’re trying to take the good things that are in Belfast and the good things of village le in Crumlin and combine them into what should be a strong brand in the Crooked Glen.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Noel-.png","title":"the day when the bovedy trailed above our heads","story":"Former De La Salle pupil Noel Connor explains the background to his exhibition The Bovedy Illuminations which can be seen at The Armagh Planetarium until May THE sky always seemed low over our street in Andersonstown, with the Black Mountain looming behind the housing estate, seeming to draw down the sky. And on top of the dark silhouette, the television mast, it’s flashing light a constant presence above my childhood. My friends and I played football in the street constantly. I remember watching my first few live football matches on television and being shocked that they stopped after ninety minutes. Why would you stop But playing in the street on Friday evenings was dficult as it was always especially busy then. At the end of the week the wages were in and everyone arrived in cars and vans and trucks to collect their money. Seamus the bread man in his Barney Hughes van, Tommy the milkman with his terric leather satchel full of loose change slung over his shoulder, and not one insurance man but two, wearing suits and all sweetness and light. Our grocery order would arrive all the way from McAlea’s shop on Divis Street, the Mikado biscuits always lying tantalizingly on top. As many people were going out as coming in, with older brothers and sisters all dressed up, heading downtown for the start of the weekend.So that evening my mates and I took our football down to ‘the Ring’, Koram Ring, a sort of muddy roundabout where our street ended and converged with three other streets. It was a perfect circle of baldy grass, criss-crossed by paths which people used as a shortcuts from street to street.At times, every kid on the street would be there, the McMahon’s, McCann’s, Gilmore’s, Murphy’s, Bannan’s, Allen’s, Casey’s, and me, always me.Not long after we had started playing, the ‘Bovedy’ blazed low across the sky above our heads at that stage a magnicent fireball floodlighting a group of amazed kids. We all stood transfixed, watching it disappear off behind the mountain, having no idea what had just occurred. Back at home, I discovered that no one  had witnessed the event, and over the subsequent days and weeks it was forgotten about. Indeed, recalling the event in much later years, I could find no family member, friend or neighbour who could remember anything of the evening, it was almost asthe subsequent years of violence and political unrest had brutally erased the memory. I almost began to believe that I had created some sort of  memory.But as an visual artist it was too profound an image to be ignored and many years later my research eventually led me to the Armagh Planetarium. Not only did they confirm the event and times and dates, but the actual meteorite which had come to ground on farmland at Bovedy, had been loaned to their collection. I was invited to visit and had the extraordinary privilege of holding the mysterious object which had fireballed across my childhood sky in . Anyone from my generation will recognize the signicance of that year in Northern Ireland, and I have come to regard that event as symbolizing an end to the innocence of my childhood. At that point I had begun to take an interest in art, and had travelled into Belfast with my pocket money, especially to buy my first proper set of paints, from the Educational Supply Store in Fountain Lane. I can imagine that my precious paint box was sitting open on my bedroom windowsill where I kept it and would have been lit up by the passing meteorite. In many ways that image lit the fuse on the work I have produced for this whole project.Having the opportunity to work with the original copy of my old school register, which was completed on that day, has also provided a terric stimulus for the work. Those ink crosses, made by our teacher, registered my ‘presence’ and that of all my friends as the Bovedy crossed the Universe towards us. I captured each tiny mark using microphotography, and then projected them across the surface of the meteorite, photographing the results. These previously insignicant and long forgotten trails of ink were transported and transcribed across fty years of space and time, to create wonderful visual and poetic illuminations.The project provided such a iety of stimulus, that I needed an outcome which could combine image, poetry and sound, and I began experimenting with film and audio recordings. I will be forever grateful to my friend Davy McBride, who was able to work with a class of boys at our old school, now La Salle College, recording them responding to the original class register of th April . That recording became the spine of ‘The Bovedy Illuminations’, the short film I’ve produced for the exhibition.I also wanted a poetic narrative to run throughout the film, at times in two voices, allowing me a dialogue with my fourteen-year-old self. To my amazement I discovered that Nathan Quinn O’Rawe, a current pupil at the school had previously won the prestigious ‘Poetry Aloud’ Award, a national competition to find the best young reader of poetry in Ireland. Throughout the film, Nathan speaks as my younger self. Again I am indebted to Davy for recording us both at the school.Without a doubt, this project would not have come to fruition without the support of Professor David Burton and his colleagues at the Planetarium, and I can’t thank them enough. Having the opportunity to present a complementary exhibition of my photoworks and poetry at the Market Place Theatre and Arts Centre enabled me to further develop my response to the project, and I’mgrateful to Christine Donnelly for her help and support there.www.noelconnor"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38005449.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/foster418.jpg","title":"foster if eu wont negotiate on backstop uk faces nodeal brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In spring , he began flirting with her and using sexual innuendos.Crown prosecutor Neil Connor told Antrim Crown Court, sitting in Belfast, that this flirtation progressed to text messages. McBride initially sent her images of women both in lingerie and naked, with comments such as: \"I like women who dress up.\"Mr Connor said the teenager was \"somewhat flattered\" by the attention and reciprocated with text messages to McBride. These messages - some of which were sent while she was  - included images of her naked.McBride sent the teenager around  naked images of him and they exchanged what the Crown said were \"graphic\" texts.In these messages, McBride told the girl he wanted to have sex with her, and set out what he wanted her to do to him, and what he wanted her to wear. They then met up in July  \"for the purpose of sex\".After she turned , she and McBride began a consensual sexual relationship, and they continued sending naked images to each other.Mr Connor revealed the relationship continued for around five months - until McBride began a sexual relationship with one of her friends.The complainant, now , went to police in June  and McBride was subsequently arrested.He told police he had been in a sexual relationship with the teenager, but said he believed she was .He also branded their relationship \"a bit of extra-marital fun\".Telling the judge there were \"aggravating factors\", Mr Connor spoke of the -year age gap between McBride and the teenager, and the grooming element which saw her sending him images of herself.Defence barrister, Charles MacCreanor QC, said his client was \"shamed and disgusted by what he has done\".

TaxPayers Alliance has criticised the high remuneration.Its chief executive John OConnell said: \"The average council tax bill has gone up by more than £ over the last  years and spending has gone through the roof.\"Disappointingly, many local authorities are now responding to financial reality through further tax rises and reducing services, rather than scaling back top pay.\"Despite many in the public sector facing a much-needed pay freeze to help bring the public finances under control, many town hall bosses are continuing to pocket huge remuneration packages, with staggering payouts for those leaving their jobs.\"There are talented people in the public sector who are trying to deliver more for less, but the sheer scale of these packages raises serious questions about efficiency and priorities.\"The next highest-earning council chiefs were Liam Hannaway and Roger Wilson, chief executives of Newry, Mourne and Down, and Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon respectively.Mr Hannaway received £,, including £, for his pension and £ in expenses, while Mr Wilson was paid £,, including £, in pension contributions.NILGA, the organisation that represents local government here,

crucial for the  councils in Northern Ireland, and senior officers now require signicant skills and competencies.\"Versatile, motivated and productive people delivering high quality, affordable services is the very least the public deserves.\"As a recent independent review of chief officers pay in Northern Ireland showed, after market testing, our pay rates for this group are in keeping with

Francis did not directly cite the church scandals.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Attendees at the procession included pilgrims, tourists and Romans The nun, Eugenia Bonetti, who works with many Nigerian women and other migrants who have fallen prey to human traffickers, spoke with Francis just before the start of the procession.She told Rai state TV that “we are all responsible” for these women’s plight, saying “indference is the biggest reason these girls are still on the street”.In one of her meditations, read aloud as the faithful listened in utter silence, she said “it is easy to wear a crucix on a chain around our neck or to use it to decorate the walls of our beautul cathedrals or homes”.Less easy is acknowledging “today’s newly crucied”, the homeless, unemployed youth, “immigrants relegated to slums at the fringe of our societies after having endured untold suffering,” the nun said.Populist leaders in Italy and several other European countries have taken to holding a hard line against migrants, refusing to accept those rescued at sea from traffickers’ unseaworthy boats.The US administration of Donald Trump is also determined to keep out illegal migrants.Among those taking turns at carrying a lightweight cross in the procession were a Nigerian woman and her daughter. torchlight procession \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Pope Francis presides over the Via Crucistorchlight procession In his brief comments, expressed in the form of a prayer, Francis also spoke of the “cross of the church”, which he said “feels continuously under assault from the inside and the outside”.The pontf did not elaborate but staunchly conservative and more liberal factions among church hierarchy have been bitterly at odds during his six-year-old papacy.Eroding the church’s moral credibility has been a flood of criticism from faithful and civil authorities in several countries over prelates’ systematic shuffling of paedophile priests from parish to parish for decades rather than remove them from access to children.Earlier, during an evening prayer service, in St Peter’s Basilica, Francis kissed a crucix held up in the centre aisle, then pressed his forehead for a moment against the wooden statue depicting Jesus.In another moment, he prostrated himself on the basilica floor in a sign of humility."},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8wNFxcXC8xOTEzMDg0MVxcXC9MeXJhLU1jS2VlLUluc3RhLWltYWdlLnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo2NDcsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjozNDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2NhY2hlLnJlc2l6ZWQuY29cXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjUyY2Y3OWRmZGE3MWU4MWU1NzQ3ZmMyOWQ4MTRmZjZmM2IwY2E1YzYifQ==/lyra-mckee-insta-image.png","title":"derry trades union council says world lost leader people lyra mckee","story":"The Derry Trades Union Council has expressed sadness following the death of journalist, Lyra McKee, who committed her le to the \"global fight against inequality\".DTUC Chairperson, Niall McCarroll, said: \"The trade union movement and social justice campaigners around the world have suffered a great loss through the tragic death of Lyra McKee.\"We have lost a leader of women, a leader of people, and a leader in a world which lacks the leadership that embodies a love for each other.\"Lyra McKee committed her le towards the global fight against inequality, defending human rights and did so with warmth and kindness she held within her heart that basic human instinct of loyalty and compassion towards others.\"He added: \"Workers across the world have the right to be safe at work, no worker should ever nothome as a result of actions like those witnessed in Derry last night, actions which were an attack on the freedom of press.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh\"All workers should be free to pursue their calling in le, in pursuit of happiness and fulfilment.\"Lyra McKee brought many stories to us through her work as a journalist we commit to honouring her story, continuing her story and never forgetting her story.\"We stand in solidarity with Lyra McKee and her family and offer our support to them.\"A rally vigil in solidarity with Lyra McKee will take place today, Friday th April, Guildhall Square at pm.

I knew Lyra McKee very well, I was one of her media lecturers as part of the Headliners project some years ago and we have been in regular contact since then. She recently moved to Derry where she was working as a freelance journalist. Lyra was a bright, intelligent and articulate writer with a witty, warm and fun loving personality and her murder has sent shock waves among the entire community. My deepest condolences are extended to her family and friends at this time.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshMayor Boyle added that a Book of Condolence is to be opened at the Guildhall at pm today. He said the Book of Condolence would provide the local community with an opportunity to express their heartfelt sympathy to Lyra’s family but also to show their total abhorrence for the continued violence on our streets.“Lyra should have been in a generation that could grow up in a prosperous and peaceful island of Ireland. Her shocking murder serves as a reminder of the urgent need for us to work together to secure peace. I am heartbroken that senseless violence on our streets has cost the le of a wonderful person whose work and advocacy was always about making the world a better place. Rest in peace Lyra.”"},{"url":null,"title":"schoolchildren implore education chief reverse decision groarty p s closure","story":"Parents and schoolchildren from Groarty Integrated P.S. this week hand delivered letters to education chief, Derek Baker, imploring him to reverse a decision on its proposed closure.The group gathered outside the Guildhall in the cold as the Permanent Secretary from the Department for Education met a cross-party delegation inside.The meeting follows a motion proposed by SDLP Councillor Shauna Cusack stating that it recognised “local schools are facing unprecedented financial pressures following real reductions in core funding for education, to the sum of £ per pupil over the last number of years.”There was disappointment amongst the parents and young people when it was decided that Mr Baker would not come outside to personally address their concerns.Instead, it was agreed that one parent, Leanne Brown, would enter the Mayor’s parlour on behalf of the group to present Mr Baker with letters written by children from the Coshquin-based school.She hopes Mr Baker will take time to digest the messages and pictures drawn by children which express their “love” for the school, and that they will inform his decision.Speaking outside the Guildhall on Tuesday, Ivan Peoples, who attended the school as a pupil and now has a child in primary , said he came along to voice his concerns to decision-makers.“I thought the whole future of Northern Ireland was to integrate both sides of the community and I don’t understand why they’d want to close the only one they have on the West Bank.“Foyle College has already moved to the Waterside, and the only other school we have in the city is Oakgrove, and for us to travel over there could cause problems.  If it’s a windy day the bridge can be closed.“The school is integrated in more than just religion, there are people with additional needs, and I think it teaches young people to be caring towards people with needs and can help prevent bullying further down the line.“It was a small school when I was there and I don’t see why they should close it now when there is going to be so much development around it.”Martina McCourt’s son Michael is the most recent pupil to enrol at Groarty P.S. after she decided the school was best-placed to meet his “complex needs”.“Because the school he was at was so big there weren’t enough staff to cater for his needs.“The staff there are fantastic and they picked up on things straight away, certain traits in class, and when I was expressing concerns they were in agreement.“I’m only finding out myself that there are pupils with dferent needs, some with severe needs, and each one of them is being catered for as an inidual and they all accept each other.“It’s just like a wee family and I love it.  He’s coming on great.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“My niece also went to Groarty and she has excelled since.“I would ask the Education Authority to please reconsider because every child deserves a chance.”‘Unique’Independent Councillor Sean Carr organised for the parents to attend after meeting them at the school last week.“We’re very disappointed that the parents didn’t get to meet the permanent secretary.  Some of the young people wanted to read their letters to him.“If you read some of the stories they’re a powerful testimony of the school and hopefully he will read them now.“There would have been no hassle, a few parents and children wanted to have their say, so it’s very disappointing.“The school has been there for quite some time and children who have left bigger schools have thrived at Groarty P.S., that is what we need, and it is unique in this part of the world.“I’d like to see the school retained and a new build for that school which at one stage they were promised with all the new development around Skeoge.”Meanwhile, Independent Councillor Darren O’Reilly, was at the meeting with Mr Baker and he said ious points were aired about the pressures faced by parents, principals and frontline workers.“There needs to be pressure politically and people need to take direct action like we’ve seen today.  More of that is needed to put pressure onKaren Bradley.“Our school system is in a serious mess, a crisis, and I don’t think the Tories are too worried about wains in Derry.  We need to make sure they know and the only way to do that is to campaign.“All the parties were unied in saying schools need more resources and Groarty P.S. needs to be protected.”Ultimately, any final decision regarding the future of Groarty Integrated P.S. has to be taken by a minister, ordevolved institutions are still suspended, by the permanent secretary at the Department of Education by January .The

Limerick had a few half chances, but couldnrsquot convert. lsquoHinch had chances of their own, including Alex Millarrsquos reverse shot which flew inches wide of the net.Millar was in the thick of it again minutes later. This time Stuart Hunterrsquos driving run from midfield found Millar open in the circle. He slipped the ball to the energetic Scott Leetch, who calmly slotted the ball into the goal to make it -.Limerick fought back and got themselves another goal before the half -time interval to make it -.After the restart the game had settled slightly and Ballynahinch started to get into a pattern of maintaining the ball effectively.With that, lsquoHinch were racking up the short corners, seven were won, but for some excellent defending and goalkeeping kept them at bay.With  minutes to go Ballynahinch took the lead again, this time through William Edgar.A few minutes later a piece of brilliance from Edgar made it - after a superb solo run matched with a spectacular finish.As expected, Limerick flooded men forward along with countless aerial passes, making it dficult for lsquoHinch to get out of their half.Limerick pulled one back with a short corner routine with five minutes remaining, but Ballynahinch had the ability to see out the game and lt the trophy for the third time in the clubrsquos history.A big thank you to all the supporters that spurred the men on in Dublin on Saturday, it was very much appreciated.

Itrsquos a great experience not to be missed.The material, including the discovery of  skeletons, has thrown up some interesting information on the Benedictine Abbey which occupied the site during the medieval period, as well as tantalising glimpses into the early Christian monastic site that was located there from the eighth century AD.Three trenches were excavated in the immediate vicinity of Holy Trinity Cathedral, two located in the old tennis courts and one located on the grass verge directly in line with the Cathedralrsquos west door, in advance of the replica of St Patrickrsquos Cross being installed.The trench on the verge revealed the existence of a substantial medieval cemetery with  skeletons being uncovered.Three of these were put forward for radiocarbon dating and the dates have recently been ed.The lowermost burial ed a date of - AD which indicates that this person lived and died before the Anglo-Norman invasion of  AD and before the present Abbey church was constructed on the site.This person would have lived at a time when the round tower mdash knocked down when the cathedral was refurbished around  mdash was still in use. The latest burial encountered ed a date of - AD showing that this person lived and died when the site was occupied by the Benedictine Abbey.Analysis of the skeletons is ongoing, but initial results of the latest burial indicate it to be a young, female, adult with severe dental trauma.The excavation in the tennis courts uncovered the kitchen and midden pit of the Benedictine Abbey.Site director Brian Sloan explained: ldquoA rich picture of medieval le was uncovered with masses of animal bone and pottery being recovered. We can use this evidence to build up a picture of the diet and everyday activities of the monks who lived and prayed here. The large pottery sherds have been painstakingly pieced together at QUB giving an idea of the shape, size and decoration of the vessels.He continued: ldquoA rich environmental picture is being established through the processing of the soil samples taken during the excavation. A multitude of blackberry seeds, sloe pips and fish bones have been recovered as well as charred wheat grains.Scientic techniques are now helping to identy and date the finds. An array of metalwork was recovered from the midden pit consisting of copper alloy and corroded iron artefacts, and these have been analysed and x-rayed. This has allowed us to see objects beneath the corrosion and the results have been quite startling. A number of items have been identied, including fine copper alloy dress pins, a socketed arrowhead, a horseshoe, a pair of iron shears and even aof chain with a suspension hook still attached.In addition, three samples mdash charred grain, charcoal and a fragment of twig mdash were put forward for radiocarbon dating.The twig fragment ed a date range of - AD which fits very well with the pottery types recovered from the midden pit. However, the charred grain and charcoal ed very similar dates of - AD and - AD respectively.This indicates that earlier activity relating to the early Christian monastic site of the th Century AD, when the original St Patrickrsquos Cross was erected, is there and waiting to be uncovered.A number of finds have now been placed on display in the High Cross Gallery at Down County Museum, in two new cases funded by the British Museum Trust, while research work continues on the collection of artefacts, dating from the Mesolithicthrough to modern times.This project was supported by the European Unionrsquos PEACE IV Programme, managed by the Special EU Programmes Body .Match-funding for this project has been provided by The Executive Office in Northern Ireland and the Department for Rural and Community Development in Ireland.To find out how to get involved in the excavation in August, contact Down County Museum on   ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch teams are All Ireland champions  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH was at the centre of Irelandrsquos sporting world at the weekend.It was a case of doubles all round for the townrsquos rugby club.The lsquoHinch won the All-Ireland League Division B title and their fourths lted the coveted Crawford Cup at the Kingspan Stadium.Just to make it a Super Saturday, Ballynahinch Hockey Club travelled down to Dublin and lted the Irish Challenge Hockey Cup for the second year in succession to complete a memorable season for Mark Brownrsquos boys.The rugby first XV dealt with St Maryrsquos College without undue trouble at Ballymacarn Park to secure their place in the top flight of Irish club rugby.Their - victory prompted huge celebrations after skipper Aaron Cairns got his hands on the trophy.ldquoThis is massive for the club, said Cairns. ldquoAll the hard work this season has finally paid off.ldquoWe wouldnrsquot have got here without our coaches, Brian McLaughlin and Tom Rock, and all the backroom staff.ldquoThere is a lot that goes on behind the scenes and without that we couldnrsquot do it.ldquoWersquove learnt lessons from our time before in A and hopefully wersquoll take that back up with us and see how we get on, added Cairns.Indeed, the trick will be staying in A somewhat longer this time around mdash lsquoHinch managed three campaigns of mostly struggle before exiting in  mdash and that fresh challenge awaits Brian McLaughlinrsquos squad.Over at Ravenhill, an experienced fourths team had just enough in the tank to defeat local rivals Banbridge thirds - to keep the Crawford Cup in the Ballymacarn Park trophy cabinet for another year.The lsquoHinch were good value for their victory in a tough, uncompromising battle, but the lsquoHinchrsquos greater experience stood them in good stead.All heads then turned towards Dublin where the hockey club faced Limerick at Serpentine Avenue in the Irish Challenge Cup final.Manager Mark Brown sent his troops out full of confidence and goals from man of the match William Edgar , Scott Leetch and Matthew Martin were good enough to give them a - victory in an entertaining final.Edgarrsquos two pieces of inidual brilliance were worthy of winning any competition in a superb display of expansive, attacking hockey.This was Ballynahinchrsquos third Irish title in seven years mdash and by far the hardest to win.The game went back and forth at breakneck speed with goals soon starting to flow.lsquoHinch, always look the more composed side with former Instonians man Matthew Martin and the predatory Edgar having that touch of class.Limerick made a real go of it in the last five minutes, but Ballynahinch had the nous to see out the game and lt the crown for a third time..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Calum wins heat at Mary Peters Track  ","story":"NEWCASTLE AC juniors attended the first meet of the Firmus Fab  Series at the Mary Peters Track on Thursday night, taking part in nine events collectively.Calum Cope won his heat in the U- boysrsquo  metre race.

The current area is unkempt and I share residentsrsquo views that it is a bit of an eyesore. I am concerned that what we are looking at here is a permanent bin lorry park.Cllr Curran said that while a number of Strangford Road residents were notied by planners about the plans for the site, there was no formal consultation. He said this must happen as soon as possible.In addition, he said those with ldquounderstandable concerns about the planning application require additional information and revealed he wants to know

could be used as a lorry park.He added: ldquoResidentsrsquo concern about this planning application need to be addressed and I fully understand where they are coming from.A council spokesman confirmed that the local authority sold part of its Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to allow the development of the proposed new Down High School.ldquoThe sale includes land which is currently used for staff parking at the front and side of the old workhouse, said the spokesman.ldquoThis planning application is to develop the remaining site under council ownership to provide parking for

This is undoubtedly the position of Roman Catholicism.ldquoThere are many doctrinal dferences between the Church of Ireland and the Church of Rome, the fundamental dference being that they preach and believe very dferent messages and ultimately cannot be united.ldquoAs Free Presbyterians, we would like to remind both those in the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church that good works do not save an inidual, the Lord Jesus Christ alone saves.ldquoTherefore, we conclude by beseeching those in St Paulrsquos Church of Ireland who love the Lord Jesus as their Saviour to not participate in any  unity march that would grieve the True and Living God.Fr McKinlay said this was the first time in his memory that there had been a protest against the walk.ldquoI think it is a sad reflection on le in todayrsquos world that men who preach the Christian gospel do not want others to walk with them, he remarked.ldquoI feel all of this is incredulous to say the least. There have never been protests about this walk in my time and I have been in Castlewellan for ten years.Fr McKinlay praised what he described as the ldquoexcellent community relations in Castlewellan and pointed out to a number of initiatives, such an inter-church choir, the Peace Bell and Peace Maze in the local forest park and a cross-community website involving all the churches in the Castlewellan area which was set up two years ago by the International Council of Churches under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C April 17%2C 1979  ","story":"EASTER mdash Down District sampled the start of what could be a record year in tourism when hundreds of thousands of day-trippers thronged into the area over the sun-drenched Easter holiday period.The first unbroken spell of sunny weather this year brought motorists flocking into the area mdash and left council tourism officials confident of a summer season boom.Newcastle was one of the biggest attractions over the holiday weekend and it was Easter Tuesday thatdrew the most people as thousands crammed into the resort to see the finish of the Circuit of Ireland Rally at the Slieve Donard Hotel.Forest parks at Tollymore, Castlewellan and Drumkeeragh were also a magnet, as were National Trust properties at Castleward, Mount Stewart and Rowallane Gardens in Saintfield.There were many tailbacks of traffic in many local towns, including Dundrum, Clough, Comber and Newtownards, and there bumper-to-bumper delays in bottleneck areas like Ballynahinch, Downpatrick and Newcastle.The Strangford ferry had the busiest ever period in its ten-year history as thousands of tourists used the crossing to drive up the Ards, or, coming in the opposite way, along the Lecale coast and into Newcastle.The two ferries made a total of  crossings on Monday alone, the highest ever, and it was an applaudable effort from all their staff that things went off without a hitch.Down Councilrsquos assistant tourist and recreation officer, Mr Frank Cunningham, was optimistic that this year would break all tourism records, providing the weather was kind.ldquoWe are all very hopeful for a tremendous year and are expecting some of the biggest ever crowds to converge on our resorts and attractions, he said.DOWNPATRICK mdash The programme for the St Patrickrsquos Festival in Downpatrick in five weeksrsquo time is taking shape and promises to be a dashing four-day bill to suit all tastes.ldquoIt is far from being just another town festival of bits and pieces, said organising committee vice-chairman Frank Connolly.ldquoFrom the opening procession to the open-air carnival four nights later it will be a fast-paced programme with many unique attractions that have neverbeen seen in the area before.The festival will open on Friday, May , with a through-town procession of floats and closes four days later with the carnival in Dunleath Park where the organisers promise that virtually everything thatcan happen will happen as long as it is entertaining.NEWCASTLE mdash Newcastle and District Ladies Circle held a very successful third annual meeting in the Brook Cottage Hotel recently.

Now, the bridge has several operational regulations like alarm levels ndash we canrsquot balance the high level of noise needed for a bridge and the low level needed for a residential area. This is the reality that the council have to consider and resolve.A Vale of Glamorgan Council spokesman said: ldquoThe swing bridge is maintained and operated by Quay Marinas, who manage the Penarth Quays Marina site.ldquoIt was closed due to a number of safety concerns, with upgrades needed before it can be reopened, including audible warnings.ldquoThe council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report following which our health and safety officers and those from Quay Marinas will discuss possible solutions which may enable the bridge to be reopened in the future. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful.

Surely it should be three strikes and out for this deal now And so on Monday, further indicative votes were held as MPs once again took control of parliamentary business ndash despite attempts by the government to shut down our debate before it started.Supporting the move to hold these further indicative votes on Monday, I said: ldquoI think Parliament made remarkable progress the other day in a few hours, compared with the Government, who have had two years to sort this out.\"It is important that we not only have the opportunity to make further progress tonight, but,necessary, a small amount of time on Wednesday to get to where we need to be, so that Parliament can take control and we can move forward together as a House.And so on Monday evening, there was a hugely signicant result placing a Peoplersquos Vote as the top option for resolving the impasse, with a Customs Union only narrowly missing out as well.I voted the same way as I did last week ndash for a Customs Union for a Peoplersquos Vote, and to revoke Article we face a No Deal Brexit.Itrsquos time for the PM to compromise for the good of the country.We all need to work together to find a solution.We need a credible Brexit option to be put to a public vote in a final say, with the option on the ballot paper to Remain, in order to find a way through this crisis. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

Surely it should be three strikes and out for this deal now And so on Monday, further indicative votes were held as MPs once again took control of parliamentary business ndash despite attempts by the government to shut down our debate before it started.Supporting the move to hold these further indicative votes on Monday, I said: ldquoI think Parliament made remarkable progress the other day in a few hours, compared with the Government, who have had two years to sort this out.\"It is important that we not only have the opportunity to make further progress tonight, but,necessary, a small amount of time on Wednesday to get to where we need to be, so that Parliament can take control and we can move forward together as a House.And so on Monday evening, there was a hugely signicant result placing a Peoplersquos Vote as the top option for resolving the impasse, with a Customs Union only narrowly missing out as well.I voted the same way as I did last week ndash for a Customs Union for a Peoplersquos Vote, and to revoke Article we face a No Deal Brexit.Itrsquos time for the PM to compromise for the good of the country.We all need to work together to find a solution.We need a credible Brexit option to be put to a public vote in a final say, with the option on the ballot paper to Remain, in order to find a way through this crisis. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

action ballot planned for   moy park workers  ","story":"More than , workers in Moy Park are to be balloted for strike action as frustration mounts over pay negotiations.The workers, mostly on the two main sites at Portadown and Dungannon, are to be balloted on whether they wish to take strike action within weeks.Moy Park is one of NI’s largest employers and, according to Unite, the union, there has been serious problems with management during negotiations.Sean McKeever, Unite Regional Officer representing his union’s membership at Moy Park sites, said the union would be balloting over ‘unreasonable management demands in ongoing pay negotiations’.“When Moy Park was sold by Brazilian meat-packing giant JBS SA to one of its own subsidiaries, Pilgrim’s Pride Corp of the USA, Unite the union forecasted that this would presage a broader onslaught on workforce terms and conditions. Sadly the accuracy of that forecast is now apparent to every Moy Park worker in NI.“From our first meetings with the incoming management team it was apparent that they were intent on attacking terms and conditions of workers in the region which remain among the best of any workforce in the UK agri-food industry. In recent pay negotiations they have brought forward proposals seeking to undermine Sht Allowances, Sickness scheme, Holiday entitlement, Attendance allowance, Nomi Statutory days and decent breaks – TCs that were hard won by this workforce over many years and which are simply not up for negotiation.“Moy Park’s workforce in NI has a strong and well-organised team of Unite workplace representatives. We recently defeated an attempt to ide maintenance engineers from the bargaining unit and saw off attempts to keep union officials off-site. Management need to think again – this is not a workforce that will stand by as they slash and burn their way in a race-to-the-bottom on rights and entitlements.“The company’s latest annual pre-tax profits were just short of £ million – an enormous increase of  percent on the year previously. Its current owners Pilgrim’s Pride declared net earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of  million in . These are not businesses that are struggling for survival, the attacks on workers’ pay and conditions are simply part of a drive to maximise profits and increase s for corporate shareholders.“Unite is now preparing the roll-out of a ballot on all-out strike action of our more than three thousand members working for Moy Park in NI. Management need to recognise the determination of this workforce before it leads to unnecessary and entirely avoidable disruption to their operations here”, Mr McKeever said.A Moy Park spokesperson said: “We are aware of the recent union statement and we will continue to engage with the union and work towards a negotiated agreement.”Former rugby chief gets MBE for service to sport Coremetrics

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/ub_11.jpg","title":"we need a sea change and this is just the beginning","story":"Posted on Thursday April  by Ulster Business Ulster Business sits down with a host of top femalebusiness leaders at one of Ulster Bank’s DSE dinners to look at the challenges facing women entering the world of business, what change is needed and how far we’ve already come  ‘This is just the beginning’. That’s a general sense of where Northern Ireland and the UK sits as a whole around female entrepreneurship.But it’s also widely agreed that a sea change is needed, from an early level, to develop the next generation of female entrepreneurs, and address a chasm in gender disparity across the business landscape.Sitting in a room with some of Northern Ireland’s female leaders in business during a dinner at Ulster Bank’s Belfast headquarters, the experience, enthusiasm and depth of knowledge which exudes is very clear.But there’s frustration at the challenges and hurdles which continue to prevent senior business and entrepreneurship being played on a level playing field.The gathering of business leaders in Belfast heard one of the challenges is that many women starting up their own companies, don’t consider themselves ‘entrepreneurs’.There’s issues around access to funding, but not only that, it’s about the lack of awareness of the funds which are out there – for both female and male would-be entrepreneurs.There are also some stark figures and findings, including those in the Alison Rose Review of Female Entrepreneurship.The Rose Review, carried out by Alison Rose, deputy chief executive of NatWest Holdings and chief executive, commercial and private banking, found that just one in three entrepreneurs are women, and cast a light on the disparity and challenges facing women of all ages in business, developing ideas, finding the funding, and expanding.It also predicts that closing the entrepreneurial gap between men and women, and creating a level business playing field, could add an additional £bn to the UK economy. On the ground in Northern Ireland, there are positive signs emerging for those at the very beginning of their entrepreneurial journey. Ulster Bank’s own Entrepreneur Accelerator, headed by Lynsey Cunningham, has already helped a raft of people on the road to becoming their own bosses and driving a concept to fruition – and refreshingly, around % of those using the scheme so far are women.The Rose Review has outlined a range of areas which can help realign and balance the start-up market, including investing in a ‘female entrepreneurs’ code – committing financial institutions to the principles of gender equality and transparent reporting of gender funding data.But there seems to be agreement that this sea change can, and should, start right at school – bringing in more hands-on skills and education, as well as fostering entrepreneurship for both boys and girls at an early age.The challenges facing women also raises the issue of ersity, in general, across business and entrepreneurship. It’s fair to say everyone is in agreement that a wide iety of ethnic, religious or sexual backgrounds can only be a positive element for any business or economy.That ersity should also feed into every element and strand of business – from the support at an early stage, to venture capital funding and further company development.While STEM subjects have gotten a bigger push in recent years, the question was posed – why would a school pupil consider starting a business, straight out of school,it’s not taught, fostered or encouraged Looking to the challenges facing successful women in business already, there’s one case in which a company owner – boasting a multi-million pound turnover – says she still faces both conscious and unconscious bias.There’s also a strong sense of talking about failure, rather than just success. It’s something most agree can be a positive step in any entrepreneurial journey, and that a ‘fear of failure’ can hold people back from taking any steps at all.In Northern Ireland, the top level of business leaders among our biggest companies is increasingly male-dominated. The Ulster Business Top  Companies  showed just two of the businesses on the list were headed by women. That number has actually dropped from six, from just a few years ago.But there is something of a gradual change happening in Northern Ireland and across the UK as a whole, albeit slowly. According to Dell, Belfast is among the top  cities for female entrepreneurship. But there’s still a long way to go.Of course, one of the toughest steps in getting an idea off the ground is funding. Crowdfunder is one organisation helping fuel that, and assists small start-ups in getting backing from everyone from friends and family, to the philanthropic who just want to see an idea succeed. It’s partnered with Ulster Bank parent company RBS, offering up reward-based crowdfunding to help test their business ideas.The conversation always comes back to education, key skills and changing the mindset of young people at an early age. If the next generation of school leavers can leave with a positive entrepreneurial attitude, free from any gender bias, then it could go a long way to balancing the breakdown of men and women in top senior roles in the years to come.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months. And pre-tax profits at the firm are up to £.m.In the last two years, CDE has increased its annual international sales by %, with those sales making up three-quarters of overall sales in the year since its latest accounts were filed.The growth led to the company recently being listed in the Sunday Times HSBC International Track , a league table ranking the UK’s mid-market private companies with the fastest-growing international sales. CDE Global is one of only three companies headquartered in Northern Ireland listed on the league table in .Working across five sectors and eight regions, CDE Global has been co-creating bespoke solutions with its customers for over  years to deliver collaborative, imaginative and unique processing systems.

The egg processing business includes big names such as Marks and Spencer and McDonald’s among its customers.Frylite, which started le when Eamon McCay opened a cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises, has seen its turnover increase to £m, with pre-tax profits sitting at £.m. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff.And helping highlight the firms which are still based in Northern Ireland and retain ownership here, accountancy firm Harbinson Mulholland hosted its inaugural HM Homegrown event in Belfast.Showcasing the top  SMEs here, it highlighted that Northern Ireland boasts more homegrown businesses per head of population than Wales, Scotland and all regions across the north of England.And almost % of them operate in just three sectors – manufacturing, construction and wholesale retail. Of the list,  are based in Co Antrim,  in Co Down, nine in Co Tyrone, eight in Armagh and one each in Co Londonderry and Fermanagh.The firms earned just over £m in operating profit in their last reporting year on a turnover of £.bn, while almost £m in wages and salaries was paid out to , employees.  out of the  businesses are family-controlled.Professor Mark Durkin, executive dean of Ulster University Business School, which carried out the research, says the economic impact of the  companies “is considerable generating as they do £.bn in revenues and wages of almost £m”.“These companies act as key enablers of Northern Ireland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, an ecosystem that Ulster University Business School is proud to be part of. The results of this research demonstrate that just because businesses are local in origin does not imply, they are not global in ambition that because they are from traditional sectors does not mean they are not modern in outlook. Indeed, local homegrown businesses have a sense of place and origin that can really create competitive advantage.“Northern Ireland has demonstrated its ability to sell its agri-food, manufacturing and construction products and services overseas, but internationally successful companies tend not to emerge in isolation. “Domestic competition drives innovation, efficiency and productivity improvements, which in turn develop businesses which can take on any competitor across the world. As a result, there is merit in Government identying the most appropriate ways to support the continued growth of successful clusters to help power the economy into the future.”And Darren McDowell, senior partner of Harbinson Mullholland said that homegrown businesses were the backbone of the practice’s client base.“The Top  list underlines the vibrancy of this group of companies and the spending power they give to local communities through employment.“Attention is often focused on other sectors, but this research demonstrates the continued importance of traditional businesses and industries to the local economy and the extent to which they can be successful.”There’s also a raft of multi-generational businesses here, which have kept both ownership and controlOne of those is food giant Henderson. It’s now in its fourth generation of the Agnew family, and is undergoing further expansion at its Mallusk headquarters. But while it’s very much a family affair, the company is now the sixth largest Northern Ireland business, according to last year’s Ulster Business Top  – with turnover of £m.Martin Agnew told Ulster Business: “It’s important for us as a family to continue to run our business with the same values on which Henderson Group was established by my great-grandfather, John Henderson. We’re also proud that we have built a sustainable business which continues to proactively develop and expand, and provides employment for over , people in Northern Ireland.”    More than  years ago, John Henderson set up a stall selling butter, eggs and cheese – he was a well-known figure and frequently was a judge of cheese and butter at the annual Balmoral Show.That subsequently progressed into a stall at St George’s Market in Belfast, and then in , the business was incorporated as a limited company.In , William Agnew married John Henderson’s daughter, and in  William joined the company as a salesman, taking a controlling interest when John Henderson retired three years later. A few years later in  John Henderson, founder of the company died at the age of .Now, the company owns a range of brands – notably SPAR and Vivo – and has spent millions in the last few years expanding its operations.Operating out of its head office in Mallusk, it employs , people across Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/ppb.jpg","title":"powered by talent making return to belfast","story":"Posted on Friday  April  by Ulster Business A host of top speakers will descend on Belfast in May for the second Powered by Talent event.The full day event – taking place at ICC Belfast on May  – has been signicantly expanded this year and will accommodate in excess of  attendees, making it the largest talent-focused conference on the island of Ireland and one of the highest profile events in the UK.Justin Rush, founding member of Powered By Talent and director of Abacus Talent Group, says: “Talent attraction and retention remains one of the biggest challenges businesses face.

Close to a thirdsaid their employer was less committed to achieving gender equality, with womenmore likely to believe there was a need for improvement, versus % of men. Only % of all respondents said their employer was committed to achieving gender equality, with men overwhelmingbelieving this to be the case versus % of women. There’s clearly still a long way to go.Most business leaders are well aware of the merit of employing a erse workforce. Diversity in areas including age, employee background, gender and religion affirms a message of inclusivity within the organisation and to a wider external audience, creating a strong position andHiring methods are an integral element of increasing ersity among employees, and CVs are one of the many ways in which the process can be improved. Many organisations will judge candidates based on their most recent job listing, potentially overlooking talented and competent applicants without a steady course of uninterrupted career progression. This can particularly disadvantage many women in professional sectors who have prioritised childcare at points throughout their career.Whether you believe it or not, we all have unconscious bias built in to our responses to others. So,you could eliminate those biases from the process, would you do so More and more organisations, including many here in Northern Ireland, now recruit based on blind CVs, where information such as age, race and gender is removed to prevent subconscious biases from influencing hiring decisions.Using competency-based application processes assesses essential soft skills such as communication, emotional intelligence, problem solving and self-motivation, rather than testing specic knowledge, which can be learned more quickly than soft skills. The absence of a CV can change the way you prepare questions and open interviews up to discussions that wouldn’t otherwise take place.Favouring competency-based applications or requiring blind CVs is a sign your organisation is taking steps to fairly assess candidates based on their skills and experience. These methods of talent-based hiring also demonstrate a commitment to overcoming the perceived disadvantage of career breaks which will positively contribute to erse representation across all sectors.The practice of blind hiring is not without its shortcomings. For instance a candidate’s personal information can only be withheld during the initial screening process. Once a line manager conducts a one-to-one interview there is no way to suppress a candidate’s gender, ethnicity or age. While applying the principle may result in a wider pool of first-round interviewees employers subsequently be faced with the same ersity challenges, for example, seeking graduates with a first class honours or a high :.At Hays we have trialled blind recruitment at assessment centres for a number internal of appointments. The absence of a CV opened up a depth of enquiry and supporting examples from interviewees where the receipt of a CV might not have encouraged the same level of enquiry and open-mindedness.Demand for transparency around targets and performance is also at an all-time high. So,your organisation is transparent in their ersity reporting, it proves their willingness to make a public commitment to achieving a fairly recruited workforce and makes them accountable for measuring and reporting their progress.  You’ll undoubtedly make some excellent new hires that you may not have appointedyou maintained your traditional processes.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
