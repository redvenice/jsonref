Wallace The Great is pictured with 31-year-old groom Christie Mclean atop his broad, flat backWalking and trotting, neck arched, body in perfect alignment, he saw off eight horses to romp home with the winner’s scarlet rosette, a mark of 67.4 and some very confidence-boosting comments from the judges.‘Well done. Pleasing rhythm and activity,’ they wrote. ‘Could be more supple, but a lovely willing attitude.’His many supporters, including multiple Olympic medallist and dressage legend Carl Hester, who learned to ride on a donkey, were ecstatic.‘If someone puts a stumbling block in your way, don’t give up, simply step over it, like Wallace did!’ tweeted one. ‘Hurry up and make a movie!’ said another.Farmer\u0027s heartbreak as her 11-year-old thoroughbred horse...Share this articlePassing van drivers toot their horns and shout, ‘Oi, is that the famous mule? I saw him on telly!’ as he clip-clops past.Given how in demand he is, I feel blessed he’s found time in his busy schedule of dust-rolling, grazing and general swaggering around to show me his dressage skills.Many celebrities seem smaller and somehow diminished when you meet them, but, in the quivering flesh, Wallace is a truly handsome beast, even with his comically big ears.His hair is shiny, his tail long and swishy, his mane cropped short, his eyes huge, his lashes lustrous and his teeth surprisingly pearly given his penchant for ginger biscuits.          I climb aboard Wallace, the product of a male donkey and a female horse, watched by ChristieLike all mules, Wallace is the product of a male donkey and a female horse. (A female donkey and male horse produce a hinny). I am assured by Lesley and Christie that he possesses a startling intellect.‘Mules are highly intelligent creatures and question things far more than horses do,’ says Lesley. ‘And Wallace is a particularly able mule. Mules being stubborn is a myth. If he seems stubborn, it’s only because he’s outwitted you!’Christie is just as smitten.          Off we trot, surprisingly quickly, and I cling on to Wallace as calmly as possible‘Horses are just, well, horses — but with mules, the brain seems more active,’ she says. ‘So, unlike a horse, Wallace will make a connection. He can read your thoughts — he’ll know what you’re thinking.’And with that, it’s time to clamber on to his back for a bit of ‘walk, trot, walk’.Christie swiftly warns: ‘He’s very, very responsive to touch. He needs to tune in with your brain. Just keep talking to him, tell him how great he is. Remember, he’ll be thinking what you’re thinking so think: “Calm, calm, calm.” ’And off we trot, surprisingly quickly, and I cling on as calmly as possible.I try to remember all the things that are so great about mules, so he can mind-read how supportive I am. How they hail from Asia, and live for 40 years — a good 15 years longer than horses. How they have far better hearing and eyesight, and work harder and longer.Lesley tells me: ‘A mule will carry a third more weight, pull a third more weight, go a third longer in time on a third less food.’ No wonder the Army used them up until the Seventies, and Queen Victoria’s wedding carriage was pulled by mules.Sadly, Wallace’s glossy flanks beneath me belie difficult beginnings. His early years are shrouded in mystery, but when he was about six (you can age mules by examining their teeth), he was discovered wandering around a village in County Antrim, Northern Ireland.It was winter, cold and dark, and seeing that Wallace was clearly hungry, the kind-hearted villagers turned the bus stop into a makeshift stable for him and kept him stocked with hay and oats. He thrived and, not surprisingly, stuck around.But come summer, when he hungrily discovered the tasty joys of their floral displays and prize vegetable patches (the village was full of very keen gardeners), he was rather less welcome.          Lesley Radcliffe, Wallace\u0027s guardian (angel), has always been mad about mulesWallace was despatched first to a local animal refuge, where he ate them out of house and home, and then to The Donkey Sanctuary charity, which transported him across the Irish Sea to Sidmouth in Devon to join all their other mules.It was here that he met Lesley Radcliffe, his guardian (angel).Lesley has always been mad about mules — and with good reason. Her grandfather was a muleteer in World War I, in charge of caring for the mules in the trenches.And as a child growing up in Cornwall, she met a mule called Lucy, who lived on a nearby farm, and fell in love. ‘I rode her for four years, and then one day I turned up and she was gone,’ she tells me. ‘The farmer had sold her. I was devastated.’But the seed was sown and she spent her life working with horses. She was a riding instructor for the disabled for 40 years.When she and Wallace met five years ago, she had already fostered several donkeys and mules from The Donkey Sanctuary and taken them back to her home in Dursley, Gloucestershire.Their meeting came by chance. Billy, one of Lesley’s other mules, had terminal cancer and they had returned to The Donkey Sanctuary for palliative treatment.‘I wanted to be with him when he was put to sleep,’ she says quietly.          A toothsome display from Wallace, an 11-year-old mule who likes nothing more than rolling in dirt, stuffing himself with hay and biscuits, and having the insides of his velvety ears rubbedBilly’s sad loss was Wallace’s happy gain. They knew the moment they saw each other.‘He was just lovely,’ recalls Lesley. ‘In a whole herd of mules, he was calm, placid and even allowed me to walk around him and pick up his feet,’ she says.So she took him home with her, where he immediately fitted in with her two other mules, Milo and Bertie, and donkeys Trevor and Ned, who is 40 and blind. These days, Wallace looks out for Ned — when he isn’t being cheeky and adventurous.‘He would be in the house if he had the chance!’ says Lesley.He adores meeting people and being fussed over — but most of all he loves Lesley, who spends at least three hours a day grooming, tending, cuddling, feeding him ginger biscuits (‘All donkeys and mules love ginger,’ she tells me) and just, well, loving him.She goes all pink and glowy just talking about him.For his part, Wallace looks at her every other second, just to check she’s looking at him — which, of course, she is — and his ears prick and perk forward with happiness.For the first year, no one rode him. Then Lesley took him to a local demonstration by world-famous ‘horse whisperer’ Monty Roberts, who declared Wallace The Great ‘highly intelligent’ and ready to be ridden.That was the beginning.          In October, it’s the Regional Championships, where Wallace\u0027s mettle will really be testedChristie, a groom friend of Lesley, says: ‘He was just a joy — and so responsive.’ She tried out dressage on him, discovered he was ‘a natural’ and caused a bit of a stir when she started competing in local events with him earlier this year.It was when one of Lesley’s horses was lame that she tried to enter Wallace in the national British Dressage event. But she was told: ‘No mules, thank you very much.’‘It didn’t seem fair,’ she says. ‘He’s so much brighter and more tuned in than most horses, and I felt he could win.’Christie isn’t the sort to give up easily and started a campaign on social media. In our equality-obsessed society, outrage snowballed until, earlier this month, the sport’s governing body changed the rules to include all animals ‘born from a mare’ — and the rest, as they say, is history. Naturally, there was joy when they won their first high-level dressage event.Thankfully, for once, Wallace didn’t eat any of the flower baskets in the parade ring.Today, as we jig about, I’m sure he can sense my nerves, but he is calm and kind. And when I kiss his warm neck, he smells of saddle-soap and musk and I can see why everyone loves him so much.As Christie says: ‘Wallace is a bonding kind of animal. He makes deep friendships. He’s had a difficult upbringing and needs continuity now.’With one big victory under his straining girth, there is no letting up. In October, it’s the Regional Championships, where his mettle will really be tested by adding the canter — not his strongest point right now. ‘We’ve got a lot of work to do,’ says Christie.So what about Wallace in Hollywood? ‘He’ll play himself, of course!’ says Christie.And as we watch him, standing in his horsebox, eating ginger biscuits, banging the floor with his oiled hoof, whinnying impatiently to get on, it is clear he’s already a Hollywood star in the making. Albeit a star with very large ears."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/30/01/4EAE933800000578-0-image-m-33_1532909931019.jpg","title":"Firms bury nuclear waste vaults national parks say MPs","story":"    Cumbria county council has already voted to reject plans for a nuclear waste facility under its national park amid huge local opposition in the Lake District (pictured: Grasmere)The cross-party committee said: \u0027In our view, it is right for safety matters to prevail over environmental concerns in this case.\u0027It added that existing planning safeguards would prevent \u0027intrusive developments and environmental damage\u0027.But Cumbria county council has already voted to reject plans for such a nuclear waste facility amid huge local opposition in the Lake District.Smart meters are \u0027making it harder for customers to switch...Chillis grew spicier, birds suffered burnt feet and we drank...Share this articleEarlier this year, a spokesman for the national park said: \u0027Because the Lake District is both a national park and a World Heritage Site, it should be excluded from the search.\u0027However, ministers say they will press ahead – and insist that no part of the country should be excluded.Energy minister Richard Harrington told the committee: \u0027I am not saying we should have them on national parks, but it would be very wrong to exclude them at the moment in this big policy statement.\u0027          Energy minister Richard Harrington said it would be \u0027very wrong\u0027 to exclude national parks from the proposals at the momentHe cited a new potash mine in North Yorkshire that includes little surface development as an example of what can be built in an environmentally sensitive location.Mr Harrington added: \u0027If it was a huge one kilometre industrial building in the middle of a national park that wouldn\u0027t be acceptable.

I climb aboard Wallace, the product of a male donkey and a female horse, watched by ChristieLike all mules, Wallace is the product of a male donkey and a female horse. (A female donkey and male horse produce a hinny). I am assured by Lesley and Christie that he possesses a startling intellect.‘Mules are highly intelligent creatures and question things far more than horses do,’ says Lesley. ‘And Wallace is a particularly able mule. Mules being stubborn is a myth. If he seems stubborn, it’s only because he’s outwitted you!’Christie is just as smitten.          Off we trot, surprisingly quickly, and I cling on to Wallace as calmly as possible‘Horses are just, well, horses — but with mules, the brain seems more active,’ she says. ‘So, unlike a horse, Wallace will make a connection. He can read your thoughts — he’ll know what you’re thinking.’And with that, it’s time to clamber on to his back for a bit of ‘walk, trot, walk’.Christie swiftly warns: ‘He’s very, very responsive to touch. He needs to tune in with your brain. Just keep talking to him, tell him how great he is. Remember, he’ll be thinking what you’re thinking so think: “Calm, calm, calm.” ’And off we trot, surprisingly quickly, and I cling on as calmly as possible.I try to remember all the things that are so great about mules, so he can mind-read how supportive I am. How they hail from Asia, and live for 40 years — a good 15 years longer than horses. How they have far better hearing and eyesight, and work harder and longer.Lesley tells me: ‘A mule will carry a third more weight, pull a third more weight, go a third longer in time on a third less food.’ No wonder the Army used them up until the Seventies, and Queen Victoria’s wedding carriage was pulled by mules.Sadly, Wallace’s glossy flanks beneath me belie difficult beginnings. His early years are shrouded in mystery, but when he was about six (you can age mules by examining their teeth), he was discovered wandering around a village in County Antrim, Northern Ireland.It was winter, cold and dark, and seeing that Wallace was clearly hungry, the kind-hearted villagers turned the bus stop into a makeshift stable for him and kept him stocked with hay and oats. He thrived and, not surprisingly, stuck around.But come summer, when he hungrily discovered the tasty joys of their floral displays and prize vegetable patches (the village was full of very keen gardeners), he was rather less welcome.          Lesley Radcliffe, Wallace\u0027s guardian (angel), has always been mad about mulesWallace was despatched first to a local animal refuge, where he ate them out of house and home, and then to The Donkey Sanctuary charity, which transported him across the Irish Sea to Sidmouth in Devon to join all their other mules.It was here that he met Lesley Radcliffe, his guardian (angel).Lesley has always been mad about mules — and with good reason. Her grandfather was a muleteer in World War I, in charge of caring for the mules in the trenches.And as a child growing up in Cornwall, she met a mule called Lucy, who lived on a nearby farm, and fell in love. ‘I rode her for four years, and then one day I turned up and she was gone,’ she tells me. ‘The farmer had sold her. I was devastated.’But the seed was sown and she spent her life working with horses. She was a riding instructor for the disabled for 40 years.When she and Wallace met five years ago, she had already fostered several donkeys and mules from The Donkey Sanctuary and taken them back to her home in Dursley, Gloucestershire.Their meeting came by chance. Billy, one of Lesley’s other mules, had terminal cancer and they had returned to The Donkey Sanctuary for palliative treatment.‘I wanted to be with him when he was put to sleep,’ she says quietly.          A toothsome display from Wallace, an 11-year-old mule who likes nothing more than rolling in dirt, stuffing himself with hay and biscuits, and having the insides of his velvety ears rubbedBilly’s sad loss was Wallace’s happy gain. They knew the moment they saw each other.‘He was just lovely,’ recalls Lesley. ‘In a whole herd of mules, he was calm, placid and even allowed me to walk around him and pick up his feet,’ she says.So she took him home with her, where he immediately fitted in with her two other mules, Milo and Bertie, and donkeys Trevor and Ned, who is 40 and blind. These days, Wallace looks out for Ned — when he isn’t being cheeky and adventurous.‘He would be in the house if he had the chance!’ says Lesley.He adores meeting people and being fussed over — but most of all he loves Lesley, who spends at least three hours a day grooming, tending, cuddling, feeding him ginger biscuits (‘All donkeys and mules love ginger,’ she tells me) and just, well, loving him.She goes all pink and glowy just talking about him.For his part, Wallace looks at her every other second, just to check she’s looking at him — which, of course, she is — and his ears prick and perk forward with happiness.For the first year, no one rode him. Then Lesley took him to a local demonstration by world-famous ‘horse whisperer’ Monty Roberts, who declared Wallace The Great ‘highly intelligent’ and ready to be ridden.That was the beginning.          In October, it’s the Regional Championships, where Wallace\u0027s mettle will really be testedChristie, a groom friend of Lesley, says: ‘He was just a joy — and so responsive.’ She tried out dressage on him, discovered he was ‘a natural’ and caused a bit of a stir when she started competing in local events with him earlier this year.It was when one of Lesley’s horses was lame that she tried to enter Wallace in the national British Dressage event. But she was told: ‘No mules, thank you very much.’‘It didn’t seem fair,’ she says. ‘He’s so much brighter and more tuned in than most horses, and I felt he could win.’Christie isn’t the sort to give up easily and started a campaign on social media. In our equality-obsessed society, outrage snowballed until, earlier this month, the sport’s governing body changed the rules to include all animals ‘born from a mare’ — and the rest, as they say, is history. Naturally, there was joy when they won their first high-level dressage event.Thankfully, for once, Wallace didn’t eat any of the flower baskets in the parade ring.Today, as we jig about, I’m sure he can sense my nerves, but he is calm and kind. And when I kiss his warm neck, he smells of saddle-soap and musk and I can see why everyone loves him so much.As Christie says: ‘Wallace is a bonding kind of animal. He makes deep friendships. He’s had a difficult upbringing and needs continuity now.’With one big victory under his straining girth, there is no letting up. In October, it’s the Regional Championships, where his mettle will really be tested by adding the canter — not his strongest point right now. ‘We’ve got a lot of work to do,’ says Christie.So what about Wallace in Hollywood? ‘He’ll play himself, of course!’ says Christie.And as we watch him, standing in his horsebox, eating ginger biscuits, banging the floor with his oiled hoof, whinnying impatiently to get on, it is clear he’s already a Hollywood star in the making. Albeit a star with very large ears."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/30/15/4EB0A46800000578-0-image-a-14_1532961873037.jpg","title":"You teach children basic speech home minister tells parents","story":"    Some 28 per cent of children do not have the \u0027expected level\u0027 of communication and literacy skills for their age group at the end of the first year of school (file picture posed by models)Mr Hinds will say that parents must understand they need to start teaching their children skills such as speaking and listening at home.It comes after the chief inspector of schools warned that many children are not receiving bedtime stories, nursery rhymes, or even toilet training from their parents.Campaigners have welcomed the Government\u0027s focus on the \u0027home environment\u0027 and pointed out it can be \u0027difficult\u0027 to get parents \u0027involved in their child\u0027s learning\u0027.In his speech today, Mr Hinds will announce his intention to cut in half the proportion of five-year-olds without communication and literacy skills by 2028.Breastfeeding TV presenter reveals she was made to feel like...Daughter brands her parents ‘monsters’ after they tricked...Share this articleHe will call on businesses, charities and tech firms to help him target parents to get more of them reading with their youngsters at home. Mr Hinds will say: \u0027It is a persistent scandal that we have children starting school not able to communicate in full sentences, not able to read simple words.\u0027This matters – because when you\u0027re behind from the start you rarely catch up … the gap just widens. This has a huge impact on social mobility.\u0027Mr Hinds, who will speak at the Resolution Foundation in London, will stress that while it is up to parents to decide how best to bring up their children, he wants to offer them more support in preparing youngsters for school.The latest statistics show 28 per cent of children do not have the \u0027expected level\u0027 of communication and literacy skills for their age group at the end of the first year of school. This includes being able to talk in full sentences and offering their own ideas.          Education Secretary Damian Hinds will say that parents must understand they need to start teaching their children skills such as speaking and listening at homeMr Hinds\u0027 aim of cutting the proportion of struggling children in half, to 14 per cent, would potentially mean a reduction from an estimated 182,000 to 91,000 depending on the population of pupils. The announcement builds on the £20 million pledged in April to provide practical tools and advice to parents on reading and singing nursery rhymes.This includes a £5 million trial run by the Education Endowment Foundation in the North of England, £6.5 million for voluntary and community group projects, and £8.5 million for local councils.Amanda Spielman, head of schools inspector Ofsted, warned last month of the vast swathe of \u0027unlucky\u0027 children who do not get nursery rhymes, bedtime stories or \u0027ABCs\u0027 at home. Some are not even toilet-trained or do not know how to dress themselves, she said.She did not explicitly blame parents, but said they \u0027clearly have the most important role here\u0027.Research from the Oxford University Press this year found that in some schools half of five-year-olds are behind in language skills, with disadvantaged children disproportionately affected.And the Department for Education said children with poor vocabulary at age five are more than twice as likely to be unemployed at age 34 as children with good vocabulary.Mr Hinds\u0027 pledge has been welcomed by campaigners.

Jessica, born in Stockport in 1892, had studied at art school, moved to London and worked both for Roger Fry’s Omega Workshop and, later, Wyndham Lewis’s Rebel Art Centre. It was only in 1980 that the painting was identified as being her work. Now, this lowering still life hangs next to two works by the American artist Sherrie Levine – one is a photograph titled Untitled (After Walker Evans), the other a drawing “After” Henri Matisse. The Matisse is a direct, watercolour copy of a Matisse drawing, while Levine’s photograph reproduces a famous Walker Evans, rephotographed by Levine from a catalogue of the late photographer’s work.Levine’s appropriations of Matisse and Evans are plays on authorship and originality, and on the supposed singular vision of the male artist. There is something poignant about the juxtaposition of Levine and Etchells. There’s a lesson here, retold and expanded in Herstory, an exhibition of work, all by women artists, combining loans to Rochdale by the Sandretto Re Rebaudengo collection in Turin, and works from the museum’s own collection. Rochdale (the gallery was renamed Touchstones in the 1990s) has a minuscule exhibition budget, and these major loans by Italian art collector and philanthropist Patrizia Sandretto Re Rebaudengo to an institution, in what the Arts Council of England calls a “cold spot” for arts provision and participation, give the Lancashire gallery a major lift. Featuring works from the 1970s to the present, Herstory is an often surprising, touching and occasionally alarming exhibition. American photographer Catherine Opie’s 1994 self-portrait has her in the most conventional pose imaginable – seated, hands clasped, facing the camera: except her face is hidden in a leather mask and collar and the word Pervert is tattooed, with decorative flurries, above her naked breasts. Precise rows of needles pierce both her arms, from shoulder to wrist. The stillness of this image, in which Opie is somehow at once both objectified and self-possessed, passive and aggressively confrontational, is a kind of bomb in the gallery, a BDSM queering of conventional portraiture. Across the gallery, Shirin Neshat’s portrait of a woman in a chador points a revolver at the viewer. Her exposed skin in the photograph has been over-drawn with fragments of poetry in Farsi script. Made almost 25 years ago, this image has accumulated unforseen power in the last quarter-century. Sarah Lucas’s woman made of tights, sitting open-legged on a chair, finds an echo in African-American artist Senga Nengudi’s 1977 RSVP, again made from her own used tights, the feet filled with sand. RSVP presages Lucas’s art and the pendulous mesh and sand-filled sculptures of Ernesto Neto. Nengudi’s work is sexy and funny, taut and stretched, showing what gravity and pregnancy do to the female body. I don’t know what stresses Berlinde De Bruyckere’s La Femme sans tête has been going through, but this headless, cold and waxy figure, crouching at one end of an otherwise empty vitrine, appears to be sinking into herself. She’s a museum piece. Perhaps she doesn’t want to be looked at.Romanian artist Andra Ursuta’s Commerce Exterieur Mondial Sentimental, is a life-size marble figure of a woman, based on a newspaper photograph of a Roma woman being deported from France. Ursuta had the figure sculpted in China in the plodding style of communist-era public sculpture (again, the references proliferate the more you look), and she stands on a little wheeled platform, as if to suggest her indeterminate status, to be pushed here and there. Her apparently folkloric jacket is decorated with hundreds of euro centimes, British pennies and American cents. There’s an Adidas logo on her cape. If the symbolism seems obvious, one might say that perhaps it needs to be.Nearby is the late Scottish-Ghanaian artist Maud Sulter’s photo-portrait of black poet Dorothea Smart, dressed as Clio, muse of heroic poetry. One of a series, produced for an exhibition at Rochdale in 1989, Sulter’s photograph debunks western photographic and art historical convention with a celebration of black creativity. Smart looks out at us, wryly, while Lynette Yiadom-Boakye’s painting of a black woman in a gold skirt has her back turned on the viewer. So too does Joey, in a Nan Goldin photograph. Is Joey a woman or a man in women’s underwear? Does it matter? Is Joey posing, or just caught unawares by the camera? Joey is being Joey, whoever they are, leaning into the night. Herstory is full of echoes, back and forth. People turning their backs, and facing the viewer down. Herstory feels a much bigger exhibition than the two rooms it occupies. Full of variety, humour and confrontation, women objectified, invisible women and women refusing to disappear, its stories have no end.

You could just lose yourselves along the way.” There is an interesting difference between the novel and the film version: in the book, the maze is filled with obstacles and monsters, like the mythical maze created by Daedalus at Knossos, where Theseus killed the Minotaur. In the movie, the maze itself is the monster: shifting, unpredictable, potentially lethal.Charlotte Higgins, chief culture writer for the , has been obsessed by labyrinths and mazes since a childhood trip to Knossos. The difference between the two kinds of puzzle is not concrete: “Some authorities say that the labyrinth has a single winding, convoluted route that often seems to turn away from the centre, whereas the maze has forking paths and choices and contains the possibility of getting lost. In fact, this strict distinction, though useful in its way, is a relatively modern one, apt to break down.” It is, perhaps, the maze that is more troubling to us: “What frightens me more than the wrong turns I have taken during my life are the right turns, the ones I so nearly didn’t take. What if I hadn’t gone to that place, on that day, and met that person, that person who now brings me happiness? Tug at a thread and everything could unravel.”As this suggests, Red Thread is no ordinary piece of cultural criticism. It is certainly a learned journey through the role and history of mazes in art and reality. But it is also a deeply personal exploration of the role of the labyrinth in Higgins’s own life, from the postcards she acquired as a girl at Knossos to a recurring adulthood dream, “in which a door would spontaneously appear in an apparently familiar building, usually my flat in London, or my childhood home. In these dreams, which I still have, I push open the door and wander through room after room of ancient stacked-up furniture and cobwebbed bric-a-brac, exploring spaces that confound the known geometries of the building.”The book itself is structured like a maze: some chapters leading the reader forwards through the story, others just a sentence or two before they peter out, as though we have taken a wrong turn. One whole chapter, entitled Cretan Lies, reads: “The Greek verb kretizo, used by authors such as Plutarch, means ‘to speak like a Cretan’, that is ‘to lie’.” And Higgins is Ariadne to the reader’s Theseus: she offers us a ball of red thread to guide us through. Indeed, the hardback is stitched in red, so that the reader turns the occasional page to find the metaphor (as is befitting for a labyrinth) hiding in plain sight.Almost immediately after the sentence on Cretan Lies, for example, there is a long chapter on Arthur Evans, the controversial excavator of Knossos. ‘There are those who say that he took great liberties both with what he wrote about Crete and in the way that he reconstructed the artefacts and remains of Knossos. But for me there is something beautiful about this: he shows us that the act of excavation and the act of creation are not so different.” Higgins’s quiet wit sneaks in when she describes the meeting of Evans and his wife Margaret. “Arthur and Margaret’s betrothal treat in London was to visit a display of finds made in Troy by Heinrich Schliemann.”But Red Thread is not merely a tour around the labyrinths of history (any more than the Samuel Johnson prize-nominated Under Another Sky was a mere tour around the remains of Roman Britain). Higgins is first and foremost a journalist, and she does not miss the opportunity to interview Adrian Fisher, a builder of contemporary mazes, which “occupy an intriguing territory somewhere between puzzle, end-of-the-pier show and landscape art his own role something between ringmaster, geometrician and impresario”. Fisher offers a different perspective on the maze, viewing it as a game between maker and walker, but a game in which he has to play all his moves in advance. And it is the type of creative game that children play, rather than a competitive one with winners and losers: Fisher doesn’t want people defeated by his maze. He wants to “bewilder them just enough to create pleasure”.No discussion of labyrinths would be complete without reference to Jorge Luis Borges, who published a collection of short stories, Labyrinths, in 1962. One of the most brilliant stories included is The Garden of Forking Paths. It is typical of Higgins’s book that not only is there a cerebral discussion of this miniature masterpiece, but that it is preceded by the chapter Borges in Stoke, in which Higgins discovers that Borges’s grandmother, Frances Haslam, was from Stoke-on-Trent, as Higgins is herself. Even though she has long since moved away, Stoke is part of her (the centre of her maze, perhaps) at the same time as it is a corner of Borges. And Stoke itself is not immune to underground labyrinths, its mining history leaving it prone to small earthquakes. “‘Quake Rocks Stoke’ ran the headline on one occasion. Beneath the banner, in smaller letters, ‘My parrot fell off its perch.’ My father won £5 from Private Eye when he sent in the cutting.”Higgins is especially good on the visual arts, from the ancient Laocoon sculpture (now in the Belvedere of the Vatican Museum) with its twisting snakes “a kind of living labyrinth: a trapping, coiling, deadly device”, to her analysis of Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining, with its terrifying hotel: “The Overlook is a place of mirrors and disturbing reflections, a very Borgesian labyrinth.” And, finally, to Picasso, whose fascination with the Minotaur led him to create multiple artworks that feature it, and eventually to be photographed – cigarette in hand – wearing a wicker bull’s head: a minotaur himself. Following Red Thread, in other words, leads us all the way to the monster at the centre of the maze.• Red Thread by Charlotte Higgins is published by Jonathan Cape (£25).

The retailer later secured breathing space from its lenders when they agreed to extend loans while it carries out the restructuring under a company voluntary arrangement scheme.C.banner, the Chinese owner of Hamleys, had agreed to make a £70m investment in House of Fraser, conditional on the CVA being implemented.A company facing financial difficulties prompted by heavy debts can apply for a company voluntary arrangement in order to avoid administration or other more disruptive forms of insolvency.It is a legally binding insolvency process in which a company cuts a deal with creditors on unsecured debts. In retail, this usually involves asking landlords of poorly performing shops to reduce rental payments or allow the company to exit leases on stores which they would otherwise be bound to for long periods. Companies hire an insolvency practitioner to assess the business and whether a CVA has a reasonable chance of success. They then produce a CVA proposal which may involve changes to the terms of leases or termination of onerous supply or employment contracts.Once approved, the company can continue trading as usual and all unsecured creditors are bound by the deal, even those who voted against it or didn’t vote at all. Creditors are often willing to support a CVA in the hope of recovering more cash than they would if the company went into administration or liquidation. They hope that reducing debts will help create a viable company that can continue to trade and pay them.The process is popular with managers because they usually remain in charge of the company and it is cheaper than other forms of insolvency.However, the CVA plans have been thrown into doubt by a legal challenge in Scotland, where a group of landlords argue that the restructuring plan would inflict unfair financial pain on them.Alex Williamson, chief executive of House of Fraser, has previously described the CVA as the “last viable” option for the business.Days after the restructuring scheme was announced, Ashley won a legal challenge to obtain the store’s business plans, providing him with vital information in the event of an investment bid.House of Fraser is one of a number of retailers to seek controversial CVAs as some of the biggest names on Britain’s high streets struggle to cope with rising costs, weak consumer confidence and competition from online-only rivals such as Amazon. Poundworld, Toys R Us and Maplin collapsed earlier this year, while the likes of Prezzo, Byron and Jamie’s Italian have shut restaurants and cut hundreds of jobs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf5cf02e514e7acce373095b95f6114b7c64176a/41_0_1198_719/master/1198.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1a2b6934e7132f59be2564f57926acc","title":"climate change denial oil companies fossil fuels","story":"The year 2018 is on track to be the fourth warmest on record, beaten only by 2016, 2015 and 2017. In other words, we have had the warmest four-year run since we started measuring. According to data from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), June 2018 is the 402nd consecutive month with temperatures above the 20th-century average. The UK’s Environmental Audit Committee has warned that we could see summer temperatures reaching 38C by the 2040s, leading to a potential 7,000 heat-related deaths a year.One hot summer does not a changing climate make, but the trend in the global data is now irrefutable. When Michael Mann published the “hockey stick” graph back in 1998, there was vociferous public pushback, yet the observed temperature rises match what Mann had predicted. Today’s hockey stick graph isn’t a forward projection but a historical record. The world has been getting hotter, and it will continue to do so. The only question now is how much hotter it gets.The mechanisms behind this are not difficult to understand. Over a period of millions of years, carbon became trapped in deposits under the Earth’s crust, as coal, oil and natural gas. As the great engines of industrialisation came online across the planet, humanity developed an insatiable hunger for this trapped carbon. Burning it powered the machines that drove economic growth and development, which in turn raised the demand for more machines and more carbon. Carbon that took millions of years to trap has been released into the atmosphere at a rate that is, in geological terms, almost instantaneous.We have known about the probable impact that this sudden release of carbon into the atmosphere would have on the Earth’s climate since the middle of the last century. However, we have been unable and unwilling to do anything about it. To pull that carbon out of the ground we created giant corporations whose sole role was to find it, mine it and sell it. Our demand led to vast profits for these companies, and unfathomable riches for the people running them. This meant that when the research showed that our insatiable carbon demand needed to be curbed for the good of the planet, there was a very powerful interest group in place with a vested interest in keeping it going.We know now that the fossil fuel extraction industry has known about climate change since at least 1977, when James L Black, a scientist at Exxon, gave a presentation to the company’s board detailing his research into global warming. A year later, in 1978, Black would write a memo saying: “Present thinking holds that man has a time window of five to 10 years before the need for hard decisions regarding changes in energy strategies might become critical.”But by the time this 10-year window closed in 1988, the energy companies had been pouring money not into reducing carbon but into denying the reality of climate change. Through well-orchestrated media campaigns and lobbying efforts, a standard narrative of denial had been firmly entrenched as common knowledge. Climate change isn’t happening, they said, and even if it is happening it’s nothing to do with us, and even if it is something to do with us it would be too expensive to change it. The fossil fuel lobby managed to convince lawmakers and huge swaths of the broader public that this was a battle between “business” on the one hand, and a coalition of corrupt scientists and hippies on the other.For all our talk of climate denial being the “business” position, we’ve strangely ignored the insurance industry, especially the climate research branches of the major reinsurance firms. Swiss Re is part of the ECA working group, and Munich Re’s geo risks research department has been in place since 1973, four years before Black wrote his memo. This is not because reinsurance is some enclave of liberal hippies nestled in the bosom of capitalism, but because their industry, by definition, can’t rely on kicking the can down the road and letting someone else pick up the pieces. If we get floods, famines and droughts leading to mass migration events, they’ll be among the ones paying out.It was easy to let ourselves believe that what was good for energy companies would be good for us all, because the immediate upsides of the cheap carbon windfall were so compelling. There was no problem that couldn’t be solved by throwing more fossil fuels at it, and the reality of climate change threatened to tell us what it cost. The fossil fuel industry told us that we could take out an interest-only mortgage against the future of the planet and prices would always go up, interest rates would always go down and there would never be a reckoning. We now find ourselves facing repayments on the scale of trillions of dollars. That does not even cover the human costs that these dry figures obscure: the lives lost, the homes flooded, the farms wasted away to drought.It is impossible to map the path not taken. Perhaps a commitment to reducing carbon consumption could have spurred innovation in alternative sources of energy. Or maybe the path we are on is an inevitable result of an economic system that cannot stop unless it crashes. We’ve seen the “Minsky cycle” of speculation leading to crash play out time and again in the financial sector perhaps climate change is a centuries-long Minsky cycle we could never hope to stop. Maybe we are destined to become the civilisational equivalent of Monty Python’s Mr Creosote, a man who gorged himself until he literally exploded.Regardless of the alternative histories and the might-have-beens, it may be too late to stop it, but we still need to learn an important lesson. If a CEO tells us that it would be bad for business if they weren’t allowed to pump poison into the air and water, then that’s too bad for them: one business is not an economy, and it certainly isn’t a biosphere. We’d have survived the crisis of an oil CEO missing out on his fifth yacht, but many won’t survive the consequences of letting them lead us by the nose into disaster.• Phil McDuff writes on economics and social policy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8740da01a0fc61d32b7cf174bab5961dad285f0d/0_238_3759_2256/master/3759.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f0aa6796854f9ee2946d48ce67b3b05","title":"deselection kate hoey frank field labour members","story":"A cliff edge approaches, and the Tories – whooping like Dr\u0026nbspStrangelove’s Major Kong as he rides the bomb – seem intent on driving us ever closer. Promises of a thriving post-Brexit Britain have been replaced with reassurances that there will be “adequate” food, that stockpiling is taking place, and the army will be on standby. Funny how these never made it to the side of a bus, isn’t it? Britain has been reduced to a man with a gun to his own head screeching: “Do as I say or I’ll shoot,” and the Conservatives are, of course, almost entirely to blame. But they have been aided and abetted by four Labour MPs, and a political reckoning must surely now take place.Two weeks ago, the government was on the brink of defeat over its plan for customs arrangements with the European Union. If it had lost, so Tory rebels were briefed, a confidence vote and a general election could have followed. Yes, these threats were partly a means to terrify Conservative MPs into submission, but there is no question that a loss on an issue of such magnitude would have posed an existential threat to the government. Ultimately Theresa May was saved in part by the aforementioned MPs – Kate Hoey, Graham Stringer, John Mann and Frank Field. Had they voted the other way, the Tories would have lost. Their rescue of Britain’s most disastrous postwar administration leaves the country galloping at full pelt towards a grave crisis.Understandably, the local parties of these MPs have recoiled in horror. Hoey’s Vauxhall voted unanimously for the whip to be removed Field’s Birkenhead party overwhelmingly backed a no-confidence motion in him. Vauxhall Labour is no den of Corbynism, having nominated the New Labour candidate Liz Kendall in the 2015 leadership election and Owen Smith a year later. Self-professed Blairites, soft lefties and Corbynites were united in this vote. In short, local party members do not want Field or Hoey to be their candidates. And it should be easier for members to remove them accordingly in favour of people who would not prop up a Tory government that is leading Britain to calamity.Some caveats here. The rebel MPs have protested that they voted according to their beliefs: unquestionably, that’s true. Also, the Labour leadership should not set an authoritarian precedent by imposing sanctions on rebellious MPs. Jeremy Corbyn’s own defiance of the whip is relentlessly brought up by his critics, of course.The objection should not be whether Labour MPs defy the whip – each should have the right to act according to their conscience. But Labour members should surely have greater power to decide whether those actions defy the values that bind the party. While Corbyn, for example, consistently voted for New Labour’s progressive policies (the minimum wage, LGBTQ rights, Sure Start), he defied the whip on issues that accorded with Labour members’ views (opposing the Iraq war, privatisation and attacks on civil liberties). It was mounting frustration over these betrayals that culminated in Corbyn’s elevation to the leadership, after all. Labour members should have the power to adjudicate on MPs’ voting records, and “not propping up a catastrophic Tory government” should be regarded as a bare minimum.Calls for the deselection of the Brexit “Gang of Four” come at a tense moment. The plot for a breakaway party is supported by a relatively small minority of Labour MPs, but it is a real possibility: the infrastructure and funding is there, and those involved are seeking the right moment and issue on which to depart before forming a new neoliberal party, wedded to the failed policies of the past, and one that would achieve nothing except help keep the Tories in office. And yes, the founding members of the Social Democratic party left when it was clear that deselection beckoned. But this is an issue that goes beyond the struggle of left and right for Labour’s soul.If Labour MPs can rescue a Tory government dragging Britain into chaos, and lose the confidence of their own local members, they should not remain as candidates. Perhaps, even in these febrile times, this is one issue on which Labour can unite."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db13a757d49d414c04a878f75c8a54353478e5de/0_268_3872_2324/master/3872.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f93bbeb007683ae0593aa24f198fed39","title":"slashing youth services tories betrayed generation labour legal requirement","story":"Every young person needs somewhere to go, something to do and someone to speak to. For many young people, their local youth club is the only safe space they have to get the support they need. However, after eight years of austerity, many parts of our country now have no recognisable youth services at all.The Labour party is committed to ensuring that every young person has the opportunity to succeed, which is why today we are announcing a bold new vision for youth services. We want to introduce new legislation that requires every local authority across England to provide a minimum level of support for young people. To ensure that provision is tailored to the needs of each community, local authorities would be required to establish a local youth service partnership with young people, parents, professionals and councillors. This local partnership would be responsible for providing strategic leadership, assessing provision in that area and publishing a local youth strategy.To make this happen, the next Labour government will establish a national body with dedicated ring-fenced funding to oversee youth-service provision across England. This body will work with all local youth-service partnerships, review local youth strategies, monitor and distribute funding, and advise on professional and service standards. We will also create a national strategy for youth work and a charter that is underpinned by law, which will define what the sufficient level of youth services will be.This will require a sustainable funding model to reverse years of Tory cuts. Part of that will be a discussion about resources, and I will be working closely with the shadow Treasury team in developing the final proposals that will emerge from the consultation. As with our last manifesto, we will be clear and transparent about where all the funding for our additional spending commitments will come from.However, we cannot allow the enormity of this task to deter us when we know the benefits are so great. Youth work can act as an extension to the formal classroom by helping young people to enhance their readiness for learning and develop the skills needed for employment. Good-quality youth services can also prevent young people from being exploited by gangs and falling into a life of crime. Various studies have shown the economic benefit of investing in youth work. For example, a 2016 study in Scotland estimated a return of £7 of value for every £1 spent on youth work.It is shameful that this Conservative government has failed to recognise the value of youth work. And by consciously destroying the whole infrastructure of youth services, they have only shifted the burden on to other public services. Rising levels of mental-health problems, substance abuse and antisocial behaviour will only increase pressures on statutory services. We can no longer sit back and allow the Tories to fail our young people. • Cat Smith is Labour MP for Lancaster and Fleetwood with portfolio for youth affairs"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/912ce6518db84abe47a6ed7fea053e07b2cadb5c/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22f17556b9ee7090d64a7c3ae92de0d0","title":"headline shows the seven greatest music venues in the us","story":"From Madison Square Garden out east to the west’s Hollywood Bowl, via New Orleans blues bars and secret Joshua Tree saloons, visit the most important musical addresses in the USConsidering its totemic role in the creation of virtually every form of popular music we listen to today – from hip-hop, R\u0026ampB and soul to house, hardcore punk and good, plain old classic rock – it should come as a surprise to no one that the US is home to a huge share of the world’s most storied music venues.Some of them are famous for their size, scale and setting, while others have entered the popular consciousness for their part in the history and development of certain styles of music. Some of them, too, are sadly no longer with us, such as New York’s CBGB, or may not count as music venues in the formal sense at all – the street corners of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Compton and suburban Atlanta that gave birth to hip-hop come to mind. Whatever your taste or level of music-nerdery may be, one thing is for sure: the seven venues below have all at some point provided the setting for significant moments in US cultural history.To New Yorkers, Madison Square Garden holds a singular place in the city’s imagination. Known to them simply as “the Garden”, this 20,000 capacity venue describes itself, modestly, as “the most famous arena in the world”. Ordinarily, such a claim would hardly be credible but, in the case of Madison Square Garden, it’s more than justified. Consider this: since the current arena opened its doors in 1968 – there had been three previous public venues occupying the same site since 1879 – the Garden has hosted a number of the greatest shows in the history of popular music, including George Harrison’s Concert for Bangladesh in 1971 Parliament Funkadelic’s legendary sold-out shows of 1977 and 1978 and, more recently, LCD Soundsystem’s final (or, as it turned out, not so final) show in 2011, which was released the following year as the groundbreaking concert film Shut Up and Play the Hits. It might also be worth mentioning that while the Garden doesn’t have an official house act, that bloke from across the Hudson who goes by the name of Bruce Springsteen has played the venue no less than 47 times. The most famous arena in the world? They’re probably right.If Madison Square Garden is the premier indoor concert venue in the US, then Colorado’s Red Rocks Amphitheatre would have to be its most spectacular outdoor musical locale. Framed by an enormous angled rock on one side, with stunning views of the rugged mountain terrain on the other, Red Rocks’ unparalleled outdoor setting has been used to a striking effect in concert films over the years, including U2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky and Neil Young’s Red Rocks Live. With a capacity of almost 10,000, the otherworldly arena has also hosted legendary performances by REM, Stevie Nicks and, on what must have been a particularly psychedelic night in 1968, Jimi Hendrix and the Soft Machine. This year, its programme of events includes appearances by Jackson Browne, Seal and the Colorado Philharmonic Orchestra, as well as every rapper’s favourite rapper, that inimitable Brooklyn native, Nas.Instantly recognisable for its “shell” of concentric arches over the stage, the Hollywood Bowl is to Angelenos what Madison Square Garden is to New Yorkers. Set in the bowels of the Hollywood Hills – with the Hollywood sign perched not far off in the background – the list of notable pop and rock performances here is too exhaustive to detail, hosting over the years the Beatles, the Doors (both of whom recorded live albums at the site), Kraftwerk, Prince, Black Sabbath and Dolly Parton. But the 17,500 capacity venue isn’t just famous for its live shows this being Hollywood, it has also featured as a location in films as varied as Some Kind of Wonderful, Beaches and Escape From LA.Perhaps no other continuously operating venue in the US has such a mythical status for its role in the history and development of one style of music as the Village Vanguard does for jazz. All of the greats (and by that we do mean all) recorded and performed here over the years: Coltrane, Davis, Mingus, Monk, Rollins, Evans, Brubeck, Baker … the list goes on. And for this reason, the Village Vanguard might just be the No 1 place of pilgrimage for jazz lovers in the world. But it is by no means for jazz buffs alone this intimate, 120-seat venue offers an authentic taste of an older New York – as a much a place to sit back with a good martini, take in the portraits of the legends that line the walls and imagine the curlicues of smoke that once rose from the tables and gave this tiny basement club the hazy ambience that jazz venues the world over have sought to replicate.If Nashville is the home of country music, then the closest thing it has to an exact address would be 2,804 Opryland Drive, where you’ll find Grand Ole Opry – a venue that holds roughly the same significance for lovers of country music as the Village Vanguard does for jazz. But the Grand Ole Opry is a little bit more than a music venue: taking its name from the weekly concert radio performance, it is also the longest radio broadcast in US history, having first hit the airwaves in 1925, moving between Nashville locations before finally settling in its current, purpose-built venue in 1974. The great names of country and western, from Johnny Cash to Loretta Lynn, and Garth Brooks to Patsy Cline, have all been regulars at the Opry, and some 215 acts have held a coveted Opry membership (a sure sign that you’ve “made it” as a country star) at some point in their careers.Possibly the coolest venue in the US that you’ve never heard of, Pappy \u0026amp Harriet’s is a dusty saloon bar located in the depths of California’s cowboy country, on the fringe of Joshua Tree national park. The stature and notoriety of Pappy \u0026amp Harriet’s has grown rapidly in recent years, since becoming the venue of choice for many an artist booked at the nearby Coachella festival to play a secret little show of their own on the side. Queens of the Stone Age, Spiritualized, Sonic Youth, Lorde and – pause – Paul McCartney have all passed through for a jam at some point. Oh, and it’s also home to a fully preserved cowboy and western film set out the back, complete with the facades of a local bank, chapel and saloon, which served as the location for dozens of films and television programmes in its 1950s heyday.No list of the US’s great music venues would be complete without at least one entry from New Orleans – and given that it is the home of the legendary Preservation Hall, competition was stiff. But we all know that they do things a little bit differently south of the Mason-Dixon line, and nowhere down south does that hold truer than in New Orleans, so it only seems fitting to choose Kermit’s Treme Mother-in-Law Lounge – one of the most magnificently eccentric music spots in the city. Set up by 60s R\u0026ampB legend and self-proclaimed “emperor of the universe” Ernie K-Doe, the lounge hosts local jazz, funk and legendarily swampy Louisiana blues performances week in, week out, and is as famous for the mind-bending murals that adorn its exterior walls as it is for its raucous shows and southern soul food.United Airlines flies from four UK airports to key US hubs, with onward connections to more than 280 destinations across the Americas.

Of course, we have still got something to look forward to: the summer misinformation-fest, when headlines will roar that “results have improved” or “slumped”, or both at the same time. We’ll probably hear how “top schools” have done better, or not so well, and some schools are “failing”, as if these matters were unrelated to the nature of the schools’ intakes or their rates of “out-takes” – that is, their pupil exclusions, which we’ve heard a lot about lately, or their invisible “off-rolling”.As I go off for my yearly humiliation at the hands of my children on a pitch-and-putt course, I find myself wondering about the teach-and-test system of schooling they’re going through. First up, it’s obvious to me that there is a priority in public debates about exams to pretend that there is only one kind of test: a national, public, high-stakes exam.You would do the public a service, Mr Hinds, if you were to explain to everyone that this is “summative” testing, which as a method of education is much disputed. People have discovered, for example, that it’s quite possible to proceed through education using methods by which learners and teachers work together to assess what’s going on. Teachers and pupils can share views on how learners are learning and how teachers are teaching. You could tell the public that this is “formative assessment”.While you’re about it, you could come clean about the fiddle at the core of summative assessment in the form of “norm referencing”. This is the equivalent to me doing all that’s asked of me in a driving test, only to be told afterwards that I hadn’t passed because a statistician (not an expert in driving) has said “too many” people had passed this year, or that the driving test was “too easy” and they had had to raise the pass mark.This is the myth of “comparable outcomes” – as if shunting pass marks up and down accurately reflected what pupils know. You could pass on to the public the fact that teachers have said harder papers with lower pass marks often result in demoralised pupils who have had little or no chance to show what they actually know. You did squeeze in one thing before we all head for the beach: a bit of ideological control through selective funding. It seems that only “knowledge-rich” schools – those that teach according to your preferred model – will be eligible for your department’s goodies. Diktat by chequebook.These days education is being squeezed more and more into “knowledge-what” and less and less into “knowledge-how”. In the world outside these are never mutually exclusive eitherors. One of the “facts” on Google (a\u0026nbsp“knowledge-what”), if you look, is\u0026nbsp“how to use Google” (a\u0026nbsp“knowledge-how”).What I’ve seen in the past few years is that a good deal of “knowledge-what” has been added to the curriculum with less time available for teachers to help the pupils understand it by applying it. It’s quite possible to learn there is extraction of metals from ore, for example, without ever seeing any ore, doing any extraction or applying this knowledge in any way.\u0026nbspThis is all driven by a summative exam system that is mostly based on testing for “knowledge-what”, sometimes reduced to rightwrong answers.Now where have I heard that sort of thing before – reducing a very complex European matter to an oversimplified yesno question that has ended up complicating things even more?Oh sorry, I’ve just intruded on some urgent holiday discussions you’ll be having with your constituents."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa0caa5a5c48164c8f43c0f66f201faf34cc8a1b/0_87_2600_1560/master/2600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3dc683612dbe2a2eba9579bc22d08ab7","title":"damian hinds social mobility children school screen time","story":"Damian Hinds to address parents’ concerns about screen time in first major speech on social mobilityMore than a quarter of children starting primary school are unable to communicate in full sentences as concerns grow about the amount of time they are spending in front of screens, the education secretary will say in his first major speech on social mobility.Damian Hinds is expected to say on Tuesday that he wants to harness technology so parents can do more to help their children’s early language development.“It is a persistent scandal that we have children starting school not able to communicate in full sentences, not able to read simple words,” Hinds will say. “This matters, because when you’re behind from the start you rarely catch up. Your peers don’t wait, the gap just widens. This has a huge impact on social mobility.”Children with a poor vocabulary aged five are more than twice as likely to be unemployed at age 34 as children with good vocabulary, research shows. Announcing an education summit this autumn to encourage parents to get involved in their children’s language development from an early age, Hinds will say: “The home learning environment can be, understandably, the last taboo in education policy – but we can’t afford to ignore it when it comes to social mobility.“I don’t have any interest in lecturing parents here. I know it’s parents who bring up their children, who love them, who invest in them in so many ways, who want the best for their children. But that doesn’t mean extra support and advice can’t be helpful.”The summit will bring together businesses, charities, tech companies and media groups to encourage more parents to read and learn new words with their children. Hinds will say: “Whilst there are legitimate worries about screen time, media and modern technology can also help to raise awareness and build parents’ confidence around what they can do to help their child’s early language development.”The announcement builds on £20m pledged to narrow the gap between disadvantaged children and their peers. However, Labour said the government figures showed that inequality across the education system was rising, with the most vulnerable children the worst affected.The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: “The measure of our education system should be the support that it offers to the most vulnerable children, and the steps we take to level the playing field between them and their more affluent peers. Quite simply, the Conservatives are failing this test.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/595816b467f2e74d210813fab8f21ff36555ee72/0_375_3508_2105/master/3508.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6723a081087d823b4e2aa249bcb025aa","title":"allow nuclear waste disposal in national parks say mps","story":"Safest site should be chosen regardless of location, committee says – but opponents call idea ‘outrageous’Highly radioactive nuclear waste could be permanently buried under national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty (AONBs), under government plans backed by a committee of MPs.Deep geological burial is seen as the only permanent solution for nuclear waste that will remain radioactive for many thousands of years and is currently stored at surface sites across the UK. Ministers’ attempts to choose a site in Cumbria for the £12bn facility were foiled in 2013 when the county council rejected the proposal.New plans by ministers were published in January and have now been backed by the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) select committee of MPs, who said the safest site should be chosen, regardless of location. “We decided against adding an exclusionary criterion for national parks and AONBs as in our view it is right for safety matters to prevail over environmental concerns in this case,” said the committee, chaired by Labour’s Rachel Reeves.However, the Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said: “It’s outrageous to think of companies burying nuclear waste and fracking for gas in some of the most beautiful places in the country. Tussles over which communities have to put up with this toxic material bring us all to shame.” Fracking under national parks was also approved by the UK government in 2015.The BEIS committee did criticise ministers for being unclear about how much nuclear waste would be produced by plans for new reactors, including at Hinkley Point in Somerset. It also said ministers made a “spurious” link between the geological disposal facility (GDF) and the government’s industrial strategy as the plans do not contain enough requirements to train and use local people.Fifty years of nuclear power in the UK has generated 750,000 cubic metres of waste but the nation has still not developed a permanent disposal solution. Following the 2013 failure, ministers have proposed up to £2.5m a year for communities that consider hosting a GDF, funding dismissed as bribes by opponents.The facility would be 200 to 1,000 metres below the surface. The BEIS MPs said: “We support the government’s view that it is conceivable for a GDF to be designed in a way that would be acceptable to communities, preserve the socioeconomic benefits that national parks and AONBs currently bring them and avoid any intrusive surface facility in conservation areas.”The energy minister Richard Harrington, giving evidence to the committee on 10 July, said: “I am not saying we should have them on national parks, but it would be very wrong to exclude them at the moment.” He said the government wanted to “ensure that the siting process has sufficient flexibility to identify the safest location for a GDF over the lifetime of the facility”. Harrington has said construction of the GDF would create 1,000 jobs and running it would create 600 more.Ruth Bradshaw at the Campaign for National Parks said: “Our national parks are precious national assets with, at least theoretically, the highest level of protection through the planning system. The proposed nuclear storage facility is completely contrary to the purposes of national parks.”Emma Marrington at the Campaign to Protect Rural England said: “Where such major development takes place we destroy beautiful landscapes and ruin our opportunity to pass on a beautiful piece of countryside to the next generation.”“Radioactive byproducts are yet another reason the government must stop building dirty, dangerous and expensive nuclear power stations,” said Lucas. “The future is in clean, renewable energy like wind and solar.” Greenpeace UK’s Kate Blagojevic said: “It’s mystifying why the UK, alone among major western nations, insists on propping up this obsolete 20th-century technology.”In the 1980s and 1990s the UK spent £400m examining a proposed GDF site near Sellafield that was eventually abandoned due to the highly complex and fractured nature of the geology."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea30ee4c2bd66440b3418e60361bac52fdc401a0/0_133_750_937/master/750.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4dfe83d92aa3ef11dfe5bbf03e1ae2d5 1440w","title":"jose mourinho moaning manchester united post precarious","story":"As he enters his third season with United short of the players he wants, the Portuguese’s complaints are serving to galvanise rivals while demoralising his own playersJosé Mourinho’s outburst after Manchester United’s 4-1 defeat against Liverpool may signal the Portuguese entering his endgame at the club. Even for a manager whose media appearances are often outspoken, the comments were extraordinary. He confessed disquiet at handing Ed Woodward, the club’s executive vice-chairman, a list of five players for “two new signings” and being unsure if even one of these will arrive by 9 August when the window closes.Mourinho also declared he would not have paid to see the Liverpool game despite it being between English football’s fiercest rivals and so a centrepiece fixture of the International Champions Cup, a lucrative summer money-spinner. This came after a huge 101,254 were attracted to the University of Michigan Stadium, United having played to near half‑empty stadiums in previous outings against Club América, San Jose Earthquakes and Milan. So how the Glazers, United’s American profit-led owners, view their manager effectively warning fans against attending the final tour match against Real Madrid in Miami on Wednesday should be clear.He was not finished yet. How could Alexis Sánchez be “very happy with the players around him”, the 55-year-old asked in a crushing dismissal of younger squad members he is supposedly developing as future United footballers.Mourinho then rounded on his captain Antonio Valencia for being unfit, the want-away Anthony Martial for not rushing back to the tour following the birth of his child, plus – oddly – the referee and assistants being sourced from “baseball”. There has also been continual moaning about starting the trip without 13 frontline players due to post-World Cup holidays.In all of this there is a near mirror image of previous Mourinho third‑term travails when twice at Chelsea (2004-07 and 2013-15) and Real Madrid (2010-13). Meanwhile the summer has seen only one major outfield signing in Brazil reserve midfielder Fred plus the untested 19-year-old full-back Diogo Dalot. Mourinho may have taken United to second place last year, a best finish since the 2012-13 title win, but they trailed by a record 19 points behind Manchester City. United were never serious challengers so what Mourinho must deliver in 2018-19 is clear: the chasm to Pep Guardiola’s men must be bridged and United must still be in the championship race come next May. In this context Mourinho’s media performance in Michigan can be viewed as a quasi-desperate roll of a dice to try to hurry Woodward into securing at least one of his centre-back and wide-forward preferences – and the preparing of ground should he not.If there are echoes of classic third-term Mourinho, the difference this time is that his predicament is precarious. In both Chelsea tenures and in Madrid, Mourinho began year three with his stock sky-high as the league title had been claimed the previous seasons.This summer his status at United is close to slipping terminally unless the side starts the season flying and continues through winter and spring. His words in Michigan followed the defeatist assessment earlier last week that United will struggle to defeat Leicester City and Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion in their opening two Premier League matches due to players having a shorter pre-season. Yet he omitted to mention Leicester have been seriously weakened by losing their best player, Riyad Mahrez, to City.An irony for Mourinho is that he enjoys more autonomy at Old Trafford than he did at either Chelsea or Real. Woodward might not sign off every transfer request – Internazionale’s Ivan Perisic and Chelsea’s Willian may be a difficult ask at their asking price due to them being 29 – but Mourinho does not have to resist pressure regarding players foisted on him.This was the situation at Chelsea and Real. In December 2006 Mourinho insisted he would never feel moved to play Andriy Shevchenko, who was viewed as a £30.8m vanity project of the owner, Roman Abramovich. His exit by “mutual consent” after limping into the September of his fourth year can be traced back to Shevchenko’s arrival with Michael Ballack also seemingly joining above his head.A memorable soundbite came just before that departure in a barb about how Abramovich’s transfer policy prevented the buying of elite players. “Some are more expensive than others and give you better omelettes,” he said. “So when the class one eggs are in Waitrose and you cannot go there you have a problem.”At Real, where the president often acts as a de facto director of football, similar issues arose. Mourinho signed a new four-year deal in summer 2012 after guiding the club to a record La Liga triumph. Yet the following campaign would prove the “worst of my career”, he said. There had been bust-ups with club favourites Iker Casillas and Cristiano Ronaldo and by May 2013 Real had lost the title to Barcelona by 15 points, were knocked out of the Champions League semi‑finals, and endured defeat against Atlético Madrid in the Copa del Rey final.His second Chelsea stint ended in similar fashion. The agreement of a new four-year contract on 7 August 2015 was followed the next day with a furious dispute with club doctor, Eva Carneiro, over her treatment of Eden Hazard during the season opener against Swansea City.While Mourinho and Chelsea later settled with Carneiro regarding an unfair dismissal claim, that December he was sacked, clearing the way for his appointment at United two years ago. Since then there have been 10 major signings granted by Woodward and the Glazers. When compared to Guardiola’s 13 for a City squad that was of higher quality than United’s when the Catalan took over, Mourinho may have a point regarding transfer policy.Yet United have twice eclipsed City’s record £60m outlay on Mahrez – for Romelu Lukaku (£75m) and Paul Pogba (£89.3m) – and while the board continue to back Mourinho there is bemusement at their manager’s off-message diatribes.If the question is posed what Guardiola could do with the same squad as Mourinho – surely better than trailing by 19 points – the crux of what is fuelling the latter’s serial moaning may become clearer. This is the sneaking suspicion that United are about to fall further behind when Mourinho’s third Old Trafford season starts. And that the once “Special One” has become the “Powerless One” regarding his ability to duke it out at the very top."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/344ed91fd145d37aa02bd37fec232a7219f98c2d/0_441_4057_2434/master/4057.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad4bc73016711420b042d74906c79756","title":"wolfsburg reading mary earps","story":"After a successful spell at Reading, the England goalkeeper has moved to the German championsHaving played with her brother’s side Mary Earps, went in search of a girls team once she was no longer allowed to play with the boys, it was there, in one of her first games, that she first stepped between the posts. She saved a penalty, and the gloves have not come off since.After playing her way around the top tier of the Women’s Super League, the 25-year-old has spent the past two seasons at Reading, helping the side to an impressive fourth-place finish last term. While the chance to continue at the Royals as they take their place in the new fully-professional WSL was tempting, once one of the biggest women’s football teams on the planet came calling – ahead of a World Cup year – it was impossible not to think again.“I was aware Wolfsburg were watching me for a few months but that doesn’t mean you’re going to get an offer,” says Earps. “I made it clear that my focus was at Reading and that if conversations were going to develop I’d be happy to discuss it at the end of the season.”With the German double winners, and Champions League finalists, interested it would have been easy to get distracted. Instead Earps finished the season with the most clean sheets in the league.The goalkeeper says that, after playing in Germany in the Champions League a few years ago, joining a German side became an ambition. “Maybe I didn’t anticipate it happening this early but it’s being something I’ve wanted to do and Wolfsburg are one of the best teams in the world.“The last two years at Reading have been really successful. I joined the team when they were newly promoted and we finished fourth last season. We’ve played some really nice football, but when this opportunity came along I was just really excited about it.“I want to be the best player I can possibly be and in order to do that you need to push yourself outside your comfort zone. At this stage of my career I felt it was time to do just that.”This is a new challenge. Earps has played at seven clubs in nine years in pursuit of first team football: “Age is a factor, particularly as a goalkeeper. The older you are the more experienced you are and it’s not easy as a young goalkeeper to get game time because experience and age is preferred, so I’ve tried to move around so I was playing.”This time it won’t be so simple. Wolfsburg stalwart Almuth Schult, two years older than Earps, has been with the German club for five years and will be difficult to budge from the starting line up. “She’s a very good goalkeeper,” says Earps. “I thought she played really well in the Champions League final. It’s going to be a great experience for us to go toe to toe. We’re excited to see how differently we work and to learn from each other.”While many of the players speak English, training is conducted in German so another challenge for Earps – the only English player on the team – is learning the language, something she says is vital for a goalkeeper: “You’re expected to communicate, you’re expected to organise, you have to dominate and dictate what you want.“That can be difficult in England let alone at a team that doesn’t communicate in your first language. At a new team you’ve got to tell people what to do and you don’t even know them yet . As a young player, it’s hard to tell older players what to do.”Earps may have made her dream move, but she’s not had the dream start. It was widely reported that she was injured in her first week of training and, while Earps says it was not as bad as stated, she was overwhelmed by the heightened interest in her health, something that just does not hit the media’s radar in England: “It was mad,” she says. “My neighbours were coming over and saying: ‘Oh I hear you’ve hurt your foot, are you OK?’” However rather than letting the short spell on the sidelines get her down, the keeper is using the time to find her feet living abroad: “I wanted to be in with the team straight away but it gives me an opportunity to get a feel for my environment, get used to the culture, my apartment, driving on the other side of the road and all those things. So I’m looking at the positives of it. I have time to get settled and then I can fully focus on the football, but I’m dying to kick a ball.”Earps should be back on the pitch within days and initial impressions of the German champions have been extremely positive: “The programme is really intense, there’s lots of things going on, it’s very competitive, it’s very thorough, they want to do things in the right way, they want to make sure they tick every box and that suits my mentality, the player I am and the player I want to be.”• North Carolina Courage won the first Women’s International Champions Cup with a 1-0 victory against Lyon.

After the euphoria of defying last year’s predictions of doom, the temptation to dream big must be strong. Yet that makes it even more important for Chris Hughton to ensure that everyone inside the Amex Stadium remembers that the club’s main priority must be establishing themselves in the Premier League.Granted, talk of survival can sound mundane when Burnley were able to back up their first campaign in the top flight by qualifying for Europe. Brighton were widely tipped to go down last season, especially after picking up one point from their first three matches, and they relished proving the doubters wrong. Even when they slid towards trouble after Christmas, a strong run in February and early March calmed fears and it is unlikely they will ever forget beating Manchester United to secure their top-flight status with two games to spare.Yet while avoiding any final-day drama was a fine achievement, it should also be pointed out that Brighton’s unease had been resurfacing before they earned their first victory over United in 36 years on a wild Friday night. They had not won since beating Arsenal 2-1 on 4 March and their final two assignments were trips to Manchester City and Liverpool. A piece of bad luck here, a couple of mistakes there, and Brighton could have been preparing for life back in the Championship.That might seem like an uncharitable reading, but it is unlikely to have escaped the level-headed Hughton’s attention. For all that it is impossible to argue with the immense pride Brighton took from staying up, their manager will know that finishing seven points above a wretched bottom three is no reason to get carried away. In a league this competitive, with precious little to separate the majority below the top six, there is no room for complacency in a team looking to avoid second-season syndrome.Encouragingly, however, it is unlikely that will happen at a club with Brighton’s sensible mindset. They have not developed ideas above their station after finishing 15th. There has been no vanity splurge, no drive to target fading stars simply because they might sell a few shirts, and no sudden demand for a big-name manager to replace Hughton. Instead they have spent the summer looking for ways to progress without compromising the levels of organisation, teamwork and humility that have been in place since Hughton replaced Sami Hyypiä at the end of 2014.Brighton have acknowledged that some members of a promoted team have a natural ceiling in the Premier League. High-class opponents wise up to them and while the players who impressed last season will strive to stay in the team, it is vital that they face competition for their places. Too much loyalty can be risky. The idea is that a sprinkling of quality in the right places will give Brighton, who won two away games last year, more depth and make them a more rounded team.At their best they are capable of playing fast, vibrant football that relies on direct wing play and the inventive, intelligent Pascal Gross probing between the lines. Yet Hughton, who tended to favour a 4-4-1-1 system last season, needs to ease the goalscoring burden on the wily Glenn Murray. While the 34-year-old is still going strong, providing a focal point in attack and finding the back of the net 12 times last season, more is required from Murray’s fellow forwards given Brighton only scored more than one goal on eight occasions.With Sam Baldock set to leave, the jury out on Tomer Hemed, Percy Tau poised to go on loan after his £2.8m arrival from Mamelodi Sundowns and Florin Andone likely to need time to settle after signing from Deportivo La Coruña, the pressure is on Jürgen Locadia to show why Brighton signed him for £14m from PSV Eindhoven in January. Locadia’s only league goal came in a 4-1 win over Swansea in February, although the 24-year-old Dutchman has the support of his manager. “When you speak with him it’s the intensity of the Premier League,” Hughton said in May. “Here he arguably would not get the space and time he would get in Holland. He will benefit from a pre-season.”Someone else who flourished in the Dutch league is Alireza Jahanbakhsh, an Iran international who is out to prove that leading Ereisie players can make the step up to the Premier League. Brighton’s wide players are crucial to their attack and although José Izquierdo was often an electrifying presence on the left, Anthony Knockaert was more frustrating on the right and Solly March is still developing. Jahanbakhsh, the club’s record signing at £17m, chipped in with 21 goals and 12 assists for AZ Alkmaar last season and could make a huge difference.The 24-year-old’s arrival demonstrates that Brighton’s recruitment team are endeavouring to think outside the box. A determination to look in places others are ignoring allows them to find young, hungry and affordable players who still have time to improve.Yves Bissouma is another example, although the promising Mali midfielder will initially find himself below Beram Kayal, Davy Pröpper and Dale Stephens in the pecking order after his move from Lille, while Bernardo’s arrival from RB Leipzig gives Hughton another option in the full-back positions. The buccaneering Ezequiel Schelotto alternates with the experienced Bruno on the right and Gaëtan Bong is reliable on the left, but Bernardo can play on either side. Hughton will prize the 23-year-old Brazilian’s versatility.Despite the new arrivals, there is a settled feel to Brighton’s squad. The resilient pair of Shane Duffy and Lewis Dunk are mainstays in central defence and will not be dislodged easily by Leon Balogun, a 30-year-old Nigeria international who has signed on a free from Mainz, although one area of concern for Hughton will be his team’s vulnerabilities at set pieces. They conceded 21 goals from dead balls last season, leading to criticism of Mathew Ryan’s command of his area. Australia’s No 1 will face competition from Jason Steele and David Button.Overall, however, Brighton look equipped to survive if they adopt the right mindset. Consolidation is the aim, with Bournemouth’s cosy mid-table life something to aspire to. Anything more will be a happy bonus.The mood feels calm and under control, which is just how Hughton likes it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9168a88803e836c41cf0ec3f6a2d4f1b5e4c0f2/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00437f3e892d97c2b629e9b64acb9acc","title":"baby pregnancy pop stars bump cardi b","story":"Stars used to keep quiet about their pregnancies, fearing they could ruin their career. Now they are celebrating them – and Cardi B is leading the pack‘SAD NEWS: I can’t see my vagina any more,” tweeted the record-breaking superstar rapper Cardi B in June. She had revealed her pregnancy to the public while performing on Saturday Night Live in April. Later, she tweeted that the last month of her pregnancy was “hell” and, when daughter Kulture was born, opened up about the baby’s sleeping patterns, her emotions (“I’m in love and I feel like I’m melting”), and, then, that she had “underestimated the whole mommy thing”, cancelling tour dates she had planned for six weeks postpartum. It was unusual to see a pop superstar documenting their experience of pregnancy and early motherhood so publicly. Until recently, pregnancy has been mostly anathema to the pop world.However, a more positive, accepting attitude has been brewing for a while. In 2011, Beyoncé famously announced her pregnancy to the crowd at the MTV Video Music awards, and those watching at home, by flicking open her jacket, rubbing her bump and grinning. In 2017, a floral, veiled image of her kneeling while pregnant with twins received the highest number of Instagram likes of the year.In the 2000s, the most visible pregnant pop star was MIA, who wore a polka-dotted dress by Henry Holland over her full-term baby bump to the 2009 Grammys. It led bloggers to call her a “skanky ho who couldn’t wait to get her baby about before getting back in the game!” Gwen Stefani, Christina Aguilera and a handful of others were photographed pregnant and Lily Allen sent up industry pressure to get her “body back” in the video for Hard Out Here (2014). Allen is on an operating table having liposuction. “How does anyone let themselves get like this?” says her revolted manager. “Um, I had two babies?” she replies. Her postpartum body is “terrifying” to him.Pregnancy in pop in the 20th century is scant. In the 70s and 80s, well, most pop stars were male, but there were a couple of visible examples. In 1972, Diana Ross was photographed pregnant with her daughter Tracee Ellis Ross and in 1976 performed Baby Love while heavily pregnant, bump concealed with feathers. In 1988, Neneh Cherry performed Buffalo Stance on Top of the Pops while eight months’ pregnant.Bumps started to appear more regularly in popular culture in the 90s. Demi Moore’s cover for Vanity Fair in 1991 – naked and heavily pregnant but for diamonds – was the starting gun. Many were incensed – some newstands refused to stock the magazine – which suggests that, at the time, the image of the female pregnant body was still taboo. Regardless of complaints, high-profile models and actors posed pregnant for magazine covers in the ensuing decades.Apart from a few outliers, it took longer for pregnancy to appear in pop. In the late 90s, Melanie Blatt performed with a bump above her trademark baggy trousers. She was on the cover of British GQ in 1998, hands on belly, under the headline: “One Sexy Mother.”In the mid-00s, tabloid interest in the pregnant body of Britney Spears was nothing if not comprehensive, dissecting her behaviour, whether an inch of flesh was bloat or baby, and photographs of her looking, well, normally pregnant, and normally postpartum, rather than the more acceptable, elegant, manicured poses of Moore or Cindy Crawford.Why did pop keep pregnancy hidden? In the 90s, one factor may have been the moral panic around pop music. The American Academy of Pediatrics decreed that the music video industry should produce videos with pregnancy prevention messages.More so, in a sexually expressive industry, historically run by men, pregnancy didn’t quite work.“Back then, women had to be fit, they had to be sexy,” says Emma-Lee Moss, a musician who performs under the name Emmy the Great. “There was this sense of: we’ve got to keep them young and fuckable.”“Pregnancy is a body-horror,” she continues. “You’re hairy and smelly and things are happening and fluids are coming out.”“Perhaps fans don’t want to think of the artists they admire shopping for diapers or having sore nipples,” says Rebekka Karijord, whose 2017 album Mother Tongue chronicled her first pregnancy and the traumatic premature arrival of her daughter. “Artists, and especially young female ones in pop music, are often supposed to be a blank canvas for their fans’ projections, for their longings and dreams. Available and untaken.”To understand the attitude that pregnancy is in some way grotesque – which isn’t confined to pop the Russian philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin defined the grotesque body as a “body in the act of becoming” – we have to look at deeply embedded anxieties around the female body. In 1962, Sylvia Plath wrote these lines: “I am a mountain now, among mountainy women  The doctors move among us as if our bigness  Frightened the mind.”Why is pregnancy frightening? One theory, suggested by the philosopher Christine Battersby, is that it challenges the idea that man was simply “thrown into the world”, as Heidegger described it. Dismissing pregnancy and birth vanishes the idea that something happened before man “is”, as she put it – and it happened in a woman’s body.The political theorist Iris Marion Young wrote that the pregnant body undermines Cartesian dualism, which constructed the male body as rational, ordered and active, and the female body as irrational, unruly and passive. The pregnant body, for a start, has two bodies in one. And it might well have a man inside it, which is disruptive, threatening and best ignored.Today, pregnancy is often fetishised but the language used by aspects of the popular press is telling. According to certain British newspapers, the kind that translate wearing a pair of shorts to “putting on a VERY leggy display”, you can’t be a pregnant woman in the public eye without “flaunting” your “HUGE” bump.Another reasons for pop stars keeping pregnancies hidden in the 90s and 00s was the worry that a baby could ruin a career. “Attitudes were really bad back then,” says Emmy the Great, mentioning a lyric in To Zion (1998) by Lauryn Hill, in which she writes about the advice given to her on finding out she was pregnant. “Look at your career they said  Lauryn, baby, use your head.”She tells a story about a tour manager she knows who was working with a band of three men in their 20s. When she told them she was pregnant, they fired her and told her it was for her own good.In a recent interview with Rolling Stone, Cardi B talked about a similar-sounding reaction from her friends and team to what Hill recounted in To Zion. “It was like, ‘You can’t do this. This might fuck up your career.’” It helps that artists like Cardi B are able to use social media to build an audience before securing a record deal, which allows for greater autonomy.The shift in the past few years is part of a wider change in interpersonal attitudes. Experiences that were once deemed “personal” are out in the open. People want to talk about their health, their emotions, their ups and downs, and others want to hear about them. Pop stars use social media to talk directly and openly to fans about their lives, encouraged and emboldened by fourth-wave feminism and the #MeToo movement.Motherhood and female reproductive health, in particular, are expressed by artists in new ways. Ali Wong’s standup specials Baby Cobra and Hard Knock Wife – both filmed when she was seven months’ pregnant – brilliantly detail the ups and downs of pregnancy and motherhood. Jenny Hval’s 2016 album, Blood Bitch, for example, celebrates periods.Karijord believes that, while women have permission to be more multifaceted in popular culture these days, “we still have a long way to go”, and raises the absence of stories about male parenting in pop.“I believe this gap has its roots in patriarchy, and it’s a shame because pregnancy and parenthood is a huge, existential part of life for many of us,” she says. “And genuine, interesting art has to be allowed to reflect our life – for both men and women. Just like falling in love. Which there are a million songs about.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef3cbfccb3db7d5a0972f911d029ac770ea5433d/0_0_5842_3506/master/5842.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02f4bda1afb38ea5f9fd9cef6e6426d3","title":"brewing rise of womens teas hype","story":"From cuppas for period pain to a breastfeeding blend, teas for women are everywhere. Should we believe the flowery hype?There was a time when the pyramid bag was the height of sophistication. Now, there’s a tea for every feeling and need – and there are teas just for women, too. Gendered brews are on the rise where once they might only be found in health food shops or at gong baths, now, around the country, they are on sale from Boots to Waitrose, Sainsbury’s and the corner shop.There are teas designed with women’s general wellbeing in mind – Pukka’s Womankind, the brand’s bestseller in the gendered-genre, is blended “to help women balance and bloom” its cranberry, rose, shavatari and vanilla are intended, so the packet reads, to stir the flowers in you into life. It tastes a bit like Christmas.The rise in teas for women has been in sync with the “wellbeing economy,” according to Lucie Greene of trend forecasters The Innovation Group. They “can be consumed as a compliment to yoga and pilates,” she says. And they’re proving popular with the millennial market, who, according to Greene, “see mind, body, spirit, fitness, beauty, as one big connected eco-system”.Pole thinks it’s also a reaction to the disempowerment of women’s health: “There has been a cry, from young women especially, to take a bit more charge of their own health. They don’t just want to be put on the pill because of period pain.”So should all women be drinking these teas? Will we, as Yogi suggests, “especially enjoy the ingredients of ginger, orange peels and angelica root” because “women and plants are supposedly similar in their inner relationship to the changing phases of the moon”?Flowery language to one side, many of the ingredients in these teas “are very traditional herbal products that have been used for centuries across the Asian subcontinent and the Far East,” says Ghazala Yousuf from Harley Dietitians. While “in terms of scientific evidence it’s lagging behind...there’s a lot of anecdotal evidence about their properties”. Before somebody says, “But what about the men?”, Yogi has a tea just for them it tastes like a compost heap. The packaging is a no-nonsense brown – in contrast to many of the women’s teas pinky hues – and has a big root on it. But if you’re all out, can blokes drink women’s teas? “Well I make them. And I drink them,” says Pole. The herbal mix of Womankind “will just be calming and soothing for a man”.The big question: do teas for women single us out as the weaker sex, in need of our women-only brews as well as train carriages, and workspaces, too weak to cope with the company of men or the musky notes of builders’ tea? I’ll get back to you after this cuppa."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/325843324f915776717a611beaa1486ec0141fba/0_174_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ddc84335652b4dc5795aae7c7c9bb40d","title":"gym new nightclub party workouts sweat crawls friends","story":"Millennials are giving up pubs for fitness studios, meeting friends at ‘party workouts’ and ‘sweat crawls’. Is this the end of the boozy night out?Every morning at 5.45am, 27-year-old fashion designer Kelly Walker wakes up and begins her morning commute. First, she makes an hour-long trip from south London to central London to attend a boutique fitness studio – F45 Training, a high-intensity import from Australia with a cult-like following. She takes the 7am class, then heads to the tube and travels for another hour to her office in west London to be at her desk for 9am.“It’s a tour of London!” Walker laughs. And it is one she has been making for the past 18 months. What makes her willing to add two hours on to her commute to go to a gym? Mostly, it’s the buzz of working out with friends. Her housemate and two friends also attend. “It’s good because you actually get up to go. It makes it more enjoyable,” Walker says. “Even though it makes no sense practically.”Traditionally, British socialising revolved around the two Bs: boozing and bitching about the weather. But now a third B is muscling in: boutique gyms. While a jog around the park or a monthly Zumba class is far cheaper, fitness fanatics with disposable cash can now spend it on interval training in LED-lit rooms with more sparkle than Studio 54.In fact, for some, the gym is replacing boozing. Young people are drinking less than ever before: according to one survey, more than a quarter of 16- to 24-year-olds are teetotal. A quarter of pubs have closed in the past 35 years, and those that survive largely do so through their food offerings.Scott credits our health-conscious times for the success of her concept. “I think the bar and brunch thing is going away,” she says. “People are making decisions to do things that are healthier, rather than spending their weekends eating and drinking.”After class, there are waiting glasses of prosecco in the bar. For 38-year-old Vicky Sampson, party workouts such as these are a way to have all the fun but none of the guilt of a drinking session. “You don’t have a hangover the next day, and it’s better for you than going to the pub. Especially how Trib3 does it. It feels more like you’re in a disco.”Another class member, 27-year-old dentist Rihanna Fulford, says: “Three years ago, if you’d told me, ‘You’ll make loads of friends at the gym,’ I’d have laughed at you.” Now, Fulford says, she is a convert, regularly taking back-to-back HIIT classes. She is endearingly self-aware about her conversion. “I used to laugh at people in gyms,” she admits. Now she exercises nine times a week and is going to a spa next weekend with a friend from the gym. “I even came here on Boxing Day in a Santa outfit, still drunk with half a bottle of Baileys in me,” she says. “It was wonderful.”Hayes, a PR manager specialising in fitness, recently joined Instagram to share pictures of her workouts. To her surprise, it has become a valuable networking tool. “People see your workouts and message you and say: ‘Can we train together?’,” Hayes says. “It’s weird how many people you meet.”Mintel’s Helen Fricker says: “It’s a lot easier for young people to get information about health and fitness through social media. You can learn about trends almost instantly, and they spread really quickly.” From fitness influencers such as Adrienne Herbert, who was recently named the “face of wellness” by British Vogue, to the social media goliath Kayla Itsines, who has 9.9 million Instagram followers and an estimated net worth ofA$63m (£35.5m), social media reinforces and refracts our new obsession.Workout trends such as CrossFit or F45 tend to arrive in the UK from the fitness epicentres of Australia or Los Angeles. Alongside social media, private investors help to spread them across the country.“People say we’re the Soho House of the fitness world,” says Deborah Hughes of Third Space, a private member’s club-cum-gym in London. The pricy membership is about £140 a month. For that, you can make like an elite athlete and have your body fat scanned and, for an extra fee, your blood checked.I follow Hughes through a maze of rooms (a reformer pilates studio that looks like a sex dungeon! A boxing gym! A medical centre staffed by Harley Street doctors!). We go into a hypoxic chamber that mimics the conditions of training at altitude. It is all absurd, but everything aspirational is absurd: if Sex and the City were written today, Carrie and co would relocate from cocktail bars to boutique gyms. And something in the Aesop-scented air is catching. I find myself calculating whether I can afford to join Third Space’s new Fenchurch Street club (I cannot).Private investors continue to funnel money into the sector. The upscale gym brand Equinox will open its first hotel in New York in 2019. In the UK, Third Space – backed by the private equity firm Encore Capital – is planning a £50m, five-year expansion. Several luxury pay-as-you-go studios have opened new London venues this year, including Frame, Boom Cycle, Ten, Digme Fitness and Barrecore.“We’ve seen a massive explosion of boutique gym operators entering the UK market,” says Richard Griston of Knight Frank estate agents. “I had a studio in Marylebone where an international brand was willing to offer £80 a square foot. It was crazy.”Some fear the industry could be heading for a crash. “My word of caution is on the rents,” Griston says. He references restaurant chains that were also pumped full of private equity money – such as Carluccio’s, Jamie’s Italian and Prezzo – and are struggling. “People paid huge amounts of money and it has come back to bite them because it wasn’t sustainable.”Industry burnout or not, the normalisation of fitness as a social activity shows no sign of slowing down. But some early adopters are taking things easier. Days after we speak, Walker gets in touch to tell me she has quit her gym. “The commute got a bit much,” she says. “I’ve found a gym closer to my office that I’ll be doing on my own.” Something tells me that Walker won’t be working out on her own for long."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d5cb952453ee9b13cb95ec366ab7c1834756c8b/0_138_3504_2103/master/3504.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06d487c2199c3d2700b5727eec74d6bf","title":"how we made steppenwolf born to be wild","story":"It soundtracked the counterculture in Easy Rider – and ended up being played on the moon and MarsMy brother Jerry and I were living in Toronto and playing in a band called the Sparrows. In search of success, we all moved to San Francisco at the height of the psychedelic 60s. We were on drugs. We played with the Doors and Janis Joplin, but it didn’t really happen for us. So I left the band to focus on writing songs and – after taking more psychedelics – started calling myself Mars Bonfire. I finally scraped together enough money to buy a used Ford Falcon and would drive into the mountains and deserts around LA. Those trips in the Falcon provided the inspiration for Born to Be Wild. I got the basic guitar riff quick, and the lyrics were written chronologically: “Get your motor runnin’, head out on the highway  Lookin’ for adventure, and whatever comes our way.”One afternoon, I had encountered a thunderstorm so ferocious I had to pull over as the road turned into a river. The sky was ominous, the colour of lead. I was struggling to describe it in words until I remembered the periodic table of elements I’d studied during chemistry class at school. The term “heavy metals” came into my head, which gave me the line: “I like smoke and lightning, heavy metal thunder!” This was before heavy metal became a music genre.All the publishers turned the song down. Then Jerry called to say the band were getting back together – as Steppenwolf – and needed songs. I’d just been kicked out of an apartment for playing my guitar too loud, so I made a demo of Born to Be Wild, almost whispering it, with my guitar so quiet it sounded like a banjo. Luckily, the band heard its potential and my replacement, a 17-year-old guitarist called Michael Monarch, played it perfectly. When Mars came round to Jerry’s with the demo, no one was home, so he threw the cassette through the letterbox. This caused Tiffany, Jerry’s great dane, to go crazy, barking and scratching. Mars came to us and said: “I think the dog’s eaten the damned tape!” Luckily she hadn’t. The demo sounded puny, but we thought we could knock it into shape. I was born during the second world war in what was then East Prussia. My father was killed and my mother escaped the Russian tanks with baby me. We ended up in West Germany after the war. Given that the country had recently experienced nazism, the song’s message of freedom really resonated with me. We were rehearsing it in a double garage when, by chance, a record executive called Gabriel Mekler moved in next door. He heard us, produced us and got us signed. But the label didn’t think Born to Be Wild was a single. They eventually compromised, putting it out on a doubled-sided single with the track Everybody’s Next One, but the radio stations just played Born to Be Wild. Years after it was used in Easy Rider, I found myself sitting next to Dennis Hopper at an airport and asked how he’d managed to get so many top artists – from Jimi Hendrix to Bob Dylan – to contribute hits to a film soundtrack. He told me they’d just wanted songs to suit the film, adding that another one of our songs, The Pusher, was perfect for the coke-dealer scene. “We bypassed all the record companies,” he said, “and just rang all the artists – who then told their labels it was a done deal.” The song changed my life. Twelve years ago, my wife and I sold all our music business assets and ploughed everything into wildlife conservation: helping endangered elephants that were born to be wild. The song has been used in so many movies that, after 60, we gave up counting. Nasa woke up the space shuttle crew with it. And when they landed a spacecraft on Mars, the little robot vehicle came down a ramp to the sound of: “Get your motor runnin’…” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Did prejudice hamper the search for justice? By  Tobias JonesIt was raining heavily on 28 March 2018, as Alessandro Albini’s officers were raking over rough ground on the outskirts of an abandoned building. The police were looking for stashes of drugs or money, because they knew the shack was being used by dealers.At first glance, this might have seemed an unlikely location for a drugs bust. Porto Recanati is a small seaside town on Italy’s Adriatic coast. It has perpendicular streets with low, pastel-coloured palazzi between palms and maritime pines. It’s all very neat: there are often mini-diggers on the sand, raking the beach flat as if it were a Japanese garden.One of Albini’s men called him over. “There’s something strange here,” he said. The rain had washed away the loose soil and what looked like a golf ball was sticking out of the ground. Albini’s colleague took a cloth and wiped away the mud so that he could see the thick bone of what appeared to be a femur.Forensic experts were called in, and for two weeks Albini, the town’s vice questore (the deputy chief constable), oversaw the sifting of 15 cubic metres of ground, which contained a lot of buried garbage and animal bones, but also other remains that seemed human.The abandoned building was five minutes inland from the sea, close to the town’s tiny stadium with its single west stand. But it was only a field away from what is possibly the most fascinating and perplexing building in Italy: Hotel House, a semi-derelict tower block that has become synonymous, in the Italian imagination, with drug dealing, prostitution and clandestine migrants.Given that reputation, there was press speculation that this might be a mass burial site. Every day local, then national, journalists came to lean over the red-and-white tape to shout questions to the forensics crew.Hotel House is shaped like a Y, with three red-coloured wings, each 17 stories high and covered by the rusting sequins of satellite dishes. There are 480 apartments, but nobody knows how many people live here. In the summer, when large numbers of Bangladeshi and Senegalese people come to the area to work as beach vendors, the number probably surpasses 3,000. There are only a handful of Italians still living in the block. All eight of its lifts are broken, there is no piped drinking water, the sewage is backing up and there are holes in the walls and floors on every level.Hotel House has been compared to Scampia – the famous Naples estate featured in the film Gomorrah – and the former Olympic village in Turin: high-concept architectural projects that have, over time, become dystopian citadels for drug dealers and an Italian and immigrant underclass. These are places where honest destitution mixes with criminal wealth, and where the Italian state often appears to have lost control completely.For almost a century, Italy was one of Europe’s largest sources of emigrants. But by the early 1990s, immigration to Italy had accelerated rapidly, and some places with high immigrant populations developed serious problems with crime – which in turn provoked outrage among many Italians. Matteo Salvini’s far-right Lega party swept to power this spring by exploiting anti-immigrant sentiment, even posing for a photo opportunity a few years ago at Hotel House.Italy’s various law enforcement agencies do attempt to police Hotel House, but with so many flats and people, plus multiple stairwells and underground garages, finding evidence of criminal activity is almost impossible. “By the time we get to the top of one stairwell,” one officer told me, “the stash has been moved to another wing. They’re very sly.”There are occasional busts, after which photos of clingfilmed bricks of hash or torpedo-shaped wraps of heroin or cocaine will be proudly shown off. One recent investigation discovered that about €450,000 was being transferred to Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan every month from a wire service on the ground floor of Hotel House. Often there were multiple transfers to the same person in one day, indicating that it was a restocking exercise. The drug trade inside Hotel House is estimated to be worth between €5m and €10m a year – not huge figures, but in a building in which poverty and degradation are everywhere, still pretty astonishing.Almost every week there’s a major incident at Hotel House. Recently these have included a suicide attempt, a Moroccan man beaten into a coma on a Saturday night, a fire, a police bust that turned up 28,000 items of counterfeit clothing, and another that found 120g of cocaine. The discovery of human remains so close to the building was just the latest in a long line of bad news.Despite constant horror stories in the press, Hotel House doesn’t feel particularly edgy at first. As you approach the block from the sea, you walk through a shady boulevard of mature lime trees, and sunflowers poke their manes above a wheatfield. Next to the building is a large car park and car cemetery, containing dozens of dented, unmarked white vans. There is a constant stream of cyclists and pedestrians walking to and from town, and as you get closer you hear screams of laughter from children playing. Beyond the pedestrian barriers, Pakistani men sit on the concrete benches, and around the corner North Africans occupy plastic chairs. One time when I visited, a white woman with a grey crew-cut was shouting amiably at Tunisian labourers working to fix some pipes in a trench. The air all around smells of grey water and rotting food.The porter’s lodge has a mirror window. The porters aren’t official, because the building has been in the hands of a judicially appointed administrator since 2015. But Luca, Ibrahim, Abid and Moustaffa sit in their office gruffly watching the comings and goings. Their powers are limited, but not insignificant: they liaise with the press and police, and hold various keys.All around the ground floor are notices in Urdu, Punjabi, Bengali and Arabic: appeals to raise money to repatriate a corpse, or posters asking residents to fork out for repairs. You can glimpse faded grandeur in the beige marble flooring, which is now covered by cigarette butts, cotton buds and empty bottles.Survival means minding your own business. Enzo, a Tuscan glass-blower who has lived here since 2001, says: “I don’t look, but just pass by.” Many apartment doors are posted with repossession orders, but others have been prettified with stencils or shells and pieces of driftwood. Most of the landings are full of rubbish: dirty mattresses, rusting fridges, ripped bin liners, plastic toys. At the end of each corridor is a view that gets more spectacular the higher you go.You know what floor you’re on by the numbers spray-painted on (or scratched into) the walls. There’s a lot of graffiti in English: “fuck this is not the truth”, and “I’m alone I’m fine”. There are philosophical asides in Italian, too: “The people who ruined this country wear ties, not tattoos.”It’s estimated that there are about 50 full-time drug dealers here – buying, cutting, bagging and slinging. Not everyone on the higher floors is a criminal, but it is like an inverse of Dante’s layers of hell: the higher you go, the darker it feels. Many doors have been damaged in previous busts. There are rugby-ball-sized holes in the walls and floors. You can see those white vans far below now, nothing more than maggots. Even here there are toddlers playing catch, laughing and smiling next to a window hanging on by a single hinge.Franca, the woman with the grey crew-cut, lives on the 13th floor. She is fired up about the “potential” of this place. One floor above her is Otello, an ex-missionary who now repairs electronic goods for residents and gives his homemade jams to kids who help him get his shopping up all those stairs. Many of the flats are immaculate inside: the public space is horrific, but the private is spotless.On the top floor, you’re almost 100 metres up, the sea breeze blasting through the empty window frames. From here the sea is two-tone: turquoise and almost purple. Next to the lift, a fuse box hangs open, with hundreds of coloured wires spilling out. You’re more conscious, at this height, that the rusting fire escape that serves the entire east wing has been locked off.It was never supposed to be like this. Hotel House was given its odd name because its architect, Antonio Sperimenti, was offering purchasers the chance to “live between domestic walls with all the services of a grand hotel”. Inaugurated in 1968, the building made you feel like you were in the Hilton: the reception featured a bronze lift plate, lush red carpets and large house plants. The ground floors were filled with fashion and food outlets, and even a Bulgari shop.The flats were all identical – 60 sq metres inside, with 18 sq metres of balcony. The ones looking out to sea were the most expensive, but the other way wasn’t bad either. To the west you could enjoy sunsets over the hills and, in the distance, the Sibillini mountains.The design was inspired by the Swiss architect Le Corbusier, and by the French utopianist Charles Fourier’s notion of a phalanstère, an ideal residence for a community of 1,600 people. It was deliberately monumental, dwarfing the more usual two- and three-storey apartment buildings in town.The lure of the seaside wasn’t just sunbathing and seafood. There were religious and literary attractions to Porto Recanati: the famous Loreto shrine is a short drive inland, and one of Italy’s most famous poets, Giacomo Leopardi, was born here.Outside the main cities of Pescara and Ancona, much of Le Marche’s coast used to be bare marshland with long pine forests. But in the 1970s many new hotels and high-rises were built. Long, sandy beaches were privatised, offering grid-formation deckchairs to sunbathers. New roads were built, including a bypass alongside the railway. But Hotel House was just the wrong side of both. As the town modernised, the building began to seem dated, and stuck on the wrong side of the tracks.When Italy went through a major recession in the late 1980s and early 90s, many families with second homes had to sell up. Suddenly there was a glut of Hotel House flats on the market, and local businessmen snapped them up. One man from the next village came to own 30 of them. Many others were repossessed by banks.Residents started to fall behind on their contributions to the spese condominiali – the shared expenses of the block. Some slum landlords charged the communal costs to their tenants, but never passed them on.With increasing numbers of flats in absentee hands, residents’ meetings were no longer well-attended. Italian law requires a majority of owners’ votes for a building’s budget to be formally approved, and if it isn’t approved, everyone is exempt from paying the communal fees. Soon the maintenance costs could no longer be met.By the 2000s, many of the original owners of Hotel House’s flats had died, and their descendents usually tried to sell up. You could still, in 2000, get roughly €60,000 for a flat there. Enzo, the glass-blower, bought his in 2001. If owners couldn’t sell, they rented them out cheaply, which made the place more of a magnet for the poor. The majority of newcomers were Senegalese, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Tunisian. Almost all looked for and found work: the men in Ancona’s shipyards or as builders, and the women as carers, nurses, waitresses and cleaners.A mosque opened on the ground floor and appointed an imam who was also a great baker. Nigerian Christians worshipped in the boiler room. A halal butcher opened. Soon there were so many Muslims that the Italian bar-owner would shut for Ramadan, since it was pointless to stay open. Cheap rent wasn’t the only attraction for migrant workers: in high season, the beaches were full of holidaymakers keen to buy sunglasses, sarongs and bangles. Thus every summer the immigrant population of Hotel House increased exponentially as incoming workers kipped on friends’ or gangmasters’ floors.In 2008, all of the lifts were still working. But then recession hit again, and apartment prices fell further. There was now a noticeable criminal element in the block, pimping and drug dealing. Two of the lifts stopped working, and there was no money to repair them. Mismanagement of communal maintenance funds had created a debt of hundreds of thousands of euros.There was also a logistical difficulty: because all the flats were in private hands, Hotel House was unlike other notorious estates across Europe, many of which were run by the state. The regional government couldn’t intervene and invest in improvements without appearing to subsidise slum landlords and banks with public money.As debts to utility companies increased, services were slowly cut off: one by one, the lifts stopped working and weren’t repaired. The water supply was switched off in 2008. An illegal well was sunk outside, which has served all the flats ever since. The water is undrinkable, but can be used for washing. Many doubtless use it to cook, as getting gallons of water up multiple floors is too much effort. Drinking water comes from a truck in the car park, at which a constant stream of people queue up to refill plastic demijohns and jerrycans.The cost of not having functioning lifts is almost worse than the lack of water. An old man died last winter because he wanted to catch his breath one night before tackling the steps. He sat on the bench and fell asleep, where he died of exposure. Many elderly residents are prisoners in their own homes, enjoying the sensational views of the sea, but never able to go there again. Lamine Cisse, a Senegalese porter, fell eight floors to his death three years ago, when he stepped into the shaft to try and fix a lift. His widow and child went back to Senegal. Some people have told me that he was an honest, hardworking man who was trying to tackle drug dealing, and that his death was suspicious. He would never have been so stupid, they say, as to attempt to fix a lift inside an eight-storey drop.Today it’s almost inconceivable that a local would buy a flat here, but there’s still a regular turnover of immigrants attracted by the dirt-cheap property and the presence of so many compatriots. It’s a place of strange speculation: when things are this cheap, both the poor and those who exploit them see an opportunity. A flat now costs only €6,000, and if you buy-to-let without worrying about paying for repairs or safety equipment, your investment could be paid off in 18 months. And for as long as everything is in private hands, the state is unwilling or unable to intervene.Elisabetta Micciarelli is the headmistress of a primary school in Ancona, 30km north of Porto Recanati. She’s in her 50s, lithe and grey-haired, energetic and idealistic. “Integration”, she says, “occurs because of the host, not the guest. If your child has a birthday party and you don’t invite the foreign child in his class, it’s not going to happen.”Silvia Mainardi, one of the teachers, points out various students. “That lad,” she says, pointing out a cheery seven-year-old running around the corridors, “was found wandering alone along the Greek-Albanian border. He was adopted by an Italian family. That boy arrived here from Libya on a dinghy with his father.”There are so many immigrant children in the school that it has deliberately become a holistic place of healing and recreation. Micciarelli and her staff work almost as much with the families as with their children, and the school has a psychologist available to parents. “We’re often the only place where they are listened to,” Micciarelli says. The school has founded a charity, Si Può Fare (“We can do it”) and runs courses for mothers, as well as free after-school courses in music, theatre, sports and even sailing for the poorest children.Every few weeks a new student arrives, usually frightened and traumatised, not speaking Italian, often not even knowing its alphabet. In 2005, four siblings, the Mossamets, joined the school. Asik, Cameyi, Sajid and Jsan were from Bangladesh, and had come with their mother to be with their father, Ibrahim, who had been working in a factory in Camerano, just south of Ancona, for years. Only the oldest child had stayed in Bangladesh.Their difficulties were huge. The mother was illiterate, and Sajid was deaf-mute, and had never had any education. Their father seemed to have fallen out with the local Bangladeshi community, some said because he had been drinking too much. Even by immigrant standards, they were isolated and facing immense challenges.But Cameyi, who was 10, was bright and vivacious. Because she was put in a class of younger children, she was looked up to by her peers. She was like most girls her age: singing pop songs, window-shopping, going for a passeggiata – a stroll – along the city’s boulevards. Her Italian quickly improved, and she was soon like a second mother in the family, translating for everyone.To say the school went the extra mile is an understatement. Mainardi used her knowledge of sign language to communicate with Sajid and translate the Qur’an for him. She often invited the siblings to dinner in order, as she says, to “raise them out of poverty”. Mainardi took Cameyi and her siblings to doctors’ appointments. They regularly stayed overnight in her flat, squeezing in with her own children.The family had been in Italy for five years when things started to go wrong. Cameyi’s father was diagnosed with lung cancer. He lost his job, and by late 2009 had fallen behind on rent payments. One day Cameyi was asked into the headmistress’s office after school. There were two social workers there, who said she couldn’t go home. Her family’s flat had been repossessed. All her clothes and makeup, her trinkets and teddy bears were gone.Social services had arranged a room for Cameyi, her mother and for her two younger siblings, in a grotty hotel near the station. Her older brother Asik and her father – who was undergoing chemotherapy that day and, according to the teachers, “vomiting every three paces” – would be left on the streets.Again the teachers pulled out all the stops. For a month and half they raised enough money to pay for a hotel room so that Ibrahim and Asik could be with their family. “I even told my father’s car mechanic that I needed €50,” Mainardi laughs, “and he just opened his till and took it. People were incredibly generous.”Mainardi showed me a photo of the new flat that social services eventually found for the family. The walls are so grey and black with mould, but Cameyi is on the sofa, smiling. By then she was 15 and bored with school. The headmistress says that Cameyi seemed to have pulsioni, a word that implies both “instincts” and “sex drive”.“I had the idea that she was older than her age,” she remembers. “She had a longing for love, she was in love with love. She was putting on makeup, hoping to be on show, longing to redeem herself.”Cameyi was also finding her family claustrophobic. She told the teachers she wanted to come to all the after-school courses, but that she wasn’t allowed. “I went to pick her up for school one day”, recalls Mainardi, “and she was sitting there with her two younger siblings looking extremely grumpy.” Like most teenagers, Cameyi must have often resented her relatives, feeling ashamed or embarrassed by people who seemed to her disabled, illiterate, ill and unemployed.Then, early one morning in May 2010, says Micciarelli, a desperate Ibrahim came into her office and said that Cameyi hadn’t been home all night. Micciarelli accompanied him to the police station and reported the young girl missing.Micciarelli and Mainardi went through Cameyi’s schoolbooks and found a diary. In it were all sorts of love hearts and ti amo (“I love you”) scrawlings. The name written in the teenager’s diary, the seeming object of her infatuation, was Monir Kazi.The investigation picked up speed. Some claimed to have seen Cameyi at the railway station catching a train south towards Porto Recanati. Kazi was 20, five years older than her, and lived in an eighth-floor flat at Hotel House with four others. He had met Cameyi in Ancona, where his sister lived. A photograph of the two kissing had been shared on Myspace.When police went through Hotel House’s CCTV (which has since stopped working), Cameyi was seen entering alone. “She didn’t have the maturity to recognise the danger of a building that would repel you or me,” says Mainardi. “Her problem was her innocence, not her so-called emancipation.”Investigators obtained a search warrant for Kazi’s flat. His pillow had blood on it, but when tested it didn’t show a match for Cameyi’s. Kazi had gone to hospital for hours on the day she went missing, complaining of stomach cramps. Even more suspicious was his decision suddenly to up sticks: he left Italy to go to Greece. In July of that year, Cameyi’s father died.Police couldn’t begin extradition proceedings without evidence, and they had none. Kazi eventually returned to Italy but, in 2011, was expelled from the country. The investigation into the missing 15-year-old petered out, and many people felt there was a lack of urgency because the missing person lacked well-connected Italian relatives. “Over the years,” says Silvia Mainardi, “no one spoke about this case in the city: there were no processions, appeals, nothing to move public opinion.”When you ask Micciarelli, the headmistress, how Ancona has changed after 30 years of immigration, she says something unexpected: “It hasn’t changed at all. There are just two Anconas now, because all the foreigners are concentrated in certain areas.”Mainardi remained close to Cameyi’s family, who were convinced Cameyi had left home for a better life. Mainardi even became so fascinated by the idealism and dysfunctionality of the immigration system – “something had so clearly gone wrong here” – that she became an external student of the subject at Bologna University.At the end of June this year, three months after the femur was found, confirmation arrived that the human remains from the drug dealer’s abandoned building were those of Cameyi. It was, by then, over eight years since her disappearance. Investigators always talk about speed and momentum, but a few years, in the chaotic life of Hotel House, is like a century. All trace of Kazi is gone, and investigators admit they don’t know where he is.“I always had the sense that everything led to Hotel House,” says Mainardi. But this new proof was “a chilling change of perspective”. She is a cheerful woman by habit, but is angered by the lack of dignity afforded to Cameyi even in death: “That ditch was a general dumping ground for rubbish. That’s what really hurts.”At Hotel House, residents are weary of all the bad press because, they say, outsiders don’t see what really goes on. Most of the fights aren’t examples of gang warfare but just arguments between cricketers from Asia and footballers from Africa about who can play on the makeshift concrete pitch. Punch-ups that have been written up as drug dealers’ turf wars, they’ll tell you, were really over a bike or a woman – just as happens everywhere when men have drunk too much.And it’s true that the longer you’re there, the serenity emerges as much as the darkness. The building has been a marginalised community for so long that there are now second-generation “hotel-dwellers”: 404 minors live in the building. They make the place noisy and playful. As I watched a game of five-a-side with Franca, she named them all and their nationalities: Macedonian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Algerian … but they were all screaming at each other in slangy Italian. Without even thinking about it, they are linguistic natives.One of the most interesting aspects of the building is the hopefulness of the Italian residents. They represent about half a percent of Hotel House’s population. They have long given up on the idea of getting back what their flats were once worth – but that, you sense, isn’t the only reason they haven’t moved out.Luca Davide, the porter, told me why he stays on: “Here there’s goodness, and we’ve got to help it emerge, to make the world understand that 30 ethnicities can coexist peacefully.” Although realistic about the building’s problems, Davide is fond of the ethnic ersity. “We could become a beacon of integration. We could have people envy what we’ve created.” The struggles of his neighbours, he says, are his own: “Our interests are complementary, they overlap.”On the 11th floor there’s a retired air force colonel, Alfredo La Rosa, who was born in Libya. The place reminds him of housing estates where he grew up, where people survived with barely anything. “Hotel House”, he told Internazionale magazine recently, “speaks of our future, of the multiethnic society that is coming. This building could be a great opportunity to experiment with forms of coexistence.”Another draw for the remaining Italians is that they, knowing how to make things happen, can improve peoples’ lives very simply. Franca got the mayor to turn a couple of streetlamps around to act as floodlights for the one grass pitch. Enzo bought the chalk for the lines. Franca goes and knocks on doors until 200 people have stumped up €40 each to repair and replace the sewers.When those Italians talk about integration, they sound plaintive, not xenophobic. “For true integration,” Enzo the glass-blower says, “you have to understand how things work here, you have to be able to adapt in order not to be marginalised.” You get the sense that the Italians now see themselves as a tiny, often ignored, minority.Every time you go there, you’re also struck by the variety: a Tunisian teenager in a catalogue-clean flat studying fashion, hoping to get to the Accademia in Milan an Italian doctor who holds a surgery on the eighth floor the Pakistani cricketer who hopes to play for the Italian national team. There’s both integration and isolation. The most isolated, you sense, are the wives who you only see once a week when they catch the Thursday bus to market.Nobody denies Hotel House’s problems. Police know that drug users are still coming from 400km away to score wholesale. But the business is still tiny compared to, say, Naples, Rome or Milan. National law enforcement agencies have bigger fish to fry than Hotel House. And so it lingers on, in its uniquely extra-statal, self-regulating way.Every initiative seems to bounce off it. The mayor of Porto Recanati ordered its complete evacuation by December last year if safety measures were not put in place, but that deadline passed and people stayed. The regional government has lent the building’s administrator €100,000 to renovate the external areas and begin safety work, but the loan has irritated law-abiding locals who say it’s a state bailout that rewards illegality. The doomsday scenario – in which a fire engulfs the whole building – seems worryingly imaginable.And yet it is a home to thousands. There are 30 legitimate businesses. Qui sto bene, almost everyone says: “I’m good here.” Many say benissimo. One Senegalese man says to me in thumpy Italian: “It’s not so different to Senegal: the beach, the rubbish, the struggle.” Every time you go, you meet someone new, but often, when you ask after someone you met last time, you’re told they’ve moved on. There’s little permanence in migrancy.Given that the police don’t even know precisely who is living at Hotel House, it seems far-fetched that they’ll ever find someone who left here seven years ago. Nobody knows where Monir Kazi is. A missing person has been found, but the man who knows most about her death will probably never be seen again.• Follow the long read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa001b582bbed9b9cab3e0d8eb5f5a7a52de2a56/0_0_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c431b8b05c72093046b16ce4795a8d54","title":"nevis how the worlds most secretive offshore haven refuses to clean up podcast","story":"The years since 2008 have seen a global crackdown on offshore finance.

Whitehall’s lobbying tsar, Alison White, also said she will examine whether the free market thinktank should be registered as a lobbyist.The two investigations were announced following an undercover investigation by Unearthed, an arm of Greenpeace, which found that in May the IEA arranged for US donors who pledged to donate £35,000 to have a private meeting with Steve Baker MP, when he was Brexit minister. Its director Mark Littlewood was also covertly filmed promising introductions to ministers for an investigator posing as a representative of a US farming investor who was considering donating to the IEA.A spokesman for Baker said that any suggestion he would attend meetings because “access” to him was being sold was entirely false and that Baker “met US Republicans in his political capacity to discuss trade relations between the two countries”.Lobbyists are expected to list their clients and any contact with ministers or senior civil servants. The IEA, which is an educational charity, does not routinely declare its donors, which are known to include tobacco, oil, alcohol and gambling companies or associations.It also emerged on Monday that the casino industry donated £8,000 to the IEA after it published a report calling for more casinos. The National Casino Forum confirmed it checked facts from the report and an internal document seen by the  suggests the forum had agreed to fund the report as a way of getting its message across through the IEA.The IEA said industry does not have “any sway or influence on the conclusions we come to in our research”. It said no one outside the thinktank saw a draft of the casino report or made any changes prior to publication.The thinktank’s director, Mark Littlewood, had previously told Unearthed’s undercover investigator that a donor could fund and shape “substantial content” in research reports commissioned by the IEA, that would support calls for a free-trade deal between the UK and the US.The investigation by the Charity Commission raises questions about the IEA’s charitable status which means it enjoys tax breaks on its £2.3m annual expenditure. Charity regulations state that “an organisation will not be charitable if its purposes are political”.A Charity Commission spokeswoman said the allegations raised by the Unearthed investigation and reported in the  were “of a serious nature”.“Educational charities can play an important role in informing the public,” she said. “The law is clear, however, that they must do so in a balanced and neutral way. There are clear rules for charities regarding political activity that form a key part of both charity law and public expectations.”The commission has powers to examine the IEA’s internal financial records, legally compel it to provide information and ultimately to disqualify trustees. The IEA denies it has breached charity law.“We do not act in donors’ interests, except to the extent that they have an interest in pursuing free trade and free markets,” a spokeswoman said, adding that the thinktank makes “independent editorial decisions and then seeks funding ... It is surely uncontroversial that the IEA’s principles coincide with the interests of our donors.”Jon Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, alleged the IEA “engaged in extensive lobbying and controversial political campaign activity in pursuit of specific policy goals, which go well beyond the scope of its objects as an ‘educational’ charity”.A former board member of the Charity Commission, Andrew Purkis, also said the regulator should be worried that the IEA’s director told undercover investigators that the thinktank was “in the Brexit influencing game”. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Monday, Littlewood denied any breach of regulations and said: “We want politicians to listen to us. I don’t apologise for that.” When asked whether the IEA was sufficiently unmindful of the interests of its donors, he said: “We have to find people with whom we have synergy. We have to raise money from companies, iniduals, foundations.”The IEA said it was “spurious to suggest that the IEA is engaging in any kind of ‘cash for access’ system”.The Institute of Economic Affairs was established in 1955 by admirers of the free-market economist Friedrich Hayek. Its mission involves “analysing and expounding the role of markets in solving economic and social problems”.\u0026nbspIn July it launched a £50,000 prize for ideas about harnessing the free market to solve the UK’s housing crisis. It is established as an educational charity and does not have to declare its donors, although it is widely known to have been backed by tobacco, alcohol and oil companies, among others. It publishes reports, and organises conferences and dinners that are often attended by government ministers as well as donors. It has a high media profile, regularly supplying spokespeople to TV news channels.Last year it spent £2.3m on its activities, which include distributing a magazine about economics to thousands of A-level students.Its trustees include Patrick Minford, a pro-Brexit economics professor who supported Margaret Thatcher, and the hedge fund billionaire and Conservative party donor Sir Michael Hintze.\u0026nbspResponding to the Greenpeace investigation, Purkis said: “Offering donor access to ministers is a practice more closely associated with commercial lobbyingPR companies or raising funds for political parties rather than charities, but charity fundraisers do quite frequently offer donors access to their patrons and celebrity supporters.“The more serious aspect for the Charity Commission may be the focus on influencing current policymaking in a particular direction, whether directly or via donors with access, which is not what educational charities should be doing. Littlewood talks about the IEA’s ‘ideological position’, which to some may suggest a closed world view that the IEA is trying to promote. Educational charities should not be promoting an ideology.”He continued: “The reference to donors being able to influence ‘substantial content’, though not conclusions, adds to the worries that the public’s trust and confidence in charities as existing solely for the public benefit can be endangered if charity reports are perceived to be ‘substantially influenced’ by big donors – who may represent particular private interests and whose identity, in the case of IEA, is often secret.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/495ecc52932e0a53dd6cb513f9a973934b965504/0_170_4316_2589/master/4316.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f01eb6b2e092c6e9d378b76a2a059273","title":"england india test cricket","story":"Swaths of empty seats could prove a troubling backdrop during the opening exchanges of England’s first Test against India, with Edgbaston reporting low ticket sales for what is meant to be the highlight of the cricketing summer.Warwickshire fear there could be up to 10,000 tickets unsold on both days one and two of England’s 1,000th men’s Test. Officials at the club have put what could be a disappointing turnout down to a Wednesday start that means the ground will not likely be filled up until Friday and Saturday.While ticket sales for the Ashes series next summer will doubtless be strong, figures for this week at the 25,000-capacity Edgbaston demonstrate the challenge of marketing midweek Test cricket outside London a Saturday start for the third Test in Nottingham could also throw up a similar concern later in that match.India, meanwhile, have shrugged off suggestions that they are going into the series undercooked.

But as the 32-year-old arrived back in Britain following a heavy night of celebrations, there were growing calls for Team Sky’s dominance to be curbed.Thomas admitted that his victory had “all come together like a dream” and said he had received calls from Arsène Wenger and Elton John, as well as a video message from Thierry Henry. An open-top bus parade is also planned in Wales, although Thomas’s next appointment will be a criterium in Belgium on Tuesday evening.Team Sky’s latest success went down less well in France, with the Tour director, Christian Prudhomme, calling for an end to power meters to make the race less predictable. Meanwhile some French papers floated the idea of a salary cap for teams – pointing out that Sky has an estimated £30m-plus budget – while Sunweb, the squad of second-placed Tom Dumoulin, is reckoned to be about half that, with Movistar’s budget about £12m a year.The 2014 winner, Vincenzo Nibali, has also floated the idea of a cap, a theme enthusiastically taken up by the French daily Libération, which warned there had been a combination of “disillusioned anger” from fans and “icy indifference” from the public during this year’s Tour. As it pointed out, in 2012 the UCI athletes’ commission had agreed that a more equal distribution of wealth was needed in professional cycling, but nothing had come of it.“Six years on, the distribution of the booty has gotten worse,” the paper wrote. “The gap between the means of teams has exploded – while the shareholders of ASO refuse to give up a cent.”Meanwhile L’Équipe criticised both the Team Sky principal, Dave Brailsford, and the UCI president, David Lappartient, for their behaviour amid the fallout of Froome’s salbutamol case. “One can regret that Lappartient and Brailsford behaved like two yapping dogs who met on a pavement, sniffed each other’s behinds and barked over one another via the press,” it wrote.It also condemned the behaviour of fans, saying: “There has always been schoolboy behaviour on the Tour, but a line was crossed this year, that of violence, and that in part ruined the feast.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0496f07539918a3cdf4fdf1f8e9ad69fec85d03/0_58_5184_3113/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0514f1acaa61f1b85762a5f89201e4d","title":"kareem open letter nfl owners","story":"To deny professional athletes the right to express dissent in a peaceful manner is a disgrace to the Constitution, the opposite of patriotism and shameful moral weaknessWhew!

Domestic violence accusations against players. The Papa John’s founder mouthing off about something or other. Players taking a national anthem knee (NAK, for short). President Trump’s “problematic” rambling. Commissioner Roger Goodell under siege from, well, everybody. Bet it makes you fellas long for the good old days when all you had to worry about was Janet Jackson’s nip slip. Where’s faithful Hodor when you need someone to hold the door against relentless attackers?Then you made it worse.In May, you implemented a childish policy about how grown men must respond to the national anthem: a player can stay in the locker room during the anthem, but if he takes the field and then protests, the team and the player can be fined. Oh, Dear Owners. You stood at the precipice of history tasked with deciding whether to choose the principles of the US Constitution over profits of commerce, patriotism over pandering, morality over mob mentality, promoting social justice over pushing beers. Sadly, you blinked. Courage, it seems, is expected only of players.Now, following the Miami Dolphins channeling of the abusive students in Stanford Prison Experiment by over-punishing protesting players, the May agreement is frozen and new negotiations have begun, this time including the NFL Players Association. A kneejerk reaction came on 26 July when Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones announced he would require all players to stand during the anthem – or else. President Trump was not too busy with his tariff wars to claim a personal victory: “Way to go Jerry This is what the league should do!” (Too busy to put in that comma after “go,” though.)Why aren’t you NFL owners outraged by that? If it were white people suffering those same statistics, you wouldn’t even play the national anthem. Then again, you wouldn’t have had the opportunity to become owners in the first place.To be fair, not all you owners have cowered under the false flag of patriotism to hide their shame. New York Jets chairman and CEO Christopher Johnson said the team would not discipline a player who protests and he would pay the league’s fine. Giants co-owner Steve Tisch has also said that his players will not be punished for protesting during the anthem. Jeffrey Lurie, owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, released a statement vaguely supporting his players right to “influence positive change”, Jed York, the CEO of the 49ers and the sole abstainee from the May vote, has not elaborated on the club’s policy. I’m sure your players appreciate your loyalty to them. The rest of us respect your integrity in the face of political pressure. And there is the $90m the NFL has earmarked for social justice causes over the next seven years.We all are entitled to our opinions, but when those opinions translate into actions that affect the whole community at large, we have a responsibility to scrutinize those opinions, to hold them to a higher standard of reason. Denying your players their freedom to express their concerns sends a clear message that you don’t value your black players’ values. You’re telling them that they must abide by your white perception of social justice even though you have no experience with the kind of institutional injustice that robs their community of lives, hope and a future. You are owners in that you own the franchise, but you don’t own the players or their hearts and minds. I’m reminded of the song from protest singer Phil Ochs, “I’m Gonna Say It Now”:Ooh, you’d like to be my father you’d like to be my dad,And give me kisses when I’m good and k me when I’m bad.But since I’ve left my parents I’ve forgotten how to bow,So when I’ve got something to say, sir, I’m gonna say it now.If not now, when?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e3787b6e04cfabb873b37b9a09f7058a0dd96a4/172_104_1937_1162/master/1937.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6e9ac7a2e41fb2bd973b2e17b72c84b","title":"womens british open catriona matthew","story":"The 2009 British Open golf champion, returning to the scene of her win, reflects on her triumph shortly after giving birthThe legend of Supermum was established even before Catriona Matthew claimed the Women’s British Open of 2009. The mere fact the Scot contended for the major, 11 weeks after giving birth to Sophie and 11 days following a dramatic escape from a fire-hit chalet, was enough. The best stories have happy endings Matthew prevailed at Royal Lytham \u0026amp St Annes. She had arrived in Lancashire with ambitions only of making the cut.Matthew’s immediate downplaying of her achievement was notable. It was left to those covering the event to articulate the extraordinary circumstances. “I suppose at the time you don’t really think about it, you just get on with what you are doing,” Matthew says. “You are focused on golf. I ended up playing better than I anticipated then got right into it at the weekend. You go into playing mode, being competitive. At the time I didn’t appreciate it was only 11 weeks when you look back, when you think about it, you realise it probably was quite amazing.“For the next week there was a lot of hype about it. When you are playing, the adrenaline keeps you going but afterwards everything sinks in … then you collapse.”Matthew’s smile explains fond memories. She was then 39 and, with her husband, Graeme, as caddie, this marked her maiden – and hitherto only – major triumph. This week Matthew will return to Lytham for the first time as the marquee women’s golf event in Britain does likewise. “For a British person to win the British Open? It’s the one you want,” she says. “If I’m going to win only one major, that would be a pretty nice one to have. It’s funny, my mum had been feeding Sophie through the night that week so it was into Monday morning and time for her 3am feed. I was feeding Sophie, mum just woke up anyway so she joined me for a cup of tea. It was back to reality apart from this time, the trophy was sitting there too.”Matthew had recalled a “speedy” four-hour labour for her second daughter, with the North Berwick resident back on a golf range within five weeks. British Open build-up had included an appearance at the Evian Championship in France, where a further layer of drama unfolded. “We were in a two-level chalet, built into the hillside,” Matthew recalls. “It sounded like rain outside, then we opened the door and there were flames. We ran outside, there was no fire alarm, we were shouting ‘Fire! Fire!’ at 10pm.“It was the kind of building you were always going to get out of but another player, Amy Yang, and her dad had to jump out of their balcony. We stupidly went back in to get our passports and a few things so Graeme burnt his feet. The fireman got my watch, I had left it on the bedside table he said five minutes later the ceiling was down in our room.”Any notion that the golfing gods were warning Matthew to return to full-time domestic life was readily shrugged off. She departed Lytham almost £200,000 richer and as Scotland’s only women’s major champion, as remains the case today. “It wasn’t until I hit the tee shot off the last that I knew I’d won,” Matthew says. “It was a nice walk from there. I hit a nice tee shot, missed the bunkers and knew I’d won with a three-shot lead. I was happy to hack it up towards the green.”She will return to Lytham, understandably, with a spring in her step. “I definitely want to go there and do well. I don’t want to turn up not thinking I can.”If nine years hardly feels like sufficient time for a broad changing of attitudes, Matthew senses an identical feat would be treated differently in 2018. She has no complaints whatsoever about that this down-to-earth working mum, who just happens to operate in a sporting environment, has never courted publicity.“At the time it felt as though it was widely recognised but that’s nine years ago now. I think women’s sport has really come on leaps and bounds. I’d include golf in that,” says Matthew. “If it happened now, there would have been even more attention. You can see that with Serena Williams playing at Wimbledon. It felt like I got a lot of exposure but, if it was now, I think there would be more. It would be a much bigger thing, even nine years later, which I think is a good thing it shows how sport has evolved.“That’s not why I play golf. I play to try and see how good I can be – that has always been the case – and to compete against the best in the world. It’s easy to sit here when you have done well and say how much you enjoy it but obviously, when you are starting out, keeping your card and how much money you earn is important. I think if a Scot won it now, it would have more impact just because women’s sport is better recognised in the media. Nine years ago you would very rarely have seen football, cricket, netball on television and now you see a lot more. You see more ladies’ golf events. There wasn’t the same exposure back then. Now there seems to be a push to be seen the same way as men.”Matthew, who has always played mainly on the LPGA Tour in the United States, still competes for 22 weeks per year. Sophie and her 11-year-old sister, Katie, are members at Gullane Golf Club in East Lothian. “As they are getting older, I almost find they need you more, they want you home more,” Matthew says. “It does get more difficult as you get older but we have grown up together as a family so in a way it is kind of accepted that’s what I do.”Matthew’s bigger picture relates to Solheim Cup captaincy. She will lead Europe against the United States at Gleneagles next year. A comprehensive defeat for the Europeans in Des Moines in 2017 triggered understandable negativity regarding the state of the women’s game in this continent.No such discussion can pass without a nod to the sparse schedule on offer for Ladies European Tour players. “Everyone wants to see more events,” says the 48-year-old. “I don’t know all the ins and outs but I know they are in talks to have more events hopefully for next year. It is tough if you play only once every few weeks to get any momentum.”Matthew, at least, has significant experience of defying all odds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61d66e4761abbe48e4d16e8d2c1491ee8f4232c7/0_144_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bea08c4e9f919df9a7f418b73543032","title":"formula one ferrari red bull max verstappen","story":"Ferrari paid the price for a slow stop at the Hungaroring while Red Bull’s Max Verstappen blew a fuse after a power failureHaving made three strategic errors this season, the pressure has been on the Mercedes pit wall. With qualifying crucial in Hungary they were on top of their game in a chaotic wet session. Tyre choice at the right time was key and it was by no means easy. The team handled it well and ensured their drivers were on the right rubber at the right time. After this it was Lewis Hamilton who was once again exceptional. As Mark Webber pointed out, on his pole lap he took the inside line for traction on the penultimate corner. Always looking for the extra grip and where a driver’s feel makes all the difference, Hamilton was in a class of his own, as he was in the wet at Monza last year. Sebastian Vettel in contrast looked almost tentative, even in comparison to Kimi Räikkönen. Perhaps the shadow of Germany still loomed large?The Scuderia were right to try an alternate strategy for Vettel, starting him on the softs, to go long and attack at the end but their plan was dependent on jumping Valtteri Bottas through the stops. It appeared to be going well, by lap 35 he had 25 seconds on the Finn, with a stop taking around 21 seconds. However Vettel then hit traffic and Bottas got the hurry-up, taking almost five seconds out of the gap in four laps. Ferrari’s slow stop cost them but before that they could still have ensured Vettel’s advantage by amending their plan. Vettel believed he could have stayed out even longer and once again opened a comfortable gap to Bottas, leaving himself with even fresher rubber at the end to attack Hamilton. He intimated as much on leaving the pit lane. The Scuderia’s calls have generally been good but this time they were too conservative. As the season reaches the sharp end, with Vettel currently playing catch-up, they may have to take more of a chance in future.A hugely successful weekend for Pierre Gasly in the Toro Rosso proved the potential of the young French driver and included a new experience. Gasly qualified brilliantly, taking advantage of the wet conditions to take sixth on the grid. He backed it up with a fine race for sixth, the best outside the big three. He passed Carlos Sainz to run as high as fifth and at times was lapping three-tenths quicker than Kevin Magnussen in the opening stint. He was the only midfield driver not to be lapped by Hamilton, indeed he had a taste of life at the front. “I think the first time that I saw blue flags for cars ahead of me, when I saw that, I was like: ‘It means I’m doing a good race’. Usually the blue flag is for me.” Toro Rosso have had three races where they felt they would be strong, Hungary was one and in the other two, Bahrain and Monaco, Gasly was fourth and seventh. Impressive stuff.On Friday it was announced that Force India had gone into administration and that buyers of the team were being sought. One of the architects was their own driver Sergio Pérez. This was far from about recouping cash, however. Pérez knew a winding-up order was set to be made on the team from another creditor and he, alongside Mercedes and sponsor BWT, chose to act beforehand, so the team could keep operating and be sold to a backer offering long-term financial stability. Pérez was unhappy but believed he had to do something. “We got to a point where action had to be taken, to protect the 400 people that work in the team,” he said. “It got too much and I was asked by a couple of members of the team to go ahead and save the team.” The collective action should result in a stronger future for Force India. They are not Caterham or Manor. Operationally they are one of the best outfits on the grid and should make a very solid investment. Toto Wolff has already said there are “many potential buyers, with deep pockets”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0bc90ef11e385cdf2bdf073a017b19b3df0877f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=960da3b8e6435a960287636fcc5e36e7","title":"mamma mia film musicals cher go gos whats next","story":"The box office success of Mamma Mia 2 and Broadway buzz over shows centred around music from The Go-Go’s, Alanis Morrisette and Cher opens the doors for more big star musicalsIf jukebox musicals come in waves, right now we’re experiencing a significant swell. The second cinematic plunder of the Abba catalogue, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, has already made $176m worldwide in just over a week. The Go-Go’s catalogue show, Head Over Heels, just opened on Broadway, joining Summer, a musical stitched around the life of Donna Summer, which debuted in April. On the horizon looms Jagged Little Pill, one of the few jukebox musicals to win rave reviews for its early run, insuring a swift move to Broadway. Soon enough it will be joined by The Cher Show, based on the bawdy life of the ex-Mrs Bono Tina: The Musical, a New York version of the hit from London and a new beast called The Heart of Rock \u0026amp Roll which plumbs the Huey Lewis and the News archives for a production that opens at San Diego’s prestigious Old Globe Theatre in September.Given that more than 100 such musicals have been created since the very first – fashioned in 1975 by Harry Chapin, titled The Night They Made America Famous – can there be any stage-worthy song catalogue left to exploit? You can bet producers, and publishers, are looking into that right now. Here’s an immodest proposal for 10 acts whose legacies have the heft, resonance and flair to earn the stage: Seventeen years ago, a new musical titled Closer to Heaven opened, boasting fresh music from Pet Shop Boys. Neither the new songs nor the story wowed critics or audiences, dooming the show to close less than five months later. Why not correct that with something closer to the tried and true? The Boys’ catalogue bursts with operatically-grand songs that telegraph specific characters, including a wan observer who vacillates between witty cynicism and wary appreciation. Surely, there’s a show to be fashioned that follows the arc from the youthful conniving of Rent to the hard-won wisdom of Being Boring.In the past, the Kinks took the opposite tack from the Pet Shop Boys. Four years ago, they went the strict jukebox musical route with their hit show Sunny Afternoon. It told the story of the band’s formation, weaving in scores of Kinks-y classics along the way. With its robust two-year run, the show did well enough to warrant a more ambitious follow-up. Turns out, Ray Davies and the band already have one semi-ready-made. Their 1969 album, Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire), was originally supposed to be a collaboration between Davies’ music and a script from writer Julian Mitchell for a Granada TV production. The collaboration got derailed along the way, but the music found its way to the Arthur album in October of 1969, which became one of the band’s most acclaimed works. Given its wide-ranging songs, and a poignant story line that traces 100 years of British history, Arthur could yield one of the most resonant rock musicals this side of The Who’s Tommy, a work which first appeared just five months before the Kinks’ gem.In 2015, the smash play Rock of Ages married a deliciously idiotic plot to the high-kitsch hits of 80s glam metal. A far more serious musical might be created from the catalogue of the first glam-rock revolution of the 70s. Think: a singingdancing spin on the Todd Haynes’ movie Velvet Goldmine. Using songs from the BowieT-RexMott age, a skilled book writer could draw a savvy link between that genre’s pioneering gender non-conformity and its current, more evolved, iteration.After years of talk about an Aretha film project, there’s finally movement behind one that’s set to star Jennifer Hudson. She’s perfect, not only for a cinematic treatment, but for a stage production primed to bring down the house. Hudson has the charisma, soul and live chops to channel the power on the Queen for the Great White Way.The first hit scored by the chic writing team of Burt Bacharach and Hal David (recorded by Marty Robbins) has the ideal title for a play about the pair’s brilliance – The Story of My Life. There have already been successful musicals connected to Carole King (Beautiful), the team of Phil Spector, Ellie Greenwich and Jeff Barry (Leader of the Pack), and Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller (Smokey Joe’s Cafe). Surely there’s one to be made from the lives of the guys who created songs as arresting as Don’t Make Me Over, Anyone Who Had A Heart and Walk On By.A highly eccentric Smiths jukebox musical was created back in 2005 by the theater company Anonymous Society under the title Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others. I saw that show in its debut in Dublin in 2005 and loved it for its sheer oddity and daring. It’s well worth re-staging the piece in the world’s artier venues. Or something new could be created that’s stays true to the post-teen angst that courses through the entire SmithsMorrissey catalogue.The driving force of Miss Jackson’s life – her will to emerge as a star from under the long shadow of brother Michael– has the kind of drama that writes itself. Janet’s trove of hits contains enough tension, sex and wonder to pack a show with excitement. Better, whoever gets cast in the lead role needn’t be a great singer – she just has to be a woman who knows how to take control.The supremely theatrical Wainwright has already created two operas, written music for a pair of dance productions (including a ballet), and supplied music for a Robert Wilson theater piece based on Shakespeare’s sonnets. But the guy can also write a pert pop song. Surely, he has it in him to create either a king new musical or fashion one from work he has already recorded. As a life-long devotee of musical theater Gods like Cole Porter and Noël Coward, Wainwright seems born for Broadway. For an added lure, he could work with his father, Loudon Wainwright III, the modern master of musical satire.The sly songs of Randy Newman have already been fodder for four musicals, including two revues plus his original, 1995’s take on Faust. Somehow overlooked in all this is Newman’s brilliant 1974 concept album, Good Old Boys, a ripe-for-staging examination of American racism that’s by turns insightful, hilarious and chilling.Yes, the 2013 musical about Tupac (Holla if You Hear Me) bombed big time –unjustifiably in my book. But that was before Hamilton broke Broadway’s aversion to hip-hop. Biggie’s iconic rhymes feature plots eager to be enacted and characters that beg to be made flesh."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b590f20e6f049db4d4f2dd31367a81ecaa021cc3/382_684_4151_2490/master/4151.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d0b3b2b1bea436bcdeb9c05e14d7352","title":"the best places to surf stay and eat on portugals coast","story":"Catch great waves, then kick back at a beach bar or restaurant before bedding down for the night – all tried and tested by Veerle Helsen, author of the book Surf \u0026amp StayVeerle Helsen spent six months touring the coasts of north-west Spain and Portugal in her campervan and with a surfboard.

Buried in cold storage at the Cartwright Hall Art Gallery in Bradford is a collection of art you have never seen, by a bunch of major British artists you’ve never heard of. This small gallery contains a hundred more works by British artists of African and Asian descent than the Tate’s national collection. Without it, the story of British art is a whitewash.“If these works are not captured in public collections there’s going to be a serious distortion of history,” is how Cartwright Hall’s senior curator, Nima Poovaya-Smith, puts it in Whoever Heard of a Black Artist? Britain’s Hidden Art History (BBC Four), and it is worth noting that it took a curator of colour to make it happen. This fascinating, moving film (it made me cry, which is not something that can often be said of BBC Four art documentaries) is a powerful reminder of how easily history can be erased. It sets out to fix the distortion, the result of what artist Sonia Boyce describes as “a mass systemic amnesia” in the art establishment. Racism, to be clear.Presenter Brenda Emmanus follows Boyce as she prepares to launch an exhibition of black and Asian modernist art at Manchester Art Gallery. The film opens with archive footage of a group of artists in the 1980s discussing the denial of their very existence. “I was told by my lecturers that there was no such thing as black art” “Black people don’t make pictures” “Whoever heard of a black artist?”. All of which reminded me of what I was told, both explicitly and implicitly, growing up in those years when being arty and brown-skinned at the same time was unthinkable and then, on the rare occasions when it did happen, unmentionable. The short answer to the question of whoever heard of a black artist is “no one”. Not even those of us who might have wanted to be one.Yet, when Boyce spent three years scouring public archives she found more than 2,000 works in 30 collections. The first wave came from the Windrush generation, arriving “with a huge sense of optimism”. We don’t need history to remind us how that worked out: we are seeing how they are being treated now. Emmanus meets Althea McNish, the first successful black female artist in Britain. A grand dame who lives in Tottenham, north London, she is as fabulous as her mid-century textiles, which were snapped up by Liberty, Balenciaga and Dior. She recalls visiting wheat fields for her signature piece, Golden Harvest (1959), inspired by the sugar cane fields of her native Trinidad. “The whole place excited me,” she says.Or what about Frank Bowling, initially shown alongside David Hockney as a British pop artist before being deemed a bit too, well, Caribbean. Or Rasheed Araeen, a conceptual artist who is only now, in his 80s, getting his first comprehensive retrospective at the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art, Gateshead. Heard of him? Me neither. Or Anwar Jalal Shemza, whose work obsessively examined the point where the square meets the circle, and who ended up as an A-level art teacher in Stafford. On Art UK, the public collections database, while Lucian Freud is richly described as British, English and German, Shemza is listed as Pakistani.Boyce and Emmanus travel to a rural Cumbrian farmhouse where Li Yuan-chia, now recognised as the father of Chinese abstraction, lived and worked in the 70s. With zero support or recognition, he created an avant-garde museum in the middle of nowhere. The LYC Museum, which showed artists including Barbara Hepworth, is now a ruin, all cracked windows and warped LYC signage lying in the rubble. There is a point at which neglect goes beyond making you angry it makes you sad. “It’s stunning … but really remote,” says Boyce, beginning to cry.By the 90s, the overtly political work of the Black Arts Movement was out and artists such as Chris Ofili, Anish Kapoor and Steve McQueen were in: mainstream, commercial and not necessarily, or solely, framing themselves as black or Asian. This opened up a space for artists of colour, but it was also a time when it became unfashionable to mention race at all when success meant assimilation, and being congratulated for not seeming black or Asian was an actual thing. A painful and insidious thing.Last year, Lubaina Himid, who came up through the Black Arts Movement, became the first black woman to win the Turner prize. “It’s difficult for me to say the white art world is racist,” she says in footage from 1986. “I can’t look at it like that. I have to look at it as something that can be changed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01bd695b04beec6f093b4d3c7d242d3e888b8787/146_174_2504_1502/master/2504.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0c72e4338c7c233813df4ccca68a057","title":"issa rae insecure","story":"The HBO show refused to fetishise its black characters and instead illuminated their lived experiences. As its third season arrives, we explore its impact on culture“Why you talk like a white girl?”“What’s up with your hair?”“Why ain’t you married?”The opening episode of Insecure – which first aired in the UK and the US in October 2016 – pulled audiences into a messy, complex vision of black womanhood, via the blunt comments of a group of school kids. Issa Dee (Issa Rae) addresses the disenfranchised pupils she’s mentoring with non-profit organisation We Got Y’All, and finds everything from her natural hair to her relationship to her career under scrutiny. Hilarious but uncomfortable, it set the scene for a series labelled by many as “the black Sex and the City”, and hailed by critics as the best show HBO had made in years.For others, Insecure was a chance to see their own lives reflected back at them with some semblance of reality this was a sitcom – often a sadcom – about black women’s relationships both with themselves and those around them. Unlike other series, the “sassy” black best friend wasn’t othered in relation to her white counterparts, because she was at the centre of the narrative. Fictional Issa was angry – angry at being the token black person adding “ersity” to a workplace run by a white woman in a dashiki, and angry at her rocky relationship with her underemployed boyfriend. But rather than a stale “angry black woman” cliche, here she had dimension and depth – and, of course, was very insecure.Alongside her was Lawrence (Jay Ellis), a man far from the stereotype of the hypermasculine black male, and best friend Molly (Yvonne Orji), a character plagued by romantic self-doubt and stuck in a staid, majority-white workplace. In short, not your typical, hackneyed black ensemble.With its nonchalant lols, relatability and the odd rap interlude, Insecure is a show that embodies the concept of “for us, by us” – that is, art and culture made for, and by, the black American community. It’s an antidote to excruciating portrayals of blackness crafted by unerse TV execs, a problem often highlighted in reality TV, where “angry black women” (Alexandra Burke on Strictly, The Apprentice’s Joanna Jarjue, Tiffany Pollard – dubbed “ghetto” by another Celebrity Big Brother contestant – and Love Island’s Samira Mighty) are seemingly edited to fit in with existing narratives. It’s something Insecure eschews, being the creation of a black, female showrunner (Rae), who came up via the acclaimed webseries The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl. As well as Rae, erse talent has been involved at every level, whether that’s the soundtrack (curated by Solange and R\u0026ampB producer Raphael Saadiq and featuring everyone from Junglepussy to SZA) or a cast of talented black breakthrough names including Natasha Rothwell (Kelli).In its second series, Insecure also developed to tackle topics such as the gender pay gap (with Molly discovering she earned less than a white male colleague), blackLatino relations in Issa’s job, and the fetishisation of the black body, with an estranged Lawrence objectified during a threesome with two non-black women. Themes such as these add to the sense that Insecure is destabilising tired norms, while more frivolous, millennial aspects – like the gifs and emojis that pop up on screen during text conversations – temper the seriousness of such topics.These tonal shifts could be seen to feed into the idea of the “black weird” – the trend for atypical representations of black America as exemplified by the likes of Donald Glover, actor Lakeith Stanfield (Atlanta, Get Out) and Janelle Monáe. Indeed, Rae herself could be seen to fit into their outlier bracket, having spoken at length about a childhood spent between Senegal, Maryland and Los Angeles, and feeling apart from black US culture (“We wanted to kind of paint that this character is in between two worlds and is just in a constant state of discomfort … She’s not black enough for the black people and not white enough for the white people,” she told NPR).For author Yomi Adegoke, much of the appeal of the show itself comes from the average, uncontroversial nature of its protagonists, who are navigating their early 30s. “I thought it was massively important, not just for African Americans but just generally for black women all over the world, to see ourselves portrayed so normally,” she explains. “Insecure shows the humdrum experiences that all black millennial women go through, but also puts them at the centre of the story. It just hits this sweet spot that quite a lot of predominantly white shows allow their characters to exist in, which is to be realistic, complex and live outside of the stereotypes.”While it may not be radical in of itself, Insecure has helped to take oft-marginalised narratives into the mainstream and make them shine. “I think for most black women watching it, it isn’t alternative,” adds Adegoke. “It’s just life.”Insecure returns to Sky Atlantic this month"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5d4d90a8b098aadb2a7e199fda45c182667333f/0_67_3552_2131/master/3552.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60a62b025fdf551aee34b4d8df3f6313","title":"love island 2018 the final follow all the action live","story":"Favourites Jack Fincham and Dani Dyer triumph over second place couple Paul Knops and Laura Anderson to be crowned king and queen of the villa Weirdly, my most indelible memory is the lacy trousers Rosie wore when when leaving the villa.

The Washington Post reported on Monday that North Korea appeared to be building one or two new liquid-fuelled intercontinental ballistic missiles at the large research facility on the outskirts of Pyongyang, citing unidentified officials familiar with intelligence reporting. According to the anonymous US official who spoke to Reuters, one photo showed a truck and covered trailer similar to those the North has used to move its ICBMs. As the trailer was covered, it was not possible to know what, if anything, it was carrying. The White House said it did not comment on intelligence. The evidence obtained this month is the latest to suggest ongoing activity at North Korea’s nuclear and missile facilities despite talks with the US and a June summit between North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and Donald Trump.Mintaro Oba, a former US diplomat who worked on North Korea policy, said: “It reflects an important fact: despite what US officials have been saying, North Korea didn’t commit to much of anything on denuclearisation.“It’s not surprising that North Korea would want to proceed with elements of their nuclear and missile programmes until a real deal is reached. They’re not just going to stop because we had a summit.” Trump declared soon after the Kim meeting that North Korea no longer posed a nuclear threat. Kim committed in a broad summit statement to work towards denuclearisation, but Pyongyang has offered no details as to how it might go about that, and subsequent talks have not gone smoothly.North Korean officials are considering disposing of a limited number of nuclear warheads in a deal with the US while secretly maintaining a nuclear arsenal, according to US intelligence reported by the Washington Post. It is not the first time US intelligence has clashed with the president’s optimism. In late June, US officials told US media outlets that intelligence agencies believed North Korea had increased production of fuel for nuclear weapons, and that it did not intend to fully give up its nuclear arsenal. Weeks after the summit, commercial satellite images showed the North was upgrading its only known nuclear power plant, the source of fuel for its weapons programme.The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, told the Senate foreign relations committee last week that North Korea was continuing to produce fuel for nuclear bombs despite its pledge to denuclearise. But he insisted the Trump administration was still making progress in its talks with Pyongyang. Joel Wit, a former state department negotiator and founder of 38 North, a North Korea monitoring project, said it was unrealistic to expect North Korea to stop its programmes “until the ink is dry on an agreement.“ That was the case with US negotiations with the Soviet Union during the cold war, and more recently with Iran, “which continued to build more centrifuges capable of producing nuclear material even as it negotiated with the United States to limit those capabilities,” Wit said.News of the construction came as generals from North and South Korea met at the border village of Panmunjom inside the demilitarised zone – the second such meeting since the leaders of the two countries held a summit in April about reducing military tensions. Experts have said the talks could lead to a reduction in military presence along the border, but there are doubts about the progress that can be made without a similar breakthrough on the nuclear issue.  The Sanumdong factory produced two Hwasong-15 ICBMs, North Korea’s longest-range missiles, but the US official noted that Pyongyang still had not tested a reliable re-entry vehicle capable of surviving a high-velocity trip through the Earth’s atmosphere and delivering a nuclear warhead.The official said it was possible that any new missiles the North was building may be for further testing of such vehicles and of more accurate guidance systems.“They seem to have figured out the engines, but not all the higher-tech stuff, and that might be what this is about,” the official said.

Rebel groups that had controlled most of the area for years quickly caved to the government’s advance after western backers including the US that had supported those fighters for years abandoned them and signalled they would not intervene to halt the regime’s offensive.Most towns and cities in Daraa and Quneitra capitulated in “reconciliation” deals that gave rebel fighters and civilians a choice between forced displacement to opposition territories in northern Syria or reconciling with the Assad regime. Most have chosen to stay, and some rebel groups joined the regime’s offensive against Jaysh Khalid ibn al-Waleed.Some humanitarian activists, including rescue workers who are part of the collective known as the White Helmets, remain trapped in parts of Daraa and Quneitra and have issued urgent appeals for their rescue. The Assad regime has reportedly refused to allow their evacuation, and the Syrian president has told a Russian media outlet that they would be killed if they did not lay down their arms.After rebel-held areas in Daraa and Quneitra were defeated, Assad’s forces went on to launch a bombardment of the Yarmouk River basin. That bombardment persisted despite an Isis attack on the neighbouring province of Sweida, which killed nearly 250 people.Isis militants also kidnapped 20 women and girls from the area and threatened to execute them if the regime continued its assault. Their fate is uncertain after the resumption of the campaign and the Isis defeat.The occupied Golan Heights is a plateau captured by Israel from Syria in 1967 in a move not recognised by the international community. Israel has maintained a close focus on the six-week campaign by Assad’s troops near the frontier and repeatedly said it will not tolerate Iranian forces approaching its territory as the battle concludes.Tehran has sent military staff and equipment to help Assad in the civil war and has built a significant presence in the war-torn state. Israel has responded with multiple airstrikes on bases where Iranian personnel are stationed.Israeli media reported that the government had asked Russia, also an Assad ally, to ensure government forces do not harm civilians near the perimeter fence, where displaced civilians have gathered in tents.  could not verify the report.Tensions between Iran and Israel peaked in February when Israel said it had shot down an Iranian drone in its airspace that had taken off from a Syrian airport. Since then, Israel has accused Iran of firing a barrage of rockets against its positions in the Golan.Additional reporting by Oliver Holmes in Jerusalem"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27a2cf62268ce4afdfb19f68878f328b6370ce77/0_176_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=441625cb7b276eb6a119a3f7b77d3ecb","title":"tuesday briefing brexit a drive into the unknown","story":"Britain’s car industry says talks must accelerate … nuclear waste may be buried under national parks … and s of the Galaxy stars defend James GunnHello on a Tuesday morning.

If we have no deal, there is no transition, there is no implementation period, that would kick in less than eight months away,” said Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Asked if there were any potential Brexit benefits for the £82bn British automotive industry and its 186,000 employees, Hawes said: “Not that we can see.”Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn could face a challenge to his Brexit policy as more than 150 constituency Labour parties, and some unions, line up to support a second referendum on the final deal. “There’s been a very definite shift internally over the last few weeks in support of a public vote,” said one shadow cabinet member.Aid abuse response damned – MPs have blasted charities for “complacency verging on complicity” in dealing with sexual abuse across the sector. The international development committee (IDC) says the UN has also failed to show sustained leadership on an issue that was known about in 2002. Pauline Latham, a Tory member of the committee, said it heard evidence of “rape, sex for food, calling people prostitutes when they’re actually desperate women who need to feed their families, or young girls who are trafficked”. Stephen Twigg, the Labour chair of the committee, said: “This is 16 years of failure by the entire international system of governments, the UN and the aid sector.”Navy brought bomber to UK – The Manchester Arena bomber, Salman Abedi, had been rescued by the Royal Navy from the civil war in Libya three years earlier, it has emerged. Abedi – who killed 22 people at an Ariana Grande pop concert in May 2017 – was 19 when he boarded the HMS Enterprise in Tripoli in August 2014 as one of more than 100 stranded British citizens. Abedi was being monitored by security services when he travelled to Libya, but his case was closed a month before his rescue.s raise pen for Gunn – The stars of s on the Galaxy have signed an open letter calling for the reinstatement of director James Gunn, who was fired by Disney over offensive tweets from his past.

Fifty years of nuclear power in the UK has generated 750,000 cubic metres of waste but the nation has still not developed a permanent disposal solution. The MPs argue that finding the safest site is paramount and national parks should not be excluded. The Green party MP Caroline Lucas called the idea “outrageous”, saying the quandary of what to do with radioactive waste showed Britain should stop building nuclear power stations.Pulled into line – New Zealand’s roads department will update its signage from “Linemen” to “Line Crew” after receiving a letter from a Zoe Carew, 7, who pointed out that “women can be line-workers too”. Roads boss Fergus Gammie wrote back to Zoe congratulating her for taking action. “Line Crew” would be used in future, he said – her suggestion of “Line-workers” was too long to fit.Earlier this year the remains of a teenage girl were found near Hotel House – a crumbling building largely occupied by recent immigrants in Porto Recanati, a small seaside town on Italy’s Adriatic coast.Many Italians regard Hotel House as a den of drugs and violence: when officers found the bones of Bangladesh-born Cameyi Mossamet, they were actually searching for stashes of drugs and money.

The 32-year-old, known as MbS, is said to be the world’s youngest defence minister and is also the kingdom’s deputy prime minister.Described by critics as an inexperienced firebrand, he has been the architect of the Kingdom’s 2015 intervention in Yemen, in which it has backed the exiled government over the Iranian-supported Houthi rebels.Jamie McGoldrick, the UN’s humanitarian coordinator in Yemen, has described it as “an absurd and futile war” and condemned the “mounting civilian casualties caused by escalated and indiscriminate attacks throughout Yemen”.PwC already has a presence in Saudi Arabia, but it is the company’s UK operation that is behind the project.PwC has already launched a “call for resources” – asking specialists and consultants in London whether they would be interested in moving to Riyadh to start the work – because, it said, the firm is “currently finalising the deal”.If it wins the contract, PwC is likely to be tasked with transforming several support areas within the defence ministry. The first phase of the work is likely to focus on how to reshape recruitment, resourcing, performance management, strategic workforce planning, and how to manage and communicate change. asked PwC what due diligence it had undertaken and how it would answer concerns about working with the Saudi military. The company declined to respond.The Saudi embassy in London was asked about the scale and scope of the project but also declined to comment. Frankental urged PwC to think again. “As any accountancy firm involved in work for the Saudi ministry of defence must know, the Royal Saudi Air Force has an appalling record in Yemen, with the Saudi-led military coalition having indiscriminately bombed Yemeni homes, hospitals, funeral halls, schools and factories. Thousands of Yemeni civilians have been killed and injured.”Anna Macdonald, director of the Control Arms Secretariat, a global coalition working for international arms control, said UK “should be focusing on trying to stop this terrible conflict, not assisting the Saudi government”.She added: “British companies should be very cautious indeed in what they are supporting. Yemen is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis and getting worse by the day.“The UK government and UK companies are fueling this in continuing to supply bombs and military equipment to Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners. Ordinary Yemenis need access to water, to humanitarian aid, and most pressingly of all, for the incessant bombing of their schools, hospitals, markets and funerals to stop.”Saudi Arabia has defended its military operations in Yemen.Earlier this year, the kingdom’s foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, said the critics were wrong.“They criticise us for a war in Yemen that we did not want, that was imposed on us,” he told the BBC. “They criticise us for a war in Yemen that is a just war, that is supported by international law.”Judeir blamed the Houthi rebels for blocking humanitarian aid and contributing to the humanitarian crisis.A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said firms had to operate by UK and international law, and there was no restriction on accountancy services in Saudi Arabia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb69a66f0fb4d15dba02aa617e98c915b855ce10/0_0_3071_1843/master/3071.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94e98b0bc86f5e91c69d6438b4538c3b","title":"zimbabwe votes first post mugabe election pictures","story":" Voters are casting their ballots in the country’s first election since the authoritarian leader was ousted last year.

I myself have made that point. In fact the vast majority of false negatives are not negligent,” he told The .However he said the 221 women identified by CervicalCheck were specifically selected because “their tests were misread to a significant degree and it had resulted in a delay to their diagnosis and treatment”.He said he could not say negligence was a factor in all the cases but the indications are the vast majority fall into this category. Mr O’Carroll said experts recruited to analyse the 221 cases have so far processed about 40 of them. “They feel that all of those so far involve a breach of duty of care,” he said. “So the indications are that the vast majority will be a breach of duty.” Mr O’Carroll said it was not the women who are forcing these matters to court but the HSE and the labs who are acting together. Promises by the State to settle with the women and then go after the labs for compensation have not been fulfilled, he said.“I believe the Taoiseach and the Department of Health have it within their remit to make that happen,” solicitor Caoimhe Haughey, who is representing some of the affected families, told RTÉ’s Six One News. “Spare these victims going to court.”Meanwhile, Ms Phelan said she was seeking an urgent meeting with Mr Varadkar this week. “I want the Taoiseach to step up and do something to protect these women. It is inhumane to watch.”Ms Phelan said settling the cases would be more expedient for the State, rather than paying huge legal fees."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Breaking red light the most common offence, accounting for 1,546 fixed-charge noticesPublic meeting hears criticism of judge who jailed Dr Bassam Naser for tax evasionPostgraduate journalism students received thousands of euro over several yearsLegal \u0026lsquoaggression\u0026rsquo by laboratories in recent weeks has caused surpriseOwner JP McMahon endured backlash for labelling race week as \u0026lsquorag week for adults\u0026rsquoGarda letter to families had suggested no inquest because trial had heard evidenceGovernment stands accused of breaking promise that no woman would have to face courtRemains were dismembered by chisel, with face, hands, teeth and organs still missingLuke Wilson from Ballyfermot admits plotting with others to kill Gary Hanley last yearFiachra \u0026Oacute Ceallaigh became the first Franciscan to serve as a bishop in Ireland for over 170 yearsGarda\u0026iacute have asked for help to locate 25-year-old Simon QuinnCalls for Red and Green Lines link between Red Cow in west Dublin and CarrickminesTricolour nailed to structure and wreaths scattered at memorial to infamous atrocityAdministration of Leader programme cost \u0026euro4.4m for first half of 2018, while just \u0026euro2.7m was paid outUK researchers say parents with depression more anxious about their children\u0026rsquos healthcareNo-deal Brexit would see \u0026ldquorestrictions importing medicines from UK, Varadkar saysChild in swimming pool at villa on Marbella\u0026rsquos Golden Mile when the fatality occurredDamages of up to \u0026euro360,000 claimed by six people in collisionCian O\u0026rsquoCarroll accuses Taoiseach of being \u0026lsquoirresponsible and of \u0026lsquomudding the issue\u0026rsquoBelmont Mill in Co Offaly offers a lot to craft workers and artists \u0026ndash but no real internet"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3581316.1532983248!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government to review handling of cervicalcheck cases","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPaul and Ruth Morrissey.

Photograph: Collins CourtsThe Government is expected to review the mediation process in dealing with some cases of women caught up in the CervicalCheck screening controversy after unexpected legal “aggression” from laboratories at the centre of the scandal.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar now says he should have been clearer when he promised in May that no women involved in the scandal would have to go to court.Sources said the attitude of the laboratories had caused surprise in recent weeks, and that a fresh approach may be needed in cases where the firms do not admit liability.It is understood that laboratories are seeking to fight cases where they do not believe there has been negligence on behalf of their staff in dealing with cervical screening. Increased legal aggression was evident in a “very small number of cases”, said a source.Mr Varadkar and Minister for Health Simon Harris have been under pressure over the commitments made in May that the State would take over the women’s cases, seek settlements by mediation and pursue the labs for damages so the women would not have to go to trial.In the High Court, Limerick woman Ruth Morrissey, who has cervical and breast cancer, and her husband Paul are suing two laboratories, Quest Diagnostics and Medlab Pathology, for her misreported smear tests in 2009 and 2012, and the HSE for failing to tell her about an audit revealing the incorrect tests for two years.Ms Morrissey (37), whose doctors have told her she has less than a year to live, was forced to take the witness stand for two days last week and deliver personal testimony about the pain she is suffering and about the impact of her terminal illness in relation to her seven-year-old daughter.Mr Varadkar said a complication had arisen “in this particular case as negligence has not yet been established in relation to the screening of the particular smear tests.“This comes back to an issue we have had since the very start, that all false negatives are not negligent. False negatives are part and parcel of screening and all of them are not negligence. Indeed, most of them are not negligent.”Mediation, it is argued by sources, should not be concluded until expert medical reports are available. Mr Varadkar said the Government wanted all cases settled by mediation, but sources said such mediation processes may have to be refined to ensure they do not concluded prematurely.Compensating for cases of false negatives, it is argued, would undermine the viability of screening programmes such as CervicalCheck.However solicitor Cian O’Carroll, who represents Vicky Phelan and Emma Mhic Mhathúna, among others, said the Taoiseach was being “irresponsible” and trying to “muddy the issue” by making this point.“Of course not all false positives are negligence.

So much of what we have been told by Essex Police has been hogwash.”Murder detectives quizzed two of Palmer\u0027s associates under caution, but have since admitted tens of thousands of people had reason to want him dead.John and Marnie Palmer in TenerifeMrs Palmer said: For the first time in his life, my husband had relaxed about all those threats against him. For years he had been so paranoid about assassination attempts. I was sleepless at times. But security had been scaled down dramatically at his homes over the last four years of life. His Rottweilers, always by his side, were all the security he needed.”In a new book, she chronicles Palmer\u0027s extraordinary rise from poverty, detailing how she saw some of the sparkling bars from Brink’s-Mat - then the hottest property in the world - arriving at her home, near Bath, to be melted down in Palmer’s homemade smelter.Marnie Palmer has criticised the police investigation into her husband\u0026#39s murderIn 1987, Palmer swaggered out of the Old Bailey after a shock not guilty jury verdict. Mrs Palmer still insist to anyone who asks that Palmer had no inkling it was loot from the so-called “crime of the century.By the 1990s, the couple were flying at will on Concorde, with private jets, helicopters and a yacht also at their disposal. The Sunday Times Rich List claimed he was worth £300m – making him richer than the Queen.However, police would eventually estimate that Palmer had duped at least 17,000 timeshare victims – mostly British pensioner. Investigators untangled a fraudulent network that stretched from dodgy Canary Islands resorts to numbered accounts in countless tax havens.John Palmer had a £300 million fortune including access to a private jetMrs Palmer says she still feels terrible for those that lost their hard-earned cash. but claimed the situation spiralled beyond even her husband\u0027s control.Palmer was convicted of fraud in 2001 and hit with one of the biggest bankruptcy orders in history.  His personal life became equally messy. He remained married to Marnie, but kept lovers in luxury for decades, and fathered children with the three of them.  When he was killed Palmer was living in Essex with his son James, and Christina Ketley, who played a key part in his shady business interests.John Palmer\u0026#39s hitman drilled a hole in his fence in order to stalk himPalmer\u0027s lone hitman was able to stalk him for hours on June 24, 2015, drilling a small hole made in the garden fence, before jumping over and firing six bullets from a .32 calibre silenced revolver.Marnie says rumours that Palmer had turned supergrass in a bid to escape another jail stint in Spain for fraud, firearm possession and money laundering were “nonsense”.But she adds: The scene of the murder was simply too convenient. John was found in the only spot where he had not installed CCTV. And where were his dogs? It was virtually unheard of for him to keep his Rottweilers inside.The police were watching his every move in the months before he died. They really should have known more about his activities, his associates and his potential enemies, yet officers are completely lost at sea.”John Palmer was acquitted of involvement in the Brink\u0026#39s Mat raidDespite his long-term affairs and violent outbursts, she says she is in little doubt that she remained his real love. He refused three attempts by Marnie to orce him. Her new book details one grim account of him putting a gun to her head and pulling the trigger. Fortunately the barrel was empty.\u0027What destroyed us was his drug-taking, womanising and violence.

Kim committed in a broad summit statement to work toward denuclearisation, but Pyongyang has offered no details as to how it might go about that and subsequent talks have not gone smoothly.It was not the first time US intelligence clashed with the president\u0027s optimism.In late June, US officials told US media outlets that intelligence agencies believed North Korea had increased production of fuel for nuclear weapons and that it did not intend to fully give up its nuclear arsenal.Hwasong-15 ICBM - new North Korean missileMike Pompeo, US Secretary of State, told the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week that North Korea was continuing to produce fuel for nuclear bombs despite its pledge to denuclearise. But he insisted the Trump administration was still making progress in its talks with Pyongyang.Joel Wit, a former State Department negotiator and founder of 38 North, a North Korea monitoring project, said it was unrealistic to expect North Korea to stop its programmes until the ink is dry on an agreement.That was the case with US negotiations with the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and more recently with Iran, which continued to build more centrifuges capable of producing nuclear material even as it negotiated with the United States to limit those capabilities, Wit said.New satellite images show a red truck in a courtyard similar to previous vehicles used to help develop long range missilesThe Sanumdong factory produced two Hwasong-15 ICBMs, North Korea’s longest-range missiles, but the US official noted that Pyongyang still had not tested a reliable re-entry vehicle capable of surviving a high-velocity trip through the Earth’s atmosphere and delivering a nuclear warhead.It is possible, the official said, that any new missiles the North is building may be for further testing of such vehicles and of more accurate guidance systems.“They seem to have figured out the engines, but not all the higher-tech stuff, and that might be what this is about,” the official said.“What’s more, a liquid-fuelled ICBM doesn’t pose nearly the threat that a solid-fuelled one would because they take so long to fuel, and that’s something we almost certainly could see in time to abort a launch, given our assets in the vicinity.”North Korean soldiers are seen at the border village of Panmunjom during a ceremony to commemorate the 65th Anniversary of the Korean War armistice agreement last weekThe reports come as generals from the rival Koreas met at their shared border for talks meant to ease a decades-long military standoff, Seoul officials said.During the April 27 summit, the leaders of the Koreas agreed to disarm a jointly controlled area at Panmunjom, work to prevent accidental clashes along their disputed western sea boundary and halt all hostile acts. Since then, the Koreas dismantled their frontline propaganda loudspeakers, restored a military hotline and held their first general-level talks since 2007.The meeting comes days after North Korea returned the reported remains of US war dead, the most recent sign of blossoming diplomacy after last year\u0027s threats of war.The general-level officers were discussing ways to implement April\u0027s inter-Korean summit agreements on non-nuclear military issues, but no huge announcement was expected from the talks at the border village of Panmunjom. Some experts say South Korea can\u0027t agree on any drastic measures to reduce animosity unless the North takes serious nuclear disarmament steps.Please review our commenting policySuspect arrested in Britain after police shootout with migrant van kills toddler in BelgiumSafety no issue at \u0026#39upbeat\u0026#39 funeral of Novichok victim Dawn SturgessSkomer puffin photographers are crushing birds to death in search for perfect shot, say wardensNHS to treat child gaming addicts as young as 12 isolated from friendsUK weather: Heatwave to return with highs of up to 33C as Britain faces north-south ideRussia investigation timeline: Robert Mueller and the probe into the Trump campaign\u0026#39s alleged collusionA simple guide to the customs union and its impact on BrexitCorrie McKeague no longer missing and \u0026#39is in waste disposal system\u0026#39, says fatherZimbabwe elections: Nelson Chamisa says he\u0026#39s \u0026#39winning\u0026#39 and Emmerson Mnangagwa \u0026#39positive\u0026#39 as vote count continuesComment: To save our democracy from fake news, we should ban political ads on social media Mount Fuji eruption fears prompt Japan to draw up disaster plansComment: Hypocrisy, not repression, causes Catholic sex abuse scandalsNational Trust for Scotland warns country\u0026#39s heritage is \u0026#39at point of no return\u0026#39Navy rescued Manchester bomber Salman Abedi from war-torn Libya three years before deadly terror attackLack of post-Brexit migration plan threatens to ide the UK, MPs warnDonald Trump says he is ready to meet with Iran \u0026#39whenever they want\u0026#39Gross negligence manslaughter sentences to be increased under new guidelines for judgesParents sending children to school unable to speak properly, says Education SecretaryOxfam charity sex scandal is \u0026#39tip of the iceberg\u0026#39, MPs warnWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/07/31/TELEMMGLPICT000170596979_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwWwNLrOnXfPdYNkDbyWiJsY.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"uk weather heatwave return highs 33c britain faces north south","story":"A jogger in fresher conditions in Billingham, County Durham, as temperatures in the north are set to sit in the mid-20s this weekThe UK is facing a northsouth split this week, with parts of the country bracing themselves for another scorching spell after a brief respite from the heatwave over the weekend.While sun worshippers will rejoice after heavy downpours over the weekend and on Tuesday morning, those facing commutes will probably wish they lived at the other end of the country as the heatwave returns with a vengeance.Weather forecasters have warned that the mercury is likely to hit 30C (86F) across the south of England by Friday, instead of being concentrated solely in the south east.The thermometer will carry on climbing over the weekend, reaching highs of 32C (89.6F)and possibly 33C (91.4F).While the south sizzles, northern parts of the UK will continue to see showers with temperatures sitting in the mid 20s.A Met Office spokesman said: In terms of the weekend just gone, they were the first two days this month where temperatures haven\u0027t reached 25C (77F) but we have got back to that point today, it hit 25.3C (77.5F) in Cavendish in Suffolk so it\u0027s already starting to warm up again.Over the next few days there will be something of a north and south split - high pressure is already starting to build up in the south, bringing dry, fine and weather.She warned: Southern England and Wales are going to turn quite hot by Friday - temperatures will probably reach 30C (86F) by that point.This is likely to include quite a wide area across the southern part of the UK - it will widely hit 30C (86F) across southern England and Wales, and the very hot weather will return as we approach the weekend.Video: Summer getaway hit by weather transport chaosThe north of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland can expect outbreaks of much-needed rain on Tuesday, Wednesday and in to Thursday.The spokeswoman said: It\u0027s a more varied picture across the north but it\u0027s an improving situation - sunshine with some showers and a similar story across the weekend.By Friday the temperatures could get into the mid 20s, so warming up, just not as hot as it is in the south.The weather broke on Friday, treating the parched landscape to a deluge of rain. It meant this July will be wetter than the blistering heatwave of July 1976.An average 49.9mm of rain fell across the UK from July 1 to July 29, according to provisional figures from the Met Office, and with further rain expected this week, the final total could be higher.The total for the whole of July 1976 was 43.3mm. The UK suffered a long heatwave during the summer of 1976, which helped make July 1976 the joint ninth driest on record.Currently, July this year is the 13th driest on record, the Met Office said.The driest ever July was in 1955, when an average of 30.6mm rainfall was measured across the UK. Comparable records for rainfall date back to 1910.Please review our commenting policySuspect arrested in Britain after police shootout with migrant van kills toddler in BelgiumSafety no issue at \u0026#39upbeat\u0026#39 funeral of Novichok victim Dawn SturgessSkomer puffin photographers are crushing birds to death in search for perfect shot, say wardensNHS to treat child gaming addicts as young as 12 isolated from friendsRussia investigation timeline: Robert Mueller and the probe into the Trump campaign\u0026#39s alleged collusionA simple guide to the customs union and its impact on BrexitCorrie McKeague no longer missing and \u0026#39is in waste disposal system\u0026#39, says fatherZimbabwe elections: Nelson Chamisa says he\u0026#39s \u0026#39winning\u0026#39 and Emmerson Mnangagwa \u0026#39positive\u0026#39 as vote count continuesNorth Korea renews work at long-range missile factory, US intelligence officials sayComment: To save our democracy from fake news, we should ban political ads on social media Mount Fuji eruption fears prompt Japan to draw up disaster plansNavy rescued Manchester bomber Salman Abedi from war-torn Libya three years before deadly terror attackComment: Hypocrisy, not repression, causes Catholic sex abuse scandalsNational Trust for Scotland warns country\u0026#39s heritage is \u0026#39at point of no return\u0026#39Lack of post-Brexit migration plan threatens to ide the UK, MPs warnDonald Trump says he is ready to meet with Iran \u0026#39whenever they want\u0026#39Parents sending children to school unable to speak properly, says Education SecretaryGross negligence manslaughter sentences to be increased under new guidelines for judgesOxfam charity sex scandal is \u0026#39tip of the iceberg\u0026#39, MPs warnWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/24/09/rtsdz5v.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1510  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/24/09/rtsdz5v.jpg","title":"deutsche bank brexit staff move jobs frankfurt london city euro clearing","story":"Created with Sketch.London has been regarded as a leader in the clearing market but European rivals now encroachingClick to followThe Independent OnlineBrexit: Deutsche Bank moves half of euro clearing business from London to FrankfurtDeutsche Bank has moved almost half of its euro clearing business from London to Frankfurt because of Brexit.

Or is he Ed Sheeran? Whatever the answer, it’s clear the public imagination is still holding out for a heroClick to followThe Independent OnlineMark Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathedHe was providing protection to Tom Cruise at the time. Summer of 2002, in Rome. Time off from shooting The Last Samurai. He had mapped it all out, talked it over with the paparazzi beforehand, so it was no sweat. They would pause for a minute or so in front of the Excelsior, the snappers would politely keep their distance, and then he and Cruise would sedately enter the hotel. Everyone would be happy. And the plan went completely to plan. They stopped. The paparazzi took their pictures. Box-office star plus bodyguard gracefully two-step in the direction of the hotel. No drama. Until the point where they’re about to go through the door.\u0026nbspMark “Billy” Billingham spots this blue streak coming towards them from the right out of the corner of his eye. Instinct honed by years of training, he simultaneously wraps a protective arm around Tom Cruise and grabs hold of the blue streak with the other one. And all three of them tumble into the foyer of the hotel, with Billingham wrestling both of them to the floor. Then Tom says, “Billy, you can let me up now. I want to introduce you to my girlfriend.” Penelope Cruz – Cruise’s then partner – was the blue streak.She was impatient to see Tom. Maybe she should just have warned his bodyguard before popping up unscripted.Another time he was escorting Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie down the backstairs of the Waldorf in New York. Everyone was waiting for them at the front. Billingham’s simple plan was to take them out the back down the service stairs. What could possibly go wrong? He was leading them from the front. Ready for anything. Then he tripped and fell down the stairs, knocking himself unconscious. Pitt and Jolie rushed down and held his head and nursed him till he came around. He was seeing stars in more ways than one.It probably wouldn’t happen in Mission: Impossible. In reality everything always goes wrong and you just have to adapt. Billingham has been an A-list bodyguard to Michael Caine and Russell Crowe and he hasn’t lost anyone yet. He says the main difference with\u0026nbspCrowe is that “you spend a lot of your time trying to stop him picking fights”. Now one of the stars of the rugged Channel 4 show SAS: Who Dares Wins, he is an ace sniper and served in the SAS for nearly two decades. Earned an MBE for leading a hostage-saving mission. Tracked down, acquired\u0026nbspand delivered mass killers to the War Crimes Tribunal. And is even now planning to take on human traffickers and slavers around the world. He has paid his dues. He is probably about as close as you can get to a real-life hero. One who is still breathing, that is.Billingham with Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and their children\u0026nbspin Chicago in 2007 (Rex)The “hero” is the ultimate myth, the “monomyth” as Joseph Campbell would say (in The Hero With A Thousand Faces), going all the way back to the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, through The Odyssey and The Aeneid, and all the way up to Mission: Impossible and Jack Reacher. The “hero” – whether engraved in stone or encoded in digitally enhanced celluloid – never dies. Real heroes always do, ultimately, but some live long enough to tell the tale. Here we run into the major dilemma for the hero: can he be the narrator of his own story? Can he speak in the first person of his own exploits in war? And is he necessarily a “he” anyway?T.E Lawrence (aka Lawrence of Arabia) pulled it off in his autobiographical Seven Pillars of Wisdom. So too, more recently Andy McNab, also ex-SAS, in Bravo Two Zero, and Tom Marcus in Soldier Spy. But there is a grand tradition of the unsung hero. A decent working definition of the hero is: someone who says nothing (or not much) and confines himself to pure doing. He acts and then keeps his mouth shut. A hero needs a Homer. This is only partly because, more often than not, there is a legal gag on telling tales. He is subject to the Official Secrets Act or the equivalent. But he is also constrained by the code of modesty. The hero, if he says anything, is always self-deprecating. Thus Mark Billingham’s funny, oblique, mock-heroic stories above.On the other hand Billy is very good at swearing. His daughter reckons he has a touch of Tourette’s. “I’ll try not to swear too much, I really will,” he tells the audience at Prince’s Hall in Aldershot for An Evening with Mark Billingham, “but I’ll probably f***ing fail.”Rambo (in David Morrell’s First Blood, immortalised by Sylvester Stallone) set fire to an entire town because he couldn’t find the words to express his post-Vietnam sense of guilt and horror. Thus the reality of the hero is that he has to say something. Self-repression leads straight into PTSD. Hero turns anti-hero. Billingham was inspired to join up by tales of veterans returning from the Falklands. Now 53, then a teenage rebel, troublemaker\u0026nbspand discontent. Brought up on a council estate in the Midlands, he became an artful dodger, going about stealing hats from old guys, until one old guy ran after him, caught him, and persuaded him to go to his gym and learn to box.\u0026nbspHe thought of joining the Marines, but ultimately signed up with the Parachute regiment because “they sounded wilder”. He’d never been out of Walsall and suddenly he found himself jumping out of planes in places he’d hadn’t even heard of. Billingham is above all a survivor. He says it’s “90 per cent luck and 10 per cent\u0026nbspskill – or maybe it’s 100 per cent\u0026nbspluck, I don’t know”. Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathed. “I can survive in bad places,” as he puts it. The most time he has spent in hospital has been with a dose of cerebral malaria.\u0026nbspThe true hero is vulnerable, mortal. Not a Marvel superhero. The army prizes the hard man. Maybe we all do. Which is why we sign up for SAS: Who Dares Wins or the adjacent “Break-Point Prime Evolution” regime, devised by Ollie Ollerton. We want the abs bordering on armour plating, like a shield or suit of armour. So the bullets will just bounce off. Unbreakable. That is the myth, at any rate. But Billingham tells a story of one of his comrades in Belize, a man who was famously “hard as nails”. The toughest guy in the whole regiment. He marches off into the jungle one day and not long after they hear him screaming. A group of men, led by Billingham, go trooping off after him, assuming he has been taken captive, and is almost certainly being tortured. They locate him quickly enough. No sign of the enemy. But the guy has a thorn in his ear and it’s killing him. Sometimes the worst thing about being a hero is you get dirty and sweaty and you can’t get a shower.25 new films to look out for in 2018 that aren\u0027t sequelsCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonBut the big news about SAS: Who Dares Wins is that the fourth series, now in preparation, will have women recruits as well as men. No reason why they can’t jump out of helicopters or rappel down a mountain. You don’t necessarily have to look like Bruce Willis or Arnie Schwarzenegger.\u0026nbsp“Hero” is now both masculine and feminine. You can’t plausibly say “heroine” any more. It sounds too much like a weepy sentimental movie or a damsel in distress.Women fight in the front line. The Kurdish Peshmerga (which translates as “those who face death”) includes a lot of women fighters. Asia Ramazan Antar was one of the fallen in the fight against Isis so too was Anna Campbell, from Lewes. On the more mythic side, we have Wonder Woman and X-(Wo)Men. This is the age of the rogue female.\u0026nbspI spoke recently to Ruth Shackleton: distant relative of the Antarctic explorer, she spent 20 years in the RAF, rose to squadron leader, did tours of duty in all the usual hellholes, and orchestrated the Red Arrows. She totally denies ever being a hero. She reckons her most heroic moment was when, with Scud rockets from Baghdad raining down, she helped a comrade (who had temporarily lost it) put on her chemical protection suit. Which demonstrates grace under pressure.Do heroes need to be less modest? The ancient myth of the hero was largely to do with defining and asserting masculinity. Aeneas dumps Dido. Theseus uses Ariadne and her thread to negotiate the labyrinth – where he slays the Minotaur – and then sails away. Ian Fleming’s James Bond follows the same pattern. The contemporary woman hero is fighting back, mainly against patriarchy. “This is the thing about bad guys,” says Stephanie Broadribb, author of Deep Down Dead (shortlisted for the International Thriller Writers’ Best First Novel award at ThrillerFest in New York, the winner of which is announced today). “They are generally guys.” She is a skilled horsewoman who trained as a bounty hunter to provide authenticity for her ass-kicking protagonist. And wields a mean taser. “I knew when I created Lori Anderson, a woman action hero, that she would never have to be rescued by a man.” She was influenced by Thelma and Louise, re-runs of The Saint, but above all by The Avengers (the TV series) in which Emma Peel is on a par with Steed when it comes to karate.There are other variations on the hero archetype, Carrie Gracie of the BBC for one, or the suffragettes or Stella Rimington, ex-head of MI5. I would propose Sofia Helin, who plays Saga Noren in The Bridge, but is also one of the extremely modest leaders of the Swedish #MeToo movement (“SilenceAction”). But it still comes down to being able to outfight, outwit, or outgeneral the opposition. And being prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. Billingham sees no reason why women can’t get into the SAS itself: “If you can pass the test, you’re in.”I was brought up on a diet of highly heroic post-Second World War comics, like Valiant and Victor (who could forget Captain Hurricane?) But at a certain point I decided the hero was uncool. Was he not, after all, a flag-waver for the military industrial complex? Verging on imperialist? Behind every Aeneas there is an Augustus or a Caesar. Winston Churchill is liable to be co-opted by every tub-thumping would-be dictator (as per Boris Johnson with his sub-Kipling rhetoric of “sending our vanguard into battle with the white flags fluttering”.) The hero, like Napoleon, can become a tyrant. And yet the hero deserves resurrection.Why Now That’s What I Call Music still has a place in pop culture‘Spiderman’ who scaled flats to save child begins job as firefighterHumiliation: The pain of character assassination in the public eyeAt one level, maybe nobody is a hero (who can coincide with a myth?). At another, maybe everyone is, or would like to be (sometimes just getting out of bed in the morning is an act of heroism). Perhaps Gareth Southgate and the England football team all are. Anyone on a quest or a mission. Most of my personal heroes are surfers (take a bow, Ted Deerhurst). We haven’t yet given up on knight errants, Shane-style lonesome cowboys, and Liam Neeson. Lee Child, creator of the globally bestselling Jack Reacher series, says of vigilante loner heroes – who, like the ronin, are wandering samurai that have no lord or master and don’t belong to any conventional force – that “we invented them tens of thousands of years ago because we desperately wanted them to exist.\u0026nbspWe continue to reinvent them in flimsily disguised forms because we need them to be there, as a matter of catharsis and consolation.”Paul Hughes reckons we need them more than ever. He is a multilingual ex-RAF intelligence officer turned forensic scientist (and CEO of PH Interim) who goes about the country inspiring young people in schools with his non-fictional tales of bravery – not least in dealing with challenges they might face at school. Hughes says that “if you ask anyone who their hero is these days, they are more likely to answer Ed Sheeran or one of those characters from Love Island”. He argues that we are apt to think, just because we are sitting on a sofa and watching television, that the world is a safe place. It isn’t. “Today’s teenagers were born after 911. They haven’t seen Srebrenica or the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. People forget so quickly – they need to be reminded.”I’ve often said (mostly to others, sometimes to myself), “Don’t be a hero!” Which is fair enough, mostly. Avoid pointless heroics, if possible. Jaw-jaw not war-war. But the hero, of whichever gender, Billingham or Bond, Thelma or Louise, remains rooted in the collective unconscious. Maybe it’s just as well. So long as we have enemies, we will still need heroes.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’\u0026nbspand teaches at the University of Cambridge.

She remembers wavering on the brink of death and telling God that she had to rejoin the living.A 21-year-old law student at the time, working at a women’s centre in West Berlin, she was nowhere near finished with the world.“\u0027I want to go back,’ I told God,” Ates, now a 55-year-old lawyer and women’s rights activist who is also studying to become an imam, recalled of that afternoon. “I still have a mission.”More than three decades later, that mission came to fruition a year ago when she stood before a congregation of Muslim men and women kneeling side by side as they recited prayers in the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque – the first Muslim house of worship in Germany where women, many with dark ponytails and long curls uncovered, are recognised as imams.Any Muslim is welcome to join: men or women, Sunni or Shia, transgender, gay or straight.“We want to send a signal to political Islam,” Ates, wearing a long, white tunic trimmed with gold, told a packed room on the opening day, when journalists outnumbered worshippers.“We want to show that another Islam exists, that has nothing to do with terrorism.”Over the past year, that something has grown into a congregation of 35 core members – many of them women. They help Ates organise weekly prayers, give tours to school groups and hold seminars on democracy, love and the concept of an open, tolerant interpretation of Islam and a forgiving God.Religious groups join together for interfaith collaborationHere\u0027s a reminder of what Donald Trump said about Muslims in the past When is Eid al-Fitr and how do Muslim people celebrate it?During Eid, it\u0027s important to reflect on Islam in BritainThree years after a wave of more than 1 million, mostly Muslim, migrants arrived in Germany seeking asylum, culture wars over religious identity and the possible threat posed by Islam have led to a rise in nationalist, populist movements.The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was nearly brought down this week over a dispute with the Bavarian sister of her conservative party, which sought to turn back refugees at the border.The Bavarian conservatives of the Christian Social Union joined the far-right party Alternative for Germany in promoting a narrative that refugees pose a threat, after several highly publicised killings and sexual assaults in the country led to charges against Muslim migrants.The party ordered that crosses be displayed in all public buildings in the state, and Merkel’s new interior minister, Horst Seehofer – also a Bavarian – declared: “Islam is not a part of Germany.”Against the backdrop of these debates, Ates sees the survival of the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, as proof that Muslims living in Germany need and are open to an interpretation of Islam that reflects the values of the Western society in which they live.Tombs in the centre of Tarung village serve as handy laundry driers on a sunny Sumba morning.Each tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) represents massive expense in terms of ritual sacrifices for local families who observe the ancestral Marapu religionCatholic imagery on a tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) shows how imported religions seem often to have blended almost seamlessly with the ancient Marapu religion.In an effort to minimise economic strain the law stipulates that only 5 buffalo can be sacrificed at funerals - in reality many more are often killed and a big buffalo with a wide horn spread will often fetch close to $4,000.A royal tomb in Pasunga village is flanked by the smaller tombs where servants were buried (sometimes buried alive!) alongside their master.Village dogs - currently s but, more than likely, part of some future feast - on tombs in Pasunga village.A horse - another part of Sumba\u0027s ancestral warrior heritage - grazes among the tombs in Pasunga village.A more humble modern style tomb stands next to the kings burial place in Galu Bakul, Anakalang.A village dog relaxes on a tomb in Prai Ijing village.While still considered sacred the tombs very quickly become part of normal village life.

The Arabs will never allow it,\u0027” she said. Instead, hundreds of people from across Germany, Europe and abroad have visited or attended services.Those most committed to its survival have made donations, some as much as €500, Ates said, emphasising that the mosque receives no public funding.“Even atheists come here and appreciate this place, as a spiritual place, a place of peace,” she said recently, standing barefoot on the pale carpet of the mosque. “I had hoped, but never dreamed, that so many atheists would be interested. That was a positive surprise.”The criticism and rejection, in its fierceness and intensity, less so. Even before the mosque opened, her personal Facebook page and that of the mosque were flooded with derogatory messages and even some death threats.“May Allah put you on the right path, or destroy you,” someone writing under the name Xalo Bero said, in one of the friendlier remarks.Protection provided by the police and paid for by the city government, in place since she published the book Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution\u0026nbspin 2009, was increased to a personal security detail after the heightened threats on her life.Days after the mosque opened, Dar al-Ifta, an influential arm of the Egyptian Justice Ministry that issues religious verdicts, denounced the mosque and declared that allowing men and women to pray alongside one another violated Islamic law.Turkish news outlets reported that the mosque was a terrorist organisation with links to the Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for a coup attempt in 2016 against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Despite a video message in which Ates states that the “the Rushd-Goethe mosque has nothing to do with the Gulen movement”, the rumours have persisted.She blames them for the fact that few Turks have joined the congregants, although they make up the vast majority of the estimated 4.5 million Muslims living in Germany.Despite the demands of running the mosque, she takes Arabic classes and continues to work as a lawyer. She considers achieving a degree in Islamic theology important to her recognition in the Muslim community.“I want to understand the words and know the meanings so no one can say, ‘She’s just a lawyer,\u0027” she said.Born in Istanbul to a Turkish mother and a Kurdish father, she emigrated with her parents to what was then West Berlin in the late 1960s, part of the first large wave of Muslim immigrants who came to fill the blue-collar jobs needed to rebuild the German economy after World War II.Ates was 6 when she and her four siblings moved into a one-room apartment with their parents.As she learned German and excelled in school, Ates says, she came to understand that it was not the crowded living conditions that she found suffocating, but the realisation that because of her gender, she was not afforded the freedoms of her non-Muslim peers.“I was a girl,” she wrote in 2007 in Zeit Online. “I embodied the family’s honour, and my hymen – for a long time I didn’t even know what that was – was more important to the whole family than my brain.”At 17, she fled her home, graduated from high school and started studying law at the Free University of Berlin. To support herself, she worked as a counsellor in a women’s centre.In September 1984, she was speaking with a client when a man wearing a trench coat entered the centre, pulled out a pistol and fired three shots. One hit the client in the stomach, killing her the other struck Ates.She survived to see the suspect, a Turkish bricklayer, acquitted for lack of evidence, which enraged her. For years, she struggled with the psychological fallout of the attack.Violent clashes leave ’86 dead’ in NigeriaFrench far-right group arrested over alleged plot to attack MuslimsShe returned to her faith, but was again alienated by Berlin’s traditional, conservative mosques, where women were forced to pray behind a curtain. She decided that if the faith community that she needed did not exist, she would create it.It took years of planning, fundraising and looking for a suitable space. While she received support from like-minded liberal Muslims from Switzerland to the US, the critics have remained.What keeps her going is the encouragement, not only from social media postings, but also from the visitors who go out of their way to find a place of worship that previously existed only in their dreams.​Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2014/04/11/16/world-in-pic-5.jpg","title":"theme parks children office slides rollercoaster pub adrenaline fun","story":"Created with Sketch.When most of us spend the majority of our weeks working, worrying about finances, trying to stay on top of life admin and suffering from increasingly poor mental health,\u0026nbspthere is nothing more precious than a place intended simply for funClick to followThe Independent OnlineRollercoasters invoke \u0027eustress\u0027, a kind of stress that is not bad for you – rather it is pleasurable and many of us actively seek it outThat moment at the top of a rollercoaster – after the slow upwards build, when you’re high above the treeline, dangling, stomach clenched, looking down – is hard to compare to anything else.

I can’t understand how some people hate rollercoasters\u0026nbsp– they are one of my favourite things in the entire world.Theme parks around the worldMeet famous characters and get your autograph book signedLego statues of all sizes - from miniland to life size modelsFerrari Land in Port Aventura, Spain, is famous for its fast rollercoastersOakwood is the only theme park in Wales and is home to Megafobia, voted the best ride in the UK and third best ride in the world by the Roller Coaster Club of Great Britain.

You can bet that any resort you visit will be filled with varied and never ending things to discover.Whether it’s the thrill-inducing rides, the milder water rides, the inventive “worlds” or the over-priced but delicious doughnut and ice-cream combos that draw you in, it’s hard to deny that theme parks offer something for everyone. They are often marketed as family attractions, something for the kids, but they are places that can captivate and entertain at any age.I don’t feel like I enjoy theme parks any less now that I’m an (admittedly childish) adult – if anything, I enjoy them more. My mood is not as volatile (kids have the tendency to be excited one moment and in a strop the next), I don’t tire at the end of the day and I can appreciate things I didn’t as a kid – the engineering that’s gone into creating a place (not that I know anything about engineering), the small details, the truly fine art and craftsmanship.And as far as I’m concerned theme parks are a work of art. As Bill Watterson, creator of the cartoon strip Calvin and Hobbes, believed, I couldn’t agree more that there is no such thing as high art and low art – rather creations that either speak to people or don’t. And what could speak to people more than a place created for the sole purpose of having fun?Kingda\u0026nbspKa, New Jersey, is the world’s tallest rollercoaster at 456ft – higher than Big BenAfter all, when most of us spend the majority of our weeks working, worrying about finances, trying to stay on top of life admin and suffering from increasingly poor mental health, there is nothing more precious than escapism. Our cities, towns and villages revolve around practicality – offices for working in, shops for buying things, gyms for exercising. Most of what surrounds us is mundane – it’s pretty wonderful in this context that we have places created for the sole purpose of having fun.But while some of the elements of enjoyment are\u0026nbspeasy to recognise as such – good food, fun family rides and the opportunity to take a picture with a lifesize Donald Duck – what is it that is so enticing about rollercoasters? By definition they should evoke sheer terror, yet we absolutely adore them\u0026nbspand queue for hours on end for the two-minute scare they provide.Richard Stephens, a senior lecturer in psychology at Keele University, argues that rollercoasters invoke a good kind of stress, called “eustress” – a word that has the same route as “euphoria”. This kind of stress is not bad for you – rather it is pleasurable and many of us actively seek it out.Eustress can also explain why we like being scared in other contexts, such as on ghost trains or in live action horror mazes. It makes sense that we must all have different ways of seeking this kind of good stress – which is why some people love rollercoasters and some people can’t stand them. I’m a big fan of rollercoasters but the thought of scuba ing absolutely terrifies me. But for others I imagine this is a “eustressful” experience.For the ultimate thrillseeker, the fastest rollercoaster in the world is currently the Formula Rossa at Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi, which reaches an eye-watering 150mph. The second fastest, Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey, is also the world’s tallest,\u0026nbspat 456ft. To put that into some perspective, Big Ben in London stands shorter at 320ft.But Kingda Ka will not hold its title for long, as a new coaster, Skyscraper, is set to open in Florida in 2020 and will reach 500ft, plus have the steepest drop of any rollercoaster in the world.And lastly the longest rollercoaster, the Steel Dragon 2000, at Nagashima Spa Land in Japan is a whopping 8,133ft. It is the only existing rollercoaster to break the 8,000ft threshold, and it lasts for a whole four minutes.With rides becoming increasingly complex and impressive, it’s fascinating to see where things all started. The first commercial rollercoaster in the world, Switchback Railway, opened in 1884 in Coney Island, New York. It kickstarted the growth of attractions in the US, and before long Coney Island housed a few similar rides. The oldest acknowledged theme park was also located in the US:\u0026nbspSanta Claus Land opened in Indiana in 1935, and included many rides themed around the big\u0026nbspman in red.If you’d like a taste of an ancient theme park,\u0026nbspthe oldest\u0026nbspstill in operation can be found in Klampenborg, Denmark. Bakken opened in 1583 and has more than 150 attractions, including a wooden rollercoaster built in 1932. Denmark is also the home of Lego, and the original Legoland Park – so a heaven for theme park fans.In the UK we’ve also been breathing life into old theme parks, such as\u0026nbspDreamland\u0026nbspin Margate. First opened in 1880 and popular all the way through to the\u0026nbsp1990s, it was closed in 2003 and set to become a residential area. But after local residents campaigned to restore and open Dreamland instead, it was brought back and soon had a £25m\u0026nbsprevamp.It now has a concert venue, seaside pub and rooftop rum shack, and new rides are being introduced to sit alongside the restored vintage ones. According to its Wikipedia page, it’s intended to be a “working museum of vintage funfair rides”. And it’s changing the fortunes of the surrounding small seaside town in Kent.Another intriguing destination is an unexpected one. Nestled deep in the Italian woods, Ai Pioppi boasts a colourful range of rides – none of which are powered by electricity. Instead, riders push, pedal and swing – but we’re not talking playground-style attractions here\u0026nbspwe’re talking full-on Ferris wheels and rollercoasters. But perhaps even more impressive than the park’s eco-credentials is its founder, Bruno Ferrin, who has been building the park himself since the late 1960s. He started by adding a few slides to accompany his restaurant – and it grew from there.Around the world there are a whole host of niche theme parks – those interested can visit Hello Kitty’s castle in Japan, unearth mud at Diggerland\u0026nbspin various locations across the UK and US and view a host of farting and vomiting statues\u0026nbspat BonBon-Land in Zealand, Denmark.Of course, obscurities aside, you’re still guaranteed to have fun at your local attraction. And increasingly we’re seeing theme park culture enter\u0026nbspour day-to-day – less traditional workplaces are starting to install slides and ball pits and Penn State station in New York is considering adding a rollercoaster alongside it’s shops and subway platforms.It would do us all some good to get out the office and have some fun for the sake of fun –\u0026nbspor even better\u0026nbspwe could incorporate theme park rides and attractions into our daily lives.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano transferred from Corinthians, but the Brazilian club had not actually owned them. A consortium of mysterious companies held the economic rights to the players, causing complications with contracts that eventually resulted in West Ham being fined a record £5.5 million.The saga resulted in the Premier League abolishing third-party ownership of players in 2008.\u0026nbspBut that same year, a paper was published describing a revolutionary technology that held the potential to transform the way assets are owned, traded and sold. It was called the blockchain.A decade after Satoshi Nakamoto’s paper was published, thousands of applications have already been built using blockchain technology, including the first and most famous cryptocurrency: bitcoin. The decentralised online ledger Nakamoto described allows assets, such as a digital currency, to be ided into digital tokens and traded through a smart contract system that is both transparent and permanent.Famous footballers have already been jumping on the blockchain bandwagon. Earlier this year Michael Owen launched his own cryptocurrency and Lionel Messi recently endorsed a blockchain smartphone. But what if players were actually on the blockchain itself? This is the idea of some payments experts, who believe the technology could one day transform the football transfer market.“The ledger entry for a single player could be ided into multiple shares, each capable of being sold inidually to create a fractional ownership scheme,” Lu Zurawski, practice lead for retail banking at payments systems firm ACI Worldwide, told\u0026nbspThe Independent. “Depending on the type of ledger technology used, these shares would be tradable and could be bought and sold via exchanges – teal folding money being used in exchange for player tokens.”Tevez and Javier Mascherano signed for West Ham under shady circumstances in 2006. (Reuters)So while the rights for a player would remain with the club they play for, the creation of a secure, verifiable and immutable record of ownership in the form of a blockchain-based ledger would allow fans or investors to own a stake of the players. It would also facilitate greater trust and transparency for players, agents, clubs and authorities.“Given the murky reputation of football dealings at all levels of the game, such a system might be a great way of cleaning up tax evasion, money laundering and, potentially, modern day slavery,” Mr Zurawski explained, adding that the Premier League or football governing bodies like UEFA or FIFA would need to be onboard with such schemes before they achieve ubiquity.

Premier League rules now state that third parties – essentially anyone or anything that isn’t a recognised football club – can trade players. Fifa, football’s world governing body, also banned the practice in 2015, though there are reasons to suggest that there are ways round bothFormer England football manager Sam Allardyce was notoriously sacked by the Football Association after he was secretly filmed by reporters claiming that there were ways\u0026nbspto “get around” the rules surrounding third-party ownership.So before any kind of tokenisation of players occurs, rules would need to be changed. Unlike the Tevez and Mascherano saga, however, tokenising footballers would make any issues surrounding the ownership of a player entirely transparent. Tokenisation is already being adopted in other sectors, including the art world. Last month, a multi-million pound work of art by Andy Warhol was auctioned as digital certificates, allowing investors to own a fraction of the iconic Fourteen Small Electric Chairs piece.The platform behind the sale said the first-of-its-kind auction was “democratising access to fine art,” as now “anyone can own a Warhol.” 1960s Death and Disaster Series (Maecenas)One of the most obvious areas that tokenisation could prove majorly beneficial is property. Property is one of the best investments currently available, but for many, especially large number of millennials looking to get themselves on the property ladder, it is unaffordable.Through tokenisation buyers will have the option to work with investors rather than banks, where the funds can be made more accessible and the approval periods can be much quicker and streamlined. Through tokenisation investors will also be able to ersify their capital by investing in portfolios not inidual properties which will spread the risk and allow for a wider variety of assets.One platform that is already allowing this is HiP, which puts properties on its platform and allows buyers to finance them through investors.Kai Peeters, founder and CEO of HiP Property, told\u0026nbspThe Independent: “Fractionalisation by tokenisation or other means will be particularly beneficial for the property market as it will enable unlocking currently tied up property wealth that owners are sitting on without selling their property or buying into equity release, refinance or bridge loaning products.“All of these things penalise the buyers unfairly by contracting them into increased interest payments or even compound interest loans in case of equity release.” Possibilities beyond football players, art and property are nearly endless. Almost any asset that holds any amount of value could be placed on the blockchain. Ross Peet, a managing partner at the London-based ideas agency Yes\u0026ampPepper says the technology could eliminate vast swathes of bureaucracy by cutting out the need for brokers and other middlemen - while also making transactions quicker, cheaper and more transparent.“The days of trading assets through complex paperwork and red tape could well be numbered as the world is gearing up to embrace blockchain.

Many of their friends and relatives have flown in especially from countries around the world.But after the Home Office missed the deadline for notifying them of the outcome of their visa application, they face the choice of either both being absent for their wedding - or doing it via a live video link.The couple, both 27, had planned to settle in the UK permanently but said\u0026nbspthey might have to abandon the idea and return to the US for good.The groom, who has dual US-UK citizenship\u0026nbspand the bride, who is American, were married in America\u0026nbspin November.\u0026nbspHowever, the couple also\u0026nbspwanted a wedding ceremony in Britain, where Mr Biancardi’s wealthy parents are from.They applied in February for a spouse’s visa for Mrs Biancardi, and were optimistic of getting one.Biancardi)She is a lawyer and he is a professor,\u0026nbspGiven their incomes, they said there was no chance she would have been claiming benefits.\u0026nbsp“We wanted to get married as soon as possible because we’re very much in love, and also because my grandfather is 88 and I wanted to be near him,” Mr Biancardi\u0026nbsptold The Independent.They started planning their UK ceremony, at Loseley Park, a Tudor manor house near Guildford, shortly\u0026nbspafter they married in California.The Home Office promises to process applications within 12 weeks – but when they did not receive a response by the May deadline they started phoning and emailing.“We got very little response. Often we were directed to what sounded like a call centre where they couldn’t give specific advice,\u0026nbspMr\u0026nbspBiancardi\u0026nbspsaid.\u0026nbspThey were useless – they kept saying there was no decision. Even as late as 3 July they said no decision had been made.”Despite the intervention of Mr Biancardi’s parents’ MP, Anne Milton, they were again told\u0026nbsptwo weeks ago that the case was still under consideration.UK news in picturesForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt followed in the footsteps of his gaffe-prone predecessor Boris Johnson as he mistakenly referred to his Chinese wife as Japanese whilst on his first diplomatic mission to ChinaBritain\u0027s Geraint Thomas, left, wearing the overall leader\u0027s yellow jersey and Britain\u0027s Luke Rowe hold the flag of Wales during the 21st and last stage of the 105th edition of the Tour de France cycling race between Houilles and Paris Champs-Elysees.

The border guards kept saying ‘how do we know you’re not lying?’“They then said the visa had been denied in May, which we didn’t know. It seemed there was nothing I could say to convince them even though we had a letter from my father-in-law confirming we wouldn’t be claiming welfare.”Mr\u0026nbspBiancardi, an adjunct professor of political science in California, added: The\u0026nbspBorder Force\u0026nbspofficers said they had concerns and made us wait 45 minutes. They then put my wife through a torturous process, taking her into an office on her own, while I had to wait outside for two hours.”His mother had put in an “insane” amount of work into the wedding preparations, including a cake, £11,000 of catering, a photographer and booking the venue, amounting to £20,000, he said.\u0026nbspThe family would not have spent that had the Home Office informed them of the visa refusal decision, he\u0026nbspadded.\u0026nbspThe 90 guests include 15 friends who have flown over from California for the event.US-trained Mrs Biancardi has already sat a law conversion exam, allowing her to practise in Britain\u0026nbspand her husband is due to begin a master’s degree in sociology at Bristol in September. Now they believe their plans might have to be overturned.“We’re desperate to have the wedding but my biggest priority is not to disappoint my family so I’m thinking of still going there for it, she said.\u0026nbsp“We’ve been feeling incredibly depressed.\u0026nbspHer fiance added\u0026nbspthat if there\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspstill no way of her\u0026nbspentering Britain before Sunday’s ceremony, one option is for his father to hold up an iPad with a Skype link on it to France while the groom walks down the aisle.“When we found out the spouse’s visa had been rejected it only left a few days to apply for a visitor’s visa but what are the chances of getting that in time? We feel this has been very unjust,” he said.The Independent has asked the Home Office for a comment but it had not replied at the time of publication.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/16/13/Scot-Mann-MP-1.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6406121  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/16/13/Scot-Mann-MP-1.jpg","title":"brexit referendum final say petition vote eu remain leave theresa may","story":"Created with Sketch.Politicians backing campaign say British people deserve right to have say on final terms of dealClick to followIndy PoliticsFinal Say: More than 390,000 people back The Independent\u0027s campaign for a vote on government\u0027s Brexit dealHave you backed our campaign? Click here to sign the petition.\u0026nbspMore than 390,000 have now signed The Independent’s petition demanding a Final Say referendum on the government’s Brexit deal.\u0026nbspThe campaign, which was launched last week, has attracted support from Leavers and Remainers.The odds on a second national vote have halved since the beginning of the year, bookies have revealed.The misinformation that was told about BrexitPM\u0027s charm offensive dismissed as prospect of no deal intensifiesSenior ex-diplomat backs campaign for Final Say on Brexit dealThose backing another referendum include senior figures from all the major parties, including former Tory cabinet minister Justine Greening, ex-prime minister Tony Blair, Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable, and Green Party leader Caroline Lucas.More than two thirds of students would also back a vote on the final Brexit deal, according to a new poll.It comes as Theresa May’s efforts to bypass Brussels and deal directly with European Union nations have been rebuffed, appearing to push Britain further towards a no-deal scenario.\u0026nbspThe prime minister was also warned on Friday that the European Parliament would veto her Chequers deal unless she comes up with a new plan for the Irish border.Adding fuel to the fire was international trade secretary Liam Fox’s assertion on Friday that a no-deal Brexit would be better than prolonging talks with Brussels, a move he described as a “complete betrayal” of voters.\u0026nbspTotnes\u0027 will start the reformation of Brexit BritainThe Independent kicked off its campaign for a Final Say on whatever Brexit terms emerge, along with a petition, earlier this week.Ex-cabinet minister Ms Greening said: “I believe that putting the final decision on Brexit in the hands of the British people is the only way to break parliament’s impasse, and the right way to decide our country’s future.“That’s why The Independent’s campaign is so vital and has my support – anyone who feels the same should back it.”Sir Vince said: “The Liberal Democrats have been fighting for the British people to have the final say on any Brexit deal, or worse still, no deal. This vote must include an option for an exit from Brexit.Vote Leave chief leaks \u0027fake news\u0027 report on misuse of dataOdds on second referendum and no-deal Brexit tumbleThis is what day one of a no-deal Brexit could look like“I congratulate The Independent for joining this campaign. It’s both a brave and correct move.”Labour MP David Lammy, who has called for a second referendum since 2016, said: “The Independent’s new push for a referendum on the final Brexit deal sits, with other similar campaigns, on the right side of history.“Allowing the public to choose whether we remain in the EU – or indeed choose, in full knowledge, to become poorer, less sovereign and diplomatically neutered – is the only democratic solution to this political nightmare.”Former Conservative attorney general Dominic Grieve, Labour’s Chuka Umunna, Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, campaigner Gina Miller and ex-Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell have also backed the campaign.Theresa May has urged voters not to worry about Brexit, despite her government setting out plans to stockpile food, blood and medicine in case it goes badly.She said people should take “reassurance and comfort” from news of the plans, to be implemented if the UK crashes out of the EU without an agreement in March.But as a no-deal Brexit began to look more likely, Mr Blair took to Twitter to give his support to the campaign.He said: “33m+ people voted in the EU referendum wanting a better country, not to be poorer, not to put further pressure on our already stretched health service, not for job losses or to stockpile food and medicines. It should be your #Finalsay.”Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Have you backed our campaign? Click here to sign our petition.Regardless of how you voted in the Brexit referendum, you deserve a say on the final deal.That’s why we’re launching the Final Say campaign, to win for the British people the right to make that all-important decision on the Brexit deal. Come what may in the months ahead, we maintain our commitment to our readers to retain balance and present many different points of view. But on this subject we believe a referendum on the final deal is right.We believe there are three reasons:1. The people, on both sides of the debate, are losing faith with the current process. From Theresa May to parliament as a whole, a chaotic approach has delivered infighting, resignations and party politics, but little progress on the key issues that people care about.2. The people on both sides should have the chance to finish what they started. With reality coming into focus, it’s only natural to check this future is what people really want. After years of negotiations behind closed doors, the people must not be shut out of the final decision.3. The people – on both sides – know so much more now than we did in 2016.

None of this is easy to doClick to followThe Independent OnlineFrom cricketing legend to prime minister of Pakistan, the rise of Imran KhanAfter more than two decades of political campaigning, much of it spent in the political wilderness, Imran Khan will finally become Prime Minister of Pakistan. Along the way, as his ex-wife Jemima Khan\u0026nbspnoted on Twitter, he endured “humiliations, hurdles and sacrifices”. Now, the former cricket legend and philanthropist could become one of the most powerful civilian leaders the country has known.Older readers will of course be familiar with him. After playing cricket for Oxford while he studied politics, philosophy and economics at Keble College, Khan became one of the best known Pakistanis in Britain. He figured prominently in tabloids for his social life, was often spotted at exclusive private members clubs like Annabel’s and Tramp.\u0026nbspHe\u0026nbspbefriended Mick Jagger, Sting and Goldie Hawn while being on nodding terms with Prince Charles and other royals. He married Jemima Goldsmith, the journalist and filmmaker sister of Zac, and invited Princess Diana to Pakistan.For Pakistanis, Khan was one of the few people who did them proud. Winning the Cricket World Cup in 1992 was a rare moment when Pakistan distinguished itself internationally. Pakistanis had grown weary of being principally depicted as a Third World basket case beset by social problems where women, minorities and the poor were treated appallingly. At times when boorish and condescending English cricketers like Ian Botham described Pakistan as “a place to send your mother-in-law”, Khan confronted that racism publicly.Pakistanis craved a confident, good-looking spokesman and the former cricketer could play the part. It’s one of the reasons why many voted for him.“I believe Oxford educated Imran Khan can stand toe to toe with world leaders and make a strong case for Pakistan,” wrote Haroon, a Pakistani singer and one of many celebrities, including cricketers, singers and actors who backed him.\u0026nbspBut he was also supported by a bewildering array of people from religious conservative backgrounds, wealthy businessmen, grafters from the middle classes, taxi drivers and factory workers.Khan is many things to many people. Central to his appeal is that he has not been in power before. It was common to hear his supporters say: “We’ve tried the others”,\u0026nbspreferring to the parties of former prime ministers Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, “let’s try him this time”.\u0026nbspFor people alarmed at endemic levels of corruption, Khan represents a rare, honest and financially “clean” leader valiantly battling against an entrenched venal order. For religious conservatives and nationalists, he soothes feelings of injured pride and rouses their spirits.There are people whose support he should be embarrassed by. Sara Taseer, a Singapore-based entrepreneur, declared herself appalled by the sight of poor Baluch women lining up to vote. “Love seeing this turnout of women,” she tweeted, “but then I think would I allow these ladies to make a decision even about what be cooking in my kitchen today? And these ladies will decide on the future of the nation. Scary thought.”And there are supporters he should stay clear of. Asad Umar, Khan’s finance minister to be, posted photos of himself courting the support of Fazlur Rehman Khalil, someone whose name is on a US\u0026nbspterror watchlist.Khan’s rhetoric is often studded with references to the plight of the poor and the ravages of the elite. “A country shouldn’t be measured by how its wealthiest live,” he said in his first speech after the election, “but by how its poorest people are treated.” Critics say that message is at odds with the composition of his party, which is dominated by some of the wealthiest people in Pakistani politics. Many of Khan’s candidates this time around were also drawn from conventional old parties or military regimes, undermining the claim that their election will herald a “new Pakistan”.There are contradictions people notice in Khan\u0027s own pronouncements. When I interviewed him for The Independent, he came across as thoughtful, polite, serious and even good-humoured. On the campaign trail, however, he was seen as boastful and arrogant – making crude jibes against his opponents, taunting voters who support his rivals as “donkeys”, and denouncing liberals as “bloodthirsty”. He has forcefully denounced terrorism, and yet has been accused of being soft on the Taliban. Khan was a critic of Pakistan’s blasphemy laws and has defended religious minorities, but more recently vowed to protect the laws and accused his opponents of being part of a foreign plot to undermine it.When I first came to Pakistan to report for The Independent, Khan was a fierce critic of General Pervez Musharraf’s military rule. I saw him on the streets supporting an independent judiciary, interviewed him the night before he was arrested for defying emergency rule, heard him speak out against attacks on the press, enforced disappearances, civilian casualties in military offensives, and covered his protests against CIA drone strikes. Those experiences do not easily reconcile with the image of him as a mere shill for the Pakistan army.As prime minister, Khan will want to be the most powerful leader in the country. That distinction has usually belonged to the head of the army, which has ruled the country directly for three decades and wielded its clout backstage for the rest. It will be interesting to see how he negotiates these structural tensions. Some of the areas of dispute between Khan and the army have faded: drone strikes are rare, military operations he opposed are a thing of the past, and the US-led, Pakistan-backed “war on terror” is all but over.So, how will Khan rule? As a crusader against corruption and champion of the poor, or as an angry demagogue? Will he strengthen Pakistan’s feeble civilian institutions or disappear into the shadows of the military? Can he unite all the different Pakistanis he appealed to this afternoon, or will he seek to deepen the dangerous political isions that this election has revealed? Will Pakistan pursue peace with its neighbours, or will old modes of chest-beating belligerence endure?Only time will tell. The speech he made this afternoon pleasantly surprised many: he vowed to lift the country out of poverty to combat corruption – starting by hold himself and his own cabinet accountable he said he would educate the more than 25 million children out of school and he said he would protect the rights of minorities and women. None of this is easy to do. There are strong reasons to believe Khan won’t be able to. But it would be good to see him try.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Things are said.” While one Cabinet minister remarks: “It is not a great surprise. He’s been saying no all along.”This minister’s view is that it is now “up to the member states” what happens next.But they aren’t likely to come to the rescue of May’s customs plan. I understand just a handful of them are interested in it.Most of them don’t want to let the UK collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf or to have to collect tariffs for the UK ­themselves. The sheer bureaucratic complexity of the scheme doesn’t make it appealing.So, what happens next? Well, as May has told the Brexit Inner Cabinet, Barnier’s real aim is to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU.His calculation is that faced with a choice between a customs union and no deal, Britain will buckle.The attraction to the EU of keeping the UK in a customs union is that it will keep the pattern of trade much the same as it is now.There won’t be any free trade deals that cut the cost of, say, Australian wine and reduce European producers’ share of the UK market.But Barnier is making a dangerous assumption in thinking Britain will accept a customs union in the end.May has repeatedly said that she doesn’t want one. In the unlikely event of her changing her mind on this, more ­ministers would resign from her Cabinet (two are already on the verge of quitting, according to their colleagues) and more letters would go in demanding a vote of no confidence in her.It is hard to imagine her surviving this. Brexiteers would argue that if the EU won’t accept May’s proposal, the UK should turn to the “max fac” customs plan.This doesn’t eliminate all checks at the border, but uses technology to hugely reduce them and speed things up.The EU, though, will say that this doesn’t solve the Irish ­border problem and match what May committed herself to in December. It was this worry which led to her rejecting “max fac” in the first place.Some ministers are now beginning to whisper about whether, in these circumstances, some separate arrangements for Northern Ireland would be so terrible. But May herself would never go for this.One Cabinet minister warns a separate deal for Northern Ireland would bring down the Government, “I can’t see how the DUP would accept that and we can’t govern without them”.This minister says that May has made a “bold and fair offer to the EU” and if they won’t work from that “we’re not going to end up with a deal with them”.There is a strong sense among ministers that the UK can’t carry on with Barnier saying no and the Government offering up concession after concession. In the words of one, “we shouldn’t sell the soul of the nation to have a deal with the EU”.Is no-deal the most likely outcome, then? Well, not yet.Some in Government believe they can reverse the EU’s threat — pointing out that if there is no deal there will be a hard border in Ireland. They hope this message might make the EU more amenable either to May’s customs plan or to a “max fac”-style solution.What’s for certain is that May’s meeting with other EU leaders in September is ­shaping up to be crucial. But May must make sure she goes to that meeting with a plan B.If Merkel, Macron and Co want more and more ­concessions on Chequers, May must simply change course and ­propose a Canada-style free trade deal.She should tell EU leaders — and Ireland’s Leo Varadkar in particular — that the choice is between that and no deal, with all it would mean for the Irish border.But MPs who are back in their ­constituencies  are telling me that they are getting  even more stick  than they  expected about her proposals.One  Tory predicts that time spent  in the constituency will “put a fire underneath MPs before they  come back, rather than calming them down”.THERESA MAY’S fundamental flaw as a politician is on display again. She is simply not very good at selling things.This was her problem in the General Election campaign and it is her problem now as she tries to persuade a sceptical public of the merits of her Brexit plan.Her trip to the North East this week was a case in point. Here was a chance to try to sell the deal directly to voters. But May failed to take it.She didn’t come with anything new to say, she didn’t ask voters to put themselves in her shoes or make a charismatic case for it. As one Cabinet minister laments: “She’s uncomfortable with ­people, including her own ­colleagues.”But May needs to sell this plan. If she cannot turn public opinion on it around – at the moment only 12 per cent of voters think it would be good for Britain – then she won’t be able to get it through Parliament.As May goes on her summer hols, she should be thinking about a big address to the nation in September where she makes the case for her plan. It could be her last best chance to save it.THE most alarming thing about Labour’s anti-Semitism scandal is that the extent of concern across the Jewish community about how Labour is dealing with the issue hasn’t been enough to make the party change course.It is now hard not to conclude that Labour’s refusal to simply accept the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism is worryingly sinister.It is tempting to put this all down to the Brexit effect, and that is – obviously – part of it.But what is striking is how volatile politics is right across the Western world. In the EU, the new populist Italian government will announce its budget in September, which could cause major problems in the eurozone.In Germany, a regional election could further destabilise the coalition there.While Spanish politics is about to be riled by it becoming the new centre of the migrant crisis.Meanwhile in America, August promises to be the most dramatic month yet in the presidency of Donald Trump  as his own lawyer appears to have turned on him.None of these situations is exactly the same.But there is a common root to this volatility: The aftermath of the financial crisis and the challenges posed by the fact it has never been easier to try to move from the poor world to the rich world.Until Western governments come up with answers to these questions, politics will be extremely volatile.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They will not allow Britain to enjoy frictionless trade as a non-member. So what happens next?EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier wants us to stay in the customs union, ending our freedom to strike global trade deals. But Mrs May would not survive breaching her own red line on this.Going back on her word would spark more Brexit ministers resigning from Government, making her position untenable. So what then?If Barnier and the sozzled Jean-Claude Juncker don’t like our proposal and insist on continuing to punish us then they leave us with no choice.No-deal is the only logical next step.Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab insists that we will be prepared for Brexit “come what may”. Good.We don’t want a hard border in Ireland. Nor do the Irish. But if the EU won’t budge, it may be unavoidable.Irish PM Leo Varadkar’s cosying up to Brussels and his anti-Brexit sabre-rattling is grossly misplaced.His country will be hit badly in the event of a no-deal.Let’s see how the Irish like that.THE Sun warned that the privacy ruling in the Sir Cliff Richard case would have a chilling impact on Press freedom and harm the pursuit of justice.Mr Justice Mann set a very dangerous precedent by suggesting those under police investigation should not be named in normal circumstances.Surprise, surprise! It took a week for us to get a legal letter citing the case to try to prevent publication of a story.A union official has been suspended for allegedly pleasuring themselves in their office and in public and uploading pictures of their activity online.The lawyers objected to us revealing the official’s name because they claimed an internal investigation was “private”.The judge’s ruling is a dangerous slide towards Press censorship, at the expense of YOUR right to know.Of course, the winners are the rich and powerful who can afford top lawyers to stop any scrutiny, regardless of the public interest.This terrible judgment must be appealed – and quickly.BRITS love to moan about the weather – usually about how wet and cold it is.But this week the complaints have been that it is too hot.

She is the same age as me. But that’s where the similarities stop. In fact physically, the only thing that is similar about our ­bodies are our toenails.But when I see pictures of her I don’t feel bad about myself or envious (on the contrary, I feel only admiration) because I know I have not put in any effort to look like that.I like cake too much, and I like going out with friends, having a drink, cooking and eating. And I am more than happy with my lot.The problem is, though, that a lot of women DO feel bad about themselves when they look at photos of beautiful women.They compare themselves and feel they don’t measure up that they are lacking or worthless. This is especially an issue for young girls.Talking about body image this week, Loose Women presenter Nadia Sawalha said she blames herself for her teenage daughter’s body issues.She thinks 15-year-old Maddie has developed insecurities by growing up with Nadia talking about her own.“She grew up around me being negative about my body and she picked that up by osmosis,” she said.Unfortunately, it’s true that girls are influenced by the way their mothers feel about their bodies.But the reality is it’s not just our mum’s body image that is informing ours.It’s the airbrushed adverts and the photos that have been photoshopped into flawlessness on social media, offering impossible standards for us to try to live up to.It’s the enhanced physiques of the Kardashians and the women on Love Island setting impossible standards of “femininity”.The bottom line is that women are constantly sexualised and judged on their appearance, so it’s all too easy for women to fall prey to the pursuit of a “perfection” that doesn’t exist.When “perfect” can only be attained with surgery and extreme dieting, or starvation, you are setting yourself up to feel inadequate and bad about yourself.Even when some women look like they’ve achieved “perfection”, they still feel bad about themselves.Megan on Love Island is a good example.She is absolutely stunning but still lacks confidence — the one key thing surgery and dieting can’t necessarily give you.The most important thing you can give to any young girl — or boy — is that belief in yourself and who you are, and the certainty that your personality is just as important as the way you look.The question is, how do you achieve this?One thing I always tried to emphasise to my daughter when she was young was that it’s not just your skin that people are going to judge you on.I never worried about my weight and never said I felt fat — even if I had put on a few pounds.I also emphasised that happiness is not about looks.It is about how you feel, and about the friendship, fun and laughter you have in life.Laughter and personality are infectious.People don’t want to spend time with people obsessed about their looks and their weight.They want to be around people who are interesting, fun and dynamic.Have you seen that film, I Feel Pretty? It stars Amy Schumer, whose character is fuller figured, wears big pants and is always on a diet.Then she bangs her head and wakes up thinking — and acting as if — she is drop-dead gorgeous.As a result, doors start opening for her and she can have any man she wants.It’s just a film, but it rings true: Confidence comes from within.So much about confidence comes down to attitude.If you are constantly thinking about your flaws you forget your positives.So next time you find yourself pointing out your flabby bits, force yourself to find a positive.Forget “perfect”, accept your flaws and focus instead on dressing for your body shape.If you don’t know how to, then ask a sales assistant — that is the beauty of going into a shop rather than shopping online.And there’s nothing wrong with a few props. I’m not a fan of cosmetic surgery but if a padded bra and fake tan make you feel better about yourself, then go for it.That way you’ll have more time to get on and enjoy life, rather than fretting that you don’t look like J-Lo.THE saga of Tini Owens, 68, who has been trying for several years to end her 40-year marriage to 80-year-old mushroom farmer Hugh, took a depressing turn when she lost her long-running legal battle to divorce her husband.In short, she insists their relationship has broken down but Mr Owens refuses to agree to the split.Despite her certainty that it’s over, and the fact they are now living in separate houses, five Supreme Court judges waved away Mrs Owens’ pleas to let her end the union.They ruled she must stay married – because Mrs Owens has failed to establish that her marriage had irretrievably broken down, as required by law.How farcical.We do not live in the Middle East, or the middle ages, and we are not owned by our husbands.So why is she being forced to stay married to him?And what kind of man wants to force his wife to stay married to him?They didn’t deny the conclusions drawn by people at the time that they would rectify the shocking pay-gap between the actors and give Claire a £100k cheque as back-pay.But now that the dust has settled, guess what? It turns out the back-pay bit was just a rumour and no such thing has happened.Given that they pledged at the time that there will be no gender pay parity for the new cast, that sounds like flawed logic.I ADMIRE Louise Redknapp for saying she “lost her identity” during her 19-year marriage to ex-husband Jamie.The former Eternal singer, 43, talked about the fallout of putting her successful career on hold to raise sons Charley, 14 and Beau, nine.I guess what partly happened is that Louise found her identity again after being in the 2016 series of Strictly, followed by the show Cabaret.Having put her life on hold, which would build resentment in even the most giving individual, Louise had a chance to rediscover herself.Either Jamie didn’t like that, or he felt he couldn’t be part of her new life.It’s such a good reminder of the importance of hanging on to your own identity in a marriage.Even if you are the stay-at-home parent, it’s important to find a way not to be the “Wife of” or “Husband of” someone else.And not just to prevent your spouse from losing sight of the person they fell in love with.The real issue is that you can forget who you are yourself.A lot of this comes back to shared parental responsibility.The more equality there is with parenting, the more space there is for both parents to retain their individuality.Here’s some unsolicited advice for any new parents out there.Even if all you think you want to do now is look after your kids, try to find a little bit of space that’s just for you.Hang on to the things that made you you before you had kids and you’ll be doing your marriage a huge favour.But what’s as important as having separate interests and experiences in a relationship is that you grow together.It’s good to take separate paths but make sure you’ve got a shared one too.You’re welcome!\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBRITAIN’S first “legal” red light district, in Holbeck, Leeds, was a great idea – on paper.It was created four years ago with the aim of stopping sex trafficking and violence, and combatting sexually transmitted infections by regulating the sex trade.The problem is, it hasn’t worked.In fact it’s caused a surge in sex and drug-taking in parks and woods – sometimes in view of children.Not only that but the number of reported rapes and sex assaults in the red light district doubled since it launched.There is no perfect solution for the world’s oldest profession.But perhaps we need to start considering a way to create safe and regulated brothels since street-walking is never going to be safe.I WAS sickened to read about the man who “rescued” an 18-year-old British au pair in Naples who had just been raped by two men.Allegedly, he offered to help her but then said, “It’s my turn now”, before raping her again.What kind of despicable human being “rescues” someone only to attack them?In my view, if he is found guilty, whatever sentence he gets should be doubled.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Party members are in open revolt and Ukip are circling like sharks.Labour, meanwhile, has been dragged into a vicious civil war by a racist rabble bent on purging the party of all the people, like Frank Field, who make it worth voting for.Yet as things stand, it is Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxists who would storm to victory in a general election, bringing with them economic chaos, instability and, as night follows day, mass unemployment.What did we do to deserve this, Theresa May?How does this great nation find itself on the brink of political anarchy, paralysis and a Channel blockade on food and medicine?The answer is appalling leadership, dithering diplomacy . . . and a quite incredible failure to speak to the people.So, a round of applause for EU bully-boy Michel Barnier and unelected Brussels puppet master Martin Selmayr for opening our eyes in time.Without their breathtaking arrogance, Britain might have sleep-walked into a humiliating deal which left us half-in, half-out — and paying through the nose for the privilege.Now everyone, including our EU allies, can see Barnier has gone too far by rudely rubbishing Mrs May’s pleas for peace in our time and insisting we still cough up a £39billion ransom.Italian deputy PM Matteo Salvini spoke more clearly for Britain than Mrs May herself when he urged her to stand up to Brussels or walk away.“My experience in the European parliament tells me you either impose yourself or they swindle you,” says Salvini.His sentiments are echoed by other EU leaders bruised by the Brussels jackboot.Privately, many would like to see Barnier and Selmayr given a poke on the nose.All the more disappointing that Ireland, one of those victims, cosies up to Barnier against the country that bailed them out after the 2008 crash.Donald Trump showed how it’s done, with sozzled EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker lurching to Washington on hands and knees for a deal on tariffs.Yet Britain does more trade than America with the EU.While Mrs May dithers, Chancellor Phil Hammond deserves a special place somewhere for leaving us dangerously in the lurch.Thanks to him we are running out of time with virtually nothing in place to soften a crash landing.The mood in Britain has hardened dramatically against Brussels since the “turd- polishing” Chequers summit.Ministers, MPs and even Mrs May’s own local party fear she has already surrendered too much.It is now too late for the traditional EU stitch-up, with Brussels giving an inch and taking a mile. Forget about a second referendum.Leave campaign mastermind Dominic Cummings is right to warn Brexit would win an even bigger majority in the current atmosphere of rank betrayal.Remainers bleat about Brexit dividing the nation for generations to come. In fact, the wounds can ONLY be healed by a successful, clean-cut Brexit.We will NOT sink back into the Dark Ages, cut off from the world, adrift in the North Sea with no friends.More important, a successful Brexit is the ONLY way the Tories will beat off the threat from Labour and Ukip.Under a bolder, more dynamic leader — sooner rather than later — Britain will re-establish itself as a flourishing, tax-competitive trading nation.It is what Brussels, and Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxists, fear above all.Before we know it, we will be into our stride, making our own trade deals and wondering what all this fuss was about.From our new vantage point we will also be looking back at the EU — a bickering, cash-strapped political catastrophe that is already unravelling at huge cost to its member states.Among which, thank goodness, we will no longer be counted.Three Jewish newspapers blasted his refusal to accept the international definition of anti-Semitism. Jezza even risks losing his beloved allotment in Jewish-voting Barnet.What will it now take for decent Labour MPs like Chuka Umunna and Yvette Cooper to admit Labour is not fit under Corbyn to be an alternative party of government?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Did you lend the jacket to somebody else?” Baron Cohen asked.Moore angrily said he had been married for 33 years and had “never had an accusation of such things”.“Certainly, I’m not a paedophile,” he said. “Maybe Israeli technology hasn’t developed properly.”The judge then promptly stormed out of the interview.Moore is just the latest politician to fall victim to the pranksters actions.Last week a Georgia state representative resigned after being tricked into shouting the n-word and exposing his bum to turn a terrorist gay.Jason Spencer, 43, was ordered to go by senior members of both parties following the embarrassing display .Baron Cohen also takes aim at the media and political correctness.The comedian poses as a pony-tailed liberal radio reporter on a post-2016 election cycling tour, and a man in a disability scooter who purports to investigate fake news.In the first episode, Baron Cohens radio journalist persona is shown dining at the home of two Trump supporters in South Carolina and regaling them with lurid stories about his supposed family.It comes after Cohen was slammed by Sarah Palin, 54, when he apparently posed as a wounded military veteran to dupe her into taking part in the show.Palin, the former governor of Alaska, revealed she will feature in the satirical comedy series, while branding his humour “exploitive” and “sick”.In a scathing Facebook post she alleged Cohen pretended to be wheelchair-bound to convince her he was a wounded former serviceman.She wrote: Yup - we were duped.

However, a real customs union would be better and so would be uninterrupted access for financial service institutions.“It is now up to the EU to accommodate demands for British industry and banks to admit that what is good for British business is also good for their continental counterparts.”And the top German MEP also invited top eurocrat Donald Tusk to intervene in the talks and steer Britain away from the exit door.He said the EU Council chief should offer the UK a “new deal” with constraints on free movement to persuade it to stay inside the bloc.He said: “Still better would be for both, Britain and the EU, to call the whole thing off.“For that I ask President Tusk to offer Britain a New Deal, giving it what it always wanted - more autonomy, especially in controlling its immigration.

This is potentially damaging. We have too much secrecy as it is.”Buerk also criticised judges for failing to take into account social media and the rise of fake news and called on Parliament to make privacy laws.He said: “ The world has changed, even if judges haven’t noticed. In the cacophony of social media everything is everywhere anyway, suspects would be named almost instantly, however much you bind the steam-age media limping along behind.“The line between privacy and freedom is one of the most important decisions a civilised society has to make. It’s time it was drawn by parliament and not left to be worked out piecemeal by judges on the basis of individual cases.”Buerk, who shot to fame with his reports from Ethiopia’s famine in 1984, he said he was pleased the BBC had reported the raid at Sir Cliff’s house because it showed “the juices were still flowing.”He said: “Journalism is not the priesthood, even at the BBC. I’m pleased that the juices are still flowing at an organisation that can often look flatulent, bureaucratic and complacent. Great that the newsroom can still “go bananas” over a “cracking story” – even if it wasn’t.”He also questioned whether police should spend so much time investigating when there was a knife, gun and violent crime epidemic.

We have carried out seven simulator tests, flight simulators, three at high and four at low speed and we found the turn was made indeed under a manual, not autopilot.”Dr Kok said the investigators examined the history of the pilot and the first officer and were satisfied with their background, training and mental health.A 2017 report by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau showed that pilot Zaharie had used his own flight simulator six weeks before the crash to fly a route which was initially similar to the one taken by MH370.However, Malaysian authorities concluded that the flight simulations were game-related and that there was was no unusual activities on the simulator.The final report today said that the co-pilots flight simulator was seized from his home but that nothing suspicious was found on it.Kok said his team “couldn’t find any flaws with the aircraft” and that “everything seemed OK” with it.He added that the cause of the disappearance cannot be determined until the plane and its black boxes are found, saying the answer can only be conclusive if the wreckage is found.The report said there was no sign the plane was evading radar detection or that it was taken over by remote control.No irregularities were found in the on-board cargo, which included items like lithium batteries and about 2,500 kgs of mangosteen which is a tropical fruit.The independent investigation report highlighted shortcomings in the governments response.Dr Kok said the probe showed lapses by air traffic control, including a failure to swiftly initiate an emergency response and monitor radar continuously, relying too much on information from Malaysia Airlines and not getting in touch with the military for help.The plane is presumed to have crashed in the far southern Indian Ocean.However, the report said there was insufficient information to determine if the aircraft broke up in the air or during impact with the ocean.Scattered pieces of debris that washed ashore on African beaches and Indian Ocean islands indicated a distant remote stretch of the ocean where the plane likely crashed.But a government search by Australia, Malaysia and China failed to pinpoint a location.And a second, private search by US company Ocean Infinity that finished at the end of May also found no sign of the wreckage.Hard copies of the long-awaited and unedited report were distributed to families of those on-board the flight earlier today.Malaysian Transport Minister Anthony Loke said the team also briefed relatives of the victims on the report at the transport ministry.However, next of kin looked distraught after receiving the report while insisting the document offered them “no closure”,  reports.Many of the heartbroken relatives reportedly said some of the information contained in the report was incorrect.Others reported that while there were no major surprises the report contained more details as to the extent in which Air Traffic Control allegedly “messed up”.Captain Zaharies friend Peter Chong, who is also a pilot, said in a Facebook post that he feels disappointment over the report and the lack of closure for the grieving relatives.He wrote: I feel sad for the Next of Kin (NOK) of MH370. After all the hype and expectations, the Report released brings forth nothing new.They are no where near to closure.Just another round in the emotional rollercoaster ride.I am happy to note there is no blame apportioned to anyone.However, there is also no answers as to what happened to the flight.Earlier, Mr Loke told reporters that “every word recorded by the investigation team (has been) tabled in this report”.“It (was) tabled fully, without any editing, additions, or redactions,” he said.Grace Nathan, whose mother was on the flight, responded to the release of the report on Facebook. “Just because they call it a final report doesn’t mean it’s over for the next of kin,” she wrote today.“The search must go on. There can be no final report until MH370 is found.”On May 29, Malaysia called off a three-month search by Ocean Infinity, which spanned 43,243 sq miles in the southern Indian Ocean and ended with no significant findings.Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur and was heading to Beijing with 239 people on board.Passengers included Chinese calligraphers, a couple on their way home to their young sons after a long-delayed honeymoon and a construction worker who hadnt been home in a year.But at 12.14am on March 8, 2014, Malaysia Airlines lost contact with MH370 close to Phuket island, Thailand, in the Strait of Malacca.Before that, Malaysian authorities believe the last words heard from the plane, from either the pilot or co-pilot, was Good night Malaysian three seven zero.Satellite pings from the aircraft suggest it continued flying for around seven hours when the fuel would have run out.Experts have calculated the most likely crash site around 1,000 miles west of Perth, Australia.But a huge search of the seabed failed to find any wreckage - and there are a number of alternative theories as to its fate.Malaysian captain Zaharie Amad Shah was flying MH370 when it disappeared.Shah, born July 31, 1961, was described as a veteran pilot who joined Malaysia Airlines in 1981.A father of three, passionate cook and keen fisherman, Shah lived with his wife in a luxury gated community where he was said to have built his own flight simulator.In the wake of the planes disappearance, rumours surfaced claiming his wife had moved out of their home.The co-pilot was Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, who was on his first flight on a 777 as a fully approved first officer.He had flown five times before with a check co-pilot overseeing him.But he had 2,763 hours experience flying other jets before moving to the larger aircraft.Fariq was reportedly planning to marry his girlfriend."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT0004193166301.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"foreign aid jobs perv magnets","story":"The International Development Committee said delivering aid to the most needy is an “attractive sector for people wishing to exploit others” in a damning analysis of the sector.MPs said charity aid bosses have “collectively failed” to tackle “the horror of sexual exploitation and abuse” over many years. Their report found sexual abuse was widespread across organisations, institutions and countries and aid bosses were “self-deluded” about tackling the problem.And it hit out at a “macho” and “boys club” attitudes to women which resulted in a workplace where sexual assault was seen as “permissible by perpetrators and their supporters”.The initial report from MPs on the issue following an expose of the abuse of aid victims in Haiti found “sexual predators” were using resources and power to “exploit and abuse some of the most vulnerable people in the world”.Committee chair Stephen Twigg blasted the “culture of denial” from charities like Oxfam and the UN with “limited action” taken in the past when claims were made.He raged: “Six months after The Times’ expose of abuse in Haiti, the Committee publishes a first look at the troubling issue of sexual exploitation and abuse in the aid sector.“Many things have changed in that time with the aid sector, Charity Commission and DFID taking steps to respond to the crisis.“One thing has not: the abject failure of the international aid sector to get to grips with this issue, leaving victims at the mercy of those who seek to use power to abuse others. No matter how insurmountable this looks, solutions must be found. This horror must be confronted.”Last night International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said urgent action was needed from the sector ahead of an international summit in October.She said: “Until the sector is fully prepared to address the power imbalance, cultures, and behaviours that allow sexual abuse, exploitation and harassment to happen, we will never stamp it out.“Ensuring that survivors’ voices are heard and taken seriously is paramount.”MPs are calling for a global register for aid workers to help screen outknown sexual predators. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Since 2010 the workplace has been transformed and these figures show why so much foreign investment comes into the UK.”A Downing Street spokesman added: “This Government is absolutely committed to making sure people have the support they need to return to work following sickness and working with employers to help people with health conditions or a disability stay in their job”.More than a quarter of sickie days in 2017 were attributed to minor illness, such as coughs and colds. This adds up to 34.3 million days per year.Workers in large organisations of 500 or more employees are the most likely to be off work sick, with a 2.3% rate. In comparison, organisations that employ fewer than 25 people have the lowest figure of 1.6% for workers.A record high of 32.4 million people are also now in work in Britain, or three out of every four people. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The government has suggested the need for this disruption is not part of its Brexit plans, and the UK\u0027s departure from the EU was not mentioned in the written statement announcing the plan or the consultation document.This does not appear to be correct, however.Local businesses have been told it will take up to two weeks to activate the plan, unlike the few minutes Operation Stack requires following news of disruption in Calais.The only plausible use for such a system is in anticipation of a structural increase in customs and regulatory checks at the UK border following Brexit in March next year.Kent County Council also point out in its report that \"Brock\" stands for \"Brexit Operations Across Kent\". Local industry sources claim privately that the government did not want its plans for a potential \"no deal\" Brexit associated with the need to turn a large swathe of the main motorway link with the Continent into a lorry park.The government hopes its Chequers plan for Brexit, including a common rulebook for goods and agri-food, will avoid the need to instigate new border checks.But they will be difficult to avoid in a no deal scenario, and the EU has vowed to enforce them even if - as Sky News reported earlier this year - the government\u0027s secret plan is to waive almost all such checks on goods coming in to the UK.The Dover report expresses some uncertainty about even in which country such checks will be required.It says: \"Current systems are based on juxtaposed controls being conducted in France and England... once outside the EU such [juxtaposed] controls may cease\".\"We cannot begin to surmise... the substantial workforce required to provide a service at the juxtaposed positions,\" it adds.The government was due to report in detail on its contingencies for a no deal Brexit in the following weeks."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-theresa-may-chequers_4355455.jpg?20180706224324 ","title":"brexit middle ground disappearing from under theresa mays feet","story":"Brexiteers such as Andrew Bridgen MP blame the Chequers compromise of staying in a common rule book for goods and trade for a shift in the polls against Brexit, and demand the abandonment of the plan.Remainer campaigners feel equally emboldened that demographics and the brutal clarity of plans for stockpiling food and medicines, are on their side if they can somehow get Parliament to vote for a referendum on the exit deal.And, as importantly, at a time when the Cabinet is touring European capitals seeking their backing to force Brussels to compromise on its red lines, the perception that the UK public does not back the Chequers compromise is very problematic.The government\u0027s official response to polls such as this is that there will be no further referendum.Indeed the PM regularly uses the fact that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has not fully ruled one out as a stick to try to beat him in the Commons.But Number 10 needs to ask itself some pretty fundamental questions about strategy.It is rather difficult to reconcile with repeatedly parroting \"No deal is better than a bad deal\".It was always likely that its Brexit plan would land somewhere near Chequers. But Number 10 did not roll the pitch for this compromise, by, for example, getting the PM to promise car or aviation workers that their jobs would be protected.The Clean or Hard Brexiteers feel the red lines that she herself announced have been betrayed.But having staked out a fairly hard line initially, the PM has not now persuaded Remain leaning voters to be thankful for her attempt at compromise.She has not sold Chequers.

It brought record-breaking viewing figures for ITV2, with the launch show in June attracting the channel\u0027s largest ever audience with 2.9 million viewers.That figure was topped just a few weeks into the run, with three million viewers tuning in mid-week.But why is it so successful? An idyllic location (Majorca), beautiful contestants and plenty of screen time (six hour-long episodes per week) certainly gave the show a boost from the start.BAFTA-winning presenter Iain Stirling\u0027s quippy voiceover also helps to lubricate the on-screen action.Stirling studied law at Edinburgh University before going on to present children\u0027s TV and earning his presenter stripes alongside a scruffy terrier puppet called Hacker.

There\u0027s even the odd minor-celebrity thrown in to give the show a little star dust, with Danny Dyer\u0027s daughter Dani (yes, really) eventually justifying her status as favourite to win.Dani and pen salesman Jack Fincham have been coupled since the start, and say they plan to move in together now the show has come to an end.The popular pair have even received the thumbs up from The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds thanks to Jack\u0027s penchant for bird watching during his time in the villa. Winning an A* for ingenuity, the show\u0027s producers even managed to wangle an appearance of sorts from Daddy Dyer over the weekend.The always awkward meeting of boyfriend and father was given an extra excruciating twist, with Jack meeting the EastEnders actor over Facetime.Luckily the soap star, who was speaking from his family holiday in Florida, said he \"approved\" of Fincham, telling him \"I think you\u0027re absolutely bang on\" and a \"proper geezer\".He also told him he had a bit of a belly using cockney rhyming slang - a classic Dyer move. Viewers were quick to share their love for Danny\u0027s appearance on social media, hailing it the best moment of the series so far.The highest-rated show across all channels in its 9pm time slot, it is not just Britons who love it. Love Island is now produced in seven other countries.Within 24 hours of launching last month, Love Island Australia received the largest catch-up service ratings for an Australian reality TV show ever. With three successful series behind it, the UK show even took home a BAFTA earlier this year, winning the award for best reality show and paving the way for the current series\u0027 success.Thorpe Park has opened its own Love Island-themed attraction - complete with beach - this summer.And more than one university student has written a dissertation on the reality show.Labour MP Stella Creasy tweeted amid the Brexit votes to say she hoped he was all right.The show even had its own underdog.Unlucky in love Alex, an A\u0026E doctor from Wales, won the hearts of the nation before being dumped from the villa just one day before the final. One fan explained her newfound love for the show: \"It\u0027s the first series I\u0027ve ever watched, but I\u0027m addicted. It\u0027s the same appeal as Big Brother. Seeing into people\u0027s lives - into relationships which are normally secret. You know they\u0027re not real, but it doesn\u0027t matter.\"Plus, as a girl, you get to see how the men act when they are with a date, and then how their behaviour changes when they are with their friends. And then again, how that dynamic changes when they interact with the girl\u0027s mates.\"It\u0027s on six nights a week but I wish it was seven. I look forward to 9pm. Most of my friends watch it too. And every episode ends on a cliff-hanger, so you have to watch it the next day.\" The world, it seems, cannot get enough.With the show recently commissioned in Denmark, Finland and Norway, there will be a version of Love Island on somewhere around the world every single day between now and Christmas.A daily Love Island podcast which dissects each night\u0027s antics - presented by Kem Cetinay, one half of last year\u0027s winning couple, and DJ Arielle Free - has barely been out of the top spot on the iTunes podcast chart since launching at the end of May. Free - who appeared in one of the Harry Potter films and briefly worked as a foot model - landed the job as Morning After podcast host after throwing her own Love Island final party last year.A true Love Island fan, she puts the success of the show down to its authenticity: \"It\u0027s a real insight into how we function as adults when it comes to dating. There are always those moments you can relate to - the uncertainty, the lust, the love.\"Last year\u0027s show moved away from all the sex and focused more on the relationships between people, I think that\u0027s why everyone became so gripped. You want them to fall in love, you want them to work and you\u0027re always rooting for someone or a couple. I genuinely feel heartache when it doesn\u0027t work out for some of them.\" Love Island commissioning editor Amanda Stavri agrees that the tone of the show is of primary importance. Explaining how the production team carefully edit any intimate scenes, she says: \"It\u0027s really important that it\u0027s not a salacious show - that it isn\u0027t grubby.\"Stavri also puts its success down to \"not being full of conflict\" and the fact \"it doesn\u0027t feel exploitative\".When whittling down the vast numbers of entries, producers insist they don\u0027t cast for potential conflict, instead relying on the natural dating dynamic to create tension.Some 85,000 people applied to be on the show this year - more than double the number of applicants for Oxbridge. Love Island producer Richard Cowles has called the non-scripted show \"aspirational, relatable and all about falling in love\".However, Cowles goes on: \"If people don\u0027t like it they don\u0027t have to watch. We\u0027re not pretending to be anything other than an entertainment show that\u0027s a distraction from real life.\"Geared towards a younger audience, over half of Love Island\u0027s launch night viewers were aged 16-34.Only Britain\u0027s Got Talent - shown on ITV\u0027s main channel - has attracted a bigger audience for that demographic on any channel so far this year. Arielle Free says the show\u0027s success is in large part down to the hard work of the production team: \"I think Love Island winning the BAFTA was a true reflection of what audiences are consuming and enjoying. It\u0027s such a great accolade, especially for all the cast and crew who work tirelessly over the year and the two months in the villa to make it as entertaining and memorable as possible.\"It\u0027s also possible that Love Island can put its popularity down to the simple fact that people love to see their own experiences reflected on screen.If you take away the location, honed physiques and perfect hair, what you are left with is people attempting to connect, along with all the pitfalls and pleasures that come along with that gamble."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-papers-tuesday_4376219.jpg?20180730220439 ","title":"uk wetter and hotter than at any time in a century","story":"Average annual rainfall was 20% higher in the years between 2008 and 2017 than those between 1961 and 1990.The study also found that average sea levels have risen by 1.4mm a year since 1900 - equal to a rise of 16cm (6.3ins).Dr Mark McCarthy, manager of the Met Office National Climate Information Centre, said: \"Our climate is changing, globally and here in the UK.\"People may not recall 2017 as having been a particularly warm year, with a relatively wet summer and snow in December.More rainfall ties in with predictions by many climate change campaigners, including the US Natural Resources Defense Council, of higher temperatures caused by increased CO2 in the atmosphere.Some of the extra rain is thought to be falling as part of more frequent severe weather, which can lead to disasters.The figures come after the US government\u0027s National Climate Assessment cited evidence that the decade from 2000 to 2009 worldwide was warmer than any other in the last 1,300 years.Dr Stephen Cornelius, chief adviser for climate change at WWF, said: \"Climate change is not just a problem for others - this report shows that it affects us here in the UK.\"We\u0027re in the age of consequences - extreme weather such as we\u0027ve experienced this summer threatens our health, our water supplies and our natural world.\"A Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Department spokesman said: \"The UK is a world-leader in cutting emissions and driving investment in low carbon technology.\"Since 1990, carbon emissions are over 40% lower, while the UK\u0027s GDP has increased by more than two-thirds.\""},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-flour-disabled_4375869.jpg?20180730145044 ","title":"zimbabwes opposition dares to dream as nation goes to the polls","story":"Zimbabwe\u0027s largest opposition party is expected to sweep the capital and its environs with a promise to lift this battered nation off the proverbial floor.

As the bad blood washes over this election, we watched Chamisa and his entourage fight their way in and out of Kuwadzana polling station number 2 as jubilant supporters and reporters surrounded them in a crush.The MDC leader told journalists: \"I am excited that Zimbabweans have expressed themselves (and I am) hoping that the ballot in the rural areas is not a distorted one, but we have no doubt that we have won this election.

Four out of five medics quizzed in a poll fear for the future of the service once we leave the EU next year. There are concerns a brain drain of European NHS staff will deepen the recruitment crisis. An array of treatments, especially cancer care, could also be negatively affected. Imports of vital drugs such as insulin could be badly hit and investment in research and funding slashed. One medic said the London School of Hygiene and \u0026shyTropical \u0026shyMedicine survey results did not surprise him. Dr William Sapwell added: “My impression from the front line is everyone knows it’s going to be bad. It affects every little corner of the NHS. “We have recruitment and retention problems for doctors and if you put a barrier in front of seven to 10% of the \u0026shyworkforce, it will get far worse. “It’s going to massively affect our ability to treat and detect some types of cancer. That’s the scariest part.  “There is also a real risk we will run out of insulin.” Survey lead author Dr Kate \u0026shyMandeville said: “Doctors are among the best-placed people to understand the impact of political decisions on the NHS. “On Brexit their opinion is very clear: Brexit is bad for the nation’s health.” Labour MP Dr Paul Williams said: “Last week the Health Secretary admitted the NHS is s\u0026shytockpiling drugs, and we know if we leave the \u0026shyEuropean Medicines Agency we will join the back of the queue for new drugs.” The British Medical \u0026shyAssociation has called for the public to have a say on the terms of the final Brexit deal. Dr Andrew Dearden, of the BMA, said: “Doctors are worried Brexit could seriously undermine the healthcare.” The study, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, also found 79% of doctors voted Remain. The Department of Health and Social Care said: “We have continued to work closely with the EU to ensure minimal disruption to the NHS.” Half of Brits want second vote... with choice to stay put Half of Britons yesterday said they would now support a second EU referendum. An online poll of 1,466 Sky customers found 50% wanted another vote with three options – supporting the final deal, leaving without a deal, or staying in the EU. But 45% voted against and No10 insisted there would be no referendum.  Best for Britain chief executive Eloise Todd said: “The public are tired of being spoken for. They don’t want a deal full of concessions, or a nightmare no deal. It’s crucial to have a people’s vote with the option to stay in the EU.” Tory infighting over Brexit continued yesterday. One Cabinet source said of Theresa May’s Chequers plan: “It is a kamikaze approach to no deal. It’s chaos.” The Tories yesterday denied claims the Army was on standby to hand out food if a doomsday no-deal Brexit happens.  Lack of immigration policy risks creating a bad vaccum Theresa May’s failure to outline a post-Brexit immigration policy has created a dangerous vacuum, MPs warn today. The Commons Home Affairs Committee is urging the Government to set out plans for who will be allowed to come to the UK. Chairwoman Yvette Cooper said: “Immigration was one of the central issues during the referendum and it divided the country, but sadly there has been no attempt by the Government to hold any kind of sensible debate on it since.

Sandy chip \u0026shybutties and a plastic beaker of warm, diluted orange squash in this gem of a resort were the long summer \u0026shyholidays of my salad days. We didn’t need to travel far – only a few miles on a bus – which was just as well when there was mam, dad and six kids, carrying bags galore stuffed with towels, rugs, flasks of tea and buttered bread, a windbreak, tent and football. I might not have fully appreciated it then, but we were fortunate to live in a friendly town on the glorious golden coast of North East England. And they’re still coming in their \u0026shythousands from near and far to enjoy their happy seaside outings in sunny South Shields. Just like the charabanc up the A19 from Middlesbrough, 50 miles to the south on Teesside. Back on the beaches with a bucket and spade, I bumped into a couple of coachloads of Smoggies from Newport Primary. Kids, parents and teachers from the school all on an annual jaunt to stunning South Shields.  “We love the seaside,” smiled head Tricia McGill, “and when the sun’s shining, you can’t beat it here.” The truth is, I hadn’t chosen the best day of a glorious summer to return to my childhood haunts for our series celebrating the Great British Seaside this week. Nor had Newport Primary, for the school’s regular excursion. “We picked the day for it,” Tricia smiled again, a little more forced this time. “We put up the gazebo and held it down for three hours before the wind defeated us. But, as you can see, everybody’s still having a great time.” And they were. Dozens of children with mams, dads, carers, relatives, and the school staff, who I found huddled in their coats on their chairs. Nobody looked as if they were having a better time of it than ice cream-licking five-year-old Priya Singh. What does she like best about Shields? “Playing in the fair,” she says. The huge fairground – with its dodgems, ghost train, waltzer, roller-coaster and amusement arcades, all a bucket of sand’s throw from the south beach – is a huge attraction.  Friends Harriet Frazer and Lizzie Campbell are sitting in their fold-up chairs on the beach. “We come often to talk and look and listen,” says Harriet, 81, who lives nearby and worked in a jewellery shop before retirement. Lizzie, 65, a vicar in Jarrow before she retired, adds: “I love being by the sea. The place puts things in perspective. And I like to swim.” “Oooh, not me,” jumps in Harriet. “I’ll watch her. But I do like to get my feet wet, so I have a plodge.” [That’s paddling to those of you not brought up in the North East.] South Shields might not be as famous as grand Scarborough down the coast, or as \u0026shycelebrated as Whitby with its wonderful Dracula myth, but it’s one of the great British seaside’s sparkling jewels. The town is in the middle of a \u0026pound100million regeneration, which has already seen the building of National Centre for the Written Word, and the revamp of the market square to host food, craft and farmers’ stalls. The second stage will see a new transport hub, as well as more shops and leisure facilities. The local authority calculates that \u0026pound80million of public and private investment has improved the resort over the past 10 years, with more still to be spent. As youngsters, we’d go to the beach or a park most weekends in the summer holidays. There was my dad John, a miner and mam Jennie, a Wright’s Biscuits factory worker and cleaner. My older siblings, Christine and Lynn, my younger brothers, David and Stephen, and my little sister, Julie.  The locals are known as Sandancers or Sandies. According to one account, it’s after folk who danced on the sand after rescuing crews and goods from ships that ran aground in storms. The two Blue Flag sandy beaches – separated by a mile-long pier guarding the southern mouth of the River Tyne – and the fair are just for starters. There’s also a new indoor swimming pool, a steam train, a boating lake, and Arbeia – a Roman fort guarding the sea route to Hadrian’s Wall. Then there are miles of stunning cliffs, and The Leas – a glorious green haven the council had the foresight to gift to the National Trust, to prevent Tory governments in London trying to sell it off for housing. You’d need to travel a long way to buy a tastier ice cream than the cones at Minchella’s, an Italianate parlour. Or to find better fish and chips than those at the renowned Colmans, with its pictures of famous visitors on the walls, including Tony Blair. The same is true of the curry houses down Ocean Road, which opened when most of Britain thought tinned spaghetti hoops were exotic. Shields’ most famous visitor ever was Muhammad Ali. In 1977, history’s greatest boxer pulled in bigger crowds than the Queen on her Silver Jubilee tour, when he had a marriage blessing in the Laygate mosque. The town’s century-old Yemeni community dates from when the port was filled with steamers, and the coal mines and \u0026shyshipyards provided work for tens of thousands. The pits are gone, and shipbuilding too, but \u0026shymanufacturing remains a bedrock of the local economy.

Siobhan Blackhurst and Damon Gilbert were still feeling the effects of a heavy party at their home the night before and decided to go out to drink it off. Dad-of-five Gilbert, 31, pushed the 16-month-old child home in a pram after a five-hour drinking spree in a beer garden, but was so intoxicated he was staggering and could barely open his eyes. The youngster, who almost fell out of the pushchair, was filthy, hadn\u0027t had a nappy change and was was taken off Gilbert by neighbours, who called the cops.  Police found the child\u0027s mum Blackhurst, 29, still drinking two hours after Gilbert left the pub. The pair\u0027s house in nearby Colne reeked of alcohol and was littered with bottles, the court heard. Gilbert said he had downed lager and Sambuca the night before and told a probation officer he had still been drunk. Magistrates in Burnley heard Blackhurst, who claimed the child had been properly looked after throughout the day, put the tot\u0027s state down to the fact the infant had been eating Wotsits and was covered in them. The couple, who are both jobless, on benefits, and have alcohol problems, were spared jail after the Bench said they needed support. Gilbert and Blackhurst, who have been together six years, were said to have stopped drinking since the incident and had referred themselves for treatment. Philippa White, prosecuting, told the hearing the defendants were pushing the child past the Market Tavern, on Market Street, Colne, at around 11am, when the landlady was opening up the premises.  She heard Gilbert say: Should we go in here for one?  The prosecutor said: They went in the premises and remained there the rest of the afternoon, until around 4pm. They were drinking most of that time in the beer garden. The child was with them at all times. Mrs White said about 4pm, the landlady was concerned about how drunk Gilbert was and suggested he should go home. He left in a highly intoxicated state with the child in a pram and Blackhurst stayed in the pub. Gilbert made his way back to their home and knocked on some neighbours\u0027 door.

Former police officer Mark Williams-Thomas has been explaining what to do immediately if your child goes missing - and it might not be the advice you\u0027d expect.  Appearing on ITV\u0027s This Morning, he described what parents and carers should do in those first few moments. He said: So the first minute - what do you need to do? Well the crucial thing, and this is the same throughout, stay where you are. Child disappears, the likelihood is they\u0027ll come back to where they last saw you.  In a post on This Morning\u0027s Facebook page, which has now been viewed more than 280,000 times in less than 24 hours, Mr Williams-Thomas, goes on to explain what else parents can do in such circumstances.

River and reservoir levels are being examined in the wake of the deluge that hit large parts of the UK over the weekend. Some places had more rain in a few hours than the average for the entire month. But the heatwave is expected to make a blistering return this week. And experts fear the downpours were not have enough to prevent hosepipes and sprinklers being switched off in the North West on Sunday.  United Utilities, the UK’s largest water supplier with seven million customers, was the only firm to announce a restriction. Such a move would reduce water usage by 5% to 10% or 100 million litres per day. The firm has been criticised for a \u0026pound180million dividend to shareholders while losing a quarter of its supply through leaks – said to be enough to fill 175 Olympic-sized pools daily.

Alessandro Iembo, 28, Martin Neil and Franco-Lorenzo, 40, allegedly paid \u0026pound128,500 in cash to hire a private jet as they pretended to be cryptocurrency leaders on their way to meet the singer in Colombia last December. The three men, alongside Neil\u0027s brother Stephen Neil, 53 and Jose Ramon Miguelez-Botas, 56, are charged with prohibition in relation to a class A controlled drug after border force agents stopped them on a second flight from Bogota in January. When booking the private jet for the earlier trip, the woman who paid the man who ran Diamonte Jets - a chartered jet service provider - gave him \u0026pound128,500 in cash for three passengers. Prosecuting Kerry Maylin told jurors: She said they were leaders in the field of cryptocurrency, they were involved in the music industry and that her clients would be meeting Bruno Mars in Colombia. Subsequent checks revealed the singer had been in the South American country at that time.  As part of the booking, it was also asked that a luxury chauffeur driven Rolls-Royce Phantom car collect the men upon their return to Farnborough. It was to take them to an address in Bromley, south east London. Jurors heard when the three men returned to the UK on December 11, they landed with a number of suitcases but it cannot be said for certain what was in the luggage as they were not stopped. Prosecutors claim the group hid drugs in a suitcase underneath dirty children\u0027s clothes when they were caught.  They were arrested in January at Farnborough Airport in Hampshire after allegedly flying in from the South American country\u0027s capital of Bogota. In the dock at Woolwich Crown Court are brothers Stephen Neil, 53, and Martin Neil, 49, both from Poole, Dorset. They deny one count of fraudulent evasion of a prohibition in relation to a class A controlled drug, between October 30 2017 and January 30 2018.

James Holt, 24, from Manchester, never felt truly happy with his natural look and his biggest insecurities were always his lips, until he turned 16 and had his first of many fillers. James relished the feeling he got after his first round of fillers and knew that he would keep on having them, despite what his friends and family said. So far, James has spent a total of \u0026pound14,000 on his lips alone. As well as having his lips done every two to four months, James has also had two nose jobs, Botox every three months, teeth whitening twice a year and Botox injections into his armpits to prevent sweating.  James travelled abroad to Poland for his nose jobs, with each one costing \u0026pound4,000. The Botox procedure has set James back \u0026pound12,000 as he has been doing it since the age of 18, and a further \u0026pound4,000 on cheek fillers as well as \u0026pound1,000 on chin fillers. I wasn\u0027t happy with my natural look, but I feel comfortable with this fake look, said James.  I started when I was 16 when I found someone who would give me lip fillers, and I think it\u0027s got better with time.  I like going to different people to have work done because there\u0027s different techniques that they can use. It adds to my face.  I\u0027ve always wanted to change my face after seeing celebs doing it, so I thought I\u0027d start with my lips and getting Botox injections. It felt great after the first time and I knew I\u0027d be getting more.  I try to top up my lips every two to four months, and I get Botox every three months. I have my teeth whitened every six months, but I\u0027ll be getting veneers at some point. I also have facials every week, and I\u0027m planning another nose job for early next year because I think it\u0027s still botched after the second surgery. I\u0027ve had Botox injected into my armpits to stop me sweating, and I have thought of the idea of removing sweat glands in the future. I have had a few problems along the way where the fillers have come out of my lips because there was too much filler in them, my lips have rejected it, and the middle of my lips has sunken before. My lips have also bruised due to their size after treatment. After my nose jobs there have been complications as I can\u0027t breathe through my nose and I sound quite nasal. I have trouble sleeping because when I\u0027m trying to breathe out of my nose I\u0027m not able to, so I wake up.  I don\u0027t really have any inspiration, I just go for what I feel like. It\u0027s my touch on me because I want to stand out and look different. Before I looked boring and plain, I looked just like everybody else. I\u0027ve been doing it so long that it\u0027s like maintenance now. Although he didn\u0027t hate how he looked before his cosmetic surgery, James now feels much happier in himself and full of confidence James appreciates the attention he gets due to his look, albeit negative and positive, and he has learnt to live with the looks he gets because he is happy with the outcome. Over the last three years, James has spent \u0026pound2000 on cryotherapy to make his bum look bigger. I love it when people double look me, added James.  My friends and family aren\u0027t best happy with the results. They tell me I\u0027ve gone too far, that it\u0027s too much and that I need to stop before my lips fall off or explode. I know they are thinking of me but at the end of the day it\u0027s me who wants this look, so I don\u0027t listen. I get lots of looks in the street and I\u0027ve even had people come up to me asking about my lips. Most people just look and gasp, but I\u0027ve learnt to live with that. Older people seem to be very shocked, but I don\u0027t think they understand.

Liz Marsh, 28, became of the one of the youngest patients in the UK to be diagnosed with mouth cancer after the ulcer on her tongue tripled in size in the space of four weeks. She underwent urgent life-saving surgery to remove the growth and surgeons also had to cut off a third of her tongue. During the same 14-hour operation they used skin, muscle arteries and veins taken from her arm to rebuild the muscular organ.  Brave Liz, is now cancer free but has had to learn to talk, eat and smile again. She said: “I was shocked when surgeons explained that skin, muscle, veins and nerves from my arm would rebuild my tongue. “When I first spotted the ulcer in my mouth I thought nothing of it. “But when it started to become painful and grew, I raised my concerns to my dentist.  “They told me to come back in four weeks and after visiting my doctor, it was dismissed as being a harmless ulcer. “My son, Charlie, now two, had undergone heart surgery at the time and we all thought it was stress related. “But my dentist referred me for tests and a few weeks later I had a biopsy. “I was told just over a week later that I had mouth cancer, by which point the ulcer had turned black.  “Thankfully my consultant at Princess Royal Hospital in Telford was amazing and he reassured me that I could be fixed. “I had a lot of muscle and veins removed from my arm so they could help rebuild my tongue. “It was a complex surgery but I was out of hospital 11 days later. I had been fed through a tube for the entire time I was in hospital and I had to try and relearn to eat once I left.  “For months after my surgery I struggled to smile as my mouth felt numb but now I’m embracing my imperfections. “I also needed speech and language therapy. It was really swollen for a long time but eventually I started to enjoy eating again.” Liz, from Shrewsbury, Shrops, was initially diagnosed in October 2016 but underwent further surgery in May. She added: “My new tongue was quite bulky so I needed it to be trimmed back once all the swelling had settled.  “I hope being open with my story helps others seek help, if it saves one person’s life then it’s worthwhile. “If you have an ulcer, white patches or a lump in your mouth then make sure you get it checked.” “Doctors were shocked when I was diagnosed as I was so young but it shows it can happen to anyone. “Due to my age I have recovered well from surgery and hopefully I will remain cancer free for the next few years so I’m given the all clear. “I currently have check-ups every eight weeks but this will be extended the longer I’m in remission.

Prince George celebrated his fifth birthday earlier this month, which means he will now be expected to bow to his great-grandmother.

A north/south split across the UK this week will see parts of the country bracing themselves for another scorching spell after a brief respite from the heat.  While sun worshippers will rejoice, those facing sweaty commutes will probably wish they lived at the other end of the country as the heatwave returns with a vengeance.   Weather forecasters have warned that temperatures are likely to hit 30C (86F) across the south of England by Friday, instead of being concentrated in the south east.  The mercury will continue to climb over the weekend reaching highs of 32C (89.6F) and possibly 33C (91.4F). While the south shrivels, northern parts of the UK will continue to see showers with temperatures sitting in the mid 20s.  A spokeswoman for the Met Office said: In terms of the weekend just gone, they were the first two days this month where temperatures haven\u0027t reached 25C (77F) but we have got back to that point today, it hit 25.3C (77.5F) in Cavendish in Suffolk so it\u0027s already starting to warm up again. Over the next few days there will be something of a north and south split - high pressure is already starting to build up in the south, bringing dry, fine and weather. She warned: Southern England and Wales are going to turn quite hot by Friday - temperatures will probably reach 30C (86F) by that point. This is likely to include quite a wide area across the southern part of the UK - it will widely hit 30C (86F) across southern England and Wales, and the very hot weather will return as we approach the weekend.  The north of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland can expect outbreaks of much-needed rain on Tuesday, Wednesday and in to Thursday. The spokeswoman said: It\u0027s a more varied picture across the north but it\u0027s an improving situation - sunshine with some showers and a similar story across the weekend. By Friday the temperatures could get into the mid 20s, so warming up, just not as hot as it is in the south. The weather broke on Friday, treating the parched landscape to a deluge of rain. It meant this July will be wetter than the blistering heatwave of July 1976.  An average 49.9mm of rain fell across the UK from July 1 to July 29, according to provisional figures from the Met Office, and with further rain expected this week, the final total could be higher. The total for the whole of July 1976 was 43.3mm. The UK suffered a long heatwave during the summer of 1976, which helped make July 1976 the joint ninth driest on record. Currently, July this year is the 13th driest on record, the Met Office said. The driest ever July was in 1955, when an average of 30.6mm rainfall was measured across the UK. Comparable records for rainfall date back to 1910.

Photos and infrared imaging indicate vehicles moving in and out of the facility at Sanumdong, but do not show how advanced any missile construction might be, experts revealed. The Washington Post reported on Monday that North Korea appeared to be building one or two new liquid-fueled intercontinental ballistic missiles at the large research facility on the outskirts of Pyongyang, citing unidentified officials familiar with intelligence reporting. According to the U.S. official who spoke to Reuters, one photo showed a truck and covered trailer similar to those the North has used to move its ICBMs. Since the trailer was covered, it was not possible to know what, if anything, it was carrying.  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The evidence obtained this month is the latest to suggest ongoing activity in North Korea\u0027s nuclear and missile facilities despite talks with the United States and a June summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump.  Trump declared soon afterward that North Korea no longer posed a nuclear threat. Kim committed in a broad summit statement to work toward denuclearisation, but Pyongyang has offered no details as to how it might go about that and subsequent talks have not gone smoothly. It was not the first time U.S. intelligence clashed with the president\u0027s optimism.  In late June, U.S. officials told U.S. media outlets that intelligence agencies believed North Korea had increased production of fuel for nuclear weapons and that it did not intend to fully give up its nuclear arsenal. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week that North Korea was continuing to produce fuel for nuclear bombs despite its pledge to denuclearize. But he insisted the Trump administration was still making progress in its talks with Pyongyang.

Known as the \u0027Man of the Hole\u0027, he is the last known survivor of an indigenous tribe who were murdered by farmers 22 years ago. He is believed to have spent every year since having no contact to the outside world, surviving on pigs, birds, monkeys and plants of the jungle in Rondonia, Brazil. Believed to be between 55 and 60 years old, very little is known about the lonesome figure who is classed as \u0027uncontacted\u0027 - meaning he\u0027s never spoken to anyone from mainstream civilization.  They claim the tribesman is often found digging holes to trap animals and to hide in- giving him his nickname, \u0027the indigenous man in the hole\u0027 - with one He also makes all his own tools, including a wooden spear that he uses for hunting, seen in a picture below. Though his name, tribe and language remain a mystery, it\u0027s understood the man has been living alone for at least 22 years, after the other five remaining members of his tribe were purged by farmers in a \u0027genocidal attack\u0027, in 1996. While the authorities have no interaction with the man, they regularly carry out subtle checks to ensure he is still alive. Much of his time is dedicated to hunting meat and he also has a small plantation where he grows papaya and corn on his piece of land measuring around 8,070 hectares.  Footage was released earlier this month as proof the man still exists in a bid to protect his right to the local land - the second time ever he has been caught on film. He was seen wearing just a loin cloth while hacking at a tree with a homemade tool in the Tanaru indigenous territory.  Survival International advocacy director, Fiona Watson, believes the lone wanderer is a symbol for the importance of human diversity - a symbol that must be protected.  Fiona said: Piecing together information from neighbouring tribes, we believe he is the sole survivor of a wave of genocidal attacks. We believe most of his family were murdered by land-grabbers and ranchers who poured into part of the Amazon along a new highway thirst for land and profit, in the 1980s.  We don\u0027t know his name, the name of his tribe, what language he speaks - and in a way we don\u0027t need to. What\u0027s important is to respect his evident desire to be left alone, not be contacted and to protect his territory so he can live the rest of his life in peace. We know he hunts with bows and arrows and also digs 1.5-2m deep holes with wooden staves in the bottom to trap animals. Some politicians in the Amazon accuse FUNAI [The Brazillian Indigenous Affairs Department] of inventing uncontacted tribes in order to increase its budget and because they want to take over the land. [The footage is] important because his indigenous land rights can be recognised and territories protected.

From a player who hasn’t played for a year you can see he can get about the pitch and he’s only going to get better.“I’m quite excited about him and I’m pleased he got on the scoresheet.“That opened it up because Peterhead worked really hard to try and limit us chances.“We’ve been working on that actually over in Portugal, midfielders coming from deeper positions into that area and he finished it well, too.“It was a comfortable finish, he didn’t rush it, though he did with one later in the game.“The over-riding feeling is we’re quite pleased to come away with three points because we were quite disappointed on Sunday.”Dundee went on to seal the three points in stoppage time as another new face found the net as Jean Mendy made it two goals in three games.Neil added: “I was pleased, clearly Peterhead were going to make it difficult.“They dropped everyone right off the ball and sometimes had 11 players in the last 40 yards of the pitch. That denies us space and it was difficult.“However, I thought we were patient enough and scored two really good goals.“We created a lot.

The first is my collections of jewellery which I design and make to be distributed to the shops that stock my designs up and down the country.“The second is my bespoke pieces.“This is where someone comes in with a design in mind or with a piece they want to be remodelled.“With my bespoke designs it is much more fun as I can be a bit more creative.“It can be a big responsibility as a lot of the time someone is grieving over the loss of a loved one and they want a piece to remember them by or they want a piece of their loved one’s jewellery reworked.“You can’t change it back, so it can be quite nerve-racking.“I have also incorporated people ashes into designs, so it can be a very emotional journey with my customer.“It is lovely that I can really help customers after the passing of a loved one with a piece that is incredibly sentimental.“The third part is teaching.“I have held workshops since the beginning.

If we’d played 80 minutes we are the winners,” he said.“It sounds stupid but true. Against Arbroath, after 82 minutes if we put the ball out we keep one zero but we don’t and lose a goal.“In the next game (Ross County), for 80 minutes we made a good game and if we score from our penalty we win. We don’t score from the penalty, then they score and win but we had played a good game.“Then we controlled the game against Alloa but lost a goal, again in the last 10 minutes. So people say we are a bad team. We are not and not everything has been bad.”While he’s confident United will show that in the months ahead, Csaba doesn’t hide his frustration over being out of the Betfred.“We created pressure for the club, for the management, for the players and from the fans.“And we lost a lot of money, let’s be honest. So, I am really unhappy, but I can’t turn this back.“We have to do better. When we have 10 minutes to go and we are in the front, we have to win the game.”Any pressure the past three games has put on him does not, he’s stressed, match the pressure he puts on himself for every outing.“I always have pressure because when we lose I think why did we. For me, there is always the pressure that this is not OK. I think about it all the time and we have to find the solution tactically.”For the manager, that solution lies in getting the right mix between the passing style he prefers and a more direct Scottish approach.“Some people tell me I play too much continental football, we have to play Scottish football, kick the ball more off the front.“We’ll mix, keep the ball down and try to kick the long ball as well but just the long balls won’t be enough.“With Craig Curran injured we have had to use Paul McMullan as a No 9, up beside Nicky Clark sometimes.

She said: \"Everything for kids is so expensive nowadays, I thought we could have some good old fashioned fun on the beach and bring a few families together.\"The idea was for the kids to have an hour to make their sandcastles, they would all get stickers and we would get someone local to judge the best ones.\"She had thought that parents would simply mind their own children, but Highland Council told her she would have to provide formal first aid cover and explain fully how the event would impact other beach users.As Mrs Cowie-Mcinnes had advertised the event on social media and circulated flyers around the town, she was worried she might have to call the whole thing off: \"I was panicking when I got the email through, thinking I might need to cancel it and the kids were already excited.\"There is too much red tape and so many barriers to get through to run an event, people will end up giving up.\"Unsure of how to save the event, she took to the Nairn Rocks social media page to ask people for advice.And as a result, Fochabers firm Saltaire Security offered their services for free and provided a copy of their own public liability insurance certificate to Highland Council.There were also offers to provide lifeguard cover and Nairn Business Improvement District also came forward to say it would help.In the end, Highland Council agreed to waive permission fees.\"It couldn\u0026rsquot have gone ahead without the security company and everyone else who is helping for free,\" said Mrs Cowie-Mcinnes, who has also been delighted at the offers of prizes from local businesses.Weather permitting, the event will now go ahead on Sunday with registration taking place from 10am at Nairn Links for categories ranging from pre-school through to teenagers and

community","story":"\u0026nbspTHE length of time being taken to start work on the fire-ravaged former Eastgate Hostel in Inverness city centre is \"unacceptable\", a senior Highland Council official has admitted.Public anger over a lack of visible action at the site \u0026ndash which went up in flames in April 2013 \u0026ndash has been growing as assurances of forward movement repeatedly come to nothing.Most recently it was suggested that the scaffolding could be down by June after a planning application was lodged to demolish the remaining structure and rebuild.This was scuppered when Highland Council\u0027 conservation and building officer objected that, at one storey lower than the original, the proposed rebuild would not \"preserve or enhance the character and appearance\" of a designated conservation area.Historic Environment Scotland also voiced disquiet, sending the building\u0027 owners back to the drawing board.Now Inverness city manager David Haas \u0026ndash who has generally sought to paint the protracted discussions over the building in the most positive light \u0026ndash appears to have fully acknowledged the depth of dissatisfaction as the city finds itself in the midst of a sixth tourist season with the unsightly ruin still in place.\"We know it is taking far too long and that it is an unacceptable length of time,\" he said after the Inverness Courier again sought answers over progress.\"It is not moving as fast as we would like.\"It is frustrating but we want to make sure we get it right and we want to make sure it happens.\"We respect the fact the owners have to make the right decision for their own interest but we have to make sure we represent the public interest and that it is protected as far as the law will allow us to do that.\"Agent for the site owners, Gary Johnston, said they would not comment at this time.The last public announcement made by two of them \u0026ndash Mr Ali and Mr Cheng \u0026ndash came in a statement last month where they claimed \"a new way forward\" was being investigated, but would not elaborate on what that entailed.No more details were forthcoming when the Courier contacted Mr Johnston more recently.Pat Hayden, chairwoman of Crown and City Centre Community Council, said she is glad Mr Haas has finally admitted the situation is \"unacceptable\", believing the community is \"being made a fool of\" over the whole saga.\"It has been for a long time and we have the right as a community to ask for an update and to get one,\" she said.\"The whole thing has been kept very hush-hush and there has to be something wrong for it to have taken five years \u0026ndash there is a bad smell about the whole thing.\"Talking about the impact of so prominent a building sitting untended for so long she said: \"It

disgrace\", and repeated his previous calls for the council to compulsorily purchase the building.\"It has been \u0026lsquounacceptable\u0026rsquo since day one,\" he said.\"Mr Haas has been trying to keep everyone happy and now no-one is happy.\"Mr Haas insisted a lot of work is continuing \"behind the scenes\", including council officers working with the owners to provide the appropriate information to enable planning officials to provide, in return, the right advice regarding the outstanding planning application.\"We need facts and once we have the facts we can move forward,\" he

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live.

Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sun sweat and stunts at the mayds sports day","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 07/07/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The Mid Argyll Youth Development Services (MAYDS) Sports Day Not on the Green kicked off on Friday June 29 to sun and sports.The sun didn’t deter the many athletes filling the fields at Lochgilphead joint campus, with rugby, football and golf just a few of the many activities enjoyed.The annual sporting event celebrated their anniversary 10 years of healthy attitude and fun with a portable skate park set up in the car park and even Wonder Woman stuntman, Dom Kinnaird, demonstrating moves for taking down bad guys.With the help of the Year of Young People National Lottery Fund, the event was organised by MAYDS themselves and featured music and stalls with temporary tattoos, face painting, hot dogs and ice cream, with swimming also held at the MACPool.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/07/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe pages of the July 6 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser contain too many stories of sadness and pain.

It was difficult to hold the bottom at times, however, we managed to hook into dab, plaice, grey gurnard, haddock and a good haul of thornback rays to bring our species tally for the day to five.All in all a decent day’s fishing given the rough conditions. We returned to harbour a tad battered and soaking wet.Day two was almost as windy as the first day, however the rain kept away which was a bonus.Conditions were still far too rough for fishing the deep so we started off on the soft ground for flats but the spurdogs had other ideas. Everywhere we went \u0026#8211 singles, doubles, trebles \u0026#8211 there was just no getting away from them despite Robbie’s best efforts.I have never seen so many chunky spurs, with the best of the day tipping the scales at 14lbs 8oz.Needless to say a fair number of rigs were wrecked, leads snagged and lost on the rough ground, and quite a few fish dropped. On the plus side there were a few PBs and a couple of new club records set.In between the spur attacks, we picked up a few decent dab, plaice, cod, grey gurnard, red gurnard and coalfish (coalies) to take our species count for the day to eight.Despite the rough and tumble we enjoyed the trip and the opportunity to catch some decent fish. Hopefully the weather will be kinder next year and we’ll get to drop a line out in the deep water marks which hold so many more species.The combined scores over two days:Nikki Thompson 185%***********************It was no surprise to find ourselves fishing in the pouring rain yet again. We don’t seem to have much luck weatherwise, but at least it was relatively calm out of Oban with only the slightest breeze.We headed out on board the ‘Laura Dawn’ in search of fresh bait but despite several drifts the mackerel eluded us.With the big tides, skipper Ronnie suggested we fish the rough ground and reefs for pollack and coalies. The plan was to play around here until the tide eased off enough to drop the anchor.It was pretty desperate though with only a few miniscule whiting to show for our efforts. The incredibly rough ground and fast drift were challenging to say the least and most of us left a fair amount of tackle and lead stuck fast to the seabed.Enough was enough, so we decided to head for deeper water and anchor up even though the tide was still pretty strong, resulting in some horrendous tangles.It proved to be a sensible move from a fishing point of view though, with reasonable sized spurs hooked on the very first drop. More spurs, spotty dogs and a couple of bonus thornbacks were taken throughout the afternoon.It was nip and tuck right to the end with just one fish separating the top three placing.Final scores:\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert golf club is looking for players","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 12:32 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSort that swing because Tarbert Golf Club is holding its James Mundell Memorial gents open.On Sunday August 5 players will compete at Glenralloch for various gross and net prizes between £20 and £60 and, of course, for the coveted James Mundell Memorial trophy.So book your place for a chance to win.Tee off times are 7.50am to 9.10am, 10.45am to 12.05pm or 1.40pm to 2.50pm.To book, call 01880 820565 and entry fees are £15.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"teenie takes the title in myargyll","story":"\t\tSandy NeilUpdated: 31/07/18, 7:36 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA competition capturing #myargyll has been won by Teenie Wilson, an amateur photographer on the Isle of Lismore, who took this stunning image before an evening’s fishing at Port Ramsay, as the sun set over Glensanda quarry in Morvern.The competition, run in in association with Wyvex Media and Argyll and the Isles Tourism Co-operative, sought to recognise why you think our region is such a fantastic place to live, work and visit through photography, video and prose.Teenie, who runs the Lismore Post office and shop with her husband David, took up the hobby, which they share, two years ago.‘I love it,’ she said: ‘It gets me out. I take the camera wherever I go. I always keep my eye open for the right shot. With a good camera you can’t go wrong.’One summer evening last year, Teenie said their neighbour Duncan Black, a retired seaman, had asked if she wanted to go fishing. ‘I was waiting for him to bring the boat in,’ she recalled. ‘I thought it would make a great shot. We caught 40 fish that night.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 3","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/07/18, 6:22 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Robin Morton provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features a popular subject \u0026#8211 the Paps of Jura.

NHS Ayrshire \u0026amp Arran this week appealed for drivers to help to keep the grounds as safe as possible for patients, visitors and staff. The car parks at University Hospitals Ayr and Crosshouse have designated short and long stay areas which are clearly signposted. The short stay car parks have a time limit of three hours and the long stay car parks are for people who need to park for longer than three hours. When the car parking scheme was first implemented, there was a significant improvement in parking behaviours. However, this has not continued. John Wright, director for corporate support services, said: “Over the past few years we have carried out surveys and audits of the car parks at University Hospitals Ayr and Crosshouse and created more than 400 new spaces across both sites. However, we have now reached the limit of the number of new car parking spaces we can build. We are, therefore, asking for help from members of the public. “We need to make sure that we all play our part in parking appropriately and safely in all of our car parks across all of our sites.

A probe also uncovered suspected blood contamination on the shoes of staff at Crosshouse Hospital. The shock investigation, carried out by Healthcare Improvement Scotland in May, included A and E, the maternity inpatient ward and theatre department, and the medical high dependency unit. Examiners said they “observed good compliance with hand hygiene”. “This included medical, nursing and domestic staff,” they added. But the report said that maternity theatre staff “appeared confused” about infection prevention and control audits, which was raised with senior managers. Concerns were also raised regarding suspected blood found on staff’s shoes and contaminated equipment in the maternity theatre and changing rooms. It comes just 12 months after a government-commissioned report into the “unnecessary” deaths of six babies at the hospital which criticised staff shortages. The latest hygiene report stated: “We were told it is the responsibility of each member of staff to clean these, however, it was recognised this had been difficult to implement with some staff groups. “In the maternity theatres, two positional pieces were heavily contaminated on the inside covers. “This equipment is used to provide support and stability to patients during their procedures. “We were told these were removed immediately and replacements were ordered.” Inspectors said they were aware of “good segregation of domestic and clinical waste”. But their report added: “In the maternity theatres, clinical waste was not stored locked awaiting uplift. “We also identified a similar issue in the wards. This could allow unauthorised access to clinical waste.” Alastair Delaney, from Healthcare Improvement Scotland said: “A good standard of cleaning was found generally and it was noted that considerable improvements have been made to cleanliness of equipment in the emergency department since our last inspection. “However, to improve care, NHS Ayrshire and Arran should ensure theatre departments are maintained so they can be effectively cleaned to provide a safe environment for patients.” Hazel Borland, nurse director for the health board, said: “We fully accept these findings. “The HEI inspection was valuable in helping us identify areas where we need to improve and our staff found the visit to be informative and useful. “We are pleased the inspection team observed that there is a good standard of cleaning and cleanliness generally. “We have an action plan in place to ensure the requirements and recommendations highlighted are addressed and we will ensure we continue to provide high standards of care and hygiene throughout our healthcare settings.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnCrosshouse HospitalAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"kilmarnock man who lifelong alcohol","story":"NewsKilmarnock man who has had lifelong alcohol struggle shares heartbreaking story and says: \"I don\u0027t want my grandson seeing me drunk every day\"At his worst Andrew from Kilmarnock could drink a bottle of vodka per day, on top of 10 or 15 pints of beer.Share\u0026nbspByDavid Wren12:25, 27 JUL 2018NewsAndrew has struggled with drink his whole life (picture posed by model)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email“I’ve got a daughter and a grandson, I don’t want them seeing me drunk everyday,” says Andrew, who has struggled with alcohol for most of his adult life. At his worst, the 59-year-old from Kilmarnock – who has asked for his surname to be withheld – could drink a bottle of vodka per day, on top of 10 or 15 pints of beer. His situation was desperate, with the alcohol numbing the pain of crippling mental health issues he has suffered from for years. Andrew spoke out after it was revealed in last week’s Kilmarnock Standard that there were 48 alcohol-related deaths at Crosshouse Hospitalin 2017/18, an increase from 38 in the previous year. Illnesses and injuries related to alcohol which have been treated at the facility have also gone up, with NHS Ayrshire and Arran aiming to tackle the problem.  Andrew said: “I’ve been drinking repeatedly for 25 years. I used to drink a litre of vodka a day and roughly four litres per week. “I’d maybe have 10 or 15 pints of beer a day as well. I sought help from various organisations which didn’t help. “I’ve been struggling with my mental health over the years too. The main reason I’ve been hitting the drink is because of my mental health and I can’t get any help.” His battles with drink and mental health have led Andrew to dark places and he has attempted suicide twice. A chaotic lifestyle where he has had brushes with the law over the years also played a part in his mindset, as well as an incident in his late teens where a gun was put to his head. The terrifying ordeal, Andrew says, “wasted my head” and he continues to have flashbacks. It started off his spiralling issues with anxiety and depression which have plagued his life and repeatedly led him back to alcohol. After one suicide attempt, Andrew said that he was told to quit his vodka habit and did so overnight. But the consequences of going cold turkey led to a mild stroke the following day. Battles with his health have continued over the years, meaning he is now on 17 tablets a day just to help his body function. Andrew doesn’t consider himself an alcoholic, but admits he has struggled with drink for most of his life. He also claims that he’s struggled to access help for his mental health issues. He said: “I’ve been to various organisations and they hunt me. “They take the name and address, say they’ll contact you – then nothing.  “So I go to drink and that solves the mental health problems. “But it actually triggers it. Sometimes it eases me and it’s a bit back to front. “These mental health organisations have no money, no funds and the NHS is in a terrible state. “The only people I can rely on are the Ayrshire Council on Alcohol down in Ayr. “I’m not an alcoholic, I’ve just got a problem with drink. “I don’t like being called an alcoholic, I’m just a normal guy that needs help.” The Ayrshire Council on Alcohol have helped him work on his problem with drink. Although on a long road to recovery, Andrew’s drinking has decreased. But, even though the alcohol counselling helps, he admits he’s desperate to tackle his mental health issues. He said: “I’m down to drinking four days a week now, before I would have been seven. The ACA have helped me, I would recommend them to anybody. “They explain the circumstances and give you a target to achieve over a period. They don’t want you to come off of it straight away. “It maybe goes from seven days to five and so on.” He continued: “In a day I’ll maybe drink 15 pints. That used to be every day but now I’ve cut it down to four. “It’s a lot of beer. It’s very hard to say the effect the alcohol has on me. “My main issue is the mental health, the anxiety and depression, my head’s wasted.” Having been in the habit of drinking every day for so long, Andrew removes himself from the dangers of binging when his days away from alcohol come around.   He goes on day trips across Ayrshire to keep him away from the lure of  the pub, which Andrew admits he would struggle to resist if he was just hanging around Kilmarnock town centre.  Although he lives himself, Andrew says he doesn’t drink in the house and bottles of booze stay untouched in his home. The social aspect of the pub, he says, is the lure for him as he seeks the company it brings. Andrew believes he can quit drink – but admits his mental health constantly brings him back to square one as he looks for a life away from alcohol. He says the ACA is saving his life with their support and he hopes continued work with the organisation can help him to live a healthy life. “At times I was just desperate, thinking ‘why live?’” said Andrew. “But I’ve got a grandson now, a daughter, so it gives me something to look forward to in the future. “Hopefully one day I can come off the drink. “Never say never – it’s my ambition.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrKilmarnockAlcoholCrosshouse"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"mayboles christmas celebrations in jeopardy","story":"NewsMaybole\u0027s Christmas celebrations in jeopardyThe community association organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day.Share\u0026nbspByAyrshire Post11:18, 25 JUL 2018NewsMaybole Christmas lights switch on (Image: David Kiltie)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe town’s Christmas celebrations will be in the ice box this year after a community group agreed to freeze itself for six months. Maybole Community Association will not meet again until January, by which time the festive fun will be over. The group organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day. But members could not form a committee at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM). A statement issued after the meeting states: “Following the EGM held by Maybole Community Association on Thursday, July 12, 2018, regrettably no one came forward at the meeting prepared to be an office bearer, knowing that the present committee were standing down. “The decision was therefore made at the meeting for all activities of the association to be frozen and put on hold for a minimum period of six months and a maximum of 12 months and will be reviewed again at that time. “No business will be conducted during that timescale. This decision means that there will be no Christmas lights switch-on and potentially no gala next year.” Outgoing chairperson Senga Mason had been in her role for three years and took over after a similar committee crisis.  She said: “People didn’t come forward for the main committee roles and there’s far greater pressures on people’s time now than there was 40 years ago.” Mrs Mason’s connection to the group, founded in 1975, goes back to 1978. Maybole Gala Days in days gone by featured lorry floats and impressive bunting displays across the High Street. But Mrs Mason pointed out: “Health and safety rules meant the end of using lorries, which in any case are normally needed 24/7 by operators. “Even for simple things like bunting you need permits and a cherry picker to put it up. “Rules are in place for a reason and we have to abide by them.” Community association members are also upset at what they saw as unfair criticisms made on social media following this year’s Maybole Gala Day on June 9. A switch-on ceremony in Maybole can only now be saved if another group of volunteers steps forward. If the community association decides to wind up in January its assets - cash, tables, chairs and gazebos - would be dispersed to other groups in the town.

And reader Brian Cassells snapped this image of the creature from the deep. “I’d never seen anything like it before,” said Brian, who was out walking with wife Julie and their two small pet dogs. “At first I thought it must be part of a fishing net, or some kind of rope from a boat. “But then, looking closer at it, it was more like a giant version of those little bones you see when you open a tin of salmon.” Aircraft mechanic Brian, 55, also noted what looked like the remains of a large fin on the sea monster. The carcass was in the water when he first spotted it. But he got a better look on a return walk, two days later. “It had started to break up a bit,” said Brian. “But I got a chance to pace out a rough measurement on dry land.  “And I reckon it was at least 20 feet long.” The Post passed on Brian’s pictures to Girvan-based David Bova, a retired Marine Scotland scientist. David, 61, said: “The images suggest the remains of a basking shark. “Shark skeletons are cartilage rather than bone, and this looks to be the case here.” David explained that basking sharks tend to be seasonal visitors to the Firth of Clyde, feeding on plankton bloom. The gentle giants can grow to over 30ft long, and weigh several tons. “I haven’t seen one so far this summer,” said David, who is regularly out on the waters around Ailsa Craig. Brian was interested to hear David’s opinion, and agrees with his view that the skeleton was more like cartilage than bone. “We kept Daisy (Bichon Frise) and Millie (Cavachon) well away anyway!” he joked.

And United proved that underdogs can upset the odds by finishing sixth and leaving Aberdeen, Dundee United, Dundee and St Johnstone in their wake. It was a stunning effort but McSherry, who was signed by Ally MacLeod on a free from Kilmarnock, reckons Ayr can once again confound the pundits and enjoy a great season. United kick off the league at home to Partick Thistle on August 4 and midfielder turned publican McSherry expects them to be up for the challenge. He said: “Consolidation should be the aim but there is no reason why Ayr can’t rise again and enjoy the good times that we enjoyed in the 70s.” An old team picture that surfaced in McSherry’s Wee Windaes got punters rewinding the years and reliving past glories. It was taken at the start of season 1975-76 and showed Ayr in their change kit of Barcelona strips. Proudly standing tall are, back row – Davie Wells, Alex McAnespie, Ally MacLean, Hugh Sproat, Rikki Fleming, John Murphy. Middle row – Alex Ingram, Gerry Phillips, Johnny Graham, Johnny Doyle, Hugh Cameron, Jim McSherry. Front row – John Dickson, Danny MacDonald, Davie McCulloch.   Jim recalled: “No one could work out why the team weren’t in their usual black and white if it was an official  team picture.  “We were also puzzled why there were 15 players in it, including two goalkeepers. “Then one of my regulars, Stephen Robb, came up with the answer – it was taken before a pre-season friendly.  “We wore it in a 7-2 defeat at home to Celtic and it was never seen  again. I think it was binned as a bad omen.  “These were good times at Ayr and the team was loaded with some great players. “We were the only part-time team in the Top Ten and were quoted at 66/1, which seemed about right given the teams we were up against. “I remember Ally signing me on the wall at Central Station and then telling me to look out my passport. “He told me ‘You’re going on tour to Canada next week’. It was quite a start to my Ayr career.” Only three months into that season, Ally was lured to Aberdeen and replaced at the helm by Alex Stuart who quickly appointed McSherry as captain. Ayr sealed safety with a last-day 2-1 win over Motherwell, who were bossed by Willie McLean and Craig Brown. Gerry Phillips got a dramatic late winner to spark euphoric scenes at a packed Somerset. The second season of top-flight football saw Ayr again more than hold their own.  They finished eighth in the table on 30 points, three ahead of Hearts and a distant 13 more than rock-bottom  rivals Kilmarnock.  Season 1977-78 marked Ayr’s third campaign in the top flight, a remarkable achievement considering they stayed part-time. Robert Connor, Ian McAllister, Derek McCutcheon and Iain Sim were called up from Ayr United Boys’ Club. But Ayr were always up against it and their life in the Premier League ended when they finished second-bottom on 24 points and were relegated along with Clydebank. Now as a new league season beckons with renewed optimism and a totally full-time structure, it’s time to dream again.

Ayr United head to Firhill to take on Partick Thistle today knowing that a win will be enough to top the group and put them into the hat for the knockout stages. The Honest Men beat Morton 3-1 in their first group game before beating Albion 2-0 on Saturday. McCall’s side then hammered Stenhousemuir 5-0 at Somerset Park on Tuesday. And McCall, who will head to his old stomping ground on Saturday, said: “It’s a good game against a team in the same league as us. “They are fancied to be challenging for the league title, so it will be a good gauge for us to see where we are at. “I don’t think the game will have any similarities to the league opener though, but if there is a place up for grabs in the last 16 then we are going to go for it.” The Betfred Cup format has come under scrutiny from a number of players and managers involved in the game.  But McCall has gone against the grain and offered his support for the group stage style. He said: “I think it’s good and I like it. “I like the games that actually mean something, rather than meaningless friendlies which I hate. “With this format it means you only need three pre season friendlies. “And we have done well in the opening couple of games so that momentum will hopefully stick with us going into the league campaign.” Ross Docherty has been back in full training for the past week, with Chris Higgins set to join back up with the squad next week. •The Ayr United open day will take place this Sunday from 12pm. Fans are welcome to join the party at Somerset where they can meet their heroes amidst a whole host of fun events. The players and managers will be there along with a Stagedoor BBQ, Mancini’s ice cream and a kids v adults match to soak in, plus plenty of more fun activities.

faced a real pre-season test against the well-drilled, energetic and highly skilledPollock U19s.The visiting team had enough potential to produce players for the higher echelons of the game in the not too distant future.Coached by our Campbeltown\u0026#8217s Stuart Crossan, the Glasgow side impressed with their quick possession football and a willingness to close space, during a frantic opening quarter of a highly entertaining match, at the wonderfully prepared Kintyre Park.The visitors immediately seized the initiative using the ball effortlessly as they imposed their own brand of football across the full width of the park.The Campbeltown favourites were in no mood to play second fiddle and, after adjusting to Pollock’s enthusiastic start, the Pupils created a number of opportunities as Souden and Barr tested the defence down the flanks.The Pupils midfield and central defence dug deep to rest the initiative from their stubborn opponents, but gradually the pendulum swung as the home side played their way into the match.It was a fascinating encounter between two well-matched sides, a game enjoyed by what was a sizable crowd for a friendly fixture.The partisan home support were soon on song when the mercurial Sary Rhama broke free behind Pollock\u0026#8217s defence, a fleeting glimpse of goal before he was unceremoniously brought down from behind.Taking the penalty kick himself, the Pupil’s striker drove the ball straight down the middle to give the home side a slender advantage with 29 minutes on the clock.The pace was unrelenting, and the visitors were rewarded when the Pupils failed to clear their lines from a corner.In the ensuing play, the ball was skilfully carried to the touchline, before an accurate cutback found the incoming forward who drove the ball home at the second attempt beyond Ferguson.One each at half-time was a fair reflection, with neither side gaining the ascendancy.Both sides made a raft of changes in the second period.Pupils ‘blooded’ seven graduates from the under-16s eleven during the game.Pick of the day was an acrobatic scissors clearance from young Ross Brown,  saving the situation with a last ditch goal line clearance.Shortly after, the home side raced up-field to claim victory with a fine goal from player of the match, Ryan McConnachie.Instrumental in both defence and attack, Ryan controlled the ball expertly in the box, deftly shifted its position, before stroking the ‘leather’ beyond a stranded goalkeeper for a brilliant winning goal.A top drawer finish if there ever was one!Tomorrow Campbeltown Pupils bring top quality opposition to Kintyre Park in the shape of Bridgewater, last season’s Scottish amateur cup semi- finalists.A tough match is in the offing, as Bridgewater  lost narrowly by 1-0 to the brilliant

The Bustler was called in to coordinate 17 other tugs in a successful action to re-float her.The outcome was to try to find more of the human side of the life and times of Bustler and its crew, especially as we knew that many of its 45 crew were Campbeltown and Kintyre natives.The objective I had in mind is a shorter document that might be of considerable interest to visitors and readers of the Courier.During the months since our visit, I have gathered a wealth of material from RN service records, family photos, official books, The Campbeltown Book, newsletters and my father’s curriculum vitae.I have also found that another Bustler model is on show in the National Museum in Edinburgh.Most of my father’s papers are with family in Australia. He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action. I have donated a copy of the book to the museum and Elaine has placed it beside the model.I think there should, be a much bigger project to tell this story.My sister and I have many happy childhood memories of Bustler, and have even sailed on her but there are gaps as we were children at the time.We were shielded from the dangers my father faced and, of course, he was unable to tell us where he was going.Another of our difficulties is that having left school and Campbeltown in 1953, we also lost touch with Kintyre people.We are interested in any written experiences, or details of any surviving sailors.Donald Leckie,North Berwick.donaldleckie7@gmailHMRT Bustler in Campbeltown museum.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.

The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history.

Mrs Reid, known as Kit, told how she exchanged early memories of her nursing career and the transition into the NHS with the royal guest.

The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.

Helen said that Wee Scones would remain open under its current name to continue operations with a view to changing its name to \u0026lsquoABC Nursery, Haddington Road\u0026rsquo, in the future.

The ABC management team are working closely with the current Wee Scones staff, with special thanks to Candy for all her assistance, to provide continuity of care and education within the setting.  \u0026ldquoEveryone at ABC is looking forward to working in partnership with all the service users and developing the service provided.  Wee Scones told its parents it was closing last month due to \u0026ldquounforeseen and personal family circumstances.  The move was greeted with concern from councillors, who shared parents\u0026rsquo fears over the future of the service for families using Wee Scones, which provided nursery places for 45 children.  The nursery will now be run by Jacqueline Robertson, who has operated childminding service Precious Memories in Tranent for seven years.  Jacqueline announced plans to close Precious Memories last Friday as she confirmed she would be taking on the manager role at Wee Scones.

The crew chose East Lothian due to its great surfing beaches and its film charter \u0026ndash an agreement between council departments to work together to accommodate film requests in the East Lothian area wherever possible.

The park, which is home to various football teams, has been the victim of numerous attacks but the latest, earlier this month, led to calls on social media for security to be tightened up there.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.

The soaring temperatures seen across the UK, Ireland and Europe over the past two months have caused a headache for travel firms and airlines, with low cost airline easyJet also warning earlier this month that late bookings might be impacted.  It is a particular blow for Thomas Cook, given that it makes all of its annual profits in the summer months.  The downgrade comes as Thomas Cook is reportedly looking to spin off its airline arm and sell a stake to an outside investor to slash debts.  Third-quarter figures for the travel group showed\u0026nbspgross profit fell 3% to \u0026pound443 million in the three months to June 30, while underlying earnings rose 8% to \u0026pound14 million.

Thomas Cook said group tour operator summer 2018 bookings were flat, while they rose 1% in the UK.  It said UK package holiday prices were 7% higher as it sought to offset surging hotel inflation in the Spanish market.  The Thomas Cook airline business saw a 15% rise in bookings, with demand for short-haul offsetting a decline in long-haul flight bookings.

Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u0026ldquoLike Shell, BP is back to something that might almost be considered normal.  \u0026ldquoCash generation is slightly lower than analysts had hoped for, and is being propped up by asset sales to some degree, but has still proven enough to fund necessary capital investment and increase the dividend.  \u0026ldquoWith payments relating to the Deepwater Horizon disaster falling and oil prices bouncing, the future looks brighter for BP than it has for some time."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7579466.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glasgow-2018-athletes-arrive-for-european-championships","story":"  Athletes from Germany, Finland, France and other European countries were among the first to arrive at Glasgow International Airport.

John Buchan Hepburn from Lord Louis Mountbatten.  Buchan Hepburn owned a rubber plantation in Atale, Ceylon which was located near Mountbatten\u0026rsquos headquarters in Kandy. Whilst in Kandy, Buchan Hepburn met Mountbatten and offered his estate as a humble retreat if needed.  Their friendship began to blossom, they would spend time relaxing whilst Buchan Hepburn\u0026rsquos children were at school, discussing the history of India and Ceylon.  On Mountbatten\u0026rsquos final stay at the Estate, he gifted Buchan Hepburn his own union flag as a generous thank you and farewell.

He was a member of one of Scotland\u0026rsquos oldest military families with a pedigree reaching back to the early 17th century.  Like many well-heeled young Scots of the era, the 18-year-old was keen to join the fight against the Kaiser.  He immediately helped to raise a regiment of plantation workers and the Ceylon Planters Rifle Corps was duly formed. Buchan-Hepburn was delighted to accept a commission.  With fronts opening up in the Mediterranean area, the regiment was seconded to the Australian army. After training in Egypt, the Ceylon Rifles were despatched to fight the Turks in the Dardanelles, along with other Anzac regiments.  In 1916, the Rifles were part of the unsuccessful Anzac force which went ashore at Gallipoli but were forced to retreat after a bitter campaign by a well-armed, well-drilled Turkish army.  After sustaining heavy losses, the Anzacs withdrew aboard a fleet of troop transporters.  But as the boats pulled away from the beach, a senior officer noticed that the two Union Jacks had been left flying in a forward trench headquarters position.  Shrugging the wound off, however, he wrapped and tied both flags around his body before setting off back down the beach. He reached the waterline without further injury but was shot again as he swam out to sea.

But his ordeal was far from as he was transferred to a hospital ship because of his injuries still clutching the Union Jacks.  On arrival, he was asked if he would like to be bedded down on the top deck or down below because the vessel was very crowded.  While he was settling down on the top deck, the ship was passing out of the Straits of Dardanelle into the Mediterranean Sea, bound for Malta.  Before long it was torpedoed by a German submarine. With the ship sinking and listing on his side of the deck, Buchan-Hepburn, wrapped once again in the two flags, chose his precise moment to jump into the sea.  He swam out to a piece of wreckage and clung on until picked up by a British destroyer which had answered emergency calls. With other Australian wounded he was taken on to Malta.  As he recovered, two generals paid a visit to the ranks of wounded men.  Buchan-Hepburn later went on to serve in some of the harshest battles of the war at the Somme and at Ypres, where he was badly gassed.  At the end of the war he returned to Scotland bringing the precious flags with him to the family home in St Andrews.

When the politician suggested waiting until an equality impact assessment and consultation could be carried out, Mr Soames said he would \u0026ldquoconsider it.  Mr Sweeney said: \u0026ldquoMr Soames told me that the vast majority of these cases involve single males, but I pointed out that there may be unknown issues involving these men \u0026ndash for example, they may well have underlying mental health problems.\u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoI suggested that an equality impact assessment should be carried out and that a full consultation should take place and he said he welcomed the suggestion.

Mitch Hunter-Scullion, 23, is seeking \u0026pound2.3 million to build a satellite capable of identifying platinum metal deposits on near-Earth asteroids.  And although it may seem like the science of the future, asteroid mining is expected to become big business as the celestial bodies are believed to be full of precious metals and minerals.  Nasa estimates the total value of resources locked in asteroids is equivalent to $100 billion (\u0026pound75 billion) for each person on Earth.  The Asteroid Mining Corporation headed by Mr\u0026nbspHunter-Scullion has become the first company in the country to join the industry of the future.    He has a plan of action that could see mining start in ten years time.  But first space entrepreneur\u0026nbsphas to launch the UK\u0027s first asteroid mining mission and is seeking \u0026pound2.3m to build a satellite capable of identifying platinum-group metal deposits on near-Earth asteroids.  The Liverpool Hope University student hopes to launch the Asteroid Prospecting Satellite One (APS1) in 2020 from India to conduct a spectral scan and determine if there are \"viable candidates\" for mining.  He calculates that a single metallic asteroid of 25 metres in diameter, contains approximately 29 tonnes of platinum worth around \u0026pound725m.  \"Yes, I think it feasible,\" he said. \u0026ldquoOur goal is to develop ground breaking technology that will eventually enable the extraction, processing and use of materials derived from the many millions of asteroids known to exist near Earth.    \"The APS1 will be our first step to achieving this success. The APS1 will be a spectroscope space telescope which will gather data on target asteroids and will act as a test for some of our technologies which we will scale up later for actual mining missions.  \"Our crowdfunding campaign to help us finance the cost of the APS1 is now up and running and we\u0026rsquore confident we can attract sufficient investment.\"  Mr Hunter-Scullion who set up AMC after completing my dissertation at Liverpool Hope University on asteroid mining added: \"Whilst researching for it I realised that there were few companies that have been set up with the intentions of mining an asteroid, with none being in the UK.    \"It was a topic that fascinated me and when I finished university I decided to set up AMC and begin working on developing technology which will open up the possibilities of an off-Earth commercial market.  With no previous business experience, Mr Hunter-Scullion received support from Business Gateway Glasgow and is now working working to allow the mining to be done legally, He is working with the International Institute of Air and Space Law at Leiden University in the Netherlands to draft a proposal for a UK Space Resources Activities Bill.  The company believe this legislation is vital to the development of the space mining industry within the UK as it allows British based companies the rights to prospect for and extract mineral resources from asteroids, the moon and other celestial bodies.  Mr Hunter Scullion is not alone in recognising the potential of asteroids.  The first asteroid company, Planetary Resources, was founded in 2012 by Diamandis, Chris Lewicki and others in Washington, USA. Within a year the US company Deep Space Industries was set up by Rick Tumlinson, Stephen Cover and a host of others.  Bankers from Goldman Sachs also hope to build an \u0027asteroid-grabbing spacecraft\u0027 to make billions from mining space metals.  A 98-page report from the banking investment company claimed last year that mining asteroids for precious metals in the near future is a \u0027realistic\u0027 goal.  \"Prospecting probes can likely be built for tens of millions of dollars each and Caltech [California Institute of Technology] has suggested an asteroid-grabbing spacecraft could cost $2.6bn,\" the report said.  No asteroid has yet been directly sampled, but Nasa aims to change that with its plans to send a probe to the mineral-rich asteroid 16 Psyche.  16 Psyche is located in the large asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, is one of the most mysterious objects in the solar system, and could be worth a small fortune.  It is seen as a 130 mile-wide lump of metal, made up of iron, nickel and rare metals, including gold, platinum and copper.  Nasa announced in January 2017 that it intended to send a probe to the asteroid to sample its chemical make-up in 2022.  It was calculated that the iron in 16 Psyche alone, would be worth \u0026pound8,072 quadrillion."},{"url":null,"title":"andrew-mckie-a-second-eu-referendum-would-be-both-pointless-and-damaging","story":"  It may be less contentious to skip to a later bit in the poem, where he claims: \u0026ldquoBut the answer / Is hard and hard to remember.  All the same, I dimly recall that the answer to the question of whether the UK should leave or remain in the EU was \u0026ldquoLeave, something we haven\u0026rsquot yet done. It might then seem surprising that a lot of people (50 per cent, to be precise) would now, according to a new Sky Data poll, like a referendum on \u0026ldquothe deal the Government suggests, no deal or staying in the EU.  But it\u0026rsquos not the most surprising finding. Nor is the very slight majority (51 per cent) who now think Brexit will be bad for the country overall.  The astonishing finding is that 10 per cent of respondents to the poll think that the Government is doing a good job in the negotiations and a mere 78 per cent think that Theresa May is making the biggest meal of it in the history of dogs or dinners.  The fact that the latter figure is not 100 per cent is almost enough to make anyone, Leaver or Remainer, doubt the wisdom of ever asking the people anything in any kind of poll or referendum.  There are other reasons, however, for not wanting what its advocates like to call a \u0026ldquoPeople\u0026rsquos Vote \u0026ndash which raises the question of who cast 33,577,342 votes just 25 months ago if it wasn\u0026rsquot people.  The first reason is just that. Why heed anyone who wants a second vote if, by the very fact of calling for one, they dismiss the answer the public has already given? It\u0026rsquos not as if the referendum has been implemented and, some way down the line, having changed their minds, people want another one. It took the UK more than 40 years to do that the last time, after all.  This is more like the tactic the EU has previously used when it doesn\u0026rsquot like the result of a vote and \u0026ndash as happened in Denmark over the Maastricht Treaty and (twice) in Ireland, over the Treaties of Nice and then Lisbon \u0026ndash has another to get the correct answer. I had thought it had given that up in 2011, it just imposed a new government in Italy, and in Greece in 2015 it ignored the vote altogether. But apparently people such as Lord Mandelson, a former EU commissioner, think it\u0026rsquos worth reviving the technique.  He\u0026rsquos wrong not just because of the principle, but the practicalities of attempting a blatant wrecking tactic. The Remain camp seem not to have considered that a rerun of the vote cannot, in any circumstances, produce a good outcome.  A binary Leave/Remain question might \u0026ndash indeed, such would be the resentment among many voters at another referendum, probably would \u0026ndash produce the same result. Which would improve matters not one bit.  Or it might, almost certainly by an incredibly narrow margin, reverse the original vote. You\u0026rsquod then have two incompatible results of equal democratic value, and a recipe for fury amongst half the population who would feel (entirely justifiably) that they had been betrayed.  Of course, lots of Remainers are furious, but thems the breaks when you lose. No doubt, had the vote gone the other way and the EU was now planning some scheme which the Remain campaign assured us it wasn\u0026rsquot planning, such as the EU defence integration Jean-Claude Juncker is in fact planning, Nigel Farage would be jumping up and down asking for another referendum. But most sane people wouldn\u0026rsquot.  The impossibility of getting a better answer is one practical objection to a straight rerun. The only binary option that makes any sense at all is the Government deal versus World Trade Organisation terms.  There are even greater practical difficulties with the suggestion, originally from the former Conservative minister and Remain campaigner Justine Greening, of a vote on three options: whatever plan the Government and the EU eventually agree (if they do), a no- deal Brexit on WTO terms, or revoking Article 50 and remaining after all.  This is popular with Remainers, because they think it\u0026rsquos the one where they would get a majority, or at least the largest chunk of the electorate, by splitting the Leave vote. But it\u0026rsquos unworkable, because a referendum more or less has to have a binary question.  What if you think Mrs May\u0026rsquos plan is better than Remain, but Remain is better than WTO? Or \u0026ndash which, despite the scaremongering over \u0026ldquono deal, seems to be a more popular position \u0026ndash that WTO is better than Remain, but Remain better than anything Mrs May comes up with (a reasonable calculation, based on her performance so far)?  You may remember the devolution referendum presented a similar potential problem. It was in practice impossible to vote \u0026ldquoNo, Yes, though it was (as a very few people, such as Tam Dalyell, argued) perfectly logical to vote against a Scottish assembly, but to think that, if there were one, it ought to have tax-raising powers.  Perhaps in that instance it didn\u0026rsquot much matter, but our departure from the EU is different, because it\u0026rsquos not confined to those three options, anyway. If we could get rid of the Prime Minister and get someone halfway smart, there might be innumerable others.  The EEA and Efta remain theoretical, and quite practical, options. The EU has already offered a variant of the so-called Canada ++ deal. Given that previous predictions of huge unemployment, wholesale departure of foreign firms and collapse of growth failed to materialise, some people think WTO terms (on which most of the world trades already) might not be as scary as Remainers claim.  I\u0026rsquom inclined to think they are, but only because the Government hasn\u0026rsquot planned for them. Any moderately competent PM could make them attractive for example, simply by unilaterally abolishing tariffs and non-tariff barriers on imports, which is all that matters to ensure cheap goods and secure supplies of medicine, just-in-time manufacturing lines, and food.  Alas, we\u0026rsquove got simple Theresa May instead. Yet, wrong though all her proposed answers have been, she\u0026rsquos still right that asking a hard question again would be not only pointless but damaging."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-asylum-seekers-facing-deportation-tell-of-flight-from-afghanistan","story":"  Bilal Quereshi, 25, feared for his life until he was packed into a lorry by his uncle and spirited across the border into Iran at the dead of night.  It was the start of a harrowing 8,000 mile journey that ended when he paid to cross the Mediterranean Sea into Italy and onwards through France and into the UK.  But now he, along with 300 other asylum seekers, is facing being thrown out of the UK after being issued with notices to quit their Glasgow homes.  A private firm housing thousands of refugees in Glasgow says it will start evicting up to 300 people who have been told they cannot stay in Britain.  Serco have issued a first six \u0026ldquolock change notices yesterday giving residents a week to get out with nowhere else to go.  Mr Quereshi says the stress of being threatened with being sent back to Afghanistan has caused severe mental health issues as he faces Taliban retribution on his return.  He said: \"I came here because I thought I would be safe. I was tortured by the Taliban and it was only thanks to my uncle that I got out.  \"I had to travel through Iran and Turkey before I paid to cross the Med but the man in charge of the boat threw my bag over the side with all my documents in it.  \"It was a terrible journey and I thought I would be safe when I got here. I love Glasgow and want to study here but instead I face going back.  \"I need it to be sorted out very quickly but it has dragged on for so long. I am currently homeless and I haven\u0027t eaten properly for weeks. It\u0027s a desperate situation\".  His predicament is shared by his fellow Afghan asylum seekers in Glasgow as Serco issue notices to the elderly and young families.  One such family is Hameeda Mohammed, 65, who arrived in the city 10 years ago with her husband and young son after fleeing the Taliban.  She was a teacher at a girls school but was regularly targeted by the ultra-conservative group as they do not approve of females teaching or girls receiving education.  To get past the group to carry on teaching she donned a burkha every day to hide her face and changed its colours every few days to make it look like she was a different person.  Eventually she fled with her husband and son and flew to the UK and they settled in Springburn where she teaches Afghan children English.  But she breaks down when she considers receiving one of the letters that will send them back to Afghanistan.  She said: \"My husband has heart problems and cannot fly. We have various doctors letters confirming this but still they might want to send us back.  \"We came here to feel safe and enjoy the last years of our lives but instead we face this. My husband hasn\u0027t eaten since we heard about the letters and he is already in bad health.  \"My son wants to study at university and he is a straight A\u0027s student but he cannot study here. It is awful, this city is our home and we feel very welcome here.\"  It is a similar situation facing Shafiqi Mohammadi who arrived in the UK last year to escape the daily bombardment of her neighbourhood in Kapisa Province, north of the Afghan capital Kabul.  Her father was killed by the Taliban so she fled with her three young sons hoping for a better, quieter life in the west.  They settled first in Austria but arrived in Glasgow last year and her sons attend Drumchapel High School.  Eldest son Mohammad, 16, wants to be a mechanical engineer, his brother Hamid, 15, wants to be an aeronautical engineer and the youngest, 13-year-old Hamid wants to be a banker.  But instead they might not even return to school next term after the holidays are finished as they face the same Serco sanctions.  She said: \"I am happy In Glasgow and my boys are doing well at school. After what happened before we left Afghanistan, we can\u0027t go back there.  \"Every day was constant shelling and we could not leave the house and my sons could not go to school.  \"We feel happy and safe here and I do not understand why they want to lock us out of our homes. We are supposed to be safe here.\"  Her eldest son Mohammed added: \"I remember how bad it was back home. We had to get out for our safety.

But it notes: \u0026ldquoWhitehall still operates extensively on the basis of a structure and culture which take little account of the realities of devolution in the UK.

The report goes on to say there is \u0026ldquoconsiderable ambiguity surrounding the Sewel convention and that the UK Government chose to interpret it in such a way that legislative consent from the Scottish Parliament was deemed unnecessary.  It recommends in future clear statements of circumstances under which legislative consent is not required by the convention should be clearly set out.  The MPs also:  *say England should be better represented in the constitution, warning a failure to do so \u0026ldquorisks a sense of increasing disconnection of the English people from the political system  *express concern about the Government\u0026rsquos attitude towards the post-Brexit UK common frameworks, calling on it to publish a coherent policy  *say current inter-governmental relationship mechanisms are \u0026ldquonot fit for purpose and recommend a fresh structure be established along with a new system for inter-parliamentary scrutiny to hold the governments of the UK to account.  The report calls for a devolution review in the year following Brexit, covering how Whitehall is structured and how it relates to the devolved administrations.  \u0026ldquoThis review, it says, \u0026ldquoshould also consider whether the role of the territorial offices in Whitehall and corresponding Secretaries of State are still necessary and, if they are, whether they might be reformed to promote better relations across Whitehall with the devolved administrations.  Sir Bernard Jenkin, who chairs the committee, said \u0026ldquoLeaving the EU will change the UK\u0026rsquos constitutional arrangements, so it needs a rethink.  \u0026ldquoWe recommend the Government sets out a clear devolution policy for the Union as we leave the EU failure to do this just prolongs misunderstandings, which are the basis for more conflict.  Michael Russell, the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Brexit Secretary, said: \u0026ldquoThe EU Withdrawal Act is a power-grab on the Scottish Parliament and this report demonstrates that fundamental change is required within the UK Government to ensure devolution is respected.  He suggested it was astonishing how 20 years on from the establishment of the Scottish Parliament, the committee highlighted how training in Whitehall about how devolution worked was still required.  \u0026ldquoBut more than training is needed, he declared. \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government has already said there needs to be a requirement in law for the Scottish Parliament\u0026rsquos consent before Westminster legislates on devolved issues.  Mr Russell added: \u0026ldquoThere has been little meaningful engagement throughout this process and it is time the UK Government respected the views of the Scottish Parliament and abandoned its pursuit of a hard Brexit.  His SNP colleague, Ronnie Cowan, who sits on the committee, said: \u0026ldquo\u0026lsquoWhat we are witnessing is a blatant Westminster power-grab after twenty years of devolution.  \u0026ldquoIt is the arrogance of the Tories who think they can rip up the devolution settlement and transfer powers to Westminster. The fact that the committee is now questioning whether the Scotland Office and the office of Secretary of State are necessary is a humiliation for David Mundell who has clearly failed to justify his job.  Willie Rennie for the Scottish Liberal Democrats said the report was a \u0026ldquopowerful rebuke to those who think the only way is separation and division.  Saying it was urgent for the committee\u0027s recommendations to be enacted to allow all the governments to work together, he added: \u0026ldquoThe prize will be a UK which has decentralised and devolved power but which can still work as a whole when the issues affect everyone across these islands."},{"url":null,"title":"rival-koreas-generals-discuss-easing-military-confrontation","story":"  The meeting comes days after North Korea returned the reported remains of US war dead, the most recent sign of blossoming diplomacy after last year\u0026rsquos threats of war.  The general-level officers were discussing ways to implement April\u0026rsquos inter-Korean summit agreements on non-nuclear military issues, but no huge announcement is expected from the talks at the border village of Panmunjom.  Some experts say South Korea cannot agree on any drastic measures to reduce animosity unless the North takes serious nuclear disarmament steps.  During the April 27 summit, the leaders of the Koreas agreed to disarm a jointly controlled area at Panmunjom, work to prevent accidental clashes along their disputed sea boundary and halt all hostile acts.  Since then, the Koreas dismantled their frontline propaganda loudspeakers, restored a military hotline and held their first general-level talks since 2007.  Tuesday is the second meeting of its kind since the summit.  The generals will likely discuss dropping the number of military guards at Panmunjom, withdrawing heavy weapons from the area and pulling some army guard posts away from the Demilitarised Zone, a buffer zone that separates the two countries.  They may also talk about ways to make sure their fishermen peacefully operate along the Korean sea boundary, the site of several bloody naval skirmishes in recent years.  The Defence Ministry will not discuss any detailed agenda for the talks.  The meeting comes four days after North Korea returned what were said to be dozens of remains of American soldiers missing from the 1950-53 Korean War, something that leader Kim Jong Un promised during a June summit with US president Donald Trump.  Mr Trump thanked Mr Kim for \u0026ldquofulfilling a promise to send back US remains and said it was a step in the right direction following their summit.  During the Singapore meeting, Mr Kim also committed to the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula while Mr Trump promised to provide him with security assurances.  But there have been worries that North Korea has not since taken any serious disarmament measures.  The North suspended its missile and nuclear tests and shut down its nuclear test site, and recent satellite photos indicated the country had also begun dismantling key facilities at its main rocket launch site.  But many foreign experts say those were not enough to prove it is serious about its disarmament commitment, saying the North must first submit a list of nuclear assets to be dismantled.  As a reward for returning the US war dead, North Korea may demand that the United States agree on a declaration to end the Korean War as a US security guarantee.  That issue could be discussed at Tuesday\u0026rsquos meeting, according to analyst Cho Han Bum at Seoul\u0026rsquos Korea Institute for National Unification.  The Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty, leaving the peninsula in a technical state of war.  North Korea has long argued its nuclear weapons are aimed at coping with US military threats, saying it wants to sign a peace treaty with the United States to formally end the war.  That could then allow the North to demand the pullout of 28,500 US troops deployed in South Korea."},{"url":null,"title":"german-ryanair-pilots-vote-to-strike-over-pay","story":"  The Vereinigung Cockpit union said 96% of the pilots who voted supported the stoppage.

Weather forecasters have warned that the mercury is likely to hit 30C (86F) across the south of England by Friday, instead of being concentrated in the south east.  The thermometer will carry on climbing over the weekend reaching highs of 32C (89.6F)and possibly 33C (91.4F).  While the south shrivels, northern parts of the UK will continue to see showers with temperatures sitting in the mid 20s.  A spokeswoman for the Met Office said: \u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoIn terms of the weekend just gone, they were the first two days this month where temperatures haven\u0026rsquot reached 25C (77F) but we have got back to that point today, it hit 25.3C (77.5F) in Cavendish in Suffolk so it\u0026rsquos already starting to warm up again.  \u0026ldquoOver the next few days there will be something of a north and south split \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash high pressure is already starting to build up in the south, bringing dry, fine and weather.

The weather broke on Friday, treating the parched landscape to a deluge of rain.  It meant this July will be wetter than the blistering heatwave of July 1976.  An average 49.9mm of rain fell across the UK from July 1 to July 29, according to provisional figures from the Met Office, and with further rain expected this week, the final total could be higher.  The total for the whole of July 1976 was 43.3mm.  The UK suffered a long heatwave during the summer of 1976, which helped make July 1976 the joint ninth driest on record.  Currently, July this year is the 13th driest on record, the Met Office said.  The driest ever July was in 1955, when an average of 30.6mm rainfall was measured across the UK.

Mr Fancier\u0027s project urged people pick up the models, take a photo and then share the image on social media.  Last year the comedian and presenter Phill Jupitus was pictured with one of the avian artworks, which have travelled as far as the Antarctic and Hong Kong.  This year, as part of its marketing drive, the Fringe has launched #catchthepigeon, in which a small flock of gold pigeon models have been hidden in Edinburgh: the public are being urged to pick up the models, take a photo and share on social media.  Mr Fancier believes the Fringe have copied his idea, and would like to have some acknowledgement for the idea.  He said: \"I have never seen anyone else who has had this idea.  \"It does seem like my idea has been copied - apart from some black marks on the face of the pigeon, it is the same.  \"I am just looking for some credit for the idea.\"  He: \"This may just be a very large coincidence, but it does seem strange that exactly one year after I released metallic pigeons at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, the marketing team of the same name are now releasing metallic pigeons at the Fringe.  \"Pigeons are a perfect representation of an underclass that gets easily overlooked.

Mr Kerevan, SNP MP for East Lothian from 2015 to 2017, gives a behind-the-scenes account of the start of the Commission in the new Scottish Left Review.  The Commission\u0027s report, largely written by corporate lobbyist Andrew Wilson, advocates keeping the pound for at least a decade after a Yes vote in an informal currency union.  The report also says public spending should growth very slowly in order to halve the deficit.  The plan has infuriated many on the left of the SNP, and been described by the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies as a continuation of current austerity measures.  Mr Kerevan revealed that after Nicola Sturgeon announced the Commission in late 2016, he and two other SNP MPs with backgrounds in economics met Mr Wilson to discuss it.  He wrote: \u0026ldquoAndrew explained that the primary task of the Commission - given the imminent likelihood of a second referendum - was to provide a fresh and robust set of economic arguments supporting independence.  \u0026ldquoIn particular, we had to replace the notion of a sterling union with the rest of Britain - a position which was seen as having been a major reason we lost the 2014 referendum.  \u0026ldquoAs I remember, it was taken for granted that the Commission was there to justify a switch to a separate Scottish currency and a break with sterling.  However, the Commission \u0026ldquochanged tack after the 2017 general election, and when it was published in May, Mr Kerevan said that \u0026ldquosurprisingly (given earlier discussions), the report proposes that an independent Scotland keep sterling unilaterally for at least a decade.  He said that was technically feasible but would \u0026ldquoleave the SNP back where it started in 2014, with interest rates, mortgage rates, and the external exchange rate determined by the Bank of England, tying the Scottish economy to the UK\u0026rsquos.  An SNP source said Mr Kerevan may have \u0026ldquomisunderstood the Commission\u0026rsquos remit, which was to \u0026ldquoconsider the most appropriate monetary policy arrangements to underpin a programme for sustainable growth in an independent Scotland.  It was therefore not fixed on a new currency, but explored a range of options, and concluded that a new currency could not be achieved overnight."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-set-for-special-question-time-with-children-and-young-people","story":"  The SNP leader is regularly questioned by opposition leaders at the Scottish Parliament and backbenchers at First Minister\u0027s Questions.

Mackie’s distributes its products to the UK and worldwide.                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"use water wisely urges council","story":"        Aberdeenshire Council has called on the public to use water wisely as the warm, dry weather continues across the area.                The council says here is increasing pressure on water supplies and forecast rain is not expected to replenish supplies sufficiently.                                                    Aberdeenshire Council and Scottish Water are continuing to provide support to a number of properties experiencing water shortages and are encouraging everyone to use water wisely.                                                    Both agencies are working with the Scottish Government to provide bottled water and tanks to those in the area whose private supply is running dry, at no cost. Council teams are already dealing with requests relating to around 40 water supplies, serving around 60 properties, a number which is expected to increase.        The council has delivered, or householders have collected, 2,500 1.5 litre bottles of water. Fifteen 1,000-litre bowsers have been issued and filled by the council, which will be refilled as required. There are more than 7,500 private water supplies in Aberdeenshire – the highest number in thecountry.Given the limited capacity of the council, priority is being given to elderly, disabled or ill occupiers and householders may have to augment the supplies the council provides with water from other sources. More bowsers are being delivered this week and farmers concerned about their livestock are beingadvised to submit requests direct to Scottish Water.                                                                                                        Significant rainfall over a prolonged period is required to replenish some supplies, but this is not expected in the near future. There are warnings that when rain does fall, private supplies could become contaminated and users should be wary.Users of untreated supplies should ensure they boil water before drinking, cooking and brushing teeth. Those using such supplies may be eligible for grant funding towards treatment – contact the council’s environmental health team for information.Long-term, the council is providing advice on future solutions to improve water security, such as support to help connect to the mains. If that is not possible, improvements to the current source or forming a new supply can be considered and grants may be available for some of this work.Environmental health team manager, Louise Cunningham, said: “Most people will be well aware of how recent weather conditions have been affecting the country, but those with private water supplies in Aberdeenshire are acutely aware of the impact it’s having.                                                                                                        “Clearly we all have to use water wisely at times like this, but around 11,500 properties in Aberdeenshire are served by private water supplies, by far the highest number of any local authority in Scotland, and difficulties for these residents could be pronounced.“We are assisting where we can and would encourage anyone who is having issues with their private supply to get in touch with us, both about short term solutions and thinking about the longer term.“When rain does come, users of private supplies should be aware that following an extended dry period the water will not be absorbed by the ground quickly and has the potential to run over ground for longer, potentially contaminating some supplies.”If you need assistance in relation to water supplies, please contact the council by phoning 01467 539539 (during office hours) or by emailing: environmental@aberdeenshire.gov.uk Some useful advice from Scottish Water is also available online: http://bit.ly/2K1CQ7s                                                                    "},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116798.jpg","title":"Caithness estate with links to royal family to be sold at auction","story":"A CAITHNESS estate with links to the royal family and rock and pop stars is to be sold at auction next month.The Dunnet Head Estate, comprising 1800 acres of land and the House of the Northern Gate, was initially put on the market in February for \u0026pound925,000.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA spokeswoman for Auction House Scotland, which is dealing with the transaction, yesterday described the price reduction as \u0026ldquoone of our biggest ever.She said: \u0026ldquoSince the latest reduction on Friday the amount of interest in the estate has increased tenfold with enquiries coming mostly from the UK.Asked why the estate is being sold, she replied: \u0026ldquoThe current owner has had it for a long time and felt it was time to sell up and move on.The estate includes six lochs, a beach, approved planning for 10 timber lodges and a detached house as well as the 10-bedroom House of the Northern Gate.It was owned by Commander Clare Vyner and his wife Lady Doris Vyner, who was the Queen Mother\u0026rsquos close friend and lady-in-waiting. While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Tuesday 31 Jul 2018 10:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116795.jpg","title":"Mey Highland and Cultural Games to be bigger and better","story":"Event chairman Captain Richard Otley said that the Mey Highland and Cultural Games 2018 will be \u0026ldquobigger and better this year and \u0026ldquowill surely put Caithness on the map.The 2018 event is the first Highland games to include para-athletes\u0026rsquo events. People with physical, vision and intellectual disabilities are eligible to compete.\u0026ldquoThis is a golden opportunity for local groups, individuals and businesses to raise awareness to their cause and raise funds from their stalls on the day, he said. \u0026ldquoWe are hoping the event will showcase Caithness in a positive way for tourism, business and the community.Sixty para-athletes will travel from as far afield as America and Australia and all over the UK to take part in the milestone event. The Mey Games will be unique as it welcomes both para and Invictus athletes to compete in traditional Highland track-and-field competitions. This will be the first time that para-athletics has been included within a traditional Highland Games context in Scotland.America\u0026rsquos Alex \u0026ldquoThe Tank Armor, who holds the world record for wheelchair caber-tossing, as well as several top Australian para-athletes will be competing.Last year saw a revamped games event held at John O\u0026rsquoGroats, with Prince Charles \u0026ndash known as the Duke of Rothesay in Scotland \u0026ndash in attendance.The duke \u0026ndash whose late grandmother, the Queen Mother, regularly attended the games during her summer stays at the Castle of Mey \u0026ndash did an impromptu tour of the various marquees on the site to chat with local organisations and vendors.Capt Otley \u0026ndash who is also chairman of the Wick, Canisbay and Latheron branch of Royal British Legion Scotland (RBLS) \u0026ndash said that all proceeds from the games will be going towards supporting the veterans and their families within the branch area. There will be in the region of 15 marquees this year, including seven new ones as a result of successful applications to local community benefit funds.\u0026ldquoThe Mey Games is now a major annual event in Caithness, Capt Otley said.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos organised by the Wick, Canisbay and Latheron branch of the RBLS who took on the running of the games when visitor numbers were dwindling to as low as just 30. Last year, we had 1500 visitors and this year we hope to welcome between 2500 and 3500 people.\u0026ldquoWe are all volunteers and work hard to ensure the event is a big success. It\u0026rsquos a community event and we want the local community to be part of it. We offer free stalls to local businesses as we want to encourage them to be involved.\u0026ldquoAt the RBLS we provide a lot of veteran support and our ethos is focused on military support and participation inclusion.\u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have so many para-athletes taking part this year from around the globe. A delegation from the RBLS Wick, Canisbay and Latheron branch visited Australia in April this year to mark Anzac Day so it\u0026rsquos fitting that we will have a number of Australian para-athletes taking part.\u0026ldquoWe want to make sure each of the para-athletes and everybody at the games has an enjoyable time.He stressed how the games have been \u0026ldquoramped up by comparing the number of marquees this year with the total put up two years ago, only three.\u0026ldquoThere has been a massive amount of work behind the scenes by a dedicated group of members to ensure the games not only takes place but grows to a more sustainable level.The build-up to the Mey Games will get under way with a North Coast 500 cycling challenge that will depart from Wick\u0026rsquos Market Square on July 28 and arrive back in the town on August 3, the day before the games.On the morning of the games, at 9.30am, there will be a rededication ceremony at the grave of General Lord Horne in Wick cemetery. \u0026ldquoWe shall honour Wick\u0026rsquos own hero of the Great War with a colour party and piper in attendance at this short but poignant event, Capt Otley said.Events kicks off at 11am and include Highland dancing competitions, pipe and drum bands, the tug of war, dog show and live music, as well as various exhibitions, local art, crafts and food stalls.The event will take place at John O\u0026rsquoGroats for the third time after travel company Natural Retreats stepped in after the previous games location, close to the Castle of Mey, became waterlogged.Since then the company has continued to provide ongoing complimentary use of the showground.Ewan Kearney, chief operating officer at Natural Retreats, said: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted to support the Mey Games again this year.For more information, visit the Mey Games Facebook page: https://www.facebook/MeyGames/Tuesday 31 Jul 2018 10:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New record set for Lands End to John OGroats cycle run","story":"THE record for cycling from Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats has been broken by Michael Broadwith.The 40-year-old from Hertfordshire did the marathon bike run in 43 hours, 25 minutes and 13 seconds \u0026ndash more than 30 minutes faster than the previous record held by Gethin Butler.His record of 44 hours, four minutes and 19 seconds had stood for 17 years.Veteran local cyclist Alasdair Washington was a record-keeper for the Road Records Association (RRA) at the north end of the trip.Mr Broadwith, a maths teacher, joins a select number of people to break the record since George Mills, riding a penny-farthing, made the first successful end-to-end attempt in 1886.Broadwith also broke the RRA 24-hour record with 507.511 miles covered at an average speed of 21.1 miles per hour.Bill Mowat, vice-chairman of the Dunnet and Canisbay Community Council, congratulated Mr Broadwith on his remarkable achievement.The women\u0026rsquos record holder is Lynne Taylor who lives in the West Midlands. \u0026ldquoShe is the only one with a Canisbay parish relative to do so, said Mr Mowat, who pointed out that the RRA only recognised female racers in the late 1930s.

Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year. The others were Scolpaig on North Uist and Unst in Shetland.All three were assessed by independent consultants with specialist knowledge of the space sector.Each one met key criteria, including the ability to stage north facing launches over the sea into both polar and sun-synchronous orbit.However, the business case for Sutherland was judged stronger overall, including being successfully awarded UK Space Agency funding for its proposals in collaboration with potential launch operators.HIE chief executive Charlotte Wright said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very clear that we want to work with others to ensure the benefits of a spaceport in the Highlands and Islands are not confined to Sutherland, but extend well beyond.\u0026ldquoA central part of our approach as we develop this project will be to explore opportunities throughout our region.Tuesday 31 Jul 2018 10:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"We just werent at the races says Academy boss after opening day derby defeat","story":"DEJECTED Wick Academy manager Tom McKenna watched his side succumb to a 2-0 derby defeat to Brora Rangers and admitted: \u0026ldquoWe just weren\u0026rsquot at the races.Goals by Kyle Macleod on the stroke of half-time and Craig Campbell just before the hour mark gave Brora a 2-0 win at Dudgeon Park on Saturday in Steven Mackay\u0026rsquos first competitive match as player/manager.Rarely will you see a more one-sided game with a mere two-goal margin of victory, and after the final whistle McKenna admitted his team had been second best throughout.\u0026ldquoWe were lethargic, we were disjointed, there was no fluency in our game, he said.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not going to take anything away from Brora \u0026ndash they were by far the better team.

The organisation\u0026rsquos chairman, Tony Vandyke, says the money will be used to complete the first stage of an extensive revamp ahead of proposed further work in the next five years.\"We are going to use the money for things like replacing the handrails and changing the electrics and lighting,\" he said. \"These are vital upgrades.

Is Edinburgh in danger of killing the golden goose by pricing artists out of appearing at the Edinburgh Fringe? £500 for an overnight hotel stay is an eye-watering sum. But prices are high right across Scotland. Even in June a popular booking site had no hotel or bed and breakfast availability in the Oban and Lorn area for the entire week. A trip to Eigg earlier this month found only a couple of B\u0026ampBs for £70-£100 in the Mallaig-Arisaig area and “No vacancy” signs outside every camp/caravan site. Luckily, I stayed with friends whose summer months are now busy and sociable with cost-cutting visits from friends and family. When they travel elsewhere in Scotland, they do the same. It’s a great way to live and travel – if you have a wheen of like-minded, far-flung acquaintances with plenty of space. But if you don’t, the novel combination of brilliant summer weather and high staycationing demand from the rest of Britain creates a problem. Put simply, Scotland is fast becoming an impossibly expensive holiday location for folk actually living here.            The collapse in sterling since Brexit means a £100 bed and breakfast is less daunting for Europeans who also plan ahead. But Scots, prompted to explore their own country at the last minute by prolonged good weather and the relatively higher costs of foreign travel, are finding day trips or wild camping are the only “holidays” they can afford.            It doesn’t have to be like this.Across northern Europe and the world’s wooded latitudes, wooden weekend huts have traditionally come to the rescue, removing locals from the commercial holiday market and offering the possibility of long, leisurely stays during the summer, extended family reunions at Easter and sanity-restoring breaks every weekend throughout the year. Norway has the world’s highest GDP and the highest rate of hut ownership, with one basic wooden hut for every ten Norwegians. In 2006, there were 429,093 holiday homes in Norway, of which the vast majority (398,884) were huts rather than converted farmhouses (30,209) in a population of 4.6 million. A further 55,000 holiday homes were owned by Norwegians abroad. That’s one hytte (hut) per 11 Norwegians (roughly one per extended family) for year-round relaxation, connection with nature, exercise, escape from city pressures and strengthening family ties. Few huts have running water (thanks to freezing winters) although some have electricity and most are custom-built with wood-burning stoves. They are close enough to reach every weekend (usually within 25 miles and one hour’s drive) and the hytte habit is a marker of wealth, not poverty. Norway is one of the world’s most equal societies, and since second homes are generally modest purpose-built huts, not family homes from the local housing stock, ownership isn’t regarded as elitist, greedy or wasteful. A smart system called boplikt has created two separate housing markets by designating huts as temporary and family homes as permanent dwellings. Houses in each category cannot have a change of use. Thus family houses in remote areas cannot be bought or used as second homes. In 1991 there was also one cabin per 12 Swedes, one per 18 Finns and one per 33 Danes, along with widespread cabin ownership in Russia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Spain plus America, Canada and New Zealand.Scotland has the lowest rate of hut ownership in northern Europe. In 2000 only 630 huts remained in Scotland – most without rights of tenancy or improvement. Since then hundreds have been evicted, although Carbeth hutters raised almost £2 million to achieve a land buyout in 2013.            Of course, not everyone wants a basic, back-to-nature, wooden hut. But thousands do. And unless working families find the land and encouragement to take up hutting, holidays here will continue to be a greater luxury than a package holiday abroad and unemployed Scots will remain walled up in city estates without hope of escape. Maybe that’s a bigger social problem than the prices facing artists at the Edinburgh Fringe?"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4774013.1532550395!/image/image.jpg","title":"strictly come dancing sensation ed balls on his newest tv show","story":"        Ed Balls is discussing the dos and don\u0026#8217ts of donning a leotard.                No, he’s not referring to his Strictly Come Dancing days (in case you missed it, he was the unexpected star of the 2016 series).            The former politician, 51, actually wears a skimpy Union flag number to enter the wrestling ring in new BBC Two show, Travels In Trumpland With Ed Balls.            “I’m not someone who previously had bikini line concerns, but they wanted me to wear a really tight-cut leotard, and I thought it would be unflattering,” quips the Norwich-born father-of-three, who’s married to Labour MP Yvette Cooper.“I got a pair of black boxers under it. Had I only worn the bikini line, that might have ruined it for the viewer…”He decided not to shave his legs and torso, like his fellow wrestlers did, either.“My kids think dads should be embarrassing but that I substantially overachieve,” he adds with a grin.“I could explain to my 13-year-old why it was important to do the wrestling, but if I’d have been waxed and shaved, she would have said it was too much.”            The factual entertainment series sees the ex-shadow chancellor walk in the shoes of a variety of supporters of US President Donald Trump, to try and understand why they voted for him.“Lots of people will assume they’re either deluded and don’t understand, or extreme and dangerous, but we just met really nice, ordinary people,” he says.“I thought that after the first year Trump would be losing support, but we didn’t find that at all and it wouldn’t surprise me at all if he won a second term.”The three episodes look at different issues facing Americans, whether that’s the gun control movement or immigration policies, and how they feel about their country since former reality star Trump was elected in 2016.            “I thought he’d drop the wild persona and become a more reasonable, centrist president but he hasn’t at all,” Balls notes.“You assume it can’t get worse, and it does.”As well as being an insightful and entertaining series, what might surprise viewers is how emotional it is to watch at times.In the first episode, Balls stays at a farm with a group of war veterans, and as well as hearing their thoughts on Trump, he joins them round a campfire for a toast to friends who lost their lives in service.And he asks to toast to Labour MP Jo Cox, a mum-of-two who was murdered by a far-right extremist outside her constituency surgery in Birstall, near Leeds, a week before the EU referendum.            “The only thing which felt comparable to me was Jo, who I knew very, very well,” Balls confides of the moving scene. “I did a lot of campaigning and fundraising with her.“From a personal point of view... Jo losing her life is a terrible thing, obviously, but I’m somebody who has three kids, and a partner who does exactly the same kind of surgeries every Friday, so it could absolutely have been us.“I could both think about what it’s like to be Jo but also think about what it’s like to be her family.”Balls agrees that competing on Strictly – on which he won fans over with his memorable salsa to Gangnam Style – showed the public a different side to him.“People kept saying to me, ‘We always knew you were a politician but it’s great to see you’re a human being as well’.”With presenting this documentary series taking him out of his comfort zone once again, he says we can expect to see even more of his personality.“It’s impossible to be in a character for so many hours [of filming] each day, so it’s impossible to conceal who I am.” Did he look to an experienced interviewer like Louis Theroux for inspiration?“I took a decision that I shouldn’t watch anyone else doing this kind of thing until we had made the first episode. I didn’t want to try and be someone else.“If you asked me what the genre is, it’s a mix of old-style, early Louis Theroux meets The Real Marigold Hotel and little bit of Ruby Wax.“I tried to let the characters do the talking. I reveal my opinions to camera but not to the people I’m with.”It was the 2015 general election when Balls lost his seat in the Morley and Outwood constituency, in West Yorkshire.And he doesn’t seem to envy those currently working as an MP.“I’m regretful politics is so chaotic at the moment, and I look back at better times wistfully,” he says.“But if you said to me, ‘You could be in Parliament or you could do this show at the moment’, I’d definitely choose this show.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4775976.1532978152!/image/image.jpg","title":"public to have a say on naming inverness airport after loch ness","story":"        The public is to be consulted on plans to rebrand Inverness Airport as \u0026#8220Loch Ness Airport\u0026#8221.                Bosses there have launched a Twitter consultation to gauge support for the proposal. They are asking: “Should we change our name to Inverness Loch Ness Airport?”             As of yesterday evening, around 400 votes had been cast with a large majority against the move.             The controversial name change suggestion has previously been mooted by \u2028local business and tourism chiefs. Willie Cameron, business development director for Cobbs Group, said he is “100 per cent behind” the name change and believes now is the right time for it, particularly given the growing market for travel in Scotland from the Far East. He said most bookings are done through smartphone and tablet devices and tourists will have a greater appreciation of the Loch Ness name, with a rebranding working better for search engine optimisation. Mr Cameron said: “I think the team at Inverness Airport is doing a great job by working hard to get more flights in there. They are also going to get the new train station coming in there as part of the future plans. “I would say expand the airport and runway.             “If it turns out that the public want them to change the name, it will enhance the number of international carriers coming into the airport.” He added that the Inverness name change was just as plausible as Liverpool changing its name to John Lennon Airport, which is iconic for that area. Stewart Nicol, Inverness Chamber of Commerce chief executive, said that his team have promoted the idea in the past, adding: “A name change immediately identifies the airport with one of the biggest draws to the region for tourism. Loch Ness is iconic across the globe.” A Highlands and Islands Airport Ltd spokesman said: “The idea of including Loch Ness in the name of Inverness Airport has been raised in the past and we thought it would be interesting to gauge the response from the public.             “As yet there are no plans to take the idea further.” It is understood that the idea would only be taken further through major backing from several tourism agencies, including the likes of VisitScotland.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers.

One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed.

As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.

A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"communities minister makes isles her first port of call ","story":"\nCabinet secretary Aileen Campbell pours soap mixture into a mould under the watchful eye of Louise Jamieson.

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/001WH1307NCA.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over. The school has achieved so much by doing less and spending no money.\n  \n“The principal, Mrs Lutton has been very supportive of the initiative and the groundsmen have ensured the meadow is looked after in the proper way.”\n  \nRachael said the meadow has been such a success that the school has agreed to extend its size. \n  \nRachel added: “These flowers have been lying dormont in the soil for years waiting for an opportunity. We now have over 20 of these rare flowers after just two years of changing the mowing regime.”\n  \nOther wildflowers found in the meadow include Self-Heal and Birds Foot Trefoil.\n  \nRachael continued: “We would love to see Ballymena schools become a showcase for meadow creation. \n  \n“Council has planted quite a lot of wildflowers around the town and it would be great to see less mowing and more and more of these wonderful meadows.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/wk28026-8492781.jpg","title":"65215  ","story":"    \nTHOUSANDS of mourners are expected to make the pilgrimage to Garryduff Presbyterian Church in Ballymoney on Wednesday to pay their respects to William Dunlop.\nFuneral arrangements have been put in place for the 32-year-oldmotorcyclist who tragically lost his life after an accident during a practice session for the Skerries 100 road races on Saturday, July 7.\nThe popular Ballymoney man was involved in an incident at the Sam\u0027s Tunnel section of the County Dublin circuit.\nThe Funeral Service in Garryduff Presbyterian Church will take place on Wednesday at 1pm followed by interment in the adjoining churchyard.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/wk280272.jpg","title":"65226  ","story":"    \nWILLIAM Dunlop\u0027s best years as a road racer were still ahead of him, according to North West 200 Event Director, Mervyn Whyte. \nThe 32-year-old was tragically killed on his return to the sport at the Skerries 100 road races in Ireland at the weekend. It was the first time he had competed since withdrawing from the Isle of Man TT Races back in May.\nDunlop was a revered competitor who had more than one hundred wins to his name at both national and international level. 15 of those came at the County Dublin circuit which ultimately claimed his life on Saturday afternoon during practice for the Open Race.\nWhyte said that after some lacklustre seasons where fans only got to see sporadic glimpses of his ability shine through, 2018 looked set to be the start of something special as Dunlop joined forces with Tim Martin in the Superstock and Superbike classes. \nThe team was being built around Dunlop, with Martin ending his sabbatical from the sport after just one year.\n\u0026#8220Tim threw everything he had at it for William, Whyte told Chronicle Sport.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/jbllegiofdoolfna1.jpg","title":"65370  ","story":"    \nARMOY Road Races Clerk of the Course Bill Kennedy says this weekend\u0027s 10th anniversary event is a \u0027massive milestone\u0027 for organisers.\nRace Week continues apace until this weekend with practice on Friday and Race Day taking place on Saturday.\nIt\u0027s been a massive achievement for the club, said Kennedy.

This is because Cameron’s health has declined over the last few weeks and we have just been fully focusing on giving Cameron everything he needs at this time.\n\n“It is with the greatest of pains in our heart that we share his journey is near over. We don’t know how long we have left with our beautiful boy but although he is sleeping mostly now he still is fighting with all his might when he is awake. He is in no pain and is just restful. We plan to be at home surrounded by family where he will be happy.\n\n“We can’t thank you all enough for everything you have done for our sweet boy. Because of the love, help and support we received Cameron’s life was greatly extended and in those times he had amazing days that we where so blessed to be apart of.\n\n“We hope to honour Cameron by continuing Cure4Cam. He has spoke of things he wants us to do in his charity and we hope we can do him proud by helping other kids with cancer and funding help and awareness for DIPG as well as much more.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAll the time in the world would not be enough with our amazing son. But we are thankful and honoured to have had the time we have had. We are filled with pride on the young man he has become. He fought this battle with more strength and courage than we could have.\n\nAs our hearts are shattering we ask for prayers. Prayers for Cameron in all that he needs right now, for his sisters and for us and our whole family. \n\n“We are going to take some time out. We will get back to everyone as soon as we have strength.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n

red y for lurgan park run","story":"\nLocals are being urged to get their outfits \u0026#8216red-y\u0026#8217 and take part in the first Red Dress Run at Lurgan Park on August 19 in aid of Northern Ireland Chest Heart and Stroke.\n\n                \nThe call comes from Gillian Abraham, Northern Ireland Chest Heart and Stroke’s Ambassador.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nShe is encouraging locals to attend the event which will see flamboyantly dressed men, women and children take part in a 5k or 10k walk or run. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe event aims to raise awareness of heart disease as well as raising funds to help combat this biggest single killer of men and women in Northern Ireland.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nGillian has NICHS close to her heart after losing her dad to a heart attack and her mum has had ongoing heart conditions as well as a mini stroke. \n\nShe said: “My aim is to get as many people as possible to

And just before the youngsters left the nest to take to County Antrim skies, Aidan led a team of birders to ring them. It was a marvellous occasion for all who took part. These participants now share a special bond, a fellowship of the rings not unlike that from the famous trilogy Lord of the Rings itself.\n\nIn April, Aidan was overjoyed to see his first barn owl when, after a three-hour stake-out of the old cottage with Dúlra, one emerged like a ghost from the window and out over the shimmering, moonlit lough. That night one of the most significant barn owl projects was launched – if the birds successfully bred, Aidan determined to ring the chicks, setting in motion a structured, monitored process to analyse the population of one of our most threatened birds, one which was on the verge of extinction in Ireland.\n\n“Now that they have rings, these chicks have become dots on the map of barn owls in the world,” said a proud Aidan. “They are five ambassadors who will contribute to a national scientific study of these birds in Ireland.\n\n“And I want the public to help us. These five birds will leave their nest by next Friday and set out to make lives for themselves. Their territory will be from Hannahstown right out to Lough Neagh. We want people to look out for them. If anyone sees one, we want to know. \n\n“You’ll often see an owl in your headlights, and if you also see a flash of metal on their legs, then it’s one of ours. And we want to know about it especially if you see one of them hurt and in need of help.”\n\nThe team weighed and measured the chicks, discovering that four of them were male. “That’s four new territories for breeding barn owls next year,” Aidan said.\n\nAidan and pals – including Belfast Media Group editor Robin Livingstone – set out to ring the chicks in a slick operation.\n\n“This was all about planning,” said Aidan. “We wanted to keep disturbance to a minimum so we had it all worked out beforehand.\n\n“Everyone knew their job, be it climbing the ladder to the nest, weighing the birds, writing their details in the log book, putting on the rings. And everyone was caring and sensitive of the brood. We only spoke when we had to and were gone as soon as possible.\n\n “Adult owls leave their chicks alone in the nest, so the two parents were sleeping in the chimney pot when we went to the nest in the rafters and they weren’t disturbed at all. Owls could teach us a lot – once the chicks are four weeks old the parents sleep in a different bedroom. They know they’ll not get any peace with the young ‘uns playing and constantly pulling at them because they want the bird equivalent of McDonald’s and Pizza Hut. \n\n“The parents go somewhere else so they can get a good night’s sleep rather than stay with their teenage brood.”\n\nThe chick with Aidan is about 40 days old – owls incubate their eggs as soon as each is laid, unlike garden birds who wait until all the eggs are laid before they incubate to ensure they all hatch together – so the five chicks are all different ages and weights.\n\n“This was pretty special for me,” said Aidan. “Despite a lifetime of birdwatching, I’d never seen a single barn owl until this year. To see five chicks in a single nest is phenomenal. This is one of the biggest broods ever recorded, and shows that the birds here are healthy and finding plenty of food.”\nThe old abandoned cottage is on land belonging to the owner of Randox Laboratories Dr Peter Fitzgerald, who is said to be delighted that barn owls have chosen to nest there and is backing the study of the chicks.\n\nAidan added: “There may be only a couple of pair of breeding barn owls in the whole north of Ireland, so these chicks are precious and represent hope that they can make a comeback. A big congratulations is due to everyone concerned.”\n\n* If you’ve seen anything interesting or have any nature questions, you can text Dúlra on 07801 414804.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Generation-identity.png","title":"fascist graffiti re emerges in north belfast","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\nA SINN Féin councillor has stressed the importance of challenging the far-right after the appearance of graffiti promoting a new fascist group in North Belfast.\nLogos representing the white supremacist Generation Identity movement were daubed on street furniture on the Cavehill Road, but were quickly removed due to the fast actions of Cllr Mary Ellen Campbell and maintenance workers from the Belfast City Council.\nGeneration Identity describe themselves as a “movement aimed at preserving the ethnocultural identity of Europe”, and are active in 13 countries across Europe and North America.\nThe shadowy group has been trying to gain a foothold in the North and have already been involved in a number of public demonstrations.\nLast month they were part of the “Free Tommy Robinson” rally at City Hall where demonstrators were pictured giving Nazi salutes.\nSpeaking to the North Belfast News, Cllr Campbell said that fascist graffiti has become a more common occurrence in recent times.\n“It’s about the fourth or fifth time I have had to get this type of graffiti removed in the area,” she said.\n“We need to keep challenging them to prevent them gaining a foothold.\n“More and more people are questioning what it is because they started putting their logo up. If you look at their logo it isn’t immediately recognisable, it’s not a swastika, but people need to be looking at it as such.\n“North Belfast is a very culturally diverse area and we don’t want anybody with that negative agenda organising here.\n“We can see what they are doing outside City Hall and we can see what they are doing in other countries. North Belfast is a welcoming area and that’s the positivity that we want to promote.\n“Thankfully the Council removed the graffiti almost immediately after I reported it.\n“The people of this area have been very welcoming to families that are here from Syria and other countries. We’re a diverse part of the city and that’s the part of the city that I want to live in and promote.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"name change opposed by belfast celtic society","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nPLANS\n for Sport and Leisure Swifts to change their name to Belfast Celtic suffered a setback yesterday with the news that the Belfast Celtic Society has voiced their opposition to the move. \n\nThe Glen Road Heights outfit announced its intentions to change their name in a statement issued on social media earlier this month, with the aim of “improving the club and improving the footballing prospects for young people in West Belfast”. \n\nHowever, despite approaching the society prior to making their announcement, Sport and Leisure’s plans have been met with opposition from the Belfast Celtic Society. \n\nHaving distanced themselves from the name change in a previous statement, primarily due to their status as a charitable organisation, the Belfast Celtic Society held a full committee meeting yesterday morning (Wednesday) to discuss the matter. \n\n“The Belfast Celtic Society again reiterates that it had no involvement in this venture,” a spokesperson said. “The Society was only made aware of the development 48 hours before the public announcement. \n\n“The Society was surprised by this announcement and the reaction received from both our membership as well as the general sporting public has been overwhelmingly negative. \n\n“Since its foundation almost two decades ago, the Society has been approached on more than one occasion to endorse and support a range of commercial enterprises with the intention of exploiting the name of the club for commercial gain. \n\n“Over this period, our standard response has been that this is contrary to the constitution of the society which is regulated by the Charity Commission.” \n\nThe Society also expressed its concern that the families of the former players of Belfast Celtic were not consulted prior to the announcement. \n\nThe Belfast Celtic Society also claim that the trademark registered by businessman Anthony John Bonnar earlier this year is a new company and is not linked to the old Belfast Celtic Football and Athletic Company. \n\nHowever, speaking to the Andersonstown News, Sport and Leisure chairman Jim Gillen said that while he was disappointed the Belfast Celtic Society hadn’t supported the name change, he stressed that the club will be moving forward with their plans regardless. \n\n“We have everything in place. As of yet, the IFA (Irish Football Association) has yet to rubber-stamp it,” said Gillen. \n\n“We have to go ahead with it. We informed them (the Belfast Celtic Society) and we spoke to a few members. They seemed to think it was a good idea. They’ve obviously put it to their full committee and they have given a different outlook. There’s nothing we can do about that other than trying to change their mind. \n\n“We would like to go ahead with their blessing and indeed the blessing of everybody in West Belfast. We’ll stay positive on what we are trying to achieve.” \n\nSport and Leisure Swifts are set to play their first game of the new season against Armagh City on Saturday, August 18 and are hoping the name change to Belfast Celtic will be approved by the IFA before that fixture.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article36707179.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/012-_Read-Only_%202.jpg","title":"revealed gcse league table for northern ireland 2018 where did your","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Grammar schools dominated the top of the league tables for GCSE results achieved in 2017, taking the top 54 places.\n\n\n\n\nRevealed: Budgets for every Northern Ireland school 2018-19\n\n\n\n\nThe Belfast \u0027s league tables include data on every secondary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe top non-grammar school at GCSE in 2016/17 was St Patrick\u0027s High School, Keady (91.3%), followed by St Colm\u0027s High School in Draperstown (87.7%), and St Patrick\u0027s College, Maghera (85.9%) - just ahead of the top performing controlled non-grammar, Castlederg High School (83.3%).Overall across Northern Ireland in 2016/17, some 70.3% of year 12 pupils achieved five or more GCSEs at grades A*-C (or equivalent) including English and maths.\n\nThis was up 2.4 percentage points from 2015/16.\n\nPeter Dobbin, principal of Assumption Grammar, described its joint topping of the latest league tables as a surprise 85th birthday present for the Co Down school.\n\n\"I am delighted with the phenomenal achievement of our Assumption girls at both GCSE level and A2 level,\" he said.\n\n\"The girls and the staff of Assumption have worked so hard and fully deserve this public recognition of our academic success.\n\n\"However, it is the school\u0027s \u0027Fully Alive\u0027 ethos which underpins every aspect of why Assumption Grammar is such a unique educational establishment and has been since we were first established by the Missionary Sisters of the Assumption 85 years ago this year.\n\n\"This is a surprise birthday present which will bring a smile to all our Assumption girls, past and present.\"\n\nDown High principal Maud Perry said the school was very proud of its results and she paid tribute to the hard work of pupils.\n\n\"We celebrate the many talents and achievements of all our pupils at Down High and we\u0027re very proud of the 100% pass rate at GCSE in both mathematics and English,\" she said.\n\n\"Our motto \u0027nothing is achieved without effort\u0027 reflects our belief that there is no limit to what can be accomplished through hard work.\n\n\"This hard work of staff and pupils, alongside the support of our parents, produced these fantastic results in the 2017 summer exam season.\"\n\nToday\u0027s tables also represent a triumph for south Belfast grammar school Wellington College, which scored 94.7%, significantly above the Northern Ireland average, as it works to be removed from formal intervention.\n\nPrincipal David Castles said: \"We are very proud of the excellent GCSE outcomes our students have attained. This significant improvement is part of our drive at Wellington College to raise standards, engage students and build pathways to success.\n\n\"Excellence in exams is a result of students, staff and parents working together, and these GCSE results give a great foundation for success at A-level and beyond.\"\n\nHow we did sums for the latest league tables\n\nThe Belfast  is the only source of comprehensive league tables showing the results of every post-primary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nWe obtained the data from the Department of Education for A-level and GCSE examinations sat in the 2016/17 academic year and compiled the figures into easy-to-read league tables, ordered from top to bottom. In the GCSE league tables, the Belfast  has used the percentage of pupils in the final year of a level 3 course who achieved five or more GCSEs - including English and Maths -between an A* to C grade in each school as the standard measure.\n\nThe Department of Education does not produce A-level or GCSE league tables and said it does not endorse them.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed transfer test grade intake for northern ireland schools","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

In the 2016/17 academic year 11,570 applications were made for the 8,743 available places at our 63 selective grammars.\n\n\n\n\nNI Transfer Tests: 2017 Grammar Schools’ intake and grade information\n\n\nThis is out of a total of 21,763 pupils who obtained Year 8 places at Northern Ireland\u0027s 199 post-primary schools in September 2017.\n\nToday the Belfast  can reveal what grades or scores it took to get into each of our selective grammars last year.\n\nThis exclusive data was obtained over several months by sending Freedom of Information Act requests to each of the selective grammars.\n\nCurrently there are no official figures provided by the Department of Education, because both the Post Primary Transfer Consortium\u0027s GL assessment and the Association of Quality Education\u0027s (AQE) Common Entrance Assessment are unofficial tests.\n\nOur data for tests sat in the 2016/17 academic year reveal:\n\n\nFive schools which use the AQE system did not accept a score below 100 in September 2017.\n\nFive schools which use the GL system did not accept a grade below an A in September 2017.\n\n30 schools accepted AQE scores, while 26 accepted GL scores, and seven took either.\n\nLagan College, which is partially selective, was the most popular first choice by far, with 456 applications for 200 places.\n\nFriends School Lisburn was one of the toughest schools to get into last September - the lowest score it accepted was 106 (AQE).\n\nThree of the 63 selective grammar schools were not oversubscribed.\n\nThe AQE and GL tests received a total number of 14,491 entries in the 2016/17 academic year - 7,725 sat the AQEs and 6,766 sat the GL tests. An unknown number of pupils sat both tests.\n\nThere are 199 post-primary schools in Northern Ireland, of which 63 are grammars that use academic selection for all or some of their Year 8 intake.\n\n\nLeaders in the AQE and GL organisations told the Belfast  that their entry rates have been steadily increasing over the last decade following the abolition of the old Department of Education-administered 11-plus by former Education Minister Caitriona Ruane in 2008.\n\nAQE chief executive Stephen Connolly said the number of entrants to the test is continuing to rise, with 8,169 pupils registered for the 2017 AQE tests, a rise of almost 6% on 2016 (7,725).\n\nMr Connolly said he can only speculate on the increase, but said he believed it may partly follow a decision by former Education Minister Peter Weir to allow primary schools to prepare pupils to sit transfer tests. That reversed a ruling by his predecessor John O\u0027Dowd, which saw schools receive warning letters from the department over preparing pupils for tests within school hours.\n\n\"That reflects a number of things, that is the steadily increasing primary school age population, also a backwash from the former minister taking the shackles off primary schools and allowing them to openly prepare pupils for transfer tests, and also word of mouth from parent to parent,\" he said. There was also an increase in the number of pupils who sat the PPTC\u0027s GL test, from 6,766 in the 2016/17 academic year to 7,150 in 2017/18.\n\nCarol McCann from the PPTC said parents remained very supportive of the tests.\n\n\"More than 30 schools use the GL test and it is used by a variety of types of school, including grammar and bilateral,\" she said.\n\n\"A number of PPTC schools also register pupils for the AQE test. Regarding the increase in the number of pupils sitting the test in 2017 for entry to post-primary in 2018, it is most likely as a result of a rising primary school population in a number of areas.\n\n\"It is very evident that the transfer test continues to be supported by parents in Northern Ireland who believe in educational choice.\"\n\nMeanwhile, talks between the two transfer test providers to create a single system of assessment remain \"ongoing and positive\".\n\nThe AQE and PPTC aim to have a common test in place by November 2019. Mr Connolly said that talks are continuing but the end goal is very complex, and they want to ensure any new single system is robust, will have the confidence of parents, and is of an international standard.\n\n\"The two negotiating teams made a very good decision at the outset to keep it confidential to not raise expectation or increase pressures and making sure the goodwill between us in this difficult process is maintained,\" he said. \"Trying to put together a single system is very difficult.\n\n\"I think it is very important that both groups think it is a matter of principle there should be one system.\n\n\"That principle has been agreed, but getting there is tricky simply because of the complexity of the two systems. People need to have confidence in schools, but also in the testing system.\n\n\"It needs to be reliable, robust and meet international standards. It isn\u0027t just a race to cobble together any old compromise, we are engaging in careful negotiation.\" Results for both tests are due to be released to pupils this Saturday.\n\nHow the figures are compiled\n\nUnder the Freedom of Information Act (FoI) legislation we asked the grammar schools in Northern Ireland which use academic selection to determine their Year 8 intake to provide the breakdown of the AQE/GL grades/scores achieved by the pupils they admitted in September 2017.\n\nThe data gives schools’ name, location, the highest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted and the lowest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted.\n\nOther information included is the number of first preference choices it received and total applications (which includes first, second, third choices etc).\n\nSeveral schools have provided bands for the lowest and highest scores they accepted, as this is the method they used to select pupils. Some schools accept both AQE and GL scores.\n\nNot all schools use academic selection to determine their entire intake. Wallace High School in Lisburn admits around 90% of its Year 8 intake on test results Campbell College in Belfast admits 70%, while Lagan College in Belfast and Slemish College in Ballymena select 35% of their pupils using test scores. Some other schools also use additional criteria to separate students with the same score vying for the final places. Two voluntary grammar schools, Loreto College in Coleraine and St Patrick’s Grammar in Armagh, no longer use academic selection.\n\nTotal pupil figures do not tally for a number of reasons, which can include pupils with a statement of special educational needs not being included in enrolment figures, and some pupils being accepted through special circumstances or on appeal.\n\nIn some schools pupils were admitted without using academic selection and some schools were undersubscribed.\n\nWhen comparing schools, the size should be taken into account. For example Glenlola Collegiate in Bangor has an annual Year 8 intake of 157 pupils. Its principal Mr W E Thompson pointed out that the 157th pupil they accepted in September 2017 scored 85 in the AQE test, but in the North Down area there are smaller selective grammars which accepted only 100 pupils.\n\nHe has asked us to point out that the 100th pupil Glenlola accepted scored 98 in the AQE tests.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast black bins may be collected just once a month","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

A consultation sets out a range of options for the future of recycling and household waste collection.\n\n\n\n\nRevealed: 10 most affluent areas in Northern Ireland\n\n\n\n\n\nRevealed: Northern Ireland\u0027s 10 most deprived areas\n \n\n\n\nOne is a four-weekly collection cycle for black bins, which hold general household waste. A second option is a three-weekly collection cycle and a third proposal would be a smaller black bin for general household waste, collected fortnightly.\n\nAny changes would be controversial, but UUP councillor Jim Rodgers said it is an opportunity for residents to have their say.\n\n\"We don\u0027t want anyone to think this is a fait accompli. We need to hear the views as we\u0027re lagging behind other areas and despite council efforts a lot of people are still being lazy when it comes to filling their bins,\" he said.\n\n\"We have made major strides in recent years on recycling, but we have to meet a target of increasing the city\u0027s recycling rate to 50% by December 2020.\n\n\"If we don\u0027t the council will face fines and that\u0027s money which could be better spent improving facilities elsewhere.\"\n\nAnalysis shows that around half of the waste in black bins could be recycled.\n\nCouncillor Kate Nicholl, chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s people and communities committee, said: \"Providing recycling and waste collection for residents is one of the council\u0027s most critical services, so it\u0027s important for us to get it right.\n\n\"We are already spending over £26m each year managing our waste - and by collecting our recyclables more efficiently we could have better quality recycling materials we could create more jobs, and money spent on managing our waste could be better spent on investment in the city and other council services.\"\n\nThe council operates four different recycling systems across Belfast and residents are being asked for their feedback on proposals to move to one city-wide recycling collection.\n\nMs Nicholl added: \"Depending on what part of Belfast you live in, you might have a kerbside recycling box collection, or you might have a blue and brown bin for recycling household waste.\n\n\"We have done well to raise our recycling rate over the past 10 years to around 44% however, we have now reached a plateau. Often the blue bin waste we collect contains contaminated items, meaning it cannot be recycled locally and needs to be shipped on for sorting and treatment.\n\n\"Council is proposing to introduce a weekly recycling collection which would accept a wider range of materials than the current blue bin collection.\n\n\"It would also provide all Belfast residents with a weekly kerbside glass collection, and all food waste would be collected weekly also.\"\n\nResidents can respond to the consultation online before October 7.\n\nA series of information roadshows will be held in September and October.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"drought helps moira castle reveal its secrets as foundations reappear","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The grounds were used for hundreds of mounted troops preparing for the Battle of the Boyne.\n\n\"Residents in the castle also played significant roles in Irish history and one child born there (Francis Rawdon-Hastings) became Governor General of India.\n\n\"There are very few images of the castle, so seeing the foundations is a wonderful glimpse of the scale of the building and its exact location.\n\n\"I would love to see some archaeological excavation undertaken and to explore the possibility of something like inlaid bricks in the ground marking the foundations so that the footprint of the castle is always visible to visitors to the demesne.\"\n\nDr Ciaran Toal, research officer at the Irish Linen Centre and Lisburn Museum, said an archaeologist will be enlisted by Lisburn and Castlereagh Council later this week to survey the site.\n\nHe is optimistic that significant interest has already been generated around the foundations.\n\n\"We already have quite a bit of knowledge around the history of the demesne,\" but we will be using this opportunity to further research this location,\" he said.\n\n\"We know Major Edward Burgh purchased the site of the current Moira Demesne in 1639 and is believed to \u0027have built a fine brick house at Moyragh\u0027 in 1651. But early 19th century written accounts suggest the house was in ruins by the 1830s. \n\n\"We\u0027ll keep residents informed of the research.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"ian paisley electoral office reveals number of signatures needed to call byelection","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They are really cute - they look like a Chihuahua with overgrown ears.\n\n\"They make a great pet and are just as intelligent as a dog.\n\n\"They love human interaction and they can\u0027t be caged, they can be kept at home just like a dog but they need good space to run around in.\"\n\nMr Potter said that the arrival of the tiny foxes has generated a lot of interest, but they would need a very particular home environment.\n\nHe said: \"We\u0027ve had lots of enquiries but they won\u0027t suit everyone. They need a lot of interaction and exercise so if someone is working everyday it wouldn\u0027t suit them.\"\n\nThe foxes are also easy to feed as they will eat most domesticated food including chicken and fruit and they are also partial to insects.\n\nThey can live up to 16 years.\n\nMr Potter, who has come under fire in the past from animal rights campaigners about keeping exotic animals, added: \"We just want to offer people something different.\n\n\"There is a black market out there and that is why we exist, to make sure these animals come through the proper channels and not dodgy breeders. \n\n\"That\u0027s why we do what we do, to try and eliminate the black market, and it\u0027s about placing the animals with the right people and teaching them how to look after them.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"bp hikes dividend for first time in four years","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

This reflects not just our commitment to growing distributions to shareholders but our confidence in the future.”\n\nPayouts for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, which rocked the company in 2010, were 2.4 billion US dollars (£1.8 billion) for the six-month period, down by 1.9 billion US dollars (£1.4 billion) year-on-year.\n\nNet debt at June 30 was 39.3 billion dollars (£29.9 billion), down from 39.8 billion (£30.3 billion) at the same point last year.\n\nWith oil prices on the rise, BP’s fuels business reported an underlying replacement cost profit of 2.5 billion US dollars (£1.9 billion), up from 2.1 billion US dollars (£1.6 billion) in 2017.\n\nFiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said BP’s debt pile remained “pretty cumbersome” and that investors were right to be wary about it.\n\nNicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Like Shell, BP is back to something that might almost be considered normal.\n\n“Cash generation is slightly lower than analysts had hoped for, and is being propped up by asset sales to some degree, but has still proven enough to fund necessary capital investment and increase the dividend.\n\n“With payments relating to the Deepwater Horizon disaster falling and oil prices bouncing, the future looks brighter for BP than it has for some time.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"heatwave knocks thomas cook profits","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

[]).push({})\n\n\nThe group said holidaymakers had been enjoying record temperatures at home in June and July, which has knocked late bookings for package holidays.\n\nIt cautioned this was set to see annual earnings now come in at the lower end of market expectations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChief executive Peter Fankhauser said customers have been enjoying the warm weather at home (Thomas Cook)\n\n\n\n\nThe soaring temperatures seen across the UK, Ireland and Europe over the past two months have caused a headache for travel firms and airlines, with low cost airline easyJet also warning earlier this month that late bookings might be impacted.\n\nIt is a particular blow for Thomas Cook, given that it makes all of its annual profits in the summer months.\n\nThe downgrade comes as Thomas Cook is reportedly looking to spin off its airline arm and sell a stake to an outside investor to slash debts.\n\nThird-quarter figures for the travel group showed gross profit fell 3% to £443 million in the three months to June 30, while underlying earnings rose 8% to £14 million.\n\nBookings for summer 2018 were 11% higher overall as airline bookings offset a more sluggish market for package holidays.\n\nThomas Cook said group tour operator summer 2018 bookings were flat, while they rose 1% in the UK.\n\nIt said UK package holiday prices were 7% higher as it sought to offset surging hotel inflation in the Spanish market.\n\nThe Thomas Cook airline business saw a 15% rise in bookings, with demand for short-haul offsetting a decline in long-haul flight bookings.\n\nPeter Fankhauser, chief executive of Thomas Cook, said the airline boost helped it weather a slowdown in package holiday bookings in recent weeks, “with customers across our European markets delaying decisions about their summer holidays as they enjoy the record temperatures at home”.\n\nHe added: “It’s clear that we remain in a competitive environment, particularly in the UK where the growth in popularity of higher-margin destinations like Turkey and Egypt has not fully offset the continued pressure on margins to Spanish holidays.”\n\nRebecca Lane, an analyst at Jefferies, said the downgrade signalled that Thomas Cook is now expecting earnings of around £324 million for the full year.\n\nShe also warned “we remain vigilant to competitors’ commentary and bookings data through August” as the heatwave is set to impact across the travel industry.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"12 intriguing statistics social media users would love to know about","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo

Their latest creation turns a workshop project into something a little different.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat video took the brothers almost two months to make, and the effort and creativity that goes into producing an effect that might last a mere blink of an eye is remarkable.\n\n“The most difficult effect was probably the table saw shot, (that only lasts a couple seconds!)” Matthew, half of the team, told the Press Association. “One of us had to be the ‘puppet’, and pretend to be cutting the wood, moving it in tiny increments each picture. \n\n“The other brother was taking the board out each picture and adjusting the pieces so it gave the illusion of being cut by the saw, while at the same time using his other hand to jiggle the saw each picture while the shutter opened on the camera, to give the illusion that the saw was spinning.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(BrickBrosProductions)\n\n\n\n\nMatthew added: “Most creative use of Lego in it? The painting bits were pretty cool.\n\n“Using stop motion and Lego together made for some really interesting paint shots. The blocks are painted one at a time, but I think that adds to the charm of the whole thing.”\n\nAs you might guess from the name: Lego In Real Life 3, there is more where that came from – with the brothers’ first video in the series shooting to viral stardom with millions of views online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“We love to use stop motion as our film making outlet because it allows us to tell stories with such a real feel,” Matthew said. “The final product can have a rough and gritty feel to it, or a clean and pristine feel. \n\n“Whatever you want it to, you have complete control over.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(BrickBrosProductions)\n\n\n\n\nThe brothers’ work has earned them over 140,000 YouTube subscribers, so the animation is brilliant and there’s an appetite for it – but can we expect more of the same from the talented pair? \n\n“Possibly,” said Matthew. “We have a few more potentially planned, but unfortunately, ‘real life in real life’ has us both pretty busy.\n\n“We both enjoy making these films, and we hope to make more. It has been such a great experience working with our sibling on this sort of thing, and having such a big audience that actually wants to watch the stuff we make!”\n\nIf you’d like to see more from BrickBrosProductions, check out their \nYouTube channel\n or follow them on \nInstagram\n. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch lionel messi ruthlessly lob his dog with a football over and over again","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

I am delighted by the high turnout and citizen engagement so far. The information from our reps on the ground is extremely positive! Waiting patiently for official results as per the constitution.\n— President of Zimbabwe (@edmnangagwa) \nJuly 31, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nWinning resoundingly...We now have results from the majority of the over 10 000 polling stations. We’ve done exceedingly well. Awaiting ZEC to perform their constitutional duty to officially announce the people’s election results and we are ready to form the next gvt.\n#Godisinit\n\n— Nelson Chamisa (@nelsonchamisa) \nJuly 31, 2018\n\n\n\n\nMore than 5.5 million people were registered to vote and turnout was about 70%.\n\nBoth candidates issued upbeat assessments of how they did, though said they were waiting for the electoral commission to make the final announcement as required by law.\n\n“I am delighted by the high turnout and citizen engagement so far,” Mr Mnangagwa tweeted.\n\nMr Chamisa said he had his own results from most of the nearly 11,000 polling stations, though said he would wait for the official tally.\n\nThe election featured a record number of more than 20 presidential candidates and nearly 130 political parties vying for parliamentary seats. If no presidential candidate wins more than 50% of the vote, a run-off will be held on September 8.\n\nWestern election observers were in Zimbabwe, reflecting a freer political environment since the November resignation of Mr Mugabe, who had ruled since independence from white minority rule in 1980.\n\nBut there were concerns about bias in state media coverage of the election, a lack of transparency in ballot printing and reports of intimidation by pro-government local leaders who are supposed to stay neutral.\n"}]
