something Labour has cast doubt on saying that hundreds of thousands of tests had already been carried out in the UK by mid-April. He also tried to bat away questions by suggesting they are best considered in the public inquiry, which will not begin until next year. \u0027There will be a time when we can go into this in detail,\u0027 he said. Earlier, Mr Hancock told the Commons that Mr Cummings\u0027 barrage of allegations - including that he lied repeatedly, failed care home residents and should have been \u0027sacked daily\u0027 - were \u0027not true\u0027 and he had been \u0027straight with people\u0027.  Mr Cummings said Mr Hancock \u0027categorically\u0027 told colleagues in March that people would be tested before being returned to homes.But the former aide said they \u0027subsequently found out that that hadn\u0027t happened\u0027. According to ITV, Mr Cummings has documents showing the PM\u0027s office summoned Mr Hancock to No10 on May 3 last year, for a meeting the following day, to explain whether he had misled the chief aide, the PM and then Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill on the testing of patients before discharge into care homes, as well as about further testing of residents and staff.The DoH said it \u0027did not recognise\u0027 the claim and Mr Hancock \u0027had many meetings with the PM across a range of issues\u0027. Mr Hancock was asked yesterday if he could say he protected care homes, and was also pressed if he made the commitment on testing.He replied: \u0027We worked as hard as we could to protect people who live in care homes, and of course those who live in care homes are some of the most vulnerable to this disease because by its nature it attacks and has more of an impact on older people.\u0027Now when it comes to the testing of people as they left hospital and went into care homes, we committed to building the testing capacity to allow that to happen.\u0027Of course it then takes time to build testing capacity.\u0027In fact, one of the critical things we did was set the 100,000 target back then to make sure we built that testing capacity and it was very effective in doing so.\u0027And then we were able to introduce the policy of testing everybody before going into care homes, but we could only do that once we had the testing capacity which I had to build, because we didn\u0027t have it in this country from the start.\u0027We started with a capacity of less than 2,000 in March last year and got to 100,000 tests a day.\u0027And we set all of this out at the time in public documents. It\u0027s all a matter of public record.\u0027On a visit to Colchester hospital yesterday, Mr Johnson said the government faced an \u0027incredibly difficult series of decisions, none of which we have taken lightly\u0027 and \u0027at every stage we have been governed by a determination to protect life\u0027. Challenged whether the government\u0027s failures had cost tens of thousands of lives as Mr Cummings claims, he said: \u0027No I don\u0027t think so. But, of course, this has been an incredibly difficult series of decisions, none of which we\u0027ve taken lightly.\u0027 He said the situation in care homes - where more than 40,000 deaths were linked to Covid - was \u0027tragic\u0027, but added: \u0027We did everything we could to protect the NHS and to protect care homes as well.\u0027He said: \u0027I think it\u0027s important for us to focus on what really matters to the people of this country.\u0027I think, if I may say so, that some of the commentary I have heard doesn\u0027t bear any relation to reality.\u0027What people want us to get on with is delivering the road map and trying – cautiously – to take our country forward through what has been one of the most difficult periods that I think anybody can remember.\u0027 Summoned to answer an urgent question in the House yesterday morning, Mr Hancock said: \u0027These unsubstantiated allegations around honesty are not true. \u0027I have been straight with people in public and in private throughout.\u0027 Mr Hancock also dismissed Mr Cummings\u0027 criticism of his testing target, saying it was \u0027how you get stuff done in government\u0027.\u0027I am proud of everyone in my department,\u0027 he said. In a brutal swipe at the ex-No10 chief, who was ousted from Downing Street in November, he said people can see that over the past six months \u0027governing has become a little easier and we have been able to deliver\u0027. Tory MPs rallied round Mr Hancock in the chamber, with William Wragg slamming the \u0027irony\u0027 of criticism from Mr Cummings, and Peter Bone dismissing him as an \u0027unelected Spad who broke Covid regulations\u0027. Mr Bone said the premier\u0027s mistake was that he \u0027didn\u0027t fire Dominic Cummings early enough\u0027.  Red Wall MP Dehenna Davison also made her feelings clear as she asked a question by video link with a \u0027Barnard Castle eye test\u0027 chart in the background.   Government sources have called the onslaught from Mr Cummings a \u0027character assassination\u0027 that was \u0027not backed by evidence\u0027.Senior Tories told MailOnline that the former No10 chief was engaged in epic \u0027score settling\u0027 and had a \u0027selective memory\u0027. \u0027He should really have words with whoever was in charge last year,\u0027 one said wryly. Mr Hancock told the Commons yesterday: \u0027Every day since I began working on the response to this pandemic last January, I\u0027ve got up each morning and asked: \u0027What must I do to protect life?\u0027\u0027That is the job of the Health Secretary in a pandemic.\u0027We\u0027ve taken an approach of openness, transparency and explanation of both what we know and of what we don\u0027t know.\u0027He said he had updated the House 60 times during pandemic, and \u0027answered questions from colleagues, the media and the public\u0027.Launching a dramatic bid to bring down the Prime Minister and the Health Secretary on Wednesday, Mr Cummings blamed a toxic mix of complacency and indecision for the needless deaths.He told MPs that senior ministers and advisers, including himself, had fallen \u0027disastrously short\u0027, adding: \u0027When the public needed us most, the Government failed. Tens of thousands of people died, who didn\u0027t need to die.\u0027In an extraordinary seven-hour performance, Mr Cummings launched attacks on Mr Johnson, his fiancée Carrie Symonds and Mr Hancock over their personal conduct during the crisis. Mr Cummings claimed the Prime Minister was \u0027unfit for the job\u0027 and could not lead Britain out of the pandemic.He said the Health Secretary \u0027should have been fired for at least 15 to 20 things, including lying\u0027. He alleged Mr Hancock had lied to the PM over the disastrous policy of not testing older people for Covid before they were discharged from hospital into care homes. The former No10 aide outlined a series of failings by him and the \u0027smoking ruin\u0027 Department for Health, including lying in January last year that pandemic preparations were brilliant when they were \u0027completely hollow\u0027."},{"url":null,"title":"More half Britons NOT hugged friend relative restrictions eased","story":"Share this article However, the R\u0026ampWS poll for MailOnline shows that most people understand how it works and what the restrictions are.Two two-thirds (67 per cent) said they understood the guidance, against a third (33 per cent) who did not. And more than six-in-10 (61 per cent) understood that travel to amber list countries like France, Spain and Italy was against Government guidelines but not illegal.Just 8 per cent though it was still illegal and 10 per cent didn\u0027t know what the situation was.More than half 53 per cent said the traffic light system was easy to understand but 39 per cent thought it was confusing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f1447c0ae5577ba491ad14de3a18249bda0d06a/534_0_3780_2270/master/3780.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=5e181240c6d62c1edf207eda01bb12c5","title":"from basslines to waveforms how tiktok taught me the basics of music production","story":"In 2013, I learned to DJ, which allowed me to channel my love for music into curating playlists and sharing my passion publicly. However, in all the time that I’ve been immersed in music in its many different forms, I’ve never attempted to make my own. I had a keyboard when I was nine or 10, but that was as far as it went. The closest I came to getting into music production was when I worked at a music school and I was allowed to take a production course for free. But, sadly, I had to drop out because I had so much going on in my personal life. But the hunger is still there. I’ll often play tunes on my 21-month-old daughter’s musical toys. However, when it comes to trying my hand at music production, I struggle to know where to begin. There is an abundance of information available online, from simple beginners lessons, all the way up to advanced masterclasses for those wishing to brush up on their engineering skills. With the advancement and democratisation of music production technology over the past couple of decades, bedroom producers are commonplace and many of those who’ve become adept at making music kindly share their experiences online. Finding something relevant to meet my needs proves a tad overwhelming, however, and I get lost in a sea of waveforms, EQ tips and info on achieving a decent level of dB. So I turn to TikTok, using simple hashtag searches. The hashtag #MusicProductionBeginners brings up a host of user-generated videos that really help cut through the noise, so to speak. One of the producers I encounter is Kade, who posts TikTok videos under the handle @musicbykade. He manages to break down how music production works in perhaps the simplest way I’ve ever heard, hailing the convenience of loops – little repetitive clips of music that can be used as the foundation for myriad genres. For me, I was angling to try my hand at a bit of “doof doof” – loud electronic music centred on a bass-heavy kick drum. Kade’s video uses GarageBand, free software for Apple Mac users, but I use another free platform called Waveform. The basic premise and layout for most production software is the same, so I follow his succinctly delivered tip to download some loops, put them into Waveform and get started. He recommends a site called cymatics.fm, where there are free loops and I start downloading house music samples to finally take my first baby steps into the world of production. Another TikTok creator, Mikey C, drops a gem in his own series of production tips: “Here’s my best advice for first-time producers – your first songs are not going to be hits, so don’t spend forever on them,” he says. Nothing technical there, but it’s solid gold for anyone who has lofty ambitions and feels frustrated when they can’t match up to their favourite artist. Learning the basics is about exploration and experimentation, not relentlessly overworking your very first attempt at a track – Mikey C’s video was less than 30 seconds long, but his tip probably saved me hours and hours of fruitless tinkering. Another of his videos suggests reaching the chorus of a song within 45 seconds. “Anything later is going to be too long of a wait and you’re going to lose listeners,” he says. While I’m nowhere near making a song yet, it’s incredibly useful to have an experienced producer share a key tip that’s easily remembered. On my hashtag travels, I stop off at Sarah Maddack’s account. Maddack has more than a million followers and describes herself as “the silliest rapper you know”. Her comedic approach is immediately disarming. Not afraid to laugh at herself, she explains how to create the sound of a “crowd” screaming by recording different types of screams with your own voice, and then layering them to create a multi-scream, group effect. I have a microphone, which I usually use to record podcasts and radio shows, so I decide to put it to use in my new producer “lab” and record my own voice. Another video I find incredibly helpful is a demonstration of how to make field recordings from TikTok creator Arthur Caplan. “You’ve reached sound design TikTok,” says the text on his video. There’s no talking, just text explaining what he’s doing. So I take my dictaphone outside to get some recordings of the trains going past on the local line, birds chirping in the trees, and the trusty sounds of people running. The simplicity of the tips I discover on TikTok have helped me take the plunge into a world that I had always felt some trepidation towards. I’ve learned that music production doesn’t have to be this grand expedition, where you spend hours meticulously arranging and creating sounds. It can be as basic as recording the sound of leaves blowing in the wind, grabbing some premade loops and basslines, talking into a mic, uploading it all into your production software and simply having fun with it. Just don’t ask me to play any of the “music” I’ve made so far. "},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown is lifting could tiktok help you re learn how to socialise","story":"The reality was, as much as I longed to see my friends and my family, the thought of getting back out there was a daunting prospect. Feelings of self-doubt and a sudden lack of confidence consumed me. Like many people, I’ve been wondering how to actually socialise again. My anxiety levels have skyrocketed. Lockdown has played tricks with my ego and confidence. The question has been what to do about it. As a busy mum-of-three, I don’t exactly have bags of spare time. During lockdown I’d become intrigued by TikTok. I’d looked at some of the uplifting videos that had gone viral and grabbed the whole world’s attention. But I sensed there was more to TikTok than just dance fads. Could its wealth of videos about every subject under the sun help me regain my social skills and self-confidence? I start my exploration of motivational TikTok videos by granting myself permission for some basic “me time”. Given my hectic schedule, I’ve never really been one for so-called “me time” – but watching and listening to some everyday women with little sprinklings of genius on TikTok really made me stop and think: hold on, it is actually about me. “You can’t give to your family from an empty cup,” explains TikTok creator @ivanarichey – one of her many short and snappy pearls of wisdom. I scoffed at it at first, and thought what a cliche. But then I realised that, actually, if I go down, then pretty much the whole ship goes down too. From then on, whenever I could grab five minutes in between the school run and dinnertime, I’d have a quick browse at some other motivational accounts to give me that extra perk I needed to make it through to bedtime. “Compliment yourself, praise yourself,” says TikTok creator @spencer.barbosa, whose motivational gems and quick and quirky style tips will perk you up in an instant. Another of her quotes that I loved was: “You don’t have to be the best, just be the best version of yourself.” I don’t know what it was that made me more receptive to heeding advice in this format. It could have been the sincerity and authenticity of the TikTok creators themselves. It could have been their uplifting vibe or disarming humour. Or it could have been the snappy, no-nonsense format. But pretty soon, I was hooked. I honestly hadn’t actually realised until now just how important and effective it is to consciously lift yourself up, dust off that crown, and so on. Suddenly, the prospect of seeing my friends and socialising again after nearly 18 months didn’t seem so daunting. One of the things I used to love doing before lockdown was get a makeover in the lead-up to a glam event. Given that this has not been an option for quite some time, I wondered if I’d ever be glam again and didn’t want to shock people when they saw me in person. I realised I was a far cry from my filtered image on social media. So I started scrolling for quick makeovers for those of us with not much time to spare. And @thepatriciabright was just the tonic I needed to give me the lift to get my face back on and get back out there. Her videos were great for providing seemingly instant glam, and they were so funny, too – especially when she teamed up with her hubby for a parody clip. It’s amazing what a sprinkling of gold dust over your cheekbones can do. And makeup artist @dominiqueallison taught me some awesome mum tricks to hide those bags by putting a slick of concealer on over your foundation. She also whipped up some funky retro looks for when we are allowed to go #outout again. I’m also a big fan of videos posted by @jaimykoroma and @werejagreeneyes, which had me in hysterics with her life hacks in ultra-short, 10-second videos. A change was coming and it didn’t have to be scary. Something remarkable was happening. Thanks to TikTok, I realised I could love life – and myself – after lockdown.

The prince said those attending the symposium shared an ambition “to help those for whom the mental anguish and physical challenges of long Covid have been devastating”. He added: “When we work together with a common interest we can build on each other’s ideas and, perhaps, build a roadmap to hope and healing.” Speaking to attendees at the event co-organised by the Yoga In Healthcare Alliance and the Give Back Yoga university, the Prince of Wales also acknowledged his own brush with Covid in March last year, saying: “I seem to have got away with it quite lightly … unfortunately, that is not the case for millions of people in the UK and across the globe.” “We have decided to go ahead with the Nordics first, it’s a priority for us,” the minister, Mikael Damberg, said. Travelers from other countries within the EU will still have to show a negative test until 30 June, Reuters reports. Travelers from outside the EU are still banned.Reuters has the story: “The corona passport we present today can be used from 1 July when you can travel within the EU,” said finance minister Nicolai Vammen. AP has the story: However, there have been warnings from across Europe that vaccine certificates could create a form of “medical apartheid”. Last month, more than 1,200 church leaders in the UK said in a letter they are an “unethical form of coercion” and would strengthen the “surveillance state”. The Valencia keeper will miss the preparations on the Algarve, which include a friendly international against Scotland on Wednesday. “The medical staff of the Dutch team are monitoring his condition closely and as soon as it is medical responsible, he will be drafted back into the squad,” a statement from the Dutch football association said. Marco Bizot, who was not named in the final 26-man squad by coach Frank de Boer, was already scheduled to travel to the camp in Portugal as a standby keeper, so no replacement is necessary, Reuters reports.But vaccines have still been denied to many doctors, dentists and medical workers in private medicine – and also some physicians in public institutions. More health workers have died during the pandemic in Mexico than any other country in the hemisphere, according to the Pan-American Health Organisation. Organisers said they would now wait to take a decision on whether to allow local fans at the Games until the period ends on 20 June. AFP reports that fans from overseas have already been barred, in an unprecedented decision. Japan has seen a comparatively small virus outbreak, with around 12,500 deaths, and has avoided tough lockdowns. But a fourth wave has prompted the government to put emergency measures in place in 10 regions including the capital. The measures mostly limit the sale of alcohol in bars and restaurants and ask them to close early, while encouraging telework and capping audience numbers at events. “The number of new cases has been declining since the middle of the month but the situation continues to be uncertain,” said prime minister Yoshihide Suga, announcing the extension. Tokyo 2020 chief Seiko Hashimoto told reporters that with the measures being taken “we expect the infection situation to improve.” But she acknowledged that a decision on local fans, originally expected in early June, would now not be taken until the end of the month. “Once the state of emergency is lifted, we will assess how many spectators we can allow in,” she said, adding that there could be different rules for indoor and outdoor venues and the decision would be based on government guidelines. Even under the current state of emergency, sports venues in Japan are allowed to seat 5,000 spectators or 50 percent capacity, whichever is smallest. Late last year, the Russian government granted Russian drugmaker Pharmasyntez a compulsory licence for one year to manufacture the anti-Covid-19 drug remdesivir under a different name without creator Gilead Science’s permission. Pharmasyntez had asked the Kremlin to allow it to produce a generic version of remdesivir before the decree was issued. Now, Russia’s supreme court has rejected a lawsuit from the US company that challenged the Russian government decision to let the firm develop and market the drug without their consent. Reuters reports that the government said in a decree at the time that the move was in the interests of Russia’s own security. According to the decree, Russia had to pay compensation to the drug’s patent-holder. The amount was not specified. Vikram Punia, its director, said the company had also written to Gilead in July last year to try to obtain their consent in the form of a voluntary licence, but had not heard back. Pharmasyntez produces remdesivir under the name Remdeform. A shipment of the drug was sent by Russia to India on Tuesday as part of a delivery of humanitarian aid.

It was not immediately clear how many Filipinos bound for Saudi Arabia would be directly affected. Saudi Arabia was the most preferred destination of overseas Filipino workers in 2019, government data showed, hosting one out of five Filipinos who landed jobs abroad during that year.Facilities hurriedly prepared residents for rushed vaccines on Friday as the commonwealth raced to vaccinate neglected populations within the highest priority group it had initially promised to two months ago. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, had said on Thursday there were 74 residential aged care homes across Australia that had not yet received an initial dose of Covid vaccine, including 16 in Victoria. But he went on a media blitz on Friday morning insisting every aged care home in the state would have received at least one dose by the weekend. The government’s push to vaccinate the remaining aged care homes in Victoria came a day after Hunt announced the recommended two-week interval between flu and Covid shots would be scrapped for aged care settings in Victoria. The operator of one aged care home in Melbourne, who asked not to be identified, told  Australia they were surprised to learn vaccination teams were being sent to their facility on Friday. It presented logistical hurdles to prepare residents at such short notice, they said.

Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

Despite calls from the restaurant industry to allow indoor dining in all restaurants from early June, along with the reopening of hotels, Ministers are due to announce that indoor hospitality for pubs and and restaurants will reopen on July 5th. The Restaurant Association of Ireland said on Thursday it would be challenging the Government’s decision to allow indoor dining among hotel guests ahead of restaurants, gastro pubs and cafes.TravelInternational travel is expected to resume from July 19th after Ministers discussed on Thursday evening operationalising the EU Digital Green Certificate from that date. Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said on Friday morning that Europe would be introducing the travel scheme from July 1st and would allow around six weeks for members states to introduce the travel cert. The digital green cert will allow people to travel if they are fully vaccinated, have a negative PCR test or can show they have recently recovered from Covid-19. France, Belgium and Luxembourg will be taken off the list for mandatory hotel quarantine, leaving just Turkey on the State’s European red list. Mandatory hotel quarantine is expected to continue beyond July 19th for those travelling from designated red list zones who are not fully vaccinated or do not have a negative PCR test. Large gatheringsAlso from July, the numbers permitted at outdoor organised events are expected to increase to a maximum of 100 attendees at the majority of venues. For larger venues, such as outdoor stadia or other ‘fixed’ outdoor venues with a minimum capacity of 5,000, this could rise to 200. It is understood Nphet have recommended that up to 5,000 spectators will be able to attend outdoor events in large stadia such as Croke Park from August 2nd, while smaller outdoor venues would have a limit of 500 people. Indoor events in larger venues could have a capacity of 200 while smaller indoor venues would be limited to 100 people, it is understood.The number of guests at a wedding reception will rise to 50 people indoors in July, which will then increase to 100 in August, under the Nphet recommendations.

Mr Reid said the number varies from a worst case of 64,000 to a best case of 235,000.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireThere was a “very positive conversation” about internatinal travel at the Cabinet sub-committee on Covid last night, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has said.The Cabinet will today sign off on a new schedule for the reopening of social and economic life that is expected to include reopening on July 5th of indoor hospitality for pubs and restaurants and the resumption of international travel from July 19th.Mr Donnelly said the Cabinet was looking “very carefully” at how to facilitate travel between Ireland and Britain.Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said although there will be different regimes for travel from the US and UK to the EU digital green pass system, the “same broad approach will apply”.Earlier Leo Varadkar said Ireland is “not in a position to restore the Common Travel Area yet” due to “real concerns” about the spread of the Indian variant of the Covid-19 virus in Britain.Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme, Mr Varadkar said international travel within the EU would resume in mid-July under the new digital green pass system but that the full reopening of travel with the Britain was not possible in June because of concerns around the prevalence of the Indian variant that now accounts for more than 50 per cent of cases in Britain.He said there would be a phased return to international travel through the summer months but that it was “not going to be international travel as you knew it”.“There will be restrictions, requirements around vaccines and testings,” he said, adding there would also be different rules in place for different countries.Mr Varadkar confirmed Belgium, France and Luxembourg were being taken off the mandatory hotel quarantine list but cautioned that any person booking a holiday abroad should recognise the Covid-19 situation could change and result in their destination becoming a red zone.NphetThe State’s public health team last night cleared the way for the expected easing of Covid-19 restrictions throughout the summer.In a letter to Government, the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) provided a broadly positive update and gave the green light for the return of indoor hospitality in restaurants and pubs from July 5th, the return of cinemas in June, indoor dining from July and the opening up of travel .The team confirmed that, as planned, hotels could reopen on June 2nd and outdoor hospitality could reopen from June 7th.From July, the numbers permitted at outdoor organised events can increase to a maximum of 100 attendees at the majority of venues, Nphet also recommended. For larger venues such as outdoor stadia or other “fixed” outdoor venues with a minimum capacity of 5,000 this could rise to 200.The number of guests at a wedding reception will rise to 50 people indoors in July, which will then increase to 100 in August, under the Nphet recommendations.Nphet is also understood to have recommended that up to 5,000 spectators can attend outdoor events in large stadia such as Croke Park from August 2nd, while smaller outdoor venues would have a limit of 500 people. Indoor events in larger venues could have a capacity of 200. Smaller indoor venues would be limited to 100 people, it is understood.The Cabinet will sign off today on the plan after the three party leaders are meeting this morning to finalise the measures discussed at last night’s Cabinet sub-committee.Mr Varadkar said he remained confident about the pace of the vaccine rollout despite the significant shortfalls in the supply of vaccines, including potentially a big reduction in the expected numbers of the single-dose Johnson \u0026amp Johnson shot.While the State will not meet the initial target of making the vaccine available to 82 per cent of adults by the end of June, it will still reach “the mid 70s percentage”, said the Tánaiste. The shortfall would be made up in July, he added.“We now expect by the end of the July that 2.5 million people will be fully vaccinated,” he said. “That’s more than 60 per cent of the population fully vaccinated.”Asked to explain the Government’s decision to reopen hotel dining ahead of indoor dining in restaurants and pubs, Mr Varadkar said the decision was “really more practical rather than scientific”.“The gap between indoor and outdoor dining will not be big, it’s only a matter of a few weeks,” he said. He added that unvaccinated people would be able to attend outdoor sporting and cultural events from August as the reopening continues, with the focus remaining on social distancing and good hygiene. Proof of vaccination will only be required for travel, he said.Asked whether he believed there would be a fourth wave of the virus, Mr Varadkar said it was a question of how big another wave could be and what impact it would have on hospitalisations and deaths.“Even with that variant in Britain they’re not seeing a huge increase in hospitalisations and deaths because the vaccines are effective, he said. “But still a lot of people in Ireland are not vaccinated so that’s why we’ll be relatively cautious.”International travelAlso speaking on Morning Ireland, Mr Ryan, said the management of queuing and crowds in airports would be very important as international travel reopens in July.The Minister stopped short of confirming that international travel would resume on July 19th, saying the details would be announced following today’s cabinet meeting, but said the changes would come into effect “in that sort of time frame”.He noted that the EU would introduce its digital green pass system from July 1st and allow six weeks for member states to fully implement the certificate. Asked whether the IT infrastructure was in place to turn around the new pass system by mid-July, Mr Ryan said preparations were under way to “make sure it’s absolutely operational”.He cautioned that a lot of work was needed to “minimise disruption of long queues” at airports, similar to those seen in Heathrow when flights were reintroduced.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"qanon as popular in us as some major religions poll finds","story":"Broken glass in the US Capitol building following the riots on January 6th. Photograph: Melina MaraThe Washington Post via Getty ImagesAs hopes fade for a bipartisan inquiry into the Capitol riot in Washington on January 6th, it’s increasingly clear that the Republican base remains in thrall to the web of untruths spun by Donald Trump – and perhaps even more outlandish lies, beyond those of the former president’s making.A US federal judge warned in an opinion on Wednesday that Mr Trump’s insistence on the “big lie” – that the November presidential election was stolen from him – still posed a serious threat. Presiding over the case of a man accused of storming Congress on January 6th, Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the US District Court in Washington wrote: “The steady drumbeat that inspired defendant to take up arms has not faded away. Six months later, the canard that the election was stolen is being repeated daily on major news outlets and from the corridors of power in state and federal government, not to mention in the near-daily fulminations of the former president.”But it’s not just the notion that the election was stolen that has caught on with the former president’s supporters. QAnon, an outlandish and ever-evolving conspiracy theory spread by some of Mr Trump’s most ardent followers, has significant traction with a segment of the public – particularly Republicans and Americans who consume news from far-right sources.Those are the findings of a poll released on Thursday by the Public Religion Research Institute and the Interfaith Youth Core, which found that 15 per cent of Americans say they think that the levers of power are controlled by a cabal of Satan-worshipping paedophiles, a core belief of QAnon supporters. The same share said it was true that “American patriots may have to resort to violence” to depose the paedophiles and restore the country’s rightful order.‘Biblical-scale storm’And fully 20 per cent of respondents said that they thought a biblical-scale storm would soon sweep away these evil elites and “restore the rightful leaders”. “These are words I never thought I would write into a poll question, or have the need to, but here we are,” Robby Jones, founder of PRRI, said in an interview. The teams behind the poll determined that 14 per cent of Americans fall into the category of “QAnon believers”, composed of those who agreed with the statements in all three questions. Among Republicans only, that rises to roughly 1 in 4. (Twelve per cent of independents and 7 per cent of Democrats were categorised as QAnon believers.)But the analysts went a level further: They created a category labelled “QAnon doubters” to include respondents who had said they “mostly disagreed” with the outlandish statements, but didn’t reject them outright. Another 55 per cent of Republicans fell into this more ambivalent category.Which means that just 1 in 5 Republicans fully rejected the premises of the QAnon conspiracy theory. For Democrats, 58 per cent were flat-out QAnon rejecters. Jones said he was struck by the prevalence of QAnon’s adherents. Overlaying the share of poll respondents who expressed belief in its core principles over the country’s total population, “that’s more than 30 million people”, he said. “Thinking about QAnon, if it were a religion, it would be as big as all white evangelical Protestants, or all white mainline Protestants,” he added. “So it lines up there with a major religious group.” He also noted the correlation between belief in QAnon’s fictions and the conviction that armed conflict would be necessary. “It’s one thing to say that most Americans laugh off these outlandish beliefs, but when you take into consideration that these beliefs are linked to a kind of apocalyptic thinking and violence, then it becomes something quite different,” he said.News outletsThe Public Religion Research Institute and the Interfaith Youth Core found a strong correlation between where people get their news and how much they believe in QAnon’s ideas.Among those who said they most trusted far-right news outlets, such as One America News Network and Newsmax, 2 in 5 qualified as full-on QAnon believers. Fully 48 per cent of these news consumers said they expected a storm to wipe away the elites soon.That puts these news consumers far out of alignment with the rest of the country – even fans of the conservative-leaning Fox News. Among respondents who preferred Fox News above other sources, 18 per cent were QAnon believers. Mr Trump himself has avoided saying much about QAnon, but when he was pressed to denounce the theory while in office, he refused. At a news conference last year, he seemed to indicate that he was pleased by QAnon followers’ fondness for him. “I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate,” he said, adding that “the movement” was “gaining in popularity”.While QAnon followers continue to be a minority among Republicans, some of the party’s most visible figures – and most successful fundraisers – have publicly flirted with the conspiracy theory. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is on a speaking tour with Matt Gaetz, expressed support for QAnon before she was elected she has since publicly walked that back. Ms Greene raised upward of $3 million in the first quarter of this year, an uncommonly huge sum, especially for a first-term lawmaker in a nonelection year.The PRRIIFYC poll was conducted in March, among 5,625 respondents to Ipsos’s probability-based Knowledge Panel. It was analysed this spring and released on Thursday.

Given the epic monstering he endured at Cummings’s hands on Wednesday, it was almost a surprise to see him still standing in the Commons, bloodied but unbowed.Caught in the crosshairs, he attempted a Churchillian call to arms – though this being Matt, it was overlaid with trademark Hancockian schmaltz. He heaped praise on Our NHS and warmly thanked the “volunteers who stood in cold car parks with a smile”.“We have come together, and we have overcome!”, he finished, flopping back dramatically on the green benches.Jonathan Ashworth, Hancock’s mild-mannered opposite number, usually seems a bit too polite for the Westminster swamp. Today, even he came out keen to slash and burn – though with his cherubic features and reedy voice, the effect was underwhelming, like watching your pet hamster attempting a powerplay to commandeer the seedbox.“Is he ashamed that he promised a protective shield around care homes, and over 30,000 care home residents have died?”, piped Ashworth solemnly.The Health Secretary looked cowed. Any minute now his bottom lip was going to wobble. But suddenly reinforcements arrived in the reassuring form of Jeremy Hunt – former health secretary, select committee chair and classic Head Boy material. Like a protective older brother, he defended poor Matt from the sixth-form bully who’d stolen his dinner money and spread nasty stories about him in the locker-room.The Tory faithful whinnied approvingly, but it was not over yet.Martyn Day of the SNP demanded a full and immediate public inquiry, Yasmin Qureshi asked about corporate manslaughter and Munira Wilson doubled down on care home deaths. Legions of opposition MPs surrounded the Health Secretary, drawn to the Cummings standard.Then, following Jeremy Hunt’s lead, the Tory backbenchers linked arms and formed a defensive phalanx around him. One by one, they stood up, in a blue-rosetted version of Spartacus, demonstrating their solidarity in ever-more sycophantic ways.“When it comes to the Health Secretary, I’m a fan”, said Mark Logan, quoting an approving constituent and plugging an article he had written in the Secretary of State\u0027s defence.“Yeahyeahyeah!” snarled the Tory combatants.Much of the love-bombing emanated from the West Country. Selaine Saxby thanked him for visiting North Devon district hospital and condemned the ‘flip-flopping’ opposition. Cherilyn Mackrory went one further, not just celebrating his trip to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro but posing a hardball question: “Can my right honourable friend assure me that he will ignore unsubstantiated Westminster gossip, and stay focused on delivering the vaccination rollout?”“I’m Matt Hancock!” “I’m Matt Hancock!” they cried.It resembled siege warfare. The Opposition trebuchet would lob a few Cummings projectiles at the keep. Meanwhile Matt or one of his backbenchers would retaliate with missiles of their own, usually praise for the vaccination rollout, or use of the word ’unprecedented’, which was deployed in unprecedented quantities, even for these unprecedented times.The congenial back-slapping atmosphere occasionally intensified into heavy-petting, but Matt swelled and his confidence blossomed.At the evening press conference later, the transparency-loving Health Secretary swerved queries about care home deaths with a familiar tactic repeating the same waffling platitudes until it was time for the next question.“Every day we are unwavering in our focus to protect life”, he trilled, on auto-pilot, using phrases only a character in a Steven Spielberg film – or a Minister who knows he’s lived to fight another day – would be bold enough to articulate.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hundreds belarusian farmers set come uk trapped flight ban","story":"About 500 Belarusian farm workers recruited under a Government visa scheme to help Britain bring in its summer harvest are trapped in Belarus by the flight hijack crisis, it has emerged. The news comes as Alexander Lukashenko, the embattled Belarusian leader, prepared to meet Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, at his Black Sea residence in Sochi for talks on closer economic ties, according to the Kremlin.The Belarusian workers, who are desperate for hard cash for their families, are struggling to get to the UK after the ban on direct flights has forced them to look to neighbouring states to fly out.Ukraine closed its border to flights from Belarus on Wednesday, limiting their options primarily to Russia because most of the workers are from the rural east of the country. For some, it could be too expensive or too difficult. About 150 have already come to the UK, before the crisis broke, but a further 500 are lined up for jobs in the UK and have visas entitling them to leave Belarus and enter Britain.They are among 30,000 foreign workers  being recruited by UK-based farming job agencies from countries including Belarus and Russia to come quarantine-free to the UK, despite both nations being under international sanctions.Ministers decided not to re-start last year’s Pick for Britain campaign to recruit UK workers on furlough despite having spent at least £58 billion protecting 11.4 million UK jobs.They have instead expanded the agricultural worker scheme from 10,000 last year to 30,000 with more recruits from Belarus and Russia where the economies are so crippled that recruitment agencies are receiving up to five applications for every UK farm vacancy.Some of the 650 recruits from Belarus are unemployed after losing their jobs for protesting against Mr Lukashenko’s “fraudulent” election victory last year, when he claimed 80 per cent of the vote, according to Agropraktika, the regional recruitment agency.“For them, life will get more difficult. They are angry. They need to get to the UK. They need to earn money for their families to help them. That’s why they want to go,” said Natalie Babelis, Agropraktika’s manager.Securing one of the six-month work visas in the UK is the only way to leave the country and offers the prospect of a £300-a-week pay package, treble what they could earn in Belarus for a similar job.In countries like Belarus, up to a third of GDP is accounted by foreign earnings, largely workers going abroad then sending money back.UCL professor Andrew Wilson, author of Belarus, the last European dictatorship, said the weakness of the flights ban was that it did not the regime directly but could instead cause hardship for ordinary people.Instead, he argued other economic sanctions could hit the elite harder, including a ban on bonds trading with Belarus, action against exports of potash, of which Belarus was a major world producer, and a crackdown on a burgeoning trade in illegal cigarettes, which was alleged to be partly controlled by Mr Lukashenko\u0027s family.Overall you are always trying with smart sanctions to hit the economic interests of the elite and affect their thinking about survivability, said Professor Wilson.On Friday, Lithuania expelled two Belarusian diplomats in solidarity with Latvia, whose diplomats were expelled from Belarus. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"carrie symonds wanted pm send","story":"NewsCarrie Symonds wanted PM to send -word complaint to the Times in row about her dogWhile Covid flooded across Britain, the PMs fiancee was furious at a total cr*p story that had claimed the couple could reshuffle their pet Dilyn out of Downing StreetmirrorShareCommentsByLizzy BuchanPolitical Correspondent:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsPrime Minister Boris Johnsons partner Carrie Symonds holds their pet dog Dilyn \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Dominic Cummings is said to have documents about the meeting on May , according to ITVaposs Robert Peston.It is claimed Mr Hancock was asked to explainhe misled the PM, Mr Cummings and then cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill. A source told Mr Peston there was a fear in Downing Street that Mr Hancock’s “negligence” had “killed people in care homes”.  Sources close to the Health Secretary dismissed the ITV report, saying they did not recognise the claims at all. But they refused to be drawn on whether the meeting took place, adding: The Health Secretary has had many meetings with the PM across a range of issues throughout the pandemic as you would expect. It comes after Mr Cummings made explosive allegations that Mr Hancock repeatedly lied during the pandemic - including on a crucial promise to ensure people were tested before being discharged to care homes. A newly-published Public Health England report has linked  care home deaths to  Covid outbreaks that were “seeded” by residents arriving from hospital. The vast majority happened between mid-March and mid-April, when hospital patients were not routinely being tested before going into care homes. According to Mr Cummings, Mr Hancock had assured Boris Johnson in March that hospital patients would be tested before they were discharged into care. Mr Hancock last night admitted he made the promise - but insisted he didnapost promise the testing straight away, only when we could do it. That, in turn, has left questions about why he allowed hospital patients to be discharged to care homes anyway. Families face fresh anguish today over the damning figures - which appear to be the first time officials have counted deaths linked to the disastrous policy last year. Mr Hancock said last May: Right from the start weaposve tried to throw a protective ring around our care homes. But Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng today mounted a limp defence of the Government’s record, saying: “They were protected as far as we could.” Dr Jenny Harries, the recently-promoted chief executive of UK Health Security Agency, tried to spin the new study as good news, saying it showed “discharge from hospitals was actually a very, very tiny proportional cause of cases” - .% of all care home outbreaks. But Nadra Ahmed of the National Care Association said claims of a “protective shield” were “absolute rubbish”. She said: “We put social care on the altar to be slaughtered while we worked on the mantra that the NHS must be protected. Sam Monaghan, chief executive of care home charity MHA, told Times Radio: “Thereaposs no way that you can take people into care homes who arenapost tested. “Its is like putting kind of a live explosive into a box of tinder. She added: That just highlights that there was no support, and that we were abandoned as a sector during that first wave.”FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnITVNHSRobert PestonBoris JohnsonHospitalsCare homesNursing homesPublic servicesPoliticsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"binge eaters incredible transformation sheds","story":":root Binge eaters incredible transformation as she sheds st after therapist uncovers triggersKrissy Gennaro had struggled with her weight for years after getting stuck in binge eating spirals, but after having gastric sleeve surgery shes transformed her leBinge eaters incredible transformation as she sheds st after therapist uncovers triggersKrissy Gennaro had struggled with her weight for years after getting stuck in binge eating spirals, but after having gastric sleeve surgery shes transformed her leByJessica Taylor:,  May A diagnosed binge eater who weighed st lbs at her heaviest has undergone an incredible transformation after having gastric sleeve surgery. Krissy Gennaro, , has lost a whopping st lbs and is still going after having the surgery  months ago. “I was fairly slim until my early s,” Krissy, from New York, told The Mirror. “I was in the military and I slowly started packing on weight while I was struggling with depression.” Krissy’s weight gain caused her to quit her job with the US coastguard. In the years that followed, she fell pregnant and gave birth to her daughter, Brooke. But she continued to pile on the pounds and reached her heaviest weight shortly after Brooke was born. “I’d gain weight and then lose it. But I’d only get as far as losing lbs before something triggered the binge eating, and then I’d put it straight back on,” Krissy explained.  Krissy described binge eating as “filling a void” that she couldn’t control. When something triggered her, she’d seek comfort in sweets, cake and pizza. “I know when it’s coming, It’s like a can of Pringles - once you pop, you can’t stop. I’d just spiral. “When it happens, I know I shouldn’t be doing it, but I can’t stop thinking about it,” she explained. After several attempts to sht the weight herself failed, Krissy made the dficult decision to have gastric sleeve surgery. “It finally got to the point where I couldn’t do it anymore. I’d miss out on things. I’m a fun person and I like to go on adventures,” she said, recalling a red-faced moment from when she took Brooke to a carnival.“I remember asking the guy on the rideI’d be able to fit into the seat.” So after researching the procedure and meeting with consultants, Krissy told her family about her decision.“I showed Brooke some videos on Instagram from other people who had had the operation. I explained everything so well,” she said.Now with her new partner Joe after splitting up with Brooke’s dad, Krissy explained the process to him and his daughter Bella, , too. “I had to meet with a psychiatrist to make sure I was in the right frame of mind to have the operation,” she said. “Then two weeks before the operation I was on a pre-liquid diet. I was mainly drinking protein shakes and eating yoghurt and jelly.” Before long, Krissy’s operation date came around and she went under the kne to have part of her stomach removed. “I was so miserable when I woke up because of the anaesthetic,” Krissy laughed. “But when it wore off I felt much better.” She was kept in for observation for a few days before being sent home. Unlike some patients who undergo gastric sleeve surgery, Krissy was encouraged to start eating whole food again just two days after the op. “I had things like chicken broth and found some recipes for really soft food on Instagram, like lasagne without the pasta,” she said. Whereas Krissy could eat huge volumes of food before the operation, now she was only eating a few bites before feeling full. But she knew the operation wasn’t enough - and she began to make lestyle changes too. She said: “I started walking rather than driving to places, even just to go to the shops. I also took the stairs rather than the escalator.  “If I was out on a hot day and I wanted an ice cream, I’d make sure I did some exercise first.”When Krissy worked from home due to the coronavirus pandemic, she bought a mini elliptical machine to work out during the day.“I used to get up every hour and do at least  steps to get my count up,” she said. As the weight fell off and she got fitter, Krissy started doing  steps per hour. She also started an Instagram account, @see_krissy_shrink, to document her journey. However, it wasn’t always plain sailing for Krissy, and there were times when her urges to binge crept up on her. “I gained about lbs during the pandemic. I didn’t realise at the time that I was anxious about everything and that caused me to put on weight,” she said. Thankfully, Krissy is now working with a therapist who has helped her identy her triggers that made her fall back into bingeing and eating unhealthy foods. Now, she finds it easiest to stick to an Atkins-style diet where she tries to eat fewer carbs and more protein. “Instead of mashed potato, I’ll have mashed caullower. I also swap beef mince for turkey mince,” she said. But she thinks it’s important not to deprive herself of things she wants - as long as she’s not eating that food all the time.  “The other day Joe and I really wanted a Five Guys takeaway, so I let myself have one,” she said. Laughing, she added: “Although I could only eat a quarter of a burger and seven chips before I felt full!” Krissy credits Joe with helping her get a grip on her binge eating and obsessive nature. “He can tell when I’m going into a downward spiral and he can usually set me straight by letting me talk about it,” she said. Now, Krissy weighs st lbs and she’s still keen to lose more weight, but she’s not setting a target for herself. “If I set a specic weight, I’ll begin to obsess over it and it’s not healthy,” she said. She’s looking forward to things she couldn’t enjoy for so many years, like shopping trips with Brooke. “I feel so much better now I don’t always feel like I’m the biggest person in the room. If you sit next to me on the train, you’ll have space.

Alyssa Patmos, , and Geoff Kulesa, , met nine months ago in a park in Denver, Colorado, while Alyssa was walking to the supermarket. “We initially passed by each other but I saw [Alyssa] a bit late. I smiled at her and she smiled back,” Geoff told The Mirror. Thinking little of it, Alyssa carried on to the supermarket to pick up some food. On the way back, with shopping bags in her hands, Geoff caught her eye again. “I thought, ‘I should have talked to her’,” Geoff said. “On the way back, I saw her again and introduced myself.”  Alyssa, who had just moved to the city, was living in a temporary apartment while she had renovations done on a permanent flat. “I’d just moved to Denver so I wasn’t even thinking about dating. But Geoff came up and asked to walk with me, and I thought that took a lot of courage,” she told The Mirror. With that, Geoff carried Alyssa’s bags and they walked together. “She had a girl-next-door look but with a bit of an edge,” Geoff laughed, pointing out Alyssa’s nose ring and tattoo. The pair hit it off immediately and left the park to go for a drink. “I wanted to get into a meaningful conversation. Neither of us wanted to do small talk,” Geoff explained. After their first impromptu date was a huge success, Geoff was excited to see Alyssa again. But it wasn’t quite plain sailing. “I hoped she wanted to see me again, but she put me off for a while and said she was ‘busy’,” Geoff joked. “I was actually busy!” Alyssa insisted, explaining she was setting up a masterclass in Denver and was working long hours. But as soon as the masterclass was over, the pair finally had their second date. From then on, they saw each other all the time. Despite the  years between them, Geoff and Alyssa say they barely notice an age dference. “I don’t remember when I found out Geoff’s age but it didn’t bother me. I’d dated guys who were  years older than me before. I know  is a bigger gap but it wasn’t an issue,” Alyssa said.  Geoff agreed, adding he’d also dated younger women before. “The only time it’s ever been an issue is when we stop and think about it. My kids are closer to Alyssa’s age than I am,” he said. Geoff has a son aged  and twin boys aged  from a previous relationship - but they’re perfectly accepting of the relationship. Alyssa’s parents, too, have no issues with the age gap between them. “We didn’t feel the need to keep it from anyone because we’re both open books,” Alyssa said.  However, the couple, who have been together for nine months, have had some bumps in the road. “We don’t get funny looks in the street, because Geoff really doesnapost look his age, Alyssa said. But someone called me a ‘Sugar Baby’ once which I didn’t like at all,” Alyssa said. She added she’s received some judgmental comments about what will happen when she and Geoff get older.  “People askI’m going to take care of him when he’s older. I think people live in fear of what the future’s going to look like. “Women also don’t believe me when I say I don’t want kids. A lot of people ask, ‘Oh, is Geoff going to want kids ’ but I don’t want children and people don’t seem to believe me when I say that.” Geoff said: “In general, people who question us say, ‘Alyssa can’t possibly be on your emotional level’, but she’s an old soul and she’s incredibly mature.” But overall, the couple say most people are “pretty accepting” of their relationship and they’re still smitten with each other. They officially moved in together a month ago, but claim they were spending every night together beforehand anyway. “My new apartment was basically a storage unit,” Alyssa laughed.As coronavirus restrictions ease, the pair are looking forward to being more spontaneous in their relationship, which is going from strength to strength.Geoff said: “Age is just a mindset at the end of the day.

John said that Cummingsapos testimony had proved that the Prime Minister had not taken the virus seriously. Clearly touched by the call, Mr OaposBrien said: I bet you were a brilliant dad. And John replied: She was  years old, she was a bundle of fun. I called her Little Chief and she called me Big Chief… she was just the loveliest person in the world and she didnapost deserve it. None of these people deserved it. At a time of crisis when we desperately needed a really serious politician in charge of Downing Street, we sadly finished up with a charlatan and a narcissist and a liar and thataposs why my daughter is dead. He continued: I feel for all of these families, every single family, my heart goes out to them and when I see it every day and people turn around and say itaposs only nine dead today. Thataposs somebody’s loved one - itaposs not only two, itaposs not only nine, itaposs not only one. Itaposs somebodyaposs loved one thataposs died. People are in pain and people should remember that the next time they go to put their cross in a box in a polling station, because this man isnapost fit to run the country.  Mr OaposBrien tweeted after the conversation: This call completely broke me. I will remember John – and Rosie – as long as I live. Johnaposs strong words on Thursday came as the Mirror revealed the fury of some families towards Health Secretary Matt Hancock. He was a particular target of Mr Cummings, who claimed the senior minister should have been sacked multiple times. Mr Hancock has hit back and denied the allegations made against him. The families of some care home victims are now calling for an inquiry to find out why their loved ones were like lambs to the slaughter. With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email. Delivered straight to your inbox, our daily coronavirus briefing will keep you informed of what is happening with Covid, lockdown, the vaccination rollout and the impact on how we live.here. A daughter, whose dad was one of those who died in a care home, has won a judicial review to hold the Government to account for their deadly failings during the pandemic. But she believes both the Prime Minister and the Health Secretary should face manslaughter charges too. Dr Cathy Gardner, from Sidmouth in Devon, was reduced to tears as she watched Mr Cummings give seven hours of evidence. Her -year-old dad died from the virus on April , just a week after the first lockdown.  I will not have been the only one crying because it reminds you of the disaster, Dr Gardner said. Particulary when he was talking about not having a plan for care homes. The consequences of that for so many thousands of people was just awful. Fty per cent of the deaths early on were in care homes and that’s so wrong. Her father, Michael Gibson, is believed to have died from Covid after a patient was discharged from hospital back into his care home despite testing positive for the virus. Seven other residents also died. She said both Mr Johnson and Mr Hancock should be charged with manslaughter adding: Our loved ones were being forced to share a space with someone with Covid - it’s absolute madness.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"coal miner 69 meets teenage","story":":root Coal miner, , meets teenage climate striker to learn what they have in commonMiner Allan Holliday, , meets passionate -year-old climate campaigner Isabella Bridgman for our Britain Talks project - and the two proud West Cumbrias find plenty of common groundCoal miner, , meets teenage climate striker to learn what they have in commonMiner Allan Holliday, , meets passionate -year-old climate campaigner Isabella Bridgman for our Britain Talks project - and the two proud West Cumbrias find plenty of common groundthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video -year-old-climate-activist-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:ptiGtOu,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

She’s a teenage climate striker fighting to stop the first new deep UK coalmine in  years. Allan Holliday and Isabella Bridgman were born five decades years apart, and have very dferent views on plans to open a new coalmine in the heart of Cumbria – but could they manage to discuss their views, and even find ‘more in common’ As the UK prepares to host the United Nations Climate Summit, we asked Allan and Isabella to get together on zoom as part of our #BritainTalks project to discuss plans for the mine in Whitehaven.The issue has ided their local community and ides the country. As Allan, , says: “I don’t want my grandchildren to grow up in a place of unemployment and high deprivation just so we can have a nice area to look at.” For Isabella, , the thought of carbon emissions from a new coalmine is genuinely frightening. “If we invest in this mine it will contribute to global warming and the future will be miserable because of climate change,” she says. What do you think  Join the Britain Talks conversation in the comments below....  “I live in Cockermouth, so I have seen the floods. I don’t want my area destroyed by flooding.” Allan, who lives with we, Susan, , in a bungalow high above Whitehaven’s historic harbour, went straight from school to work in the now closed Haig pit, before becoming a postman then a local councillor. Isabella, who usually lives with her family in nearby Cockermouth, is away at college in South Wales. Yet both West Cumbrians also share a deep love for their local landscape and community, as well as being keen on a bag of chips. There has been talk of a new deep coal mine in Whitehaven for years. Cumbria County council approved plans for The West Cumbria Mining facility, off the coast of Whitehaven, in  promising to create  jobs and provide coal to the UK steel industry. But after new environmental evidence and campaigns against the mine – including fierce protests from Isabella and other climate strikers- the government is reviewing the plans.  Allan tells Isabella he’s seen first-hand how poverty has affected the area. “If we can get this coal mine up and running it will vastly change the quality of le for the people of West Cumbria,” he says. “I don’t want my neighbours and friends to continue with le of unemployment. Unless we can find jobs there is no future for them, they are starting to lose a bit of hope. That is why the coal mine came along, people in this area were clapping their hands, not because it was coal, because it was jobs, it is work.  “At present there is nobody  offering any other form of employment. They kept saying they shouldn’t be having these types of industries, we should have cleaner, environmentally-friendly jobs. But local people have been promised this for  years. The coal side is going to produce the raw materials to help us build the wind farms, to build the tidal barriers and solar .” Isabella is chatting from the closed campus where she’s been all term.  Perched on her bed, surrounded by posters and college work reminders in her student room, Isabella agrees - but thinks they should push for long-term, sustainable jobs instead. “I think the jobs argument is an important one,” she says. “I really recognise that jobs are really needed in the area. But the coal mine isn’t going to be sustainable. We have committed to going zero carbon in  so these jobs are not going to be long-term. “West Cumbria deserves better than that. I want to see the government investing in more sustainable jobs in more stable industries that are secure and well-paying.”  She adds: “It’s quite scary as a young person to see the government making decisions I know will contribute to global warming and impact my future.” Allan clearly misses the “family atmosphere” and close-knit community of his pit days. But as they talk more, Allan also explains that he understands the harsh realities of mining more than most. He tells Isabella of losing his own dad, William, who was killed working as a miner when Allan was just two years old.  William was down Haig Pit when he was hit by falling machinery, leaving Allan’s pregnant mum to raise seven children. “It was terrible,” he says, “My mum had to bring us up, but the community helped, people did what they could. That’s what it’s like here, it’s a good area.” Then Allan admits: “If there was an alternative, I’ll be honest with you, I’d rather have an alternative. Because there’s nothing easy about coalmining.” And he says he’s always supported alternative technology. “In  through my work as a councillor, I opened the first wind farm in Cumbria. I have always been a fan of wind farms.” But Allan lacks belief that any alternative jobs or technologies will make it to West Cumbria in time to save his beloved town. “I just can’t see sustainable jobs coming in the next two years,” he says. “That is too long for me to wait. I have lived here all my le, I have seen what unemployment can do.” The impact on the local environment is the subject of another lively discussion, with Isabella worried the mine workings could endanger marine le, while Allan says the site is ideal.  “The coal mine is on disused coalfield site next to a disused chemical factory. It is ideally placed for high quality coal.” Allan says he shares Isabella’s concern about local flooding. “I can go along with that, when it comes to global warming the rain falls on the fells and it floods. But when we talk about global warming… I don’t think the coal mine will affect it.” But both agree on a need for central government to do more to support the West Cumbria they love. They’re protective of their community and trade stories of walking in such a beautul part of the world – as well as Allan’s favourite chip shop. “It’s better than Whitby,” he laughs, “Next time you’re home the chips are on me!” As the conversation ends, both are quick to say how much they’ve enjoyed it. “It is nice to have an adult conversation rather than someone say, ‘you don’t care’,” Allan smiles. “It is dficult when I see my neighbours unemployed and it must be dficult for Isabella to see her neighbourhood flooded. It’s nice to talk to dferent people without falling out.”  Isabella smiles. “The conversation threw up things I hadn’t really thought of before and some interesting perspectives. I’ve really enjoyed it.” Afterwards Allan admits: “I didn’t really know what to expect from Isabella. I was worried we might not be able to get through to each other, that we wouldn’t hear each other out. But our chat was really good.

Kai Grunwald forked out £, to build the wooden structure - which includes a slide and climbing wall - for daughters Kara, six, and Kayleigh, four. But the -year-old, from Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, said itaposs a case of red tape gone mad after Dacorum Borough Council told him to demolish it within  days. The authority sent Kai, a strategy director, a letter stating the treehouse is a breach of planning regulations because it is over .m in height. The dad admits he should have sought planning permission in hindsight but struggles to understand the councilaposs attitude.Have you had similar issues with a local council  Let us know at webnews@mirror It’s not like I’ve built a block of flats or something like that without permission, I just wanted to do something nice for the girls, Kai told The Sun. One of the great joys for me, apart from their excitement, was the encouragement, smiles and comments I received whilst making it. It was a lovely way to engage with the community. Working on the treehouse on evenings and weekends, Kai said it also helped to distract him from his day job which sees him staring at a computer screen most of the day.  Along with we Kerryn, , he wants to be able to submit a planning application retrospectively and work with the council to ensure everything fits the regulations. However, Kai said DBC has shut that option down and wants the treehouse gone, which he said seems totally unfair. The council raised concerns about the safety of the structure, as it encroaches on a footpath, as well as the visual impact on the street in its letter. However, Kai disputes this, having made it all from high quality material and is adamant it is very safe, while it only marginally overhangs the street path below. A council spokesperson told the Mirror: Dacorum Borough Council was informed of the structure within the Berkhamsted area of Dacorum.Following an investigation and considering planning policies, the Council has explained the reasons why the structure should be removed.The homeowner can apply for retrospective planning permission and we are happy to discuss modications or alternatives.This would enable the Council to assess the impact fully including taking into account any comments which may be received from local residents.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnDiyers"},{"url":null,"title":"how getting back board improved","story":"AdvertorialHow getting back on board improved one mans mental healthA National Lottery-supported group helped Marc Lawler get back on his skateboard - and it’s brought his family togethermirrorShareByLaura Tait:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY AdvertorialMarc with his son Brandon at the Hook Skate Park in NottinghamStanding at the top of the ramp, Marc Lawler felt the adrenaline begin to kick in. It was  years since he had last ridden a skateboard – he’d given it up to concentrate on his job as a welder and being a dad to his first child, Jack. But passing a skateboard shop in his hometown of Nottingham, he’d felt the pull of his old hobby. Minutes later, he walked out with a brand new board under his arm. STARTING SLOWLY That was two years ago, and Marc, now , has been brushing up on his skills. “It took me a while to get back into it, but I gradually got there,” he says. “I live opposite a skate park so I could see when it was quiet and I’d time my visits for then. Marc wasn’t sure how his body would stand up to the thrills – and inevitable spills – of the sport: “I started slowly so I didn’t hurt myself, and didn’t attempt anything more complicated than just moving round on the board at first. “I wasn’t too worried about what people thought, though. One of the good things about being older is that you care less about what people think.” As he grew more confident, Marc began to share his hobby with his family.  His -year-old son, Brandon, also had a skateboard, so the pair headed to a Skate Nottingham event, where the coaches taught them tricks and techniques. “Brandon will try stunts that I’m just too cautious to do,” says Marc. “I used to skate ramps, jumping from one and landing on another but it’s too dangerous now. I might crack my head or injure my knee and I’m too old for that. My worst injury has been a rolled ankle.” Marc sticks to street-style skating, where he uses kerbs and rails to skate on. “I taught myself to skate on rails by starting on low walls and then building up,” he explains. “It can take me anything from a week to nearly a year to learn a new trick. It feels great when I can master one that I’ve been working on for ages.” While Marc can skate some impressive rails, he’s still trying to master a basic kick flip, which involves jumping up, flipping the board over and landing on it. Skate Nottingham puts on National Lottery-funded events at skate parks, workshop venues and public spaces around the city, encouraging people of all ages to give it a go. It’s just one of many good causes to have benefited from National Lottery funding, thanks to the £ million raised every week* by players. For Marc it has become a family affair as his stepson, Bill, , joined in and the trio began to explore Nottingham’s skate parks. “We decided to visit as many as possible,” says Marc. “There are such a lot of them now and they’re all really well designed. We started before lockdown but have begun to explore dferent skate parks again now that things are beginning to open up again. And thanks to the support of The National Lottery, many of these parks have the funds to be maintained and improved. Marc started to go to more Skate Nottingham events to show others that you could skateboard regardless of your age. He also began to make friends as he saw the same faces at dferent events. “I didn’t have lots of confidence and I thought I was quite shut off from other people,” says Marc. “But it’s such an inclusive pastime that I began to really feel part of the community.” Meanwhile Marc and the boys began to record the skate parks they visited, and they have ventured further afield. At the last count they had visited around  parks, going as far as Cornwall. “We’re hoping to hit the  mark but we won’t stop there,” says Marc. “It’s become a real family affair too. My elder son, Jack, has started coming along for the ride and to explore new areas, and my -year-old stepdaughter Esme wants to get some roller skates.”  FURTHER BENEFITS As well as bringing them closer as a family, there have been some other benefits too. “It really helped with my mental health over lockdown,” says Marc. “It gave me the space to take some time for myself and unwind. And it’s helped me get to know Bill better. “I’ve also noticed that Brandon is really changing the way he approaches learning new things. In the skate park, he has to stop and assess things logically and I can see that having a positive effect at school too.” How the money you raise is raising smiles In these challenging times it’s great to be able to put a smile on people’s faces. And when you play The National Lottery you’re helping people to do exactly that – whether it’s by bringing the world of the Vikings to le or driving the unique underground train in London’s Postal Museum.  Many of those who have benefited from funding have faced their own le challenges. They include Ekow Otoo, who hasn’t let multiple sclerosis stop him achieving sporting glory. He now stars in The National Lottery’s stunning new TV ad, in which he pulls off some spectacular moves in his wheelchair at a skate park. By playing The National Lottery, you raise £ million for good causes every week* – and during the pandemic, aside from the Government, no one has made a greater contribution to those affected than National Lottery players.When we all play a little, fun stuff happens.

Chris Grfiths, of Knowsley firm Grfiths Car Care, says the pandemic has forced him to move home, sell his cars and rely on handouts. He claims he is now broke and unable to reopen his business after being denied government and council grants. He says he cannot sleep at night after being refused one of the Government’s Restart Grants because the council say there was no legal requirement for the business to close in January.Ex-army serviceman Chris told the Liverpool Echo his ‘detailer’ firm, like many businesses that closed at the time, is “non-essential” - as its main focus is “washing and machine polishing cars to make them shiny”.He said he had received “all” of the Government support packages up until this point.  The council said it was “genuinely disappointing” that Chris’ firm had suffered due to Covid but that, unlike others, he did not contact the authority for advice before closing for the most recent national lockdown. The -year-old claims he discussed the matter with the council and that his business received a Local Restrictions Support Grant back in January. Chris, who was a main battle tank crewman, said: “We have had all grants up until the Restart Grant, now they say I shouldnapost have closed as Iaposm a repair business, and so essential. I wash and machine polish cars to make them shiny. Chris claims many of his clients cancelled jobs they had booked in because they couldn’t travel to have their cars cleaned. He says he canapost afford to reopen, adding: “We’ve lost everything over the past year. I had a massive five-bed house in Maghull, a garden like a footie pitch, a brand new Audi and a -Series BMW but we are broke. We have nothing now. He accused the authorities of “not listening at all”, claiming he kept getting passed between the Department for Business, the council and the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority. He added: “Itaposs absolutely disgusting. I started this business after leaving the army, I started washing cars in dealerships around Liverpool, then it ended up with high-end cars. “I kept the business in Knowsley to try and help people like myself gain jobs. “We had just invested heavily in a new unit on the same estate in Kirkby the week before lockdown. He added: “If we can’t reopen I have no idea what I will do. I’ve done this since I left the army and it is the only thing I can do. “This is our only income and it’s affected us massively. My nine-year-old son has been hit hard. Having to rely on foodbanks isn’t great, but I’m so happy they are available.” A spokesperson for Knowsley Council said throughout the pandemic the local authority had offered advice and support to local businesses.  The spokesperson added: “Many businesses contacted us for advice around whether they could open during lockdown, but Grfiths Car Care didn’t and the decision to close the business during lockdown in January was made by the owner. “Whilst Mr Grfiths appears to be suggesting that his business operates as a car wash, it is apparent that Grfiths Car Care predominantly offers specialised and bespoke car detailing and paint correction services from its studio. “As such, many of these services could be treated as being car repair and there would have been no legal requirement for the business to have closed in January .” The spokesperson added: “As with all other businesses in Knowsley, we shared all of the business support schemes and grants that were available with Mr Grfiths. “We did not receive an application for the Local Business Support Grant, but an application for the Restart Grant was received. “Unfortunately this grant was unable to be paid as there was no legal obligation for the business to have closed.  “It is genuinely disappointing that Grfiths Car Care has suffered financially as a result of the pandemic but, as you will appreciate, the council must adhere to the conditions of this scheme, as it will be audited to ensure that it has complied with regulations. “Our Business Grants Team have been in regular contact with Mr Grfiths regarding this matter and have responded to his correspondence. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy added: “We understand how dficult the pandemic has been for iniduals and businesses, including for those in the automotive maintenance industry. “Businesses mandated to close under the regulations were able to access grants of up to £, per six weeks of closure during the period of national lockdown from January . “Restart Grants are sector-focussed grants, introduced to support businesses as Covid- restrictions are lted. “We have issued clear guidance to local authorities on business categorisation and grant eligibility, and continue to monitor them to ensure businesses are receiving the support they need.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirus lockdownSmall businesses"},{"url":null,"title":"major covid variants detected uk","story":"NewsAll the major Covid iants detected in UK including India and Thai mutationsUK health officials are watching  iants, including the India, so-called Thai, Kent and South Africa mutations, which have been detected in the countrymirrorShareCommentsByChris KitchingSenior News Reporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video matt-hancock-more-half-big-,customFields:,clearance:Network,source:bcdccbccd,sourceUrl:sky news,site:Mirror,brandSafety: Sport and specialist news – passed for ad targeting,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:teYcYkZh,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Scientists are carrying out tests to determine whether the strain reaches the threshold of being a iant of concern, a term used to identy strains which are more transmissible or more severe. PHEaposs latest report identies five iants of concern - including the India and Kent mutations - and nine iants under investigation, while  others are being monitored. Experts have said the next few weeks will be crucial in determining whether coronavirus restrictions in England can be lted next month, given the surge in India iant cases in some local authorities. Current data suggests that although hospital admissions are rising in some parts of the country affected by the India iant, overall admissions remain broadly flat. Some experts on Friday argued that restrictions should remain in place until more of the population have received both vaccine doses Despite a rise in confirmed infections, Mr Hancock said vaccines were working against iants and severing the link between cases and hospitalisations and deaths.These are the  iants which are currently circulating in the UK or being monitored by health officials.India iantThe Indian iant, formally known as B..., is now the dominant strain in the UK, accounting for up to  per cent of new cases in the country. It became a iant of concern in April. Bolton, Bedford, Blackburn with Darwen and Rossendale are among the iantaposs hotspots. A total of , cases have been detected in England as of Tuesday. Of those, involved international travel.  By region, the North West had the highest total, with , amid surge testing in a number of areas. This accounts for  per cent of Englandaposs confirmed cases of the B... iant. The North West was followed by London, which had  cases, and the East of England, which had . PHE data shows the majority of people with the Indian iant have not been vaccinated, with just three per cent of casesfrom February  to May  having received both doses. There were  deaths linked to the iant, of which eight were among the unvaccinated.  Kent iantThe Kent iant of concern, which emerged late last year, was the dominant strain in the UK, fuelling a series of lockdowns from December and January. It also became the dominant strain in other countries as it spread round the world. According to the latest PHE data, there were , cases of the iant between October  last year and Tuesday. A total of , deaths linked to the B... iant were reported. Recent studies found that vaccines are highly effective against the strain, which spreads more easily but does not increase disease severity.  Bristol iantIn February, the Bristol strain became a iant of concern. It is the Kent iant with the EK mutation also found in the South Africa and Brazil iants. A total of  cases had been detected by late February. The total stood at  as of Tuesday, with only one death linked to the iant. Brazil Japan iantThis iant has been called the Brazil iant and the Japan iant. It became a iant of concern in January, leading to surge testing in parts of the UK and a travel ban. PHE said  cases have been confirmed as of Tuesday. No UK deaths have been linked to the P. iant. It was first reported by health officials in Japan after it was detected in four Brazilian travellers at Haneda airport in Tokyo. It is thought to have contributed to a surge in cases in Manaus, Brazil. South Africa iantLike the Brazil iant, the South Africa iant led to surge testing in parts of Britain and a travel ban. The B.. strain was named a iant of concern in December, with a total of  cases confirmed as of Tuesday. Thirteen deaths have been linked to the iant, according to PHE. Variants under investigation The nine iants under investigation are:A.. with EK, first detected in the UK B.., first detected in the UK B..., first detected in the UK AV., first detected in the UK P., first detected in the Philippines B..., first detected in India B..., first detected in India C.., first detected in Thailand C.. has been described in media reports as the Thai iant because it was found in that country in a person who had travelled from Egypt. This has angered Thailandaposs government, which said on Friday there is no Thai Covid- iant because the C.. iant has not been found in the domestic infection in that country. It said the iant was found in a person who had travelled from Egypt and was staying in the state quarantine. The person was treated and has recovered, the Thai government said.Supakit Sirilak, director-general of the Department of Medical Sciences, told the Bangkok Post that C.. should be called the Egypt iant.The situation highlights concerns that using place names to identy Covid iants creates stigma and puts people from those places at risk of racist or xenophobic abuse.

The researchers define a aposhotspotapos as a local authority where there are - or are predicted to be - more than  new cases of Covid- per , of the population per week. Public Health Englandhas identied the North West city as an area to watch based on its own data which shows a growing cluster of confirmed cases of Covid-.Have you been affected by the Indian coronavirus iant  Email webnews@mirror. Blackburn with Darwen, Bedford, Rossendale and Bolton are expected to remain top Covid hotspots for weeks, the Imperial College London map shows. Manchesteraposs probability of becoming a new hotspot by Sunday is  per cent, but it rises to  per cent by June , the researchers said. Separate data from PA shows rates continue to rise across the North West, including Greater Manchester, as the Health Secretary said Covid vaccines are severing the link between cases and hospitalisations and deaths. Burnleyaposs seven-day rate has climbed to  new cases per , people, with a total of  confirmed cases, in the week to May .  It is the seventh highest rate in England, up from . the previous week. Manchesteraposs rate is the eighth highest, going from from . to ,, with  new cases. Bury is ninth with a rate of  , up from . the previous week. Bolton has highest Covid rate Englandaposs highest rates are found in the Indian iant hotspots of Bolton , Blackburn with Darwen , Bedfordand Rossendale , though it appears the Bolton outbreak could be nearing its peak. The latest data from PHE show the Manchester cluster continuing to grow in size.  PHE epidemiologist Meaghan Kall tweeted: By local authority we see Bolton cluster and Bedford continue to increase in size. Other clusters also growing but nothing of note apart from Manchester joining the mix as one to watch. Councillor Joanna Midgley, executive member for health and care for Manchester City Council, said officials are taking robust action to prevent the spread of the iant.She said: “From the week beginning March , vaccinations started to be offered to residents aged  and above in eight city wards.Residents in these wards are at a greater risk of contracting the virusit spreads which is why action was taken sooner rather than later.  “It has been known for a long time that Covid was something we will have to adapt with as the vaccination programme continues.It’s vital that people continue to wear their masks, maintain social distancing and wash their hands to ensure their own safety, and that of their community.” Manchesterapos Director of Public Health David Regan added: “We are closely monitoring confirmed cases of the iant that originated in India, and I want to reassure residents that steps are being taken to prevent its spread. “While viruses mutate and change, it’s important to stress that this is normal and from time to time we will see iants pop up. “There is no evidence to indicate this iant is more dangerous, and preliminary studies have shown that our vaccines are effective against it and prevent people from getting seriously ill. “As always residents should keep wearing their masks, socially distancing and handwashing, and adhering to the most up to date public health guidance.” UK-wide cases of the Indian iant have doubled in a week - from , to , - leading to fresh doubts over the ending of Covid restrictions in England next month. Boris Johnson warned that freedom from restrictions on June  may have to wait. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said up to three quarters of new UK Covid cases could be of the Indian iant, and there are “early signs” that rates in Bolton are starting to “cap out. The Government is waiting for fresh data to find out how the continuing surge has affected hospital admissions, which have increased slightly but remain low across England.  PHE said the hospital admission rate for Covid- was . per , people in the week to May , compared with . per , in the previous week. The daily number of Covid caseshas been increasing, with , announced on Thursday, a week-on-week rise of  per cent. The daily number of deaths has remained level. Promising data from PHE show just three per cent of Britons infected with the Indian iant were fully vaccinated. Almost  per cent had not received a single dose. Other figures show the average age of people testing positive has fallen to , the youngest ever recorded during the pandemic and down from  at the start of the year.  A majority of older Britons have received at least one dose of a vaccine. Meanwhile, a total of , cases of the Indian iant had been detected in England as of Tuesday, a new PHE report found. Of those, involved international travel. By region, the North West had the highest total, with , as of Tuesday, amid surge testing in a number of areas. This accounts for  per cent of Englandaposs confirmed cases of the B... iant. The North West was followed by London, which had  cases, and the East of England, which had . There were  in the East Midlands,  in the South East and  in the West Midlands. The North East had the fewest number of cases , followed by the South Westand Yorkshire  Humber . Mr Hancock said on Thursday that the increase in cases of the Indian iant remained focused in “hotspots” where surge testing and vaccinations were taking place.He said of  people in hospital with coronavirus in Bolton, only five have had both doses of vaccine.Mr Hancock added: “So when you get the call, get the jab, and make sure you come forward for your second doses so you can get the maximum possible protection. “The vaccine is severing the link between cases and hospitalisations and deaths from coronavirus.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirusMutant Coronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markles great great great","story":"NewsMeghan Markles great-great-great-grandmother used to work at Windsor CastleIt turns out the Duchess of Sussexs association with the Royal Family goes back much further than the first time she met Prince Harry - it actually spans over  yearsmirrorShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsMeghans link to the royal family goes back generations \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Bird, who appeared in the Windsor Castle Weekly Disbursement Book in .This was around the same time Mary would have been in the UK, reports The Express.  Meghanaposs great-great-great-grandmother later married Thomas Bird, an Irish shoemaker who served as an officer in the British Army.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeA mum wrote a childrenaposs book while in labour – just hours before delivering her daughter in a traumatic birth. English teacher Jo Harte, , came up with the idea for aposDo You Know the Colours of the Rainbow apos while she was pregnant with her first child. She wrote the story between contractions, when she had some time to kill. With a busy lestyle, Jo said the opportunity to sit down and get writing didnapost arrive until she was in hospital waiting for her daughter, Isabella, to be born in September . She and husband Ben, , were inspired by a mischievous magpie that visited their garden and stripped the branches off their tree to build a nest.  Nicknaming him Marvin, the couple from Thatcham, Berkshire, decided to write a book featuring the bird. We had discussed the idea a little while before Isabella was born, Jo said. Ben would read to Isabella every day while she was in the womb. We always said we would write our idea down one day as we both love childrenaposs books. When we had some time to kill in the hospital waiting for Isabella to be born, we seized the opportunity. We drafted the story together in a notebook I had in my hospital bag. Jo went to hospital on a Sunday to be induced and spent the following two days drafting the story. She continued writing it on Monday evening and carried on into Tuesday because she couldnapost sleep on the noisy ward.  Meanwhile, the determined mum went through three failed inductions, five unsuccessful attempts at breaking her waters, and had to be placed on an oxytocin drip. Despite having contractions, and gas and air, there was no sign of the baby – and that meant Jo had plenty of time to focus on her book. She said: I needed something to take my mind off things. Ben was really good throughout the whole experience and kept me busy with lots of chat and of course writing the book. I was so impatient for Isabellaaposs arrival - she had kept us waiting long enough - so I was distracted by that, but my husband kept me grounded. At last, four days after arriving in hospital, baby Isabella was born via C-section. But there were more complications. Jo said: I was waiting for the cry, but it never came. Ben wasnapost anywhere nearby and I panicked. It transpired that Isabella was a meconium baby and had to be resuscitated at birth. She was rushed into NICU and incubated on oxygen until she was able to breath by herself. I wasnapost allowed to see her until late afternoon on Wednesday and the first time I met her she was all tubed up and incubated. Isabella made a full recovery – and went on to become one of the main characters in her parentsapos book. The story also features a character called Harry, which was their choice of namethe baby had been a boy. In the book, teacher Mr Brown tells his class all about the colours of the rainbow. Students Isabella and Harry draw their own rainbows, but when theyfrom lunchtime they find their artwork has mysteriously disappeared – and it looks like mischievous Marvin the magpie is the culprit. The book has been flying off the shelves at Waterstones. Jo is delighted – and was also thrilled by the way the bookaposs illustrator managed to capture Isabellaaposs likeness. She said: It was amazing to see the draft we wrote in the hospital come to le and be completed with beautul illustrations. The illustrator has captured her perfectly and a lot of people who have read the book [say] how well the images have characterised her cheekiness.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBabiesHospitalsPregnancyGiving birth"},{"url":null,"title":"music teacher who tried board","story":"NewsMusic teacher who tried to board Egypt flight with fake Covid test faces jailPhilip Cunningham, , was caught out at Heathrow airport after staff noticed that there was a digit missing from his test result.

The kittensapos mother, Martha, was just a year old when she was spotted by the elderly residents in Bridgemary, Hampshire who started to feed her.Attempts to find her owner failed and she was taken into the care of Cats Protection in Gosport where she soon gave birth to a litter of four. The tots are now just over three weeks old with three of the four tiny cats are polydactyl, meaning aposmany fingeredapos, the Daily Record reports. Black-and-white Ernest has five toes on each paw including elongated dew claw aposthumbsapos. His brother Hemingway who is tabby-and-white has six toes on each paw while their tabby-and-white sister, Havana, has five toes on each back paw and six toes on each front paw. The kittens were named in honour of Ernest Hemingway, who is said to have been given a six-toed cat named Snow White by a sailor who docked in Key West.  Over  polydactyl cats, many of which may descend from Snow White, live at a house and museum on the Florida island which was once the writeraposs home. Another famous polydactyl cat, a Main Coon named Pauline, lives at the Maison De Moggy cafe in Edinburgh where she can be found giving people apostwo thumbs upapos.  Cats Protection are now encouraging pet owners to neuter their cats, as kittens can become pregnant from four-months-old. Kate Stapleford, Gosport Cats Protection branch coordinator, said: Kittens are always a delight, but to have three polydactyl kittens is extremely unusual. “Iaposve been fortunate in fostering several single cats over the years who have been polydactyl but Iaposve certainly not cared for three polydactyl kittens at once before. She added: Although the kittens are gorgeous and are taking advantage of their extra digits by learning to walk and climb over each other as soon as they can, Martha was a young mum, and pregnancy, especially in stray cats, can have many risks.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCats"},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle shared struggles weight","story":"NewsMeghan Markle shared struggles with weight and looks during brutal s in candid postThe Duchess of Sussex writes of trying to be as \"cool\" and \"smart\" as her peers in blog post to mark her birthday as she turns mirrorShareCommentsByAdam BarnettJohn Varga:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsMeghan Markle opened up about her brutal s in a blog post for her rd birthday \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Instead she ended up having two more sets, as well as a single baby, during her  years of pregnancies. After two sets of twin girls, Meredith, from San Francisco, Calornia, and her husband Brady really wanted a boy but it would take them a more years to finally get their wish. Meredith said: So I had my first set of twin girls, Gabriella and Julia, now , and then after me and my husband got married we decided to try for another baby. After falling pregnant, I never dreamt that I would be pregnant with my second set of twins. I didnapost even really know that you could have more than one set. I thought that once youaposd had a set of twins, that was it and youaposd just have single babies. But I was very wrong. We were so shocked when we discovered that I was pregnant with twins again. I never knew of this happening to anyone. I had my next set of twin girls, Elsa and Lucia, who are now -years-old, in July .

The -year-old says that the couple really wanted to experience what it was like being parents to the opposite gender. Meredith and her husband decided to try for another baby in the hopes it could be a boy. She said: I fell pregnant to a single baby which wasnapost a shock because I definitely didnapost think I would have another set of twins. I gave birth to my fth daughter, Cambia, now , in August . Having a single baby was crazily easy compared to having twins. She was such an easy baby I think she lured us into trying for a baby boy just once.  I just thought that having two sets of twins was a fluke, especially after having a single baby. I definitely never could have imagined I would have a third set of twins. It wasnapost on my radar at all. So we tried again for one more baby. After having Cambia, we just took it for granted that we would be having another single baby. We were so sure that the twin thing was over that I went to the scan by myself. At the scan, Meredith recalls seeing two embryos appearing on the screen and the feeling of shock running through her body.  She said: I was like oh no. My first thought was about having to do another two college educations at the same time again. During my pregnancy people were always joking with me aboutI was having twins again, but I actually was. It got quite annoying because people would always say about my hand being full, which seemed kind of negative, so I would just respond by saying that my heart was fuller.

She then grabs Ms Broadwateraposs hair again, pulls her across the lobby and punches her in the face multiple times. Ms Broadwateraposs toddler daughter rushes to help her mum, at which point staff intervene as a bystander shouts: Move the baby, move the baby. The victim was eventually rescued by bystanders who were able to free her from the vicious assault and bring her back into the shop as the attacker left in her car. Ms Broadwater was left with multiple injuries to her face and was assisted by emergency services at the scene but refused to go to hospital, the outlet reports.

Other baristas have also spoken out against such orders, saying that customers are inspired and trying to recreate drinks seen in viral TikTok videos. The order Josie, from Calornia, lost his job over was a traditional Caramel Ribbon Crunch Frappuccino, which is made with coffee, milk, ice, caramel syrup, caramel sauce, whipped cream, caramel drizzle, and a crunchy caramel-sugar topping. But the customer, Edward, added  changes to the recipe, including extra caramel drizzle, seven pumps of caramel sauce, extra ice, extra cinnamon dolce topping, and heavy cream. Speaking to , a spokesman for Starbucks said: Our , partners across the US are the best people in the business, and their experiences are key to helping us make Starbucks a meaningful and inspiring place to work. We offer a world-class benefits program for all part- and full-time partners and continued support for partners during Covid- to care for themselves and their families, and we continue to have an industry-leading retention rate.” But after tweeting about the drink in a post that went viral, many people wanted to try the new recipe and labelled it aposThe Edwardapos.  Other US baristas from Starbucks say they are treated like aposcoffee-making robotsapos thanks to TikTok, as more and more customers come in and order elaborate drinks.Speaking to , one said: These orders are driving us insane because they’re so long, so specic and it requires you to do much more work than you should be doing for one single drink and they’re not being adequately translated into our labour hours.The coffee chain doesnapost limit customers to the number of times they can change a recipe, and a worker said that customers can get angry when they donapost get what they want.  A Starbucks worker said to : With mobile order or delivery, we can’t always clary what they want and people will get very mad over sort of little stuff when you’ve made the drink almost perfectly, and it’s frustrating to feel like you can’t say we can’t really make it that way, so people treat us like coffee-making robots. Another employee added: Starbucks definitely took this turn to become just another fast-food drive-thru. They want us to just be these robots that move fast, we’re just little drones to them that just need to pump out as many lattes as we can in a half-hour. After Josie shared a picture of his drink order online, both customers and employees of Starbucks commented their thoughts on the issue. One barista shared a picture of a Frappuccino with  additional changes, adding: This order comes in every other week. And one customer wrote: I was behind a woman who had an order that ridiculous and insisted it is heated to  degrees celsius., aposnot , not –I will KNOW the dferenceapos. Itaposs not just baristas who are angry at the trend, many customers are tired of long queues thanks to the complicated drinks. One posted online: The line at my local SB is ridiculously long, more than usual. I asked the barista whataposs been going on. He said a lot of people are ordering the TikTok drinks. Another added: Iaposd make a register sign that says aposTIKTOK DRINKS +apos. While a third wrote: Starbucks should hire one extra employee who ONLY does TikTok drinks. You have to come in-store to order it, watch the person make it for you so you can appreciate the work that goes into it, and a  tip is mandatory.What do you think, are the complicated drinks impacting the coffee industry  Let us know in the comments...

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeAfter weeks of miserable weather, the forecast is finally looking up - and just in time for the bank holiday weekend.So what better time to dust off the barbeque and invite your nearest and dearest around to enjoy a spot of sunshine - especially now that coronavirus restrictions have eased.But whilst the smell of food cooking is dreamy, the smell of smoke that clings to your clothes, blankets, furniture and basically anything within a -foot radius of the BBQ, is impossible to escape - and just as hard to remove. So, we spoke to cleaning expert and founder of Laundryheap, Deyan Dimitrov, to see what we can do to get rid of the smell. Overwashing garments is never good for their longevity soyour outfit is otherwise clean, try airing it outside before putting it in the washing machine, Deyan suggests.  If the neighbours are lighting up their own barbeque or the clouds are looking ominous, head to the bathroom instead! Hang the item up whilst having a hot shower to let the steam relax the fabric fibres and release any unwanted odours - this is also a great decreasing trickyou’re rushing out to your next barbeque! Another quick fix is a homemade fabric freshening spray.  Mix vinegar, which is as cheap as chips and acts as a natural deodorizer, with water and a few drops of essential oil for a more pleasant scent. Then, just spritz the solution over your smoky clothes. Or,you really need to resort to a machine, try this first: seal the garment in a bag with baking soda and leave it overnight as the powder will help to absorb any odours. Then add half a cup of lemon juice or vodka to the wash! This will leave your clothes looking clean and smelling fresh.Have you got any other suggestions  Let us know in the comments.

Sally, from Kingston on Thames, admitted she was put off the property entirely as it is in the middle of nowhere and the sighting of the rogue legs didnapost help.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @MirrorWeirdNewsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnReddit"},{"url":null,"title":"woman bemused found fox stuck","story":"NewsWoman bemused when she found a fox stuck in her washing machine at her London homeNatasha Prayag, , was astonished to find the creature cooped up in the appliance on Monday, May , and a photograph of the unusual discovery has sent the internet into a frenzymirrorShareCommentsByJohn BettAudience Writer:,  MAY NewsNatasha Prayag was astonished after finding a fox in her washing machine \" %, rgba, rgba, url\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your dayInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.SubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Natasha Prayag, , was astonished to find the creature cooped up in the appliance at her home in London on Monday, May , after leaving the door open as she grabbed some bags from the car. The adorable fox must have snuck into the house as Natasha and her partner, Adam, unloaded the car - and looking for a safe spot to hide in, it chose the washing machine. Natasha quickly captured a photo of the fox, who was startled after being spotted and bolted for the exit.  Natasha, a content manager, said: The initial reaction was shock and alarm, which turned into curiosity. “As it was dark we decided to double-check it was in fact a fox. We both carefully peeped our heads around the kitchen but couldnapost see the fox. “Adam looked behind the kitchen blinds, which reach the ground, and even in the cupboard - the fox had disappeared. “As he was turning, he spotted a soft, little ear peeping out of the drum of the washing machine. He was in the washing machine.”  The fox made himself at home, with Natasha guessing the small, dark space of the drum offered security. She added: “You can see it looks quite relaxed from the pictures we took - almost quite happy. “We tried to coax him out first by whistling, then banging around a bit but he held steady. “I eventually got some food from the fridge - my little oneaposs pea pasta - put in a Tupperware box and placed it outside to lure him out.  “After a few minutes, he slowly creeped out and towards the pasta that was placed in the garden. However, he smelled the pasta then ran off out the back gate into the street. “He stopped, came back, snfed pasta again then ran off. At this point, we closed the kitchen garden doors in case he wanted to .” Luckily, the couple didn’t mind the unplanned visit. “Foxes can be seen as a nuisance but like any other creature, they are simply trying to ensure their survival,” Natasha said.  “The fantastic fox in the washing machine seemed very relaxed and no threat to us so we treated it as such.”After sharing a snap of the fox in its hiding spot on Twitter, Natasha quickly went viral with more than , likes on her original tweet, but it has also been reshared nearly , times.She wrote: “Honestly, guys. I’ve got a fox stuck in my washing machine. WHAT THE ACTUAL FOX.” Viewers quickly flocked to the comments section to share their amazement at the encounter – and a few jokes. One person quipped: “I’m an expert of foxes, and legally, he now owns your house. You have  hours to vacate.”  “The washing machine probably needs vixen,” another person joked. Someone  advised: “Call the manufacturer and ask what cycle you wash a fox in.” “This is why you should not keep chickens in your washing machine,” said another comic. Other people shared their own run-ins with local wildle. One person said: “I had one in the bath at am, left the back door open on a warm night. Cats were not impressed.” “We have coyotes in my neighbourhood, but they don’t climb into the appliances,” another person added. But other viewers were slightly more fearful. “So London town is completely overrun by foxes, that’s the message to take from this thread  My goodness,” said one person. According to the London Wildle Trust, there are around , foxes living in London at the moment, and in certain boroughs, the creatures are more common than in rural areas. After her encounter, Natasha has some stellar advice for any other people who encounter a fox in their home. She added: “It turns out there are some wonderful charities, including the Fox Project, that will offer advice and assistanceyou find yourself in a fox conundrum – or, in my case, a fox in your drum.”Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

allow the business to grow long-term.It posted revenues of more than £m in its last financial year.Mr Scott said: “Our mission is to provide all British dogs and cats with the best possible nutrition.#This funding round will enable us to continue growing.#Attracting this recent investment demonstrates the long-term potential for Bella and Duke and showcases the signicant opportunity within the raw feeding category.“We’re delighted to be working with our investors for the next phase of the journey.”Peter Farquhar, former chairman of natural petfood brand, Forthglade, will join

start next season “with a bang” as they prepare for le as a Premiership club once more.And he reckons the recently-promoted Dark Blues are ready to take on the country’s top ision right now.Since moving into midfield, McGhee has proved an indispensable part of the Dundee machine that powered its way up through the play-offs.Strong running between both boxes has been allied to some deadly finishing with the former Hearts man grabbing three goals in four play-off contests. | SPFL\" width\"\" \"\" src\"https:www.youtube embed CEIsUMmg start#featureoembed\" frameborder\"\" allow\"accelerometer autoplay clipboard-write encrypted-media gyroscope picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreenOne of those was the crucial first goal of the two-legged tie against Kilmarnock at Dens Park as the Dark Blues won - on their home patch.And they confirmed ato the top flight with another fine - victory at Rugby Park in the second leg.They may have become only the third Championship side to win promotion through the play-offs but McGhee was unsurprised at the levels Dundee reached in seeing off Killie.He said: “It’s transformed our summer. It’s massive.“You just want to cherish the moment as these nights don’t come around that often in your career.“I turned around in the dressing-room before the game and there were players with immense quality all around me.“On the park, when things aren’t going well, you look around and see a Premiership team.“We’ve definitely got a side here that can go and have a right good go at the Premiership and kick on.“I think we’ve got the nucleus of a team that can do something.“We’ve shown that not just on Monday but in other games.“We took a doing from Hearts at the start of the season but since then we’ve picked ourselves up, done well against Hibs in the cup and against St Johnstone we gave a good account of ourselves. | Dundee Promotion Joy As Kilmarnock are Relegated | SPFL\" width\"\" \"\" src\"https:www.youtube embed A_hgapJNaw featureoembed\" frameborder\"\" allow\"accelerometer autoplay clipboard-write encrypted-media gyroscope picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen“We’ve got a team that’s hungry and is young as well.“We’re ready for the Premiership.“We’ll do it our own way. We can rest up now and look forward to next season and start with a bang, hopefully.”The turnaround in fortunes for the Dark Blues has been a remarkable one – losing - to Hearts on the opening day, poor defeats to Ayr at home and away and failing to find any lasting consistency.Until the final stage of the season, that is.Since the - loss to the Honest Men at Dens Park, Dundee lost two matches in the next .One of those was to eventual Scottish Cup winners St Johnstone and the other in an aggregate win over Raith.On top of struggling for form at times, there has been a global pandemic to contend with in the players’ personal lives as well.That saw last season finish early with Dundee in third place and play-offs scrapped before an extended summer kept them out of action until October.And McGhee says coming out of all those dficulties in the manner they have speaks volumes for the club.“To a man, we’ve been kicked up and down the park all season by everyone,” he added.“Especially with the way we started the season against Hearts. To come back and get the club back where it belongs means everything to us as players.“I couldn’t tell you what the turning point in the season was – probably our attitude and finding confidence.“We found a formation which suited us and people have chipped in with goals all over the park.“When that happens, you’ve always got a chance of winning.”McGhee insists those struggles made their success even sweeter on Monday night.And he hopes Dundee fans can be back at Dens next season to enjoy their being back in Premiership football.He added: “I didn’t think about it too much because the whole Covid situation meant there was more to le than football.“But I think we’re stronger for what happened. The play-off games are completely dferent to any other games.“The pressure in them is unbelievable. We know we’ve got players in there who can play under pressure now.“We’ve done it in the past four games.“I think promotion is thoroughly deserved. I’m just delighted for everyone at the club and all the players and the fans back home who deserve it more than anyone.“The  who were in Dens last week were incredible so fingers crossed we get more numbers through the doors and there’s more normality for everyone.“We should cherish this moment and come out after the summer all guns blazing.”Liam Fontaine says promotion with Dundee is on a par with Scottish Cup triumph #

all of which share a lack of profile or wayfinding for those travelling through our region.#Brown tourist signage is simply critical: Dundee VA would not consider operating within the city without clear directional brown signage and similarly Aberdeen city and shire should not consider this current position acceptable particularly when its tourism sector requires such crucial support.#Take Royal Deeside for instance the fact there is no signage highlighting the way to Balmoral # a really important site for Scotland # is just not good enough.#I understand brown tourism signs are really expensive but it is really important too.#I believe that AWPR signage is critical to supporting the bounce back of north-east attractions and would help to reignite our visitor economy.#As we see the critical international trade come back again # as we will one day # we need to help ourselves.#Mr Hawkins, who previously ran the tourist attractions of Blackpool pleasure beach, highlighted brown signs remained in parts of Aberdeen, but were yet to be put up on the new dual carriageway around the the city.However, hopes of a helping hand from government towards the cost of the pricey posts were dashed when the Scottish roads body reiterated it would be for destinations to foot the bill.A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “The onus is on the inidual visitor attractions to apply for signage, where they meet the criteria set out in the relevant guidance, and approvals will be determined by the location of the proposed signage.“The costs of the signage will be dictated by the size of the sign required and the tourist attraction would be expected to fund the cost.”Mr Hawkins said the suggestion was #surprising# given the #suffering# endured by the tourism industry throughout the pandemic and called for ministers to look at introducing the signs as part of a #strategic economic approach#.He added: #Passing the parcel of costs to the tourism operators does not seem to be a productive way to go about this.#It is fair to say that some operators including charitable organisations such as the National Trust For Scotland would not be in a position to take this cost and to procure such signage.#The completion of the AWPR without tourist directional signage is unacceptable and is not representative of all other towns and cities within the UK.#The National Trust For Scotland is sounding out support for their calls # but has already won the backing of the north-east tourist board.Visit Aberdeenshire chief executive Chris Foy said the signs could perhaps uncover hidden gems which would prompt visitors to come back to the area.“We welcome consideration of any initiative that can help to reignite and sustain the visitor economy, and make it easier for visitors to discover the north-east,# he said.“Even in an age of satnav and smart phones, the recognisable brown signs can be an effective way finder for many visitors, and can also promptvisits to explore more attractions.”And Aberdeen City Council # keen to highlight the recently-refurbished art gallery, #jewel in the crown# beach and other attractions hoped to pull visitors off the fast track of the A # is also keen to take the idea to the Scottish Government.But onlythe initiative was to come for free.Conservative leader on the council Ryan Houghton, who controls the purse strings as city growth convener, said: “Anything that supports tourism within Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire is something that the council welcomes.“Alongside the National Trust For Scotland, we would be happy to lobby the Scottish Government # which controls the AWPR # to ensure appropriate road signage is put in place to highlight the many tourism attractions that are available throughout the north-east region.“I am confident that should Transport Scotland agree to fund appropriate road signage, then the local authorities would quickly move to ensure these signs were put up in appropriate places to encourage tourists to visit the many worthwhile attractions that the north-east offers.#As the huge bypass was being completed, Trump International complained about the Menie Estate golf course being #cut off# due to a lack of signs.Brown signs highlighting the north coastal route, towards Newburgh and Cruden Bay on the A, have been erected on the A Balmedie to Tipperty road, which built alongside the £bn bypass.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/05/vaccine-rollout-140521-e1621007541735-300x180.jpg class=attachment-part-medium size-part-medium wp-post-image ","title":"coronavirus in scotland here are the key demographics","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remWe’ve put together some regularly updating charts and maps showing the demographic information available on the people affected by the coronavirus pandemic in Scotland.The charts below show the distribution of deaths by age and gender.Given the way the virus transmits, we also looked at whether there was any link between the fatality rate and the population density.The NRS provides information on the number of deaths by smaller areas, known as intermediate zones, once per month.The chart below shows the proportion of deaths by location.This chart shows Covid- as a proportion of deaths each week in Scotland.The animated chart below shows where Covid- sits in the ranks of leading causes of death in Scotland.Covid vaccine in Scotland: Track the rollout progress with these charts\" title\"#Covid vaccine in Scotland: Track the rollout progress with these charts# #

That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#The question posed by the surveyor should, of course, have been: #Are you opposed to further development of onshore wind #In Scotland today we have , operational turbines# that#s more than the rest of the UK put together.We also have , consented  under construction and a further , in the planning system according to an FOI response from the Scottish Government.These figures change on an almost daily basis as applications continue to pile in unabated.How many people are going to continue to support onshore wind when they witness the total annihilation of this country It would also be interesting to know exactly where the data from #rural Scotland# was collected. Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local wi and  I cannot get G on my phone.Dr Carina Spink, MuasdaleSir,Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun’s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips, owners can help to protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun’s rays.Dr Sarah Elliott, Central Veterinary Officer, Cats Protection"},{"url":null,"title":"from cradle to grave","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It involves GPs, nurses, an army of health professionals and lots of support staff. It is essentialwe are to achieve what the publicsay is a priority, enjoying a healthy le.

And their latest distancing act is to #temporarily suspend# public representation on its Integration Joint Board.I am coming to believe that this critical situation has overtaken long-held belief systems that need to be challenged.In NHS values, the first statement is #working together for patients.#That is well out of date increasingly the patient has been a participator in their care, and the duty of obtaining consent means you can’t have treatment without co-operation.This report goes on to make clear that #collaboration# is a key requirement. That means we are an essential part of the system.It seems clear that we are going to have to fight to get past the unconscious assumptions of decision makers.

We once again highlighted our concerns over a lack of immediate action on the crisis at the Rest and be ThankfulDear Roy and Hugh,I am writing in response to an official Transport Scotland email to the Rest and be Thankful Campaign on the April , where you have sought to answer several questions posed by us at our meeting with your officials and in subsequent emails to you both. We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states #we are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace# yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.We believe creating  options for consultation in November  and five further options for consultation in March was a time-wasting exercise. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.A geological survey, which will take  months to complete, could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides.The email states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use#, yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for Transport Scotland which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in - weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay.It further declares that #we understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts#.While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside or people#s homes you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful. What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in Transport Scotland#s official reply or in recent press statements:If the next landslide, or subsequent ersion along the equally inadequate A, results in a fatality who will be held accountable Who is responsible for the social and economic impact on the people and businesses of Argyll while we wait another  years for something permanent to be done We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament.We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two km of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach.We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful.John Gurr, chairman, The Rest and be Thankful CampaignSir,Mental Health Awareness Week opened on Monday May  and we are inviting everyone to #ConnectWithNature to support their mental health.Spending quality time in and around nature can help to reduce stress and increase feelings of positivity, and you don’t have to be surrounded by fields or have to take a walk in the wilderness to feel the benefits.The Mental Health Foundation, which works to prevent mental health problems and has organised this awareness week for the past  years, encourages you to recognise and grow your connection with nature by sharing a photo, video or sound recording with your family and friends, and on your social media.Connecting with nature can really make a dference to your mental health, and now more than ever, it is time to look after yours.Julie Walters, actorSir,Alan Reid, Dunoon"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside kids vote for nature","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

However, there now seems to be an acceptance in Transport Scotland that a new solution has to be found.In a letter to the press, George Allan points out that the -mile route from Strathlachlan to Colintraive and the eight miles between Ormidale and Tighnabruaich were designed and constructed in  or  years.I was a member of the survey and design team on these routes. I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.Philip Shimmin, Inverness.Sir,I would like to say thank you to all the lads who have been working at the Crinan Canal # often when the north winds were blowing and water was pouring down from the hills into the empty canal more quickly than the pumps were able to remove it.The men greeted me each morning as I walked past to go over the temporary bridge.

With the evenings getting longer and brighter you can use your garden or patio as a great extension to your home and just sit back and relax.It’s at this time of year that lawns need to be mowed more frequently, so here are some key pointers on getting that perfect cared-for look.Mow at least once a week and raise the mower blades when it’s very hot weather. Don’t mow when grass is wet or during a drought and don’t collect your clippings during dry spells as this helps conserve moisture.Keep watering throughout the summer unless there is a water shortage and repair bare patches with turf or re-seeding.This is also the month to ensure that all your plants are adequately fed, particularly those in baskets and tubs.Plants benefit from a regular feeding programme as they are growing vigorously and need their nutrition levels to be kept up. Slow-release granules are a good idea for pots and baskets because they last for about six months and release food as it is required into the compost.Not often thought of as a container plant, but an excellent option for small gardens, is a rose.A simple solution for June is to create an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.Just buy a selection of dferent sized pots, plant them with a ieties of roses and then place them together in a group.There is a rose for every garden situation. From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew. Pruning is also important to remove dead heads and improve flowering over a longer period of time.If you are replacing old roses with new ones, ensure that the old soil is removed and replaced with fresh soil.As the temperature rises and midsummer day arrives, here are few ‘must do’ jobs for the garden this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters a unique holiday destination","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But never mind, Chinese astronauts, who regard a moon base as essential for probing outer space, have just about solved these problems with a bioregenerative le support system called Yuegong-, or Lunar Palace  . LP is a temperature and humidity-controlled, sealed, articial human-animal-plant-microorganism ecosystem in which oxygen, water and food sources are recycled to create an Earth-like environment. The latest experiment had LP in use continuously for a whole year, with two crews of four each having two periods of occupation and the maximum stay being  days. All emerged fit and healthy.LP comprises a living area, two cabins for growing plants , an animal-raising room housing yellow mealworms and waste treatment and storage rooms.Crew requirements # food, water, oxygen and waste disposal # are accommodated as follows: plants and mealworms provide food, the latter being processed into ‘flour’ for bread.Plant photosynthesis provides oxygen and consumes CO, while puried water from plant transpiration and condensation provides drinking and washing water.Nitrogen puried from crew urine generates plant fertiliser, while the remaining urine is puried along with waste water for plant irrigation.Crew faeces mixed with straw are fermented by bacteria to produce CO for plant photosynthesis, while fermented vegetable waste is fed to the mealworms. The whole system achieved  per cent recycling, the only non-recyclable product requiring storage being solid waste from fermented faeces.All this represents huge progress, but we are not there yet. Running LP requires massive energy input, particularly since lunar days and nights each last an Earth month, and the nights are freezing.But still, I have read of plans to build kilometre-high lunar towers bearing solar  , possible because of the moon’s zero gravity, but don’t hold your breath!* https:doi.org . ...# arxiv.org abs ."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures may 21 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It will help protect the people around you, and help us avoid anotherto lockdown.\"It may be tempting to think as vaccinations increase and cases drop, that testing will become less important.\"In fact, this will only make it more important to spot and prevent new outbreaks as cases emerge.\"We know from our experience of last summer just how quickly one outbreak can lead to another.\"This also applies regardless of whether you have been vaccinated or not.\"While the latest evidence suggests vaccines provide a high level of protection against the effects of Covid-, they dont yet provide a guarantee that you cant still get the virus or pass it on to others.\"How do I take a test Follow these stepsyoursquore doing a rapid LFD test at home.Read the instructions that come with your test kit.Clean and dry a flat surface and wash or sanitise your hands before you start.Once you have removed the test strip from its packet, start the test within  minutes.Carefully open the extraction buffer sachet tube.Open the extraction tube and pour in all the liquid.Close the cap and put the extraction tube in the holderBlow your nose.Clean your hands again.Remove the swab from the packet. Do not touch the fabric tipof the swab.Open your mouth wide and rub the fabric tip over both tonsils . Do this  times on each side. Itrsquos normal to find this a bit uncomfortable.Using the same swab, insert it up your nostril until you feel resistance.Rotate the swab in your nostril  times.Pick up the extraction tube, open the lid and place the fabric tip of the swab in the fluid in the tube.Firmly press the swab against the bottom-inside of the tube and rotate it around for  seconds. Itrsquos important to mix thoroughly.Pinch the tube as you remove the swab and put the nozzle cap on.Squeeze the extraction tube to place two drops of fluid on the test strip. Watch out for any air bubbles.Set a timer for  minutes and leave the test strip on a clean, flat surface.Once your test is complete, place all used test kit contents in the waste bag provided and put this in your bin.Where testing takes place - community testing sitesIfyou do not have coronavirus symptoms but live in a community that has been targeted for testing, you can access a test at a rapid test site.These are only available in some parts of Scotland.You can usually just turn up and do not need to book in advance ndash but you should check the arrangements at your local site first.You will be tested using a lateral flow devicewhich involves taking a swab or saliva sample.You should usually get your result within an hour.Island testingThe First Minister also added that people visiting the islands should take two lateral flow tests before travelling.Nicola Sturgeon said: \"We are keeping island communities at the same level as the rest of the country at the moment, so that we can allow travel between island communities and the rest of Scotland.\"But we know this does create a risk for our island communities.\"Many of them currently have very, very low rates of Covid.\"And they will be welcoming visitors from parts of Scotland which I know many of them are looking forward to where Covid will still be circulating at a higher level and more widely.\"So If you are planning to travel to an island we do encourage you to take two lateral flow tests before you depart.\"The second test should be on the day that you are planning to travel, and the first should be three days before you travel.\"That means thatyou test positive, you have a chance to take a PCR test - which is more sensitive - to confirm the result before making a final decision on cancelling your visit.\"This is potentially an important way in which we can minimise the risk, of bringing Covid into island communities while nevertheless allowing our island communities the benefit of opening up again to visitors.\"Soyou are planning on travelling to an island over the course of next week, it is possible to get tests from today, and I would encourage you to do that.\""},{"url":null,"title":"times-league-table-borders-high-schools-appear-top-50","story":"A LEAGUE table of Scottish secondary schools has been published by The Timesndash and the Borders has two

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence.

He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"enjoy running a mok but please do so safely","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states: #We are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace#, yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.Creating  options for consultation in November , this, we believe, is a time-wasting exercise. Five further options for consultation in March. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report. Conducting a geological survey which will take eighteen months to complete, a process that could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides. It also states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use.# Yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for TS which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in  to  weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay. It further declares: #We understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts.#While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll, should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment. This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside, or people#s homes, you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at RABT.What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the Rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in TS#s official reply or in recent press statements:We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management, and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament. We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two kilometres of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach. We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the RABT.We stand at a once-in-a-generation crossroads.Earlier this week, a thought-provoking poem, ACCEPTABLE  by the Anonymous Mother # judged for needing a food bank to feed her child # started a nationwide debate about whether the world#s fth richest country should need food banks to feed children.This conversation needed to happen as our food bank crisis has become critical.Last year food banks in the Trussell Trust#s network handed out , emergency food parcels for children in the UK. This surely cannot be acceptable.However, fate has given us a rare opportunity, as history shows us that the best time to create a brighter future is after times of great darkness.The pandemic has been the most devastating event to hit our country since the Second World War, but it also brought out the very best of our nation.We recognised our real community heroes, we protected the vulnerable, we didn#t stand by when kids went hungry.But now, as we prepare to wake up from the pandemic nightmare, millions of British families still cannot afford food on their table.As the Anonymous Mother poetically says # it doesn#t need to be this way.In , Britain woke up to its new dawn at a similar crossroads # go back to the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to make things better.That great generation chose hope, and created a better, fairer society for all # including founding the NHS.This pandemic has been our generation#s darkest hour. This is now our new dawn, our choice. Will we choose the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to eradicate hunger in the UK I urge you to do just one thing today, and that is to seek out the poem that started all of this, and reflect.If, afterwards, you agree with me and the hundreds of thousands of other supporters of the Trussell Trust, that we can do better, join us as we collectively create a #hunger free future#."},{"url":null,"title":"safety first as shops reopen","story":"Wyvex MediaUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It#s a really exciting move as it offers the potential to climb the Scottish football pyramid.#From the club#s point of view, we want to find our standard amongst the new teams joining the set up.#We want to be the best we can be as the senior team of the Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.#With our acceptance into the WoSFL, we can offer a pathway for the youngest age groups right through to the under- side, being trained by Stuart Crossan, into our first team, representing Campbeltown in non-league football.#With that, it#s important to acknowledge the huge amount of hard work that has gone into making Campbeltown#s community club a Gold Merit Award holder, one of only seven clubs in the Scottish Football AssociationWest region, encompassing all of Glasgow and the west. This accolade was a major factor in our acceptance into the WoSFL.#Other factors in the Pupils# favour before WoSFL committee scrutiny included having changing facilities for two teams of up to  players each, a separate referee#s room, and an enclosed ground with spectator barriers.Campbell said of the club#s Kintyre Park home: #The renovation of the pavilion is nearing completion, through a fundraising campaign led by club chairman Alex McKinven.#Campbell added: #The SAFL was a great  for us to play competitive amateur football for  years. In periods, we went through some wilderness years but we have happy memories of successful title-winning seasons, too.#In recent seasons, however, the club became disillusioned with how the league was going, with dficulty getting referees and sometimes teams to travel to Kintyre at a week#s notice – this was not a feature against even rival teams in years gone by.#In the WosFL, our geography could not be a determining factor in league entry as we are SFA West region members, which meant that the criteria we could meet on a match day, and the quality of our community club pathway, mattered most.#Meanwhile, the Pupils are gearing up for le in the WoSFL with contact training resuming on Tuesday evening.The team have been training twice weekly in a non-contact setting to build up their base fitness since March.Campbell added: #Training has been well attended, led by coaches Norman Thomson and Lewis Mackay, and although it has been hard to get the players together with ongoing restrictions, the squad are right behind the move and excited about the challenge ahead.#Campbeltown Pupils are keen to hear from anyone who would be able to help with ground and park maintenance.

As German troops advanced through Normandy, the st fought valiantly, protecting French citizens, hoping evacuation by sea would be forthcoming.On June  , German tanks surrounded the ision at the French fishing port of St Valéry. This, alongside a curtain of heavy fog, made the long-awaited flotilla rescue unviable and they were forced to surrender. Those who were not killed in the fighting were captured as prisoners of war and marched to camps in Eastern Europe, where they remained for five gruelling years.Following the commemorations to mark the th anniversary of the battle last June, a remarkable story has emerged. One brave soldier miraculously evaded capture and was taken in by a French family who hid him from the occupying German forces.#We were contacted by Monsieur Patrick Prieur, a -year-old St Valéry resident whose grandparents and father remained in the town during the entirety of the war. He told us the story of the escapee and the tragedy that befell him,# said Dr Claire Armstrong, chief executive of Legion Scotland.#As we approach the st anniversary of the battle, we hope to identy this Scottish hero, give him the recognition he deserves and bring peace to his family.#Patrick Prieur recalled the tale his late father told him: #A soldier from the st Highland Division was hidden by a family in the village. They bonded and the family learned he was a married man with a we and two daughters waiting for him tohome.#For several weeks, the soldier remained hidden but, regretfully, he was eventually discovered by German troops and marched through the town to the municipal cemetery.#After being forced to dig his own grave, he was positioned against the cemetery wall and shot. His death deeply upset the townspeople, who had been aware of his hiding, and especially my father, who was only  at the time.#In later years, the Franco-British military cemetery was built and his body was moved there. His grave is marked as #Known unto God# and my father and other villagers tended to it for decades after the war ended.#Monsieur Prieur added: #My father had been gted a piece of paper on which the soldier#s name was written, #Keller Len Scott#, and this became his prized possession. He desperately wanted to find the soldier#s family to tell them what had happened to their beloved and where he was laid to rest, but having very little information, he struggled.#In  my father passed away and, being eager to finish what he started, I recently contacted Poppyscotland and the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association to ask for help.#Michelle McKearnon, head of engagement at the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association, said: #We started to do our own research to unearth the fallen soldier#s identity but only got so far. We believe the name order on the piece of paper may have been written in military fashion, with the surname preceding any given names, so the family name might be Keller.#We#re now at an impasse, struggling to find additional information through our own resources, so we need the knowledge of the wider community to continue our efforts.#Dr Armstrong added: #We are urging anyone who believes they know of or has any information about our #Unknown Soldier#, no matter how small, to get in touch.#This brave man fought valiantly for his country and to repay our debt to him for his service would be an honour, not only for Legion Scotland as custodians of remembrance, but for his family, Monsieur Prieur#s father, the people of St Valéry and, ultimately, for all the #unknown soldiers# who sacriced their lives for us.#Anyone with information that could help identy the soldier should visit poppyscotland.org.uk stvalery"},{"url":null,"title":"engines at the ready mach 1 stages rally gets go ahead","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

They did notto the harbour until after pm with the casualty in tow.The following day, Sceptre skipper Tom Smith praised the hard work and efficiency of the Campbeltown leboat crews.Diver Robert Lamont, a member of the leboat crew the night before, went in and removed the damaged rudder ready for Sceptre to be towed by tug to Troon, the finish of the race.The race sails from Oban to Mull, Jura and Arran then Troon, stopping at each island for a team of runners to complete a hill race.Sceptre, with a crew of four, was carrying the boys# team from Glenalmond School, Perth.She had run aground the night before entering Craighouse, Jura. Everything looked fine on the yacht, which was built in Argyll at Alexander Robertson#s Holy Loch yard to compete in the America#s Cup of .#As a precaution, we did not have the boys on board for the tough leg round the Mull of Kintyre to Arran,# said crew member Roger Finbow.#They haven#t missed the race they were on board Blue Damsel, carrying the girls# team.#The decision proved a wise move as not only did the rudder come loose leaving the yacht with no steering, it was flapping wildly and in danger of damaging the hull.As a precaution, the leboat crew put a heavy-duty pump on board but this was not needed.HMS Dragon broke off her sea trials to come to the aid of Sceptre. The Type  Clyde-built destroyer stood by until the leboat arrived.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOCalls were mounting earlier this week for a Scottish Office decision on the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Northern Ireland.The Scottish Office has been considering a business plan for state-owned Caledonian MacBrayne to operate the link with Ballycastle in Northern Ireland since the beginning of February.The company needs Scottish Office permission to become involved in the project.But concern is growing that unless a decision is made soon the necessary harbour work at Campbeltown will not start until it is too late for the service to begin next year.Two Campbeltown ambulance men were among six from Argyll recently presented with long service and good conduct medals by the Duke of Argyll.Ronnie Hamilton and Malcolm Black travelled to Oban for the presentation, carried out by the Duke on behalf of HM Queen.The medals are not awarded automatically but are made on the recommendation of a special .The Duke told the ambulance men: #What you do is not a profession, it is a vocation.#He also paid tribute to their families, pointing out the ambulance men worked anti-social hours for long periods at a time.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown was #switched on# to colour television on Tuesday by the town#s new Provost, William Craig, in his first official engagement.The service has been brought to Campbeltown by Redfusion, the firm which pipes television to several thousand subscribers from its mast at Crosshill Farm.The firm#s Scottish general manager Mr Colin Payne said that Redfusion offers a public service of which they were proud.#We looked at the television problems here. There were just BBC and STV and occasionally Ulster in the town.#We said can we bring to Campbeltown the full range of colour programmes which are available where and the answer to that was #yes#.#There are now six programmes on the system. There aren#t many places in the country which can receive this.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOAn English steam liner which called in here for bait one day last week had full bunkers and a plentul reserve of coal in ious corners. She had gone to Ostende for the fuel.A further restriction of the gas supply in the burgh comes into force on Saturday night. The hours during which there will be reduced and normal pressure respectively are given in advertisement.The local branch of the Miners# Union opened a subscription list this week for the purpose of starting a communal soup kitchen. It is not intended, of course, to confine the benefits of the scheme to miners or their dependents. Over £ has already been raised and the committee intend to publish the list of subscriptions next week.A welcome break in our comparative isolation from the mainland was made at the beginning of the week when the steamer Kinloch made a special run to the upper reaches, with mail, passengers and cargo.Many merchants, not only in Campbeltown but at Carradale and the west of Arran ports, were carrying very low stocks and this run was not made a day too soon to prevent absolute scarcity of not a few necessities.Flour, for one thing, was running very short, and the new supplies got by bakers were very much-needed.Alcohol is again tipped as a likely rival to petrol. The new motor fuel is being produced by the Distillers Company Ltd and consists of a mixture of  per cent of alcohol,  per cent of benzole and  per cent of paraffin. The idea of using alcohol is not new, but a fatal obstacle has been the unwillingness of the government to release its hold upon alcohol and permit it to be used for commercial purposes."},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and Be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.This week, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulancemarks its eighth anniversary – after a year like no other.Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, our Helimed crews have never missed a beat maintaining our emergency helicopter air ambulance service across Scotland#s mainland and island communities. In fact we#ve enhanced our service with the launch of a new aircraft – Helimed  in Aberdeen last year – which has already had a huge impact on pre-hospital care in the Grampian, Highland and island regions.In our busiest year ever, our aircrew have endured challenging working conditions, with additional procedures and cumbersome protective and safety equipment as they go about an already dficult and stressful job.But they#re not complaining – this is what the Scottish public ask of them, to save and improve lives, wherever the need arises, and they fulfil their role with courage and pride.Our exemplary performance during this national crisis has been a tribute to how far SCAA has come in just eight years and I, for one, am immensely proud of what the SCAA team has achieved.But our operational teams are acutely aware that we are only able to provide this critical service, thanks to the continued public donations which you have maintained throughout these dficult times. So you are the real heroes in our charity.SCAA is the people#s helicopter – funded by the people of Scotland, for the people of Scotland – and our two frontline aircraft are stood by ready to help you, your family, your friends, colleagues, neighbours or anyone in your community when you most need us.As we mark our eighth birthday on May , we are asking the people of Scotland,they can, to support us into the future. Any donation, however small, to celebrate our anniversary will help to save a le – just like the numerous lives we have already saved over almost , missions.SCAA vows to continue to transform emergency care in Scotland, particularly to our rural and island communities, with your support. Thank you.As a coalition of leading providers of care and support to vulnerable children and young people, we congratulate all MSPs on their election and welcome the consensus there is between the major political parties to tackle the growing mental health crisis in our young people.We have for some time raised concerns over a potential lost generation of vulnerable children and young people, whose mental health is being impacted even further by the Covid- pandemic.There have been dramatically increased waiting times for mental health treatment during lockdown.In December , for example,  per cent of children and young people had been waiting more than a year for specialist treatment, compared with . per cent in , a truly frightening statistic.A commitment by MSPs to focus on mental health, increasing investment in support services and intervention strategies, must be a priority for this parliament, giving our young people the care and support they need, when they need it.The frightening statistics on the deteriorating mental health of many young people presents a compelling case for a radical new plan for our struggling mental health services and for a national crusade to address what is a mental health pandemic, underpinned by considerably greater resourcing.This is a crisis we can overcome, but it will require a similar energy and commitment to that demonstrated for Covid-we are to achieve this and prevent many young people giving up on their futures.At sight loss charity RNIB Scotland, we are concerned the Covid- crisis might have impacted on people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older.We would like to highlight the emotional reassurance and practical help we offer during the coronavirus lockdown and its aftermath.Covid has eclipsed all other health news in the past year but  people still start to lose their sight in Scotland every week. Add to that stress over Covid and the lockdowns and there could be more people needing support and reassurance.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute and the Western Highlands for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as families, friends and carers.Losing your sight can be devastating news to take in. But our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.The uncertainty during the Covid lockdown over access to basic shopping and medication, a lack of information in accessible formats, the social isolation, the barriers to being guided because of social distancing # these have all added to and compounded the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.But we want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.To contact the Need to Talk service, phone the RNIB Helpline on    or email needtotalk@rnib.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types, providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew.Pruning is also important to remove dead heads and improve flowering over a longer period of time.If you are replacing old roses with new ones, ensure that the old soil is removed and replaced with fresh soil.As the temperature rises and Midsummer#s Day arrives, here are few #must do# jobs for the garden this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:CAPTION:June is the perfect month for creating an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.

The Mary McLean is skippered by Mr Duncan McArthur.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOThe South Kintyre Sports# Council made quite a promising start last Wednesday with their Fair Day programme.The weather, fortunately, was perfect and this contributed in no small degree to the pleasure of their outdoor plans.The Christian Institute Rooms were thrown open, as a club, for all country workers, who were made very welcome by the committee.Teas, etc, were served in the lower room, and from about  o#clock, the centre of attraction changed to the show field, where the challenge football match, between teams representing the northern and southern area, took place.The XI for the northern side was made up of five players from Drumlemble Sports# Club, three from Peninver and three from Kilkenzie that of the other side was composed of seven players from Achencorvie Sports# Club and four from Southend.The success of this fixture and the keen interest taken in it will be seen from the fact that over  spectators paid to witness it.At first, perhaps, the players were somewhat over anxious, but after a little they settled down and gave a display which, considering the time and opportunity they have had for practise, surprised and pleased the spectators.Some slips were made on either side, and, after a very good game, the southern combination ran out winners, by the odd goal."},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 28 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Mr Mitchell acknowledged receipt of these answers.I was alarmed and saddened by the headline #Failing# school is #betraying# pupils and the community# in last week#s Courier.Coming from a retired Campbeltown Grammar Schoolteacher, it is hard to believe that someone who has worked in the profession could have such criticism for his her fellow colleagues.Although clearly passionate about the future of CGS, perhaps retirement has helped this inidual forget what a challenging job all school staff face.It is commonly known that CGS has not had its troubles to seek in recent years with major staff shortages due to ill health and other unforeseen circumstances.The league tables do not make good reading but, on their own, I don#t think they reflect the efforts of the staff.It is a well known fact that you can take a horse to water but you cannot make it drink. Is the behaviour of pupils the greatest barrier to success Despite the efforts of teachers to discipline the pupils, there are few deterrents for the offenders, especially where the pupil is aware that,they ask, the parent will fight their corner instead of backing the school.The responsibility of teaching our children to behave and respect others needs to be instilled from early years by us all and not just when the child reaches CGS.Maybe the retired teacher should offer his her skills and visit CGS and see the problems that all staff are facing It is time for the community to pull together and support our school and encourage our children to believe that a good education is very achievable in CGS.Recently, an investigation by the Herald newspaper uncovered that #just over half of Scotland#s leline ferry network is operating outwith its working le expectancy#, with  vessels out of  in operation over  years old.Despite the huge challenges created by the Covid- pandemic that our hard-working ferry crews have to deal with,  residents rightly expect a high quality ferry service that runs on time and has enough space to ensure they can travel to and from the islands, businesses can transport goods to the mainland and tourists can visit our islands to boost the economy.Unfortunately, cancellations and delays continue to plague routes. I have been working closely with residents, our community councils and other parties to find long-term solutions.This pressing matter simply can#t be left on the backburner.The  National Lottery Awards are now open for entries.Once again, the annual search for the UK#s favourite National Lottery-funded people and projects will recognise those iniduals and organisations who have made an extraordinary impact in their community – especially during these unprecedent times.National Lottery players raise £ million every week for good causes and we know this money is being used in amazing and inspiring ways.As part of The National Lottery Awards, we want to celebrate those whose selfless dedication and fantastic work makes such a dference in villages, towns and cities across the country.Encompassing all areas of National Lottery funding, you nominate local legends and hometown heroes in the following categories: culture, arts and film, community charity, heritage and sport.In addition, there will be a young hero award for someone under the age of .Groups or organisations are eligible to enter The National Lottery Project of the Year category, where shortlisted finalists will face a public vote later in the year.All award winners will receive an iconic National Lottery Awards trophy and £, for their organisation.Nominations can be made by completing an entry form on our website at www.lotterygoodcauses.org.uk awards.All nominees must have been funded by The National Lottery or be associated with a National Lottery funded project. Entries must be received by midnight on June .Now, as we approach summer with hopefully fewer restrictions, we can start to make plans about how we will spend time with family and friends.Following the challenging year we have experienced, we could all do with a bit more play in our lives. Play is a hugely important part of childhood and has a whole host of benefits, including improving physical and mental health and wellbeing.Throughout this pandemic, children have had to deal with so many dficult challenges some having to stay in unsafe homes and many living with families who are struggling with health worries and financial issues.Children have told Childline that they have struggled to cope and their mental health has suffered as a result.It doesn#t matter how people choose to play this Childhood Day , whether it#s organising a sponsored kickabout in the park, a game of cards, a musical get-together or an online gaming tournament, we just want as many as possible playing and raising money to help us keep children safe.We look forward to hearing how your readers plan to support the NSPCC and children across Scotland this Childhood Day.To find out more and download a fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk childhoodday or search online for NSPCC Childhood Day."},{"url":null,"title":"look out little explorers about","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is a big commitment for the school, requiring  hours of #on site# work.After finding out about Scottish-born American naturalist John Muir, his love for nature and his environmental work, the children mapped along their nearest beach and undertook a beach clean.Nearby, the pupils discovered a trig point and a lookout or watchtower.They are interested in finding out more about Kintyre#s lookout towers and are appealing to Courier readers with any information or stories to send them letters to: Rhunahaorine Primary School, Tayinloan, Tarbert, PA XG.Some of the children are also interested in the rocks on the beach beside the lookout tower at Rhunahaorine.They collected ious examples and took turns smashing them in the hope of finding geodes – crystals or other mineral matter – inside. They discovered lots of interesting patterns but no real geodes – this is perhaps a lelong project for some.Other pupils are interested in the shells and crabs on the beach. Crabs #body parts# are often collected and it is deemed a good finda moveable claw or leg can be worked.During one visit, the youngsters searched for shark egg cases and, after what seemed to be a fruitless hunt, more than  were found in one morning when their eyes became accustomed to what they were searching for. Their findings were submitted to the Shark Trust.Head teacher Catriona Brown told the Courier she was #very impressed# with the children#s enthusiasm and commitment throughout the project so far.Mrs Brown hopes to be able to share in the near futureany of the children achieve the award."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 28 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Did he feel embarrassed in front of his friends who did not share his doubts, did he feel ashamed that his faith had not remained resolute or was he able to put those feelings aside and share the joy of the risen Lord We do know that Thomas responded with the words: #My Lord and my God.#More than two thousand years later, we may feel embarrassedour faith falters and doubts set in.However, we should focus on the happiness of which Jesus speaks.Have the strength and hope to echo the words of Thomas: #My Lord and my God.#Do not beat yourself up for doubting – have the strength to believe."},{"url":null,"title":"former-ross-high-pupil-ruari-paton-aiming-scottish-cup-glory","story":"Ruari Paton will be hoping to line up for Stranraer todaywhen they make the long journey north to face Brora Rangers, who stunned Hearts in the previous round.The frontman attended the Tranent secondary school after signing for Hibernian as a teenager and making the move from Dublin.Many had expected Stranraer to be travelling to Tynecastle this weekend but Brora caused one of the biggest shocks in the competitionrsquos history when they won - last Tuesday.Paton was part of the Stranraer team taking on Brechin City at the same time and said that his reaction was much the same as football fans up and down the country when he heard the result.He said: ldquoI would not like to take anything away from Brora but you donrsquot really hear of a Championship team getting beaten by a Highland League or a Lowland League team ever.ldquoIt was a shock, it was a big shock, but fair play to them.ldquoWhat an achievement it is and it is an amazing challenge to overcome.ldquoYou cannot take anything away from them.Stranraer have enjoyed an impressive start to the campaign, with just one defeat since the beginning of November, as they look toto League One.Paton, who now lives in Bothwell, South Lanarkshire, has been at the heart of that form, scoring eight goals in all competitions, with strikes against Spartans and a last-minute penalty winner against Kelty Hearts in the previous round.He has also found the net for Gala Fairydean Rovers, while on loan from Hibs, and for East Kilbride in the competition last year.Now, attention has turned to the trip to Brora and Paton said: ldquoTherersquos nothing better in the world than scoring.

James VI also came to the Bass in  as a guest of a later Lauder he liked the island so much that he offered to purchase it, but here he was snubbed.During the reign of Charles II, the Bass became a notorious prison, mainly used for the Covenanters.As many as  of these religious dissidents were held on the island, under appalling conditions: there was a well that produced fresh water, but fresh meat was a scarcity and the fishy taste of the seabirds was a torment to the wretched prisoners.In , four Jacobite officers were imprisoned on the Bass but they successfully took over control of the island and ordered the garrison to depart. After reinforcements had been received, they withstood a siege of nearly three years, under trying conditions, before they surrendered with full military honours in May .The Bass later passed into the ownership of the Dalrymple family, to which it still belongs today.The Bass Rock lighthouse was constructed in  by the celebrated engineer David Stevenson, a cousin of Robert Louis. He made sure that parts of the old castle were demolished for the stone to be harvested to build the -metre lighthouse, which served its purpose well for many years to come.It was lit with gas derived from vaporised paraffin oil for many years, monitored by the lighthouse keeper.Since , when the lighthouse was converted to electricity and remotely controlled, the lighthouse keeper was no longer needed, and the Bass Rock has been without any permanent human resident.From his house lsquoRockstowesrsquo on Melbourne Road, the celebrated postcard artist Reginald Phillimore enjoyed uninterrupted views of the Bass Rock.He had a fascination with the island, visited it many times and wrote a guidebook that he published himself.The Bass Rock is home to the largest gannet colony in the world: , birds spend their summer residence here, having been in Africa for the winter.The gannet, or lsquosolan goosersquo as it was known in Phillimorersquos time, is a large and formidable-looking seabird, with a white body, a yellow neck and head, and black and white speckled wings and tail.The reason that much of the Bass Rock appears white from a distance is the sheer number of birds and their acrid droppings.The gannet hunts fish by ing headlong into the sea, as any visitor to the Bass Rock can observe at close range.The air is full of birds, which are squawking cacophonously, and the smell from their droppings is very noticeable.Phillimore made some beautul postcards featuring the Bass Rock gannets he is likely to have travelled to the island from Canty Bay or on a vessel from North Berwick, but nowadays access to the Bass can be arranged via the Scottish Seabird Centre.This is an edited extract from Jan Bondesonrsquos book R.P.

With Children.\"She [Rebel] is like me, in that Ive been a working mum my whole le,\" says the -year old, who is married to Kurt Sutter, her third husband and Sons of Anarchy co-star .\"I am a much better mumIm a working mum, and I would not know how to sacrice one of them - and shes the same.\"Shes got this huge drive and passion for what she does, she also has children and loves them, and it gets messy and somebody gets neglected.\"In the series you see the repercussions on her older kids, and theyll complain about her - that she didnt spend enough time with them and she didnt make it to school s and she didnt do all that.\"But, at the same time, the two older children go into service work: ones a doctor, ones a lawyer, and theyre fighting the good fight. So, you see how it [Rebels work] kind of rubbed off on them.\"Also starring John Corbett, Tamala Jones and Andy Garcia, the series follows the \"funny, fearless, brilliant\" Rebel, and her work as a blue-collar legal advocate without a law degree.When Rebel applies herself to a fight she believes in, she will win at almost any cost.It feels notably rare still to see \"messy\" women like this on screen, and Sagal loves playing someone whos flawed.\"She is not perfect, by any means, and you get to see a three-dimensional person thats trying to juggle everything,\" elaborates the actress.\"And she orders a lot of people around - shes not always polite. Shes just kind of in your face. She thinks shes right and you have to do what she says.\"Empowering lead characters aside, what was it about this script that stood out for Sagal \"I was very energised by the creator of the show, Krista [Vernoff]. And when I knew that it was inspired by Erin Brockovich - it wasnt her le, because we dont have her le rights - I was immediately interested in that because I love what she does.\"Another draw was that Sagal knew the team behind Rebel wanted her she was actually approached and asked to play the part, she reveals.And it sounds as though it was a no-brainer to say yes.\"I love that shes working for something,\" she follows. \"I like that it means something.\"As an entertainer, I look at the whole thing as helping people, really. And then to have subject matter that actually gives voice to helping people... I dont think people necessarily need to watch television because of that but for me, personally, to be able to be saying something is important to me. So, all of that attracted me to it.\"Also, shes very dferent to me. People think just because Ive played a lot of badass characters that I am that way, but Im really not. So, thats always fun for me to be in that position.\"As part of her preparation for the role, Sagal met Brockovich, who is now in her sixties, a couple of times.She recalls having lunch with her and Vernoff, and how they all \"just got on so well\".Being able to pick up on the activists vibe informed her work on the show, she explains, as the lunch quickly \"became like a sort of girls chat\".\"I understood who she was just sitting there with her. She talks very passionately and very quickly - and shes very smart and funny.\"There is a lovely warmth that radiates from Sagal, even though the interview is through a screen, over a Zoom call.As well as an impressively ied acting career, she is also known as a singer-songwriter she worked as a backing vocalist for the likes of Bob Dylan and Etta James, was a member of Bette Midlers backup group, The Harlettes, and she still performs on stage today.\"I love to play music,\" she enthuses. \"Now its so in the right place in my le because I dont rely on music, but I have my band. We go out and play and have fun.\"We end our chat discussing what Sagal has learned about herself from making Rebel, and she muses on how all roles allow an \"inner something to be released\".In the case of Rebel, \"she gets angry a lot in the name of something righteous\" - something the star has obviously enjoyed getting her teeth into, from the way she smiles playfully when talking about the emotionally-charged scenes.\"Its so great to be able to scream and yell at somebody,\" she admits. \"And she doesnt censor herself. As a human being, I think Im a little more diplomatic, Im a little more concerned with what other people think I struggle with a lot of that. She doesnt care what you think.\"She knows that shes in the right world, she knows what she believes in and shell just let it fly - and theres something very liberating about that.\"Rebel premieres exclusively on Disney+ on Friday"},{"url":null,"title":"gardening-safe-plant-tender-veg","story":"Gardening: When is it safe to plant out tender veg Tomatoes and chillies in a bowIts just about time to plant out tender veg safely - or is it The rise and fall of temperatures this spring - April started off warm and dry, but ended up being the frostiest April in  years - has left some gardeners in a quandary about when to plant out their tender edibles, including courgettes, tomatoes and chillies.Gardening expert, bestselling author and presenter, Alys Fowler, says that a handful of tender crops need to bake in warm conditions, and sulkthey are subjected to cold and wet.\"Chillies, tomatoes and aubergines should have already been sown, although you could get away with sowing courgettes and possibly sweetcorn in mid-May,\" says Fowler, whose new book Eat What You Grow offers a wealth of advice on growing fruit and veg.As a general rule, tender plants that have been sown indoors can be taken outside between mid-May and early June, depending on where you live, but only when all danger of frost has passed.Tender plants will need to be hardened off - acclimatised gradually and with protection, whether it be a cold frame, greenhouse, sheltered porch or under a cloche, she advises.Tomatoes\"To have good tomato growth you need night-time temperatures to remain above  degrees, and preferably -C. The cold spring doesnt mean they cant go outside, but they really do need to be protected.\"They need to be in a patio greenhouse, or something like that. You can use a cold frame but really the best tomatoes are grown in a greenhouse in this country.\"Growing them outside means you are growing them really late and you wont get tomatoes until September. They need heat and sun to ripen. Dont expect to be eating them in June.\"Some ieties are better for growing outside, such as Gardeners Delight, Kenilworth and Matts Wild Cherry.\"She says hardening off takes two or three weeks, and dont just turf them out on a really sunny day, as the change in conditions can cause the plants stress and they may wilt as they try to adjust.Top tip: \"The more room that you give your tomatoes, the better they will grow. Put them in the biggest pot you possibly can. The more root mass, the healthier the plant. And as soon as you see the flowers, start feeding the plant every week.\"Chillies\"Chillies are like tomatoes, they really need heat. They come from South America and want to bask in the heat. A good place to grow them is on your windowsill, butyou are growing them outside, it needs to be a really sheltered, sunny spot like a sunny courtyard or patio.\"They make a lovely houseplant, although some grow to ft, while others are really small such as Prairie Fire, which would work on a windowsill. The chillies start off yellow and ripen to bright red.\"She notes that chillies are hungry, so will need potting on a lot more regularly than tomatoes, in fact every time the roots stick out of the bottom of the drainage holes, youll need to pot them on. And once flowers appear, feed them weekly, she advises.Top tip: \"Some ieties produce a king chilli, which is the first fruit which appears on the first axis of the plant. Take it off, otherwise it will prevent further flowering by concentrating a lot of the growth into this single fruit.\"Courgettes\"Put them out too early and you may get lots of male flowers when its cold, which will mean flowers and no courgettes, which is frustrating. The only thing to do is wait for it to warm up.\"Courgettes are big plants and people tend to put them slightly too close together. They really are better .-ft apart.\"Top tip: \"Keep picking them when they are small and they will keep producing.

For turning Gaza into a refugee camp instead of allowing an independent Palestine state to flourish.Israel will never enjoy peace while it continues to oppress Palestinians.

It now influences our thoughts and actions in innumerable ways, so it is essential that we are properly informed about it. The more we understand, the more we can do to combat it.Learning is the key to this, and itrsquos an area in which Scotland is emerging as a global leader. Today, The Herald is launching an exciting and empowering new programme that aims to bring climate change discussion and solutions to iniduals and organisations everywhere ndash not just in this country, but around the world.Our Herald Climate Solutions initiative is linked with Climate Solutions Network, a pioneering new initiative developed by The Royal Scottish Geographical Society in association with the Institute of Directors , Universities of Stirling and Edinburgh and Jump Digital.This ground-breaking project offers two compelling courses allowing participants to learn about the climate crisis and how they can help to address it.One is the Climate Solutions Professional., which consists of four easy-to-follow web-based modules and an online workshop. It will help time-poor managers to understand climate issues and their relevance to their organisations and personal lives.The second is Climate Solutions Accelerator, an express online learning programme which teaches the basics in vital areas such as climate science and policy legislation and offers ideas around solutions in just  minutes.Both courses feature highly motivational materials as well as contributions from some of the worldrsquos leading figures in the fight against climate change.Those featured include global campaigner Greta Thunberg, former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, ex-Irish President Mary Robinson, former Norwegian Premier Gro Harlem Brundtland and recent UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.The programmes are the brainchild of Mike Robinson, CEO of the Perth-based Royal Scottish Geographical Society and a veteran climate change and sustainability campaigner.In  he helped found, and chaired, Stop Climate Chaos Scotland, the largest civil society coalition ever formed in this country.What drove him to launch this new programme  ldquoIt became obvious to me that far too many people still didnrsquot understand the relevance of climate change to their businesses and they didnrsquot have the time to sort that out, he explains. ldquoI realised I had built up a lot of knowledge in this area and that there wasnrsquot anything out there that could teach people what they could do. So I got together with the IoD and Edinburgh and Stirling Universities to produce this course.The full four-module course has recently been launched and contains some  hours of online learning as well as the two workshops. ldquoThere is a lot of expertise crammed into it. We had already had about  people subscribe to it, including  in the Scottish Government.ldquoItrsquos aimed at people who are managers, directors or board members ndash anyone who wants to have a robust organisation. Wersquove got people signed up from a whole range of sectors and I think that is part of its appeal. The point is that climate change is now pervasive. It goes beyond the Sustainability Officer or a single department.ldquoItrsquos going to impact every aspect of organisations, so itrsquos really important that everyone from the board through to Finance Directors through to those in personnel, HR, purchasing and other areas has a better and more rounded understanding of where this is all going.ldquoWe do touch on the science, though that has been settled for quite a long time and we only tell people what they really need to know. Then therersquos another part that is about the inevitability of the direction of travel.ldquoPeople need to realise the ways things are going on this ndash the forthcoming COP conference in Glasgow later this year is a case in point. International commitments on climate change are ramping up year on year.The shorter, single session Climate Solutions Accelerator programme offers the basics in an easy-to-digest fashion. Several organisations have signed up to put their entire senior management, and in some cases their entire workforce, through one or other of the two courses. And this appeal is global.ldquoOne major US company enrolled some of its Scottish staff in an early session of the full course and quickly decided that the learning and knowledge gained needed to be rolled out to all its staff globally, more to follow on this. Wersquore getting a sense now that there is a really strong appetite for this sort of thing ndash businesses really want to understand the issues and get on top of them quickly.ldquoThe global names wersquove brought in on both of the programmes to help convey the message have helped with the content and to make it clear why people need to wake up to this issue.Although the courses are attracting interest worldwide,Mike Robinson says that they are unapologetically Scottish. ldquoCountries are at dferent points and therersquos no question that Scotland is well ahead of the rest of the world on this journey.ldquoNo-one is perfect in this, but the UK is the leading country on addressing climate issues in the G and Scotland is the leader within the UK, with much more stringent commitments than the other parts. That means that we have a responsibility, but there is also an opportunity for us in terms of leadership. Itrsquos about helping people understand the whole of the debate so they can be better informed and better prepared. I hope that by taking the courses, they will be better able to build change and deliver the future."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12647851.jpg?type=article-full","title":"build-knowledge-fairview-way-life-schools-open-day","story":"FOLLOWING months of challenges and disruptions, Fairview International School is delighted to offer families the ability to visit the establishment in person as part of an on-campus Open Day.The choice of education is an important choice for any parent to make and this decision-making process has been made much more dficult without the ability to experience the physical school environment throughout the recent period of restrictions in movement and social distancing.At this Bridge of Allan-based independent school, staff have worked hard with families and pupils to make the period of home schooling as undisruptive as possible.Head Teacher David Hicks said: ldquoOur in person Open Day allows you to come and experience our campus, taking in the beautul surrounding area of Bridge of Allan and beyond.ldquoBy attending, it also allows visiting students to fully immerse themselves in a student-centred, inquiry-focused lesson, engaged by the passion that flows through each of our wonderful teachersrsquo ways of teaching.ldquoThe structure of our open day allows both you and your child to learn about the IB Curriculum while your child also has the opportunity to join a lesson, whether that be a primary years based class or a middle years based class.ldquoBy attending in-person you will have the opportunity to meet with existing students and their parents to find out more about our school and the positive community ethos we have built.

UBIs have attracted increased interest in a number of countries during the Covid- crisis because of a rise in unemployment and food poverty in particular.The Welsh government have been interested in introducing a UBI scheme for a while. Their First Minister Mark Drakeford was a social policy researcher before he became a politician and has a long-standing interest in welfare and social security. So what is a UBI, how would it work and should we consider this in Scotland A UBI involves a regular payment given to all adults to ensure that no one goes without an income. It is an unconditional payment, and is the same irrespective of salary, employment, housing costs, marital cohabiting status or family size. Itrsquos not means tested, so is paid alongside other benefits orearnings changed.Other countries have trialled UBIs. Finland has run the largest trial to date that reported results just a few weeks ago. It involved , unemployed adults aged  to  who were provided with a regular payment of around pound per month for two years. They were followed up alongside a control group of similar iniduals not provided with the payment. Those who received the UBI reported lower levels of depression, anxiety and loneliness. They also had increased confidence, happiness and had greater trust in other people and institutions. But the trial did not find that people provided with a basic income were signicantly more likely to get jobs.Details on the proposed pilot in Wales are still being ironed out. It is likely to focus initially on particular groups in society, including young people leaving the care system. There are some hurdles to Wales moving ahead with this ndash as social security is not devolved, they will need cooperation from the Treasury and the Department of Work and Pensions. A motion has been tabled in the House of Commons calling for UK government support to allow the trial to take place.A UBI has been considered in Scotland, and a  set up to explore its feasibility reported last June. It concluded that a pilot would be welcome but too complex to deliver at the moment. Determining the best way to fund a UBI would be challenging ndash a separate report from the Fraser of Allander Institute suggested that the cost in Scotland could be between pound and pound billion depending on the amount people would receive.:Cummings paints surreal picture of goings-on at dysal Number  ndash Westminster sketchItrsquos very obvious to anyone working in public health like me that health and wealth are inextricably linked.

We ask it to do remarkable things and it complies, usually immediately and uncomplainingly.Thatrsquos both a blessing and a curse. Computers and IT are simultaneously our best friend and an inhibitor to our advancement. We know things will happen when we click an app without ever really thinking about how it works or remembering that skilled people have worked to create and polish that app.This creates an assumption and an entitlement that acts as a barrier to learning when it comes to learning computer science. If youngsters in particular grow up with technology all around them, the thinking goes, then why should they feel the need to build that technology themselves Todayrsquos children are generallyregarded as what are known as lsquodigital nativesrsquo ndash young people who have grown up with computers and the internet as an integral part of their lives and as such, they are all comfortable and confident using these things.But the challenge is getting them to realise thatthey donrsquot develop a consciousness and a curiosity about the technology in their hands, itrsquos hard to convince them that they should consider a career in the science underlying it.To put it another way,someone is having a smooth ride in a modern car, they really donrsquot need to think about what is happening underneath the bonnet in the engine compartment. Therersquos an assumption because modern vehicles are so comfortable and reliable, we really no longer need mechanics. Until, of course, the car breaks down.When applied to computer science, this assumptive ethos is of concern to educators and in particular to Digital Xtra Fund, a Scotland-wide charity working to build interest in computing and technology among those aged  and under through extracurricular activities.Kraig Brown, the Fundrsquos Partnerships and Development Manager, believes this attitude is creating problems when it comes to getting students engaged in programmes such as the ones supported by his own organisation and others such as dressCode, which works to inspire Scottish girls to learn computing.ldquoThe term lsquodigital nativersquo implies that computer users donrsquot need to take computing science. It also assumes that they will automatically have the skills they need to enter the sort of tech-centric careers we are trying to encourage students into.ldquoThat might be the case for a minority, but it certainly isnrsquot for a majority. In fact, the phrase lsquodigital nativersquo diminishes the work that we do by suggesting the programmes we support for young people arenrsquot really needed.He adds: ldquoThey can go through school thinking that all they need to do is pick up an iPad and they can find everything they need on the internet.ldquoBut when they get beyond school and into university or an apprenticeship, they find they do need some computer science skills for a lot of careers in the world today ndash and not just tech-based roles. Once they realise they donrsquot have the necessary skills to get into many job markets, what do they do then  They can reskill or upskill but itrsquos much easierwe instil these computing skills earlier.Kraig makes the point that previous generations using popular early domestic computers such as the Commodore  or BBC Micro generally had to learn something about programming.ldquoYou had to know about computational thinking just to use them! Modern computers have eliminated that need. Thatrsquos good in many ways, it makes technology more accessible, but it also means many modern users donrsquot have those skills anymore.The declining numbers of computer science teachers in Scottish schools over the last  years hasnrsquot helped the situation. Even in , computer science is not taught in every secondary school.In the Highlands alone ndash an area nearly the size of Belgium ndash there are nine full-time Computer Science teachers covering  secondary schools. ldquoI think most senior leadership teams in schools appreciate how important the subject is by now, but because many donrsquot have the staff or resources, they canrsquot be as proactive in promoting the subject or getting their students as involved as they would like.Last yearrsquos Logan Review into education produced for the Scottish Government recommended that computer science should be treated as a core subject such as maths and physics.Kraig supports this, though he concedes the shortage of computing teachers will be an issue. ldquoThe challenges with computer science at the secondary level is negatively impacting a lot of young people in Scotland, eventhey donrsquot know it yet. I believe one solution is to aggressively upskill our primary teachers and introduce computing skills at an earlier stage to give them the foundational skills they need as well as excite them about the possibilities of tech.Recruiting more computer science teachers or introducing these skills earlier wonrsquot helpthere isnrsquot uptake from young people in secondary and beyond. How can the question of exciting students about building computing skills be successfully addressed  He believes the learning must be directly connected to real le.ldquoIn my opinion, the best way is to get industry involved ndash ideally young experts or professionals, but really anyone who can talk about their career, the skills they use, and how technology impacts this. So much of what we do in daily le is based on technology and the pandemic has only amplied this. It has also highlighted the growing importance of having technology and connectivity in place for all.Many people born before  have recently learned new digital skills as a matter of necessity. Kraig believes that the same kind of urgency and thinking is now required to inspire todayrsquos generation of young people to take the next steps to become digital creators and digital leaders, not simply lsquodigital nativesrsquo.www.digitalxtrafund.scot"},{"url":null,"title":"fmqs-sketch","story":"Having licked her chops after mocking Ruth Davidson all the way to the House of Lords, Nicola Sturgeon settled down to dine on her successor, Douglas Ross.However the new Scottish Tory leader proved a tougher beast than she might have hoped.He began by listing multiple moans from businesses struggling under the extended lockdown in Glasgow, Ms Sturgeonrsquos home turf.The First Minister understood the frustration of businesses, but you know, Covid eh  What can you do At least she wasnt Boris Johnson, the Prime Muppet who Dominic Cummings napalmed on live TV.\"It is sometimes necessary for people such as me in leadership positions [ie not you Dougie] to take very quick decisions,\" she said.\"It is often the failure to take quick and firm decisions that leads to loss of le.

He also said the Scottish Government was continuing to explore ways of improvingaccessto the EU scheme.However, the UK Government insisted the decision to end participation in Erasmus was based on securing value for taxpayers.The SAC analysis explores a wide range of issues facing higher education, including Brexit, the impact of Covid-, income pressures, risks arising from immigration policy, and ensuring institutions are adequately represented within the UK Research and Innovation funding body.:Support for moves to protect Scotlands participationin ErasmusPete Wishart, SAC chairman, said: ldquoThis is a crunch time for Scottish universities and improved collaboration and engagement on reserved issues is the key to ensuring the wellbeing of our university sector.ldquoThe reputation of Scottish universities and the research they conduct is nothing short of world class. But they face challenges made more dficult by Brexit and coronavirus.\"Getting the policiesimpacting right will help them through this rough patch and strengthen the foundations of higher education and research.Scrapping UK participation in Erasmus has proved controversial north of the Border, with the SAC report noting that ministers and academics here lobbied for Scotland to remain. Such involvement was opposed by the British Government, it adds.Earlier this year, Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, also rejected the idea, telling MEPs that, as a ldquoconstituent nation of the UK, Scotland could not be granted separate association.Pete Wishart is Chair of the House of Commons Scottish Affairs Committee.Nevertheless, the SNP manesto published before this monthrsquos Holyrood election says the party will ldquocontinue to advocate for Scotlandrsquos inclusion while also pursuing the creation of a ldquoScottish programme of exchange.The SACrsquos reportstates: ldquoThe Scottish Government has indicated a desire to remain in the Erasmus+ programme. Should they decide to continue down this path and be willing to cover the associated costs, and should the EU consent to Scottish participation, the UK Government should not block this endeavour .While acknowledging that Turing is expected to benefit more than twice as many UK students as Erasmus+ for the one year currently funded, SAC members also note the British programme will not support inward placements.ldquoWe recommend not only that the scheme continue with at least the same level of funding in future years, but that it be expanded to incorporate the funding of international student and academic staff placements to the UK, the report adds.Another area of concern is over-reliance on international student fees following a  per cent real terms decrease in public sector money over seven years.:EU chief closes door on separate Scottish participation in ErasmusldquoThe Scottish Government and Scottish universities should work with the UK Government and universities in other parts of the UK to seek out examples of best practice in ersying income streams away from potentially volatile international student fees, the report states.ldquoIn doing so great care should be taken to ensure that core focus on education and research is not lost in favour of commercialised corporate ventures.MPs also want to see new scholarships for EU students and lower visa costs for researchers.Universities Scotland director Alastair Sim said: ldquoThe report makes clear that by working together, the UK and Scottish governments can support Scotlandrsquos universities.ldquoWe hope both governments take the time to respond and ensure that Scottish universities can make the most of their potential, be that on immigration policies at Westminster or sustainable funding at Holyrood.Jamie Hepburn is Scotlands new Minister for Higher and Further Education.Mary Senior, the UCUrsquos Scotland official, said: ldquoThe report makes some useful observations, especially on the shortcomings of the new Turing scheme, and the need for an immigration system which works for the university sector in Scotland.ldquoThe report recognises that Turing is not the reciprocal exchange scheme enabling students and staff to live study or work overseas in the same way as Erasmus, and urges the UK Government to address that.A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ldquoThe UK Government decided to not participate in the next Erasmus+ programme as it was not in the interest of UK taxpayers and our net contribution would have been around pound billion.\"The new global Turing Scheme, backed by pound million, will provide thousands of students across all of the UK with the opportunity to study and work abroad.ldquoWe will continue to work with the sector and devolved administrations to deliver the programme.\":Fears over delayed university offersMr Hepburn said: ldquoThe UK Governmentrsquos decision to not participate in Erasmus+is hugely disappointinganddirectly impacts Scottish students and staff, who have benefited enormously from the programme.\"The Turing scheme is a watered-down imitation of Erasmus+ which will see support for our most disadvantaged learners cut, and opportunities for all our students, staff and young people reduced.ldquoWe continue to explore with the institutions of the European Union how we can improve Scotlandrsquos access to this vital programme.

This month, a group of people from around the country have decided to make their work-outs matter for those who need it most, by running in support of international relief development charity, Tearfund.Saraand Ricardo will be running km each day while currently teaching in Malaysia. Sara teaches Reception-aged children and Ricardo teaches maths to secondary students. “Running in Malaysia has certainly been hot, humid and sweaty’, Sara says, “But it is a worthy challenge. My husband and I dont run regularly so it has been good to spend time working on our stamina, especially in a hot climate. “Running has also many mental health benefits and as we are in Lockdown # here in Malaysia, it is good to get outside and go for a run to clear the head.”The pair have been in Malaysia since .The group of  members is together covering the distance between Belfast and the very tip of North Africa - , kms, over the month of May. Running mainly in Northern Ireland with a few international participants in Malaysia, Lincolnshire and Geneva, they hope to raise pound, for Tearfund - which could help up to , families living in poverty with health and hygiene training and food support as they await safe access to a Covid-vaccine.Millions of people in Northern Ireland are now partially or fully vaccinated. But for billions of people around the world, a vaccine is still a long way off. It is estimated that amongst people living in poverty, only  in  will access a safe vaccine this year with most others having to wait until next year or even  before they are able to.Sara says, ‘Covid- has affected so many people around the world in many dferent ways. From the loss of jobs to the loss of loved ones, it has been a very dficult time for many. “We are both fortunate that we have been able to work from home and that our families are safe. We feel it is so important to help others in need, especially during this dficult time. “To raise money for food to feed families and to support those in need of imminent healthcare is something we should all consider doingwe can.’Glen Mitchell, Tearfund’s NI Director, says: “We talk about the pandemic being a storm we are all experiencing, but in very dferent boats. This inequality has never been more evident than when it comes to the access to Covid- vaccines.AMPLE DOSES“Those of us who live in countries with enough resource to purchase ample doses of the vaccine are often also those who can afford to social distance and freely access things like clean water or soap. “For many people living in poverty, going to work in crowded spaces is their only chance at putting food on the table for their families. Still others, in refugee camps for example, have no way of isolating. “Many others have to walk for miles in order to access clean water, which they then have to ration through the day,’ he added.“Tearfunds core values are centred around compassion and being servant-hearted,” notes Sara.“The work that they have done and continue to do to help those in poverty or in the face of natural disasters is humbling. “We had heard of the km a day in May challenge through word of mouth and wanted to be part of it to help families. “To know that pound can provide a family with health and hygiene training and food support for  months whilst they wait for the vaccine, really motivated us to jump on board and do our bit to help!“For over  years, Tearfund has walked alongside communities around the world as they respond to disasters, including supporting people living with HIV and those affected by recent Ebola outbreaks. Tearfund helps communities to recover and create a more resilient new normal’. VULNERABLE“And now, Tearfund is working through local partners in more than  countries where the most vulnerable people need help with emergency food and hygiene supplies before, during and after Covid- vaccines become available. “Tearfund is playing a vital role by preventing the spread of the virus through improved hygiene and sanitation and supporting our locally based partners and churches to m“ake a meaningful, sustained response. While people are waiting for access to the vaccination, it is important to act to mitigate the spread of the virus and its impacts.The aid and development organisation is also working to spread accurate information about Covid- vaccines. ‘Alongside our work tackling poverty, we are also helping church leaders and organisations to use their influence to build a good understanding of the Covid- vaccines and help shape and support vaccination programmes that are good for society, particularly the most vulnerable and marginalised.”From the support she and Ricardo have received, Sara is encouraged: “We have been blown away by the generosity of our friends and family during our km a day in May challenge. “It has also been great to be part of a community with others who are also completing the challenge. “The simple words of encouragement and opportunity for accountability with pictures and Strava screenshots has really helped to spur us both on each day for our next run. “The Tearfund staff have provided helpful tips and cheered us on every step of the way!”To make a donation in support of Tearfund’s work responding to coronavirus around the world and support Sara and Ricardo’s running challenge, visit their Justgiving page at https:justgiving fundraising Sara-Braganza.

These have included its County Antrim congregations in its Route, Ballymena, Carrickfergus and Templepatrick presbyteries. Called ‘Fanning the flame’, the initiative is part of PCI’s Refined series of resources that it has developed throughout the pandemic to support and develop ongoing congregational le. Explaining the rationale for the series, Rev David Thompson, Secretary for the Council for Congregational Le and Witness , who organised the sessions, said that it was important for congregations to retain flexibility for the road ahead.“Since the start of the pandemic, it has been an extraordinarily dficult time for everyone. “For our congregations in Northern Ireland, it has been a very stop – start journey. “Thankfully it does feel like we are turning a corner and entering a moment of greater hope, optimism and opportunity, but it won’t be without its challenges.”The title for the series comes from  Timothy :-, which says, “For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gt of God [...] For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline. Key leaders from each congregation in Northern Ireland, including those across County Antrim, were encouraged to participate.David Thompson said that he was pleased that each presbytery has responded positively to the Moderator’s invitation to be part of the programme. “Timing is key in building progress and trying to do so too early may lead to frustration. “Leaving it too late, may mean we miss an important moment. This is why we began with our northern presbyteries this month, with events for congregations in our southern presbyteries taking place in June, which seems about right given their setting and circumstances,” David Thompson said.Running the events has involved a signicant leap of faith and rapid learning by staff in how to harness the potential of digital technology and presentation. Lynne Herbison’ PCI’s Programme Development Officer added, “The team involved have learned a lot and those new skills will be invaluable in opening up a world of possibility in how we can now engage with congregations and their members in the future. “Nothing compares to being physically together, but we hope our digital  will be able to supplement that and improve the reach of what we can offer to our churches and their members.”Presbyterian Moderator, Right Reverend Dr David Bruce, who took part in the events, said, “This has been a massive undertaking, delivered in a very short window so as not to miss this crucial moment as we continue to turn this long awaited corner.“ I really want to commend everyone who has made this important series possible.“We have been through exceptionally challenging times and I don’t want to minimise that and the suffering that this pandemic has caused. In my contributions to each event, looking at how congregations can begin to move forward, I tried to convey a sense that change often forces reinvention and reconsideration, opening up new pathways and patterns that overlay the old familiar foundations of church le that we cherish. “Exploring this, I am looking forward to welcoming our Republic of Ireland presbyteries to ‘Fanning the Flame’ in June.” he said.Dr Bruce concluded by saying, “In the long history of God’s people there have been many times like the months we have experienced, and in those dark days God was at work, and He is today. “It is my earnest prayer that we will see tangible signs of His leading, so that we can press on with confidence into this new beginning.” "},{"url":null,"title":"poll 31 ofnorthern ireland people plan","story":"Enter your code here\" required\"\"The access code entered is not valid.

Destinations include Portugal, Israel, Iceland, Australia and New Zealand.However, today’s poll reveals many are still deeply reluctant to hop on a plane abroad any time soon.People were asked, once vaccinated, when they would consider a foreign holiday.Just % said they plan to head away in  — % may travel this summer while another % would consider an overseas trip later in the year.The vast majority , said it would be next year before they think about going abroad.Another % said it would be two or three years before a trip outside the UK or Ireland, while % have no plans to go overseas at any point.The remaining % were unsure or had no firm opinion.Fewer older people are willing to consider overseas travel this year. Just % would consider doing so — % this summer and % at any point this year. More than halfsaid it would be next year before they consider jetting off, while % would leave it two or three years.By contrast, almost halfof  to  year olds are considering heading overseas this year — with % hoping to get away in the next few months and % later in the year. Another % will leave it to . Broken down by gender, males of any age are more willing to take a trip abroad — % plan to do so this summer and a further % will at some point in . Another % said it would be next year.However, just over a quarter of females plan to holiday abroad in  — % this summer and % this year. Some % plan to leave trips to .It comes as a public health expert from Belfast warned against summer holidays — despite the traffic light system for foreign travel.Professor Gabriel Scally told holidaymakers to “beware” and also warned it is “irresponsible” to travel to other countries while potentially infected with a dangerous iant.Prof Scally, a member of independent Sage, said: “The regional director of the World Health Organization in Europe issued a statement in the last couple of days saying there shouldn’t be international travel and I would agree with that.“It is undesirable to have people holidaying in international resorts at this time for all sorts of reasons.“It isn’t necessarily safe to travel on airplanes, there was a flight between India and Hong Kong and there were  infections and they were only picked up because of quarantine in Hong Kong.“Flights are dficult, but it isn’t just the flights, it’s what happens at arrivals and departures with queues of people in restricted spaces.“You also have lots of people from dferent countries mixing together at foreign resorts.“If you think back a year, the virus came to the UK and Republic of Ireland by people ing from holidays.”He continued: “It’s important to remember that the vaccine isn’t the cure all.“There’s always the risk posed by iants and it’s irresponsible to go off to another country and potentially take a dangerous iant with you.”Prof Scally also criticised the traffic light system, saying: “We need a proper managed quarantine system for everyone arriving into the country.”The Department of Health and the Executive were contacted for comment.Yesterday an airline industry chief said people who have received both doses of the Covid- vaccine should not face restrictions when travelling to countries on the Government’s amber list.Willie Walsh, director-general of airline body Iata, said people should be allowed to make up their own minds about the risks of travelling to amber list destinationsthey have received their jabs.Those ing from countries on the Government’s amber list must quarantine at home for  days and take pre-departure and post-arrival tests.But Mr Walsh, who is the former chief executive of IAG — the parent company of British Airways — said amber restrictions should be the same as those for green list countries for fully vaccinated passengers.He told the Mail on Sunday: “People were promised the benefit of being vaccinated — a vaccine idend — and they should be given it.“I thinkyou’ve had both shots then there’s no argument you can make to say those restrictions can remain in place, and people should be free to decide for themselvesthey see any risk in travelling to a green or amber country,” the former IAG chief executive added.Most ReadI don#t

Credit: Liam McBurney PAAndrew MaddenTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailMore than half of people in Northern Ireland believe parents should have the right to refuse a Covid vaccine for their children, our poll shows.The news comes after Northern Ireland’s vaccine roll-out opened to those aged  to  and a raft of Covid restrictions are lted from Monday.“This has been made possible because of the success of the vaccination programme and the majority of people acting on the public health advice,” Health Minister Robin Swann said.According to the Belfast -LucidTalk poll, % of respondents felt parents should be able to refuse a vaccine for their children, while % felt they should not and % said they did not know, were not sure or had no opinion.The figures, however, y depending on the age and religious make-up of those who took part in the poll.Regarding  to  year-olds, a majorityfelt parents should not be able to turn down a vaccine for their children, while % felt they should and % didn’t know or had no opinion.Those aged  to , on the other hand, had starkly contrasting views. Some % said parents should be able to refuse a vaccine for their children and % said they should not. And % said they didn’t know, were unsure or had no opinion.Vaccines may be refused for a iety of reasons. For instance, earlier this year several countries temporarily halted the roll-out of the AstraZeneca jab due to concerns of rare blood clots.Due to evidence suggesting that younger people may be at greater risk of the extremely rare clots associated with the AstaZeneca vaccine, those in this age group can choose which vaccine to receive.The latest advice states that anyone under  can book a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, or they can make what the Department of Health has described as an “informed decision” and get the AstraZeneca jab at Belfast’s SSE Arena or at participating community pharmacies.More than one million people in Northern Ireland have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine to date.Looking at the religious make-up of those who took part in the poll, it is apparent that Protestants are more likely to feel parents should have a say over vaccinating their children than when compared to Catholics.Some % of Protestant respondents felt this way, while % felt they should not have the right to turn down a jab for their children and % had no opinion, were not sure or didn’t know.Of those designating as Catholic, % felt they should have the right to turn down a vaccine for their children and % did not. The remaining % said they didn’t know or were unsure.In terms of those of no religion, % were in favour of parents having this right and % did not. Some % weren’t sure or had no opinion on the matter.On Sunday the Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride urged everyone to get vaccinated. He said: “A Public Health England study has found the vaccines are highly effective. This underlines the need for people to come forward for their first and second doses as soon as they are available.”Most ReadI don#t think he#s laughing now: Christian Jessen to pay record damages over Arlene Foster  tweetDUP turmoil: Resignations, walk outs and heated exchanges after #ding dong# leadership meeting but Poots insists party not idedPoots stays tight-lipped on whether he’d accept Mass inviteHurt, humiliated, trashed... and outrageously wronged: Arlene Foster’s record £k payout a warning to trolls that you can’t just post what you like and get away with itAlex KaneOpinionThe problems are already mounting for Poots… luckily for him none of his rivals are ready to take advantageTop VideosPlayEdwin Poots officially ratied as new leader of Democratic Unionist PartyPlayDUP turmoil: Poots insists party isn#t idedPlayEdwin Poots full speech as he is ratied new leader of the DUPLatest CoronavirusMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageCoronavirus QA: Everything you need to know as vaccination programme opens to all adultsNearly  payments issued under £k Covid grant scheme ineligibleCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No deaths, fewer than  cases and vaccine programme extended£m to be paid out to NI businesses that managed to remain open during lockdownLatestI’m paying my mortgage by fighting dragons, jokes Rege-Jean Page after flying into Belfast to film fantasy adventureDUP ‘nasty and regressing’ says Foster as calls grow for police probe into bullying and UDA intimidation claimsAhmed Elmohamady among group of players released by Aston VillaFactors in Dalian Atkinson death ‘impossible’ to quanty, murder trial toldTimeline: Usman Khan’s path to murder,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Macauley said it was time to move on.Thanks to the farmers who made me welcome and environmentalists who shared their love of the natural world,” he said on Friday.Hope to reflect some of these stories in my new role.”One of the first to welcome Mr Macauley was RTE’s northern editor Vincent Kearney, who took up his role after the retirement of Tommie Gorman this year. Mr Kearney had previously worked as BBC News NI’s home affairs correspondent for a number of years. Mr Macauley is from Cullyhanna in Co Armagh and has worked in the past for The Irish News and UTV before joining the BBC. He is a graduate of Queen’s University Belfast.He was a reporter for Newsline before taking up his role as correspondent, where he reported on stories such as the RHI Inquiry over the past number of years and the impact of Brexit on food and farming. He has also reported on the Troubles, paramilitary ceasefires, policing reform and political developments culminating in the restoration of devolution at Stormont.A keen hillwalker, Conor enjoys long days in the Mournes of County Down, the Cooleys of County Louth and the Ring of Gullion in his native Armagh.On his new role, Mr Macauley said: I#m delighted to accept the position of Northern Correspondent for RTE.

Photo: Stephen Henderson FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe image captured by Stephen Henderson. Photo: Stephen HendersonEimear McGovernTwitterEmailMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA Belfast photographer said he was “over the moon” after capturing a widely-shared photo of a stunning lunar display seen across Northern Ireland on Wednesday night.Stephen Henderson stood in the cold for more than three hours to capture a supermoon that was “bigger, brighter and definitely redder than usual” at Scrabo Tower in Newtownards.A supermoon is a full or “new” moon that appears when the moon is closest to the Earth in its orbit, meaning the moon usually appears about % bigger and % brighter.The May supermoon coincided with a lunar eclipse which saw the moon turn red but that was only visible in parts of world including South America, Australia and South-East Asia.He planned for several weeks to capture the shots but said a bit of luck also allowed him to take the picture.Mr Henderson , who previously worked as a sports photographer, said he had a few moments of panic when he worried that he hadn’t picked the right spot on a long road which he had scouted out in previous days to capture the moon in “exactly the right spot”.The moon first rose in red and then turned pink shortly after pm to allow Mr Henderson to get the shot.“I was phoning other photographers to ask them when the moon was rising because the hill was in the way of me seeing it,” he told the Belfast .“I couldn’t see anything until others started sharing photos and videos. Then I was able to walk down the road and get the moon in exactly the right position.”Mr Henderson said he walked around to find the right spot from which to take his shots. “The nice thing about moon photography is thatI move left or right, it moves the moon left or right of the subject. I can move it by walking down the street a few hundred metres.“People think it’s photoshopped or it can’t be done, but you can explain the terminology and the method and then they say “fair play to you”. It’s just practice.”It’s taken several weeks for the photographer to plan the image, compared to a year of planning to capture another famous picture taken by Mr Henderson of a supermoon over Stormont last October.Trends for capturing landscape photographs have grown over lockdown, with many photographers now clamouring to the same spots to capture phenomena such as harvest moons.“Over the course of a year I only get about three or four attempts to capture it,” said Mr Henderson.“I was getting messages the morning of the full moon asking where I’m going and what my plan was. I plan and drive around like a madman to try and get the right shots, I’m not going to tell people where I’m taking them. I was by myself on a road outside Newtownards and nobody  got it.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadI don#t think he#s laughing now: Christian Jessen to pay record damages over Arlene Foster  tweetDUP turmoil: Resignations, walk outs and heated exchanges after #ding dong# leadership meeting but Poots insists party not idedPoots stays tight-lipped on whether he’d accept Mass inviteHurt, humiliated, trashed... and outrageously wronged: Arlene Foster’s record £k payout a warning to trolls that you can’t just post what you like and get away with itAlex KaneOpinionThe problems are already mounting for Poots… luckily for him none of his rivals are ready to take advantageTop VideosPlayEdwin Poots officially ratied as new leader of Democratic Unionist PartyPlayEdwin Poots full speech as he is ratied new leader of the DUPPlayDUP turmoil: Poots insists party isn#t idedLatest Northern IrelandI’m paying my mortgage by fighting dragons, jokes Rege-Jean Page after flying into Belfast to film fantasy adventureDUP ‘nasty and regressing’ says Foster as calls grow for police probe into bullying and UDA intimidation claimsDisaffected DUP councillors ‘having conversations’ with UUP, says new leaderVulnerable young adult assists police with enquiries after Carnmoney Cemetery damage Deirdre Heenan and Mark DayanOpinionSeven points of action which would help address waiting list mess, once and for all LatestI’m paying my mortgage by fighting dragons, jokes Rege-Jean Page after flying into Belfast to film fantasy adventureDUP ‘nasty and regressing’ says Foster as calls grow for police probe into bullying and UDA intimidation claimsAhmed Elmohamady among group of players released by Aston VillaFactors in Dalian Atkinson death ‘impossible’ to quanty, murder trial toldTimeline: Usman Khan’s path to murder,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This party is always described as a bit of a family party and sometimes in your family you have a bit of a ding dong and there was probably a bit of a ding dong, but we#ll pull together, Mr Paisley said.East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson also denied there were isions within the party.People had an opportunity to say, they said it very forthrightly and it was all very amicable at the end of the day and a decision was made, he said.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePress Eye - Belfast - Northern Ireland - th May  Edwin Poots pictured at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Belfast where the ruling executive of the Democratic Unionist Party are meeting to raty Edwin Poots as the party’s new leader.

Credit: Sam Barnes   SportsfileGareth CrossTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailIrish athletes will be able to claim vital ranking points to qualy for the Tokyo Olympics at an event in Belfast on Saturday after it regained its European permit.Athletics Ireland has now agreed to support a permit for the Irish Milers Club meeting at the Mary Peters Track.A permit was awarded to the event back in December, before being revoked last week by European Athletics over administrative concerns.Athletics Ireland said it had not been asked to give the necessary clearance for the event and had only recently become aware it was taking place.When the initial permit was granted it was signed off by Director of the Belfast meeting Eamonn Christie and the Irish Milers Club#s Michael McGovern on Athletics Ireland’s behalf.“Athletics Ireland only became aware of the Belfast Irish Milers Meet application for a European Athletics permit recently. European Athletics withdrew their permit for this Meet due to administrative concerns,” Athletics Ireland said. However, following criticism it was announced on Thursday that the permit had been restored after signicant lobbying from those within the Irish athletics community.Mr Christie, a well-known local athletics coach, accepted he had been responsible for the mix-up that led to the permit being revoked. “I will certainly hold my hands up on that, call it my inexperience, or my naivety, but I didn’t realise I had to go through the national federation,” he told the . “I did eat humble pie, I did apologise, writing them a couple of emails, begging them not to stop the permit.Mr Christie said he was ecstatic and over the moon for the athletes taking part. “I know this is the news a lot of the competing athletes wanted to hear, and I’d like to thank Athletics Ireland, and Northern Ireland Athletics and UK Athletics, for their assistance, he said. In a joint statement Athletics NI and Athletics Ireland said they had worked together with their UK counterpart to resolve the matter.Athletics Ireland and Athletics Northern Ireland have worked together behind the scenes to jointly support our athletes to facilitate the issue of a European Athletics Permit with Category D ranking points for the Belfast Irish Milers meeting at the Mary Peters Track this Saturday, the statement read.Our commitment to the athletes in both the North and South of Ireland, their health, safety and status has always been the central theme throughout the management of this matter, and we are grateful for the support of UK Athletics in working collaboratively with us in ensuring that this meet could proceed with a European Athletics Area Permit.We wish the athletes and officials a safe, enjoyable meet this weekend and look forward to some excellent performances.Irish Olympic hopefuls set to take part in the event include Mark English, Phil Healy, Paul Robinson, Cian McPhillips and Michelle Finn who will now be available to qualy for ranking points ahead of July’s event.Around  athletes are set to gather for events ranging from the m to the ,m..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadI don#t think he#s laughing now: Christian Jessen to pay record damages over Arlene Foster  tweetDUP turmoil: Resignations, walk outs and heated exchanges after #ding dong# leadership meeting but Poots insists party not idedPoots stays tight-lipped on whether he’d accept Mass inviteHurt, humiliated, trashed... and outrageously wronged: Arlene Foster’s record £k payout a warning to trolls that you can’t just post what you like and get away with itHome comforts… ‘lestyle’ store opens in Belfast in £m investmentTop VideosPlayEdwin Poots officially ratied as new leader of Democratic Unionist PartyPlayDUP turmoil: Poots insists party isn#t idedPlayEdwin Poots full speech as he is ratied new leader of the DUPLatest Northern IrelandMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageI’m paying my mortgage by fighting dragons, jokes Rege-Jean Page after flying into Belfast to film fantasy adventureDUP ‘nasty and regressing’ says Foster as calls grow for police probe into bullying and UDA intimidation claimsDisaffected DUP councillors ‘having conversations’ with UUP, says new leaderVulnerable young adult assists police with enquiries after Carnmoney Cemetery damage LatestMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageI’m paying my mortgage by fighting dragons, jokes Rege-Jean Page after flying into Belfast to film fantasy adventureList of terror attacks where perpetrators were known to MIUsman Khan: Profile of a killerThomas Frank ignores the omens as Brentford seek to end play-off hoodoo,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Niall Carson PA WireLauren HarteTwitterEmailMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailIncoming DUP leader Edwin Poots has refused to be drawn on whether he would be willing to attend Massinvited.Mr Poots is a member of the Orange Order which forbids members from taking part in Catholic ceremonies.However, previous DUP leaders have in recent years steered the party away from this hardline attitude.If he accepted an invitation from the Catholic church he would be following in the footsteps of his two predecessors.Peter Robinson attended the funeral Mass of murdered Catholic PSNI officer Constable Ronan Kerr at the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Beragh, Co Tyrone in April .It was the first time a DUP leader had attended a Catholic Mass.It was also the first time any Taoiseach had attended the funeral of a PSNI officer.In March , Arlene Foster was applauded as she entered Derry’s Long Tower church for the Requiem Mass of former Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness.Mrs Foster later revealed she “lost friends over going” to the funeral but still believed “it was the right thing to do”.A fundamentalist Christian, Mr Poots is a member of the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, founded in  by Dr Ian Paisley  years before he established the DUP.If Mr Poots reverses the policy of his immediate predecessors and declines invitations to attend Mass, it is likely to increase fears from some observers that he wants to bring the DUP back to its traditional evangelical roots.A DUP spokesman told The Irish Catholic: “The DUP has worked with the Catholic Church on many issues from freedom of worship through to protecting the le of the unborn.”However, when asked whether Mr Poots would accept an invitation to attend Mass, the spokesman said: “Mr Poots is heartened that people of all faiths are able toto congregational worship and has received a number of invitations from the faith community which he will consider in due course”.Last October, the Agriculture minister made controversial comments that levels of Covid- are higher in nationalist areas than unionist ones.Mr Poots claimed the dference in virus transmission between nationalist and unionist areas was “around six to one”Sinn Fein’s John O’Dowd subsequently called on the Lagan Valley MLA to apologise for his remarks, claiming Mr Poots had effectively accused nationalists of spreading the virus. He said the remarks had caused “huge offence”.Mr Poots later denied his remarks were sectarian, saying they could not be because “most Sinn Fein leaders don’t attend the Catholic Church on a regular basis”..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadI don#t think he#s laughing now: Christian Jessen to pay record damages over Arlene Foster  tweetDUP turmoil: Resignations, walk outs and heated exchanges after #ding dong# leadership meeting but Poots insists party not idedPoots stays tight-lipped on whether he’d accept Mass inviteHurt, humiliated, trashed... and outrageously wronged: Arlene Foster’s record £k payout a warning to trolls that you can’t just post what you like and get away with itAlex KaneOpinionThe problems are already mounting for Poots… luckily for him none of his rivals are ready to take advantageTop VideosPlayEdwin Poots officially ratied as new leader of Democratic Unionist PartyPlayDUP turmoil: Poots insists party isn#t idedPlayEdwin Poots full speech as he is ratied new leader of the DUPLatest Northern IrelandI’m paying my mortgage by fighting dragons, jokes Rege-Jean Page after flying into Belfast to film fantasy adventureDUP ‘nasty and regressing’ says Foster as calls grow for police probe into bullying and UDA intimidation claimsDisaffected DUP councillors ‘having conversations’ with UUP, says new leaderVulnerable young adult assists police with enquiries after Carnmoney Cemetery damage Deirdre Heenan and Mark DayanOpinionSeven points of action which would help address waiting list mess, once and for all LatestI’m paying my mortgage by fighting dragons, jokes Rege-Jean Page after flying into Belfast to film fantasy adventureDUP ‘nasty and regressing’ says Foster as calls grow for police probe into bullying and UDA intimidation claimsAhmed Elmohamady among group of players released by Aston VillaFactors in Dalian Atkinson death ‘impossible’ to quanty, murder trial toldTimeline: Usman Khan’s path to murder,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

End to end swashbuckling football that turns the stomach inside out. Slaughtneils shoot-out with Kilcar in Omagh a few seasons back. Derrys win over Dublin in the  All-Ireland semi-final. Armagh and Kerrys blockbuster in the  All-Ireland Final are some that instantly jump onto this page. But championship is about so much more. It is about character and pulling a result from somewhere, like a rabbit from a hat. I think about Dungivens Ulster winning team of . Their performance against Errigal Ciaran that day in Clones was brilliant. It was a convincing win, but they nearly didnt get out of the first round of the championship in Derry that year. googletag.cmd.push In two nerve-tangling encounters at Drumsurn, they escaped from Glenullins clutches on the seat of their pants. Ruairi Boylans - nearly toppled them in the drawn game, before coming through by a point in a replay, their lowest winning margin of the season, second only to a two-point Ulster semi-final over St Pauls of Belfast. There are many others down the years, but when I think about the term championship team those two games in Drumsurn rush to the forefront of my mind. A team finding a way to win, Glenullin dying with their boots on. Chatting to Mark Lynch for a piece on Derrys encounters with Longford got me thinking. Are Derry really a qualier team  googletag.cmd.push More often than not, it was a sorry story from the house of pain. Before the qualiers began in , Derry were on the wrong end of two massive refereeing decisions. Henry Downeys perfectly time shoulder charge on Paddy McKeever yielded a free in as their Ulster semi-final with Armagh sat in the mixer, with the Orchard County going on to win the first of two Ulster titles. Then,  months later, they got another soft free – with BBC commentator and former Armagh legend Jimmy Smyth admitting as much on commentary – to go ahead before Anthony missed a chance to level the game from a free well outside the .     Sting through the championship records, I start to wonder how the mental scars couldve affected the county as a whole. Derrys runs to the All-Ireland Qualiers yielded the  tilt at Sam, only for running out of diesel coming down the final furlong of the infamous semi-final and Galways Matthew Clancy delivering a hammer blow. As the years went past, the challenge dwindled. The  season ended in a comprehensive enough defeat to Kerry in the semi-final. There was the high-octane battle against the Dubs in the  Quarter-Final and the defeat to Tipperary in the last- clash in Breffni in . Outside of that, Derrys championship record of the last  years is a reality check. Of the  championship games, there were  wins,  defeats and a sole draw, against Tyrone in , Mickey Hartes first game in charge. Derry have played  qualier games, winning . Of the  defeats, three were after extra time and the only extra time win was over Cavan in  at Celtic Park. Of the  victories, only the  win over Mayo and a one-point win over Armagh the same year jump out as scalps. The win over Monaghan in Clones two years later was of note. The rest, on paper, were games Derry were favourites in, including three wins from four against Cavan – the only county Derry havent faced over the last two decades in the Ulster championship. Then you have the Longford story with one win in four games. Add in two wins from four against Laois, another team Derry would fancy beating. In Ulster, Derry have won just  times in  games, with that one draw thrown in. On the face of it, the result looks grim, but scratch the surface and  of those games were against either Donegal or Tyrone. Of that,  were in the first round. The  win, under the baking sun in Ballybofey, was Derrys only win over Donegal in eight attempts. Of the eight clashes with Tyrone, the famous  win in Omagh, when the Red Hands were All-Ireland champions, is the only victory. In fairness, thats a tough series of draws. Five of the defeats to Donegal came in an era when they were jostling in the pecking order behind Dublin. The same can be said for Tyrone. But Glenullin wouldve been fair from Ulster club contenders in , yet couldve dumped Dungiven out on their ear. A team with the McKeevers, Brolly, McGilligan, goalkeeper Eoin McCloskey and rising star Paul Murphy. As Derry go into this years Ulster championship, they search for a first win in the competition since  and there is a decent chance it will be Donegal again. From looking back at the championship records, it changes the attitude on where Derry currently sit. Yes, there is a lot of talent coming along, but there is nothing that breeds growth like winning games. And especially when against the odds. I think back to Castlebar in . After being relegated from Division  and shipping a hammering by Tyrone in Ulster, Derry were seconds away from turning Mayo over. Conor Loftus bagged a goal to change the game and Derry went out with a whimper after extra-time. Two years later, in the Ulster championship opener in Omagh, Derry had Tyrone momentarily on the ropes. But after Shane McGuigans goal, they needed to attack the jugular even more. Darren McCurry had the ball in the net a matter of seconds later, as Tyrone outscored Derry - to -. Then there was last years game with Armagh. If Derry had got anything out of the first ten minutes, when they were all at sea, theyd have had a brilliant chance of victory. Thats three games and three massive uses of the word , but thats where Derrys future lies. Speaking before the start of this season, manager Rory Gallagher highlighted how Derry, in recent years, failed to win games that mattered. He mentioned championship and key relegation or promotion games. The manner of both league wins so far point to a team that can have a real cut at the Ulster championship on the other side of battling for promotion. Derry need to replicate Dungiven from that night in Drumsurn, in the  championship. By hook or by crook, find a way of turning performances into results.

He waves a cursory greeting and continues on his way. In the time it takes me to gather everything I need together, he passes me again, his step count no doubt rising with every lap of the town. Zoom. Walk. Laptop. Bake. Netflix. Repetition has become endemic over the last year, but its something Moneymore cant be accused of. There is a unique feel to the fronts of the buildings that greet me as I walk around the town. Even the post office, now boarded up, remains unbranded. googletag.cmd.push Moneymores terrain gives the town a layered effect. The pillared entrance of The Manor House provides the backdrop to the towns mini roundabout, welcoming motorists coming down the hill from Smith Street. Rusty scaffolding frames a construction site on my left as I make my way down. A woman waters potted plants in her compact front garden. The distinctive smell of curry is emanating from the two Chinese restaurants at the bottom of the hill. Shutters are down on Antonios pizza, yet to open for the day. More scaffolding sits alongside buildings in mid-construction off High Street, but no work appears to be going on today. googletag.cmd.push Along Lawford Street there are ersion signs in place as Council staff busy themselves in resurfacing the Turnaface Road. The grating sound of the road roller echoes off the houses that line the street leading back to the town centre. You could describe Moneymore as ornate. Older, unique buildings, set at dferent levels, create a layered backdrop, crowned by the spire of St John and St Treas church on the top of the hill.  The hum of a small aircraft passing overhead and the unmistakable smell of freshly-cut grass adds to the sense of a town taking new-found pleasure in the mundane.     A pregnant sky threatens rain. Taken a dip I nip into The Mane Barber Shop, where a neon sign declares the shop open for business. Owner Pauline McGarvey is at her lunch. She says reopening has not been the silver bullet the industry was hoping for. “This week has been terrible. For the first seven days [after reopening] it was great, but its taken a dip again,” she tells me. “The older folk that keep you going – your pensioners and farmers and that during the day – they havent been about the same. A vintage tractor model welcomes visitors to the town from the Tyrone side. “It was a gamble coming into a small town. You do have a bit of passing trade but youre hoping people are going to come in from the likes of Coagh, Lissan and Loup. “I said I would give it six months and see how it turns. Its fine, but its not busy. You have that fear of whether its going to come back.” Pauline has been in Moneymore three years, and until the pandemic ruthlessly attacked all businesses, things had been going well.  has seen a seismic change across all industries, driving many hair and beauty professionals off the high street altogether. “Lots of people are working from home and I have to admit, Im tempted,” she says. “Youre still going to be hit with rates, and you havent stopped paying your water bill, your electricity, your rent. “Yes, we got a bit of help, butyouve no customers in, then that money is all going to go and you still have to find wages too. “Ive seen a lot of hair and beauty people who havent gone back from the first lockdown.” Humanity adapts though, and over the last year, Pauline has embraced the situation in which the world found itself. She got married in February, and has enjoyed the extra time with her family. Keeping an eye on litter in the area. “It was the first time in my le I could actually say I was a mummy. I loved spending time with the weans,” she says. “It felt like wed a whole  years wrapped into one year. It is nice getting back though, you need the routine. Its bittersweet in a way.” Cookstown native Pauline says lockdown has really hit young people in the area hard. Her daughter, Danielle, is in Year , her entire GCSE years undertaken amid a worldwide health crisis. “Even she says she could do with another year at school,” she says. “Theyve missed a full year of preparation for the next step. Theyve been living alone in their bedroom. No formal, nothing. They werent even in school to plan it.” Its a quiet day in the barber shop, on what would normally be a busy Friday afternoon, with people popping in ahead of their weekend plans. There would have been excited chatter, the buzz of anticipation. Last minute changes of plan. Maybe even a wee drink. A look at her schedule confirms a gap of a few hours until Paulines next appointment. Without that steady flow of customers, the day can be long, lonely even. Welcome to Moneymore. Company is a two way street, and the dynamic of conversation, service and industry has been greatly missed by both barber and customer. “Even the most bald man that I have is in here every week,” says Pauline. “Two seconds would do it, but you would stretch it out to ten or  minutes, just because he likes coming in for the company. “Sometimes its just nice to get sitting down and get it done for you. Even though I have good faithful customers, I was nervous and jittery the first day back. “The amount of people who are saying its great to see you back, it gives you that wee glow. It would be nice to see a boom in Moneymore again. “I dont think anybody is going to feel anything dferent. Were all just going with the flow and trying not to stress and worry. “I think youre just going to have to wipe this year out the same as last year.”  The indicators that marked the early, panic-stricken days of the pandemic – the empty streets, closed schools, empty supermarket shelves – have long faded into memory. Only the window dressing remains. Sanitisers at shop doors. Face masks in shops. The odd discarded rubber glove on the street. All three car dealerships on the Magherafelt Road are dotted with customers as I drive past on the way home. The petrol station forecourt is hiving with people. By next Monday, theof indoor hospitality will mark another signicant step on the road to recovery. On the way out of the town, I spot a familiar cowboy hat bobbing up and down at the road side. A man enjoying his rediscovered freedom on the fringes of the Sperrins.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

After crossing the bridge, I head up the hill and pull the car in opposite the Vivo and the magnicently named Rio Grande bar. Parks Rio Grande, the Faughan River, flows through the centre of the village, which this afternoon sits under an angry-looking sky. A woman walks her dog down Learmount Road, her face set against the stf breeze that is swishing through the trees surrounding the village. The scene on Learmount Road leading up the hill. Rain starts to fall as a mother guides her toddler out the doors of the Vivo, one hand clutching hers and the other gripping the bottle of juice he has just been bought. googletag.cmd.push A large plastic ice cream cone sits hopefully outside the shop. Up the hill comes a learner driver seemingly on a lesson. She stops outside Learmount Resource Centre and disappears into the building, before emerging with her child in tow to resume her lesson. A delivery driver pulls into the yard of Devine Kitchens. He s to his cab and pulls out a hammer. Things must be getting serious. As I cross the bridge, I spot the wheel from an old watermill by the river side, almost reclaimed by its surroundings. A remnant of an  flax mill known as Quigleys Mill. googletag.cmd.push Perhaps the most clear view of the mill is from the top of the hill outside Park Hardware and DIY. Greg McElhinney and Matthew Devine. Inside, owner Greg McElhinney says the last year has been busy. “With construction and everything  closing down last April, we were very busy, which was good for us because people from the local area were able to do home projects,” he tells me. “The weather was good as well, so youd a lot of painting and decorating – fences and gardens and stuff like that – going on. “People were happy there was a local business still operating, because a lot of the bigger hardware stores had closed.     “It got to the stage when it was hard to source materials because suppliers were closed until June time, but people were happy enough to occupy their time. They had nothing  to do.” The remains of Quigleys Mill, Park. Parks postal area recorded an increase in Covid cases last week, and despite the attachment to Derry city skewing the numbers, Greg admits there is still a degree of worry locally. “The majority of the population feel we still have to be serious about this. Its drilled into everybody at this stage, like putting your seatbelt on in the car,” he says. “The worry now is were straddling the Donegal border to a certain extent and case numbers are very high either side of it. “There is more positivity now than there was maybe six weeks ago though. Society is opening up again, and the vaccinations are a positive thing.” Covid has taken its toll on rural le too, and compliance with regulations has come at a social cost for village communities. “Where were based is very much a rural area, with a lot of the farming community and tradesmen and stuff,” says Greg. “You get some people who, by chance, meet up outside the shop here and have an opportunity to have a chat that maybe havent seen each other in a few months. “Those guys would have been at markets or farm meets every week, or pubs, but now you see them sitting out there for half an hour chatting to each other. “The social aspect, face to face, is the biggest thing. “The local community group have done a lot of work with the walkways there over the past number of years, which is very good.” Caroline Lynch and Catriona Doughty from Learmount Community Development Group. The local community group to which Greg refers is Learmount Community Development Group, which is nestled down a lane next to the entrance to Learmount Forest. Over the last year, Caroline Lynch and Catriona Doughty have noticed a big increase in people using Parks hidden gem. “We would have come down here some mornings and that car park would be full,” says Caroline. “Our secret Learmount Forest isnt a secret any more, and thats great, because everybody wants out, and weve had drop-ins coming from that.” “The forest has been fantastic for people being able to get out and safely meet their neighbours,” adds Catriona. “Theyll maybe call in at quiet times to have a socially distanced cup of tea. That social aspect has been missed, they are missing company and casual conversation.” Caroline feels the experience of the last year has sharpened focus on the issue of loneliness that had been hiding in plain sight. “We had a man who lives alone and had been sick for two or three days,” she says. “He hadnt been out and had no food in the house, so thankfully we were able to help with that. “You just know people are lonely and looking to get out again, but at the same time are a bit anxious about it. “Theyre happy to take the summer out of it and see what happens. There is certainly a lot of loneliness, isolation and depression though. “You could obviously be in the middle of a housing site and still be lonely, but when you see some of the people on their own, up a lane, they see nobody. They barely even see the postman now.” Working with both young and old people, the group have seen the effect the pandemic and its associated lockdowns have had on both generations.  “A lot of our work is with older people, and whilst theyre saying theyre fed up, some of them are getting a wee bit set in their ways,” says Caroline. “You just know by talking to them. We had a woman who always came in every week, even when it was bad, and she hasnt been in about two months. “Its highlighted how much we miss the social side of things, not being able to get out and meet friends. Even for the youth. “People always think all they need is their phone, because thats all theyre sitting on, but you can see now how the youth are crying out as much for social contact as any other generation.” There is hope though, that with the vaccines roll out and the upcoming warmer weather, that the group will be able to run some of their usual summer events. “We are looking at putting together a summer programme, but wed be a bit nervous ourselves about bringing a group of people into the room,” says Caroline.  “It would be perfectthere was good weather, because it will be planned outdoors. If the weather is bad, well take it over to Park hall, because its a bit bigger than here. “We have funding for dancing and music, which I think people would love to hear. Wed love to have tables out there on a nice evening, with a bit of a barbecue and a bit of music. “Youd like to think by September, we should be able to get going.” On the way back through the village, the shutters are half up on the Rio Grande as preparations continue inside. By the time you read this it will have reopened its doors. Hospitality has ed throughout the county, another step on the road to recovery. The farmers outside Greg McElhinneys store now have somewhere  to shoot the breeze. For the next few weeks at least, Covid fears will be drowned out by clink of glasses, the audible relief of the repressed socialite and the laughter of friends reunited. Dancing, however, is still prohibited under the regulations. It may need to be done across Parks Rio Grande, rather than inside it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was impossible not to notice the atmosphere of optimism at the Lisnagelvin club recently as City of Derry re-opened after too long away, the cobwebs of covid shaken off by the camaraderie and revelry of those who have seen tough times before and come through it together. Unity has ed to the club after a few uncertain years, and as President Billy Jones greeted everyone, as Charlie McDaid walked around with his hands clasped behind his back ensuring everyone had what they needed, and as Treasurer Jim Ross sat and surveyed the club’swith satisfaction, one word sprang to mind – contentment. googletag.cmd.push Just being back at the club and back amongst friends was a huge step that the club has been waiting for, and with a brand-new competitive season approaching fast, the excitement was tangible. If anything, the cub has strengthened over the past year, with President Jones revealing that there have been over  new members joining City of Derry. “This marks the raising of the flag and I’m just delighted with the turnout,” he said. “The new members are playing with the well-established players and it’s great to have this confidence run through the club at the present time. We welcome anyone who is interested in the bowls to come up to City of Derry and you’ll be made most welcome. googletag.cmd.push “Last year, even Covid didn’t put the membership down it actually brought the membership up. More people were out and about. The garden centre is close by and I think people just put their head over the fence and seen that this was an activity that they could get into, so they came and joined us, and we were very fortunate that the numbers were so good.” There was also excited chatter about a few new star players who have joined the club… “We’re very lucky that people who have moved from other clubs have come joined us,” Billy explained. “The quality of player to come to us is very welcome and it’s very, very good for the future of City of Derry, and we have a good chance of playing for some cups in the IBA. The prospects we have would be very good this year and I’d be delightedwe could recognise some of the talent that’s in City of Derry.”      Freedom City of Derry is now in a position to play two teams in the upcoming league, and because of the signicant boost in numbers through new memberships, there is real hope of some silverware for a club that has always had the potential to go further. For former President and current Treasurer Ross, the club is about opportunity – for competition, for friendships, for peace of mind. “Last year we had no competitive bowls because of the lockdown, although we did play some friendly bowls amongst ourselves. It’s good to come up here and get a bit of freedom because it’s good for the mind,” he said. “This year we’re hoping the league will start at the end of May and the start of June. We have a club now with around  members, and we will likely have two teams in the league, an ‘A’ team and a ‘B’ team. Things are looking good,the virus continues the way it’s going. Most people here would be the older generation, although we have some new stars coming through here and we’re hoping to have a good season. “It does help with getting out and meeting with your friends and colleagues but we’re looking forward to competitive bowls again. That’s what it’s all about. It’s a great hobby. Fingers crossed it starts on schedule. This is our official opening day and we’ve had such a great turnout. The weather hasn’t been that good to us, but the turnout has been great.” Bowling has always been on the periphery of sport in Derry, a real niche market compared to the more glamourous sports that attract a large percentage of the youngsters in the city. Bowling is very much a generational game though and the potential to expand and grow is there more than ever for City of Derry. “Clubs like Ballymoney, Coleraine and Limavady have what they call an academy and they have young fellas coming from schools straight into the teams, but we don’t have that facility,” Jim continues. “We don’t have that facility here, but we would love to have it. It’s hard for us to attract the young people because most of us are the older generation, but we have one or two star players who are younger, andpeople see that we’re progressing we might draw more young people. In years gone by you could have played bowls in Derry seven days a week, especially indoor. We all enjoy the outdoors, and everyone is excited to get it open again and get it done. They are all waiting to see the teams picked so they can get into competitive bowls again.”  Mixed bowls for the first time For the first time in the club’s history, this year will see women integrated into the league, a recent law change permitting mixed teams, opening up yet another door for those who love the game. For Jim, this move only strengthens the club even further. “Women can now join our club and take part which wasn’t the case before,” he revealed. “We had a separate ladies’ team here but they were struggling for numbers. The governing bodies changed the rules and said that women can play with men now and take part in the leagues as equals That strengthens us, especiallyyou have a good lady bowler. We’re quite happy to have them. “Doors are opening that haven’t before, and of course we are all cross-community- it doesn’t matter what colour or what creed you are, we’re just happy to have you. If you can walk and throw a bowl then we want you. “We have some great new signings. We were never top of the league but we were always sort of in the middle of the league but I think this year we could have a very good year, and maybe even get a bit of silverware.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

As well as being part of a major community development in Creggan which will bring the club’s facilities into the st century, the club have recently unveiled an U girls team, while their senior team heads into the Neal Carlin Cup final against Glack this weekend. Ciaran Wilkinson, part of the Dolan’s team which won the treble back in , is in as manager for the first time, and, following victories over Limavady Reserves, Drum and Faughanvale Reserves, they are just one game away from silverware. googletag.cmd.push It would be a nice way to begin a managerial career that ‘Wilkie’ never, ever saw coming. “I never thought about it but when your body doesn’t let you play anymore, it’s a close second,” he said. “I was just asked would I like to do it and I jumped at it, and got my team around me and that was it. “I’m enjoying the challenge to be honest. It’s nothing compared to playing, but I’m enjoying it. It’s still very early and things are going well, but it always is when you are getting results. It’s only pre-season, it’s not the league or the Championship, but it’s going alright.” googletag.cmd.push Ciaran has his own ideas of how he wants to manage, insisting he wants to change the mindsets of the players to help them realise their potential. “I want boys to believe in their own ability and back themselves,” he explained. That was me as a player no matter who you are up against in that ision, you have to back yourself, so it’s just a matter of getting the players to believe that they are good enough and against anyone in that ision, they’ll give them a game not to fear anybody andyou approach every game like that you have a good a chance as they do.”     Glack are tomorrow night’s opponents, reaching Celtic Park by defeating Craigbane Reserves, Magilligan and Steelstown Reserves. Whilst the silverware would be nice, there is something more important for the new Dolans manager. “I just want them to enjoy it more than anything,” he admitted. “You don’t get to finals every whiparound. I never enjoyed it much as a player, soanything, I’m hoping to get the players to enjoy it win, lose or draw. That’s why we’re playing the game at the end of the day it’s not always about winning. Of course, it would be nice to win, and it’s better when you’re winning, but I’m just drilling it into them to enjoy it. I didn’t win anything until I was almost finished, and I wish I had enjoyed it more, soI can get them to enjoy it, without us focusing on the win, I’ll be happy enough with that to be honest.”  Notable addition A notable addition to the Dolans coaching staff this year is that of Ciara McGurk, someone who knows all about winning due to her success in recent years for both club and county. Still a player with Steelstown, Ciara has now stepped into the coaching side of the game, and such is her reputation in the game, that Wilkinson sees it as a huge benefit to have her as part of the team. The addition of a female coach at senior level adds something dferent he believes. “Ciara is there on merit,” he said. “I have watched her up close and from afar and she’s a great coach. She’s passionate and she brings a set of skills to the table. There’s not many people around the town has that experience or those medals. It’s great. I didn’t even have to think about it when I was asked. It was just about thinking outside the box, and she’s capable, and the fact that she’s a girl didn’t even come into it. It’s what she brings to it and she’s there on merit.” Geoffrey McGonigle, manager of the  treble-winning team, has also agreed toto the coaching set-up at Dolans, meaning there is no shortage of winning experience at the club this year.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Candystripes are the only team in the Premier Division without a home win so far, but since the arrival of new manager Ruaidhri Higgins, they have been superb on the road, winning at Sligo Rovers, Bohemians and Waterford and drawing with champions Shamrock Rovers. That elusive home win was just minutes away against St. Patrick’s Athletic on Monday evening, only for a late equaliser to deny the hosts the three points. It was not from lack of effort however against one of the Premier Division’s most improved teams. googletag.cmd.push “We had to dig in,” midfielder Ciaron Harkin said. “It was a scrap all over the pitch and it was hard at times to get the ball down and get it moving as both teams got in each other’s faces trying to cancel each other out. I thought we dug in well and we had the chance to win it, but we conceded a goal at the end. “We don’t really look at that home record. Be it home games or away games, you get the same points. It’s about working on our performances and trying to get as many points on the board and as many wins as possible. It wasn’t our day , we thought it was when Joe put us into the lead, but we’ll just have to keep digging in and go to Friday and push even harder for another win.” googletag.cmd.push Those three away wins have made City one of the most consistent teams in the ision away from home. Bohemians’ - win over Dundalk on Monday night shows just how dficult away games can be, making that recent away record all the more impressive according to Harkin. “The away form has been good so hopefully we can keep the confidence and the consistency up,” he continued. “Obviously it is tough playing away from home but everyone is working hard together so hopefully we can get the three points. “It’s about consistency. You see Dundalk go and get a good win against Rovers, the league leaders. But then they get beaten by Bohs this week, so anything can happen and it’s about making sure you’re on the right end of it and you can push up that table, which is the main thing.”     Midfielder Marc Walsh is the only injury doubt for Higgins as City chase the win which could see them leapfrog Dundalk into seventh.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Candystripes are the only team in the Premier Division without a home win so far, but since the arrival of new manager Ruaidhri Higgins, they have been superb on the road, winning at Sligo Rovers, Bohemians and Waterford and drawing with champions Shamrock Rovers. That elusive home win was just minutes away against St. Patrick’s Athletic on Monday evening, only for a late equaliser to deny the hosts the three points. It was not from lack of effort however against one of the Premier Division’s most improved teams. googletag.cmd.push “We had to dig in,” midfielder Ciaron Harkin said. “It was a scrap all over the pitch and it was hard at times to get the ball down and get it moving as both teams got in each other’s faces trying to cancel each other out. I thought we dug in well and we had the chance to win it, but we conceded a goal at the end. “We don’t really look at that home record. Be it home games or away games, you get the same points. It’s about working on our performances and trying to get as many points on the board and as many wins as possible. It wasn’t our day , we thought it was when Joe put us into the lead, but we’ll just have to keep digging in and go to Friday and push even harder for another win.” googletag.cmd.push Those three away wins have made City one of the most consistent teams in the ision away from home. Bohemians’ - win over Dundalk on Monday night shows just how dficult away games can be, making that recent away record all the more impressive according to Harkin. “The away form has been good so hopefully we can keep the confidence and the consistency up,” he continued. “Obviously it is tough playing away from home but everyone is working hard together so hopefully we can get the three points. “It’s about consistency. You see Dundalk go and get a good win against Rovers, the league leaders. But then they get beaten by Bohs this week, so anything can happen and it’s about making sure you’re on the right end of it and you can push up that table, which is the main thing.”     Midfielder Marc Walsh is the only injury doubt for Higgins as City chase the win which could see them leapfrog Dundalk into seventh.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

His -year playing career ended on the Evergreens in the early s.Joersquos role as match secretary for twenty years was absolutely crucial given his unique ability to dig out players when all seemed lost, recruiting players at Down High on Saturday mornings to fulfil fixtures later that day.Complete strangers would often turn up for second  matches in the early days saying that Joe had instructed them to turn up and play.Despite his tireless work on behalf of the club, Joersquos greatest pleasure throughout his rugby le has been the friends he has made along the way.A keen tourist, he has travelled the world to follow rugby and even took in some of the Lions fixtures in South Africa in .He was tour manager on the legendary  Ballynahinch tour of Canada, as well as partaking in a few trips away with the Evergreens.When promotion to the All-Ireland League was secured in , Joe was a regular spectator at games all over the country and could be seen at every first XV home fixture in his familiar spot on the m line until very recently.The flat cap, long navy Adidas coat, familiar cough and half pint of Harp should conjure up an image of Joe to everyone who knows him, and to countless others who have passed through the Ballynahinch club in recent years not knowing the huge influence he has had on their rugby.Joe is the recipient of the coveted Spence Cup this season. He is truly deserving of this award and it is le-affirming to see that friendships gained through team sports run deep as Sam Robinson, himself a Spence Cup winner, acts as carer for Joe as his health deteriorates.Rugby it seems, is giving something back to one of itrsquos finest local servants.On behalf of the Spence family, Emma Rice commened: ldquoThe Spence Cup is given to a member who shows an example of commitment to the rugby club. Joe Carlislersquos service to the club in time and deed epitomises this.ldquoA society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they will never sit in. We are often guilty of not noticing a tree that gives the shade we sit under, she continued.ldquoPlayers of today may no longer see as much of that familiar face on the m line at Ballymacarn Park, but they will see the roots, the structure, the shade and benefit from what wee Joe once planted.

Itrsquos been very challenging for carers and their loved ones, and people often forget that carersrsquo lives are adversely affected too.ldquoImagine having a spouse or parent who no longer recognises you and who due to this awful disease you no longer recognise.One of the things that resonates with both women is the thought of any loved one losing all our precious memories.Ciara continued: ldquoResearch into the causes of, and treatment for dementia is critically important but not a priority for UK governments.ldquoWe would love to see this dreadful disease eradicated for future generations. We both have strong ties to Northern Ireland, being from here, although we both spent time living and working in England and Scotland before moving home to settle back in Co Down. Our mutual love of baking and cooking was how we met and became friends.The two bakers organised a virtual bake sale to raise money for dementia research.However they soon realised that due to geography not everyone could buy their fabulous baking, so they set up a JustGiving page to run alongside the bake sale.ldquoPlanning the challenges of a bake sale during lockdown was fun, so too was choosing some of our most popular products to sell to raise money, said Sharon.ldquoThe menu proved so popular.

The former dismissed both Carson and Linehan in the same over to swing the match back in favour for Dundrum.This started a Downpatrick collapse with the last eight wickets falling for only  runs.

But also to strengthen school community and pride in our fantastic school.Mr Austin paid tribute to the schools PTFA for its fundraising, to the board of governors for support and a group of volunteers who worked on the welcome garden.ldquoThe team spirit that has been displayed throughout this project has been uplting and a reflection of the strong school community that exists within St Colmcilles Primary School, he said.ldquoThe board of governors have supported this project throughout and are committed to a cycle of continuous improvement of all aspects of the school, especially its facilities and resourcesHe continued: ldquoThe PTFA have fundraised relentlessly through organising ious raffles, draws, bingos and hampers.

He had been a vital cog in the Down Rec team which enjoyed great success in the late Seventies.But it was and remains the case that the Down Rec experience is defined by the enduring friendships which have stood the test of time.Coot grew up in Stream Street and the reason he knocked back opportunities to perform at levels his talent merited may well lie there.That part of Downpatrick had three working class housing developments, Ardpatrick and Russell Park with Stream Street and Ibrox Park in the middle.Ibrox was their playground, the place where Coot first kicked a football.He was a Stream Street kid and it seems he never wanted to be anything .When Jim Prior took him to Down Rec, it was a marriage made in heaven.In that dressing room you had another more senior Stream Street kid. Coot would have idolized Tony lsquoDartrsquo Curran in those days as he was the leader of the pack.Russell Park resident Barney Fitzsimmons was there too, a swashbuckling goalscorer who enjoyed something akin to Roy of the Rovers status at the time.Then you had the late great Paddy lsquoGeordyrsquo Galbraith, who combined a hard man reputation with a heart of gold.Peter Mulhall was another player he would have admired, a winner who proved the perfect centre back partner for the laid-back Coot.The total respect he had for them was accorded to all of us even though he was a better player than any of us. That was Coot Connolly.Prior realized that he needed to recruit from outside Downpatrick to fulfill his ambitions for the club and over a period of time he recruited players from Portaferry, Strangford, Ardglass, Dundrum, Crossgar, Saintfield, Killyleagh and Ballygowan.They were brought in for their ability but Jim couldnrsquot have known that the erse personalities therein would create the perfect storm in the dressing room.Neither could he have anticipated the level of support which flowed from those villages in the seasons to come.Dressing rooms are bastions of banter and slagging and with Dart jester-in chief, the group relished every minute they spent together.The five strong Portaferry contingent proved to be a vital ingredient, their earthy Ards humour and the opportunities their accents provided for slagging sealing their popularity.Jackie Leckey and Barney Ross brought another dimension willing as they were to join in the shenanigans on and off the pitch. Coot loved the craic and happily joined in the banter.However, he left the slagging to other less sensitive creatures of which there were plenty.A good example was the time I decided to get the footballers perm which was in vogue at the time. I should have known better.I got slaughtered, Dart declaring that I looked more like Shirley Temple than Kevin Keegan.Those were the days, as the saying goes, but happily there were plenty of good days ahead of us.We have had many reunions with Coot, an ever present and every one of them underlined the strength of the bond we enjoy so much.Sadly those reunions tend to be confined to wakes and funerals nowadays and the baby of our team has now joined Shane Breen, Paddy Galbraith and Marty Ross on the sidelines.Coot would have been the first to remind me that the Rec wasnrsquot only about the players.The one and only Charlie Oakes was highly influential in his role as assistant manager, while Austy Keating doubled as chairman and groundsman for many years.Joe Lyttle was our physio and his son Joea loyal player for years while my sister Tina was a committee member and a fanatical fan.They were all fully paid up members of the Rec family and we continue to mourn their loss.I would love to have name checked every single member of the Rec family in this piece but time and space didnrsquot allow. My apologies.The laughter which rang through Cootrsquos house during his wake was a fitting farewell for someone who loved to laugh.He was a very special human being. We will miss him forever.

Access should only be restrictedany confidential information is discussed. If any person considers that access to meetings is being restricted unnecessarily, their first step should be to approach the council with these concerns.But access remained denied, so the Minister was asked to amend legislation around this sticking point.A spokesperson replied: ldquoGiven legislation currently allows public press access to committees and subcommittees subject to the exclusions previously advised, the Department is not at this time considering making amendments.This was shared with councillors, with all who replied commenting positively around press attendance.Councillor Barry McElduff, Sinn Fein formally called for press to be permitted access to Health Group meetings and Chief Executive Alison McCullagh suggested this could be achieved by upgrading to subcommittee status.Following unanimous agreement in December, BBC Local Democracy enquired when this could be expected, and were advised it was part of an ongoing review.The matter arose last week, and what started out as a victory for democracy, quickly dwindled when members learned upgrading meant quota rules of membership would apply.Councillor Emmet McAleer, Independent suggested retaining working group status, but opening meetings to public and press, but the Chair Councillor Stephen McCann replied: ldquoThat conversation has been had a number of times and we are aware why that cannot happen. However it was given extra clout as a subcommittee, I understand the press would have access. That would address some concerns members have raised in the past.The Chief Executive stressed: ldquoThe only dference is Standing Orders apply in subcommittees, therefore press and public would have normal access.Current Health Group member Councillor Donal OrsquoCofaigh, Independent, acknowledged subcommittee status would cost him his place under the quota, but nonetheless was willing to agreeit meant public and press access.SDLP Councillor Mary Garrity said: ldquoIf itrsquos not legislatively enforceable, we come upon this quandary, whether we like it or not.However she felt working group status meant reporting back to full council and: ldquoAbsent the press, we would still get all our concerns highlighted.The Chief Executive confirmed: ldquoActions would be reported, irrespective of working group or subcommittee status.Councillor Josephine Deehan, Independent found it: ldquoRegrettable we didnrsquot have information regarding legislative requirements prior to making this decision. Irsquom concerned that members of small parties and independents would be excluded. I strongly believe in inclusion and as elected members we have a duty to represent our constituents.She added: ldquoTherersquos not a huge amount of dference between a subcommittee and a working group. In terms of involving the press and public, we would have the opportunity to raise issues at standing committees.Proposing retention of the current working group status to ensure inclusivity and current membership, Councillor Deehan said: ldquoThe only dference is access to the public and press hellipRepresentation and input from members is more important and should be the greater priority.This was seconded by Councillor Garrity.Councillor McElduff requested clarity around press access noting: ldquoObviously where possible, when we arenrsquot talking about issues which are confidential, wersquod want to err on the side of openness and transparency.The Chief Executive pointed to legislation in which: ldquoThere is no provision for press or public to attend working group meetings.Councillor Adam Gannon, SDLP noted the Health Group was: ldquoLooked at to change into a subcommittee because some members wanted it opened to the press. Whilst it would be nice to have public access to everything, it may not always happen and canrsquot always be that way.Concluding the discussion, he said whatever the status of the group: ldquoThe work is still being done. It would be nice for the public to be present, but we donrsquot need the press there to do our work. I know I donrsquot.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Alban seems to think that it’s all right to weaken Israel’s defence capability relative to neighbouring Muslim states. Because I found Mr Maginness’ article to be objectionable, in the antipathic attitude it expresses towards Israel, I wrote to the editor of the Belfastand which letter may bear repeating. My letter reads: “Alban Maginness gives a rather one-sidedview of the ongoing conflict in the Holy Land. The Belfast , May . “Alban views the conflict from a narrow Northern Ireland perspective: he appears to be blind to the geographic and political realities of the Middle East and Israel’s precarious security situation there. “In the ongoing conflict, it is Israel that is the beleaguered state and Israel is, and has always been, facing an existential threat from the neighbouring States. By comparison with these states, Israel is a tiny Jewish state with little by way of natural geographical defences for its protection against the much larger surrounding Muslim states and hostile forceswith their huge land mass, oil and other resources and populations amounting to hundreds of millions. “To look at the Holy Land conflict exclusively as a Jewish Palestinian problem without reference to this much bigger political, geographical and military landscape, seems to be poor,not threadbare, analysis.”Micheal O’Cathail, By email• Jackie Goodall: Ireland shows itself to be Europe’s most anti-Israel nation——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It is hard to see how a three-way split can be sustained, yet there is a case for two main unionist blocs — a moderate one and a conservative one.There is an increasing view that a single unionist party would just drive more voters to the neutral political centre.The biggest issue by far facing unionism is the NI Protocol Boris Johnson betrayal. Senior DUP politicians have seemed far too willing to accept tough talk from Tories such as Lord Frost. Yet London keeps reiterating its commitment to the protocol, about which Brussels is so uncompromising. The UK says the Act of Union has been partially repealed and we must assume that is the situation . It is an outrage, yet Edwin Poots has to date been pragmatic about this Irish Sea border. Doug Beattie yesterday seemed to say on radio that the protocol was less important than the NHS, but the comparison is misleading because it is an utterly dferent policy area. It is possible both to think that health is the single most important non constitutional matter, but that the constitutional question is the single most important political issue.That is what republicans think, yet they do not allow themselves to be talked into saying the NHS is more important.A united unionist rejection of the repeal of the Act of Union can, and should, exist alongside a wide range of views among unionists on non constitutional matters.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The votes that are going to be shed by the DUP is not in their hundreds, it’s in their thousands. It’s in their tens of thousands,” he said.“We cannot go round the doors, the people in Fermanagh and South Tyrone will vote for anyone but the DUP. That is because, not of an election, that is because of what took place before the election.”Mr Poots later addressed the media alongside the newly ratied deputy leader Paula Bradley, with supporters gathered behind him.He described the meeting as “good” and said it is a “great privilege” to now lead the party that his father had helped form  years ago.Mr Poots said there had been a debate and a contest, and that the contest “had been decided”.“We will move forward in a united way,” he said.“The DUP is not a ided party, the DUP has went through an electoral contest, the first in  years, and everybody that goes through an electoral contest will have some passion, and passion is good in politics.“I like to see people having passion, sometimes even when they are people contesting with me. I like to see people who are passionate in their arguments.”Mr Poots added that he hoped to be able to speak to Mr Bell “in the near future”.“Sometimes people don’t like the outcome and they do things in the heat of the moment, I have a lot of respect for the gentleman,” he said.Mr Poots narrowly defeated Sir Jeffrey Donaldson earlier this month in the party’s first leadership contest.In a speech following his ratication, he vowed to revive unionism and scrap the Northern Ireland Protocol.“We will consistently roll back the objectional provisions of the Protocol, as we have been doing,” he said.“That involves arguing our case forcefully and with conviction. It involves making Brussels and Dublin aware that the Protocol is intolerable and unworkable.“Legal challenges are one correct tactic, but the guaranteed way of reading our sales of the isive Protocol is through the Assembly.”He added: “We will employ political tactics to continue the pressure, and let Dublin see that isn’t some hiccup, but rather something that has the worrying capacity to destabilise relationships that they have gained most from.”Mr Poots said his challenge was to encourage supporters of unionism to get out and vote.He also called for a “united unionist coalition” ahead of the next Assembly elections.Mr Poots said the only way of preventing a border poll and getting rid of the Protocol was by securing a Unionist majority at the next election.In his speech, Mr Poots paid tribute to Ms Foster’s leadership of the party.He said: “Arlene is and will be regarded as one of the most foremost women and unionists in British politics.“Irrespective of our dferences in any issues that have brought us here this evening, she is admired by us all.”Mrs Foster announced her resignation as First Minister and DUP leader last month following an internal revolt against her leadership.She said she would step down as DUP leader on Friday and as First Minister at the end of June.Earlier this week, Mrs Foster said she still had not seen the reported letter of no confidence in her leadership.DUP MP Ian Paisley said he understands the party chairman Lord Morrow has read the letter to her and told her the names who signed it.“The process that the party has always adopted is that those letters are not shared with other people who have gone,” he said.“My father never ever saw the requisition order that was signed against him. He accepted it because he accepted the good grace and standing of our party chairman.”Mr Poots has signalled that he will become the first DUP leader not to take the First Minister position at Stormont, and will instead nominate a colleague in order to focus on the job of leading the party.MLAs Mervyn Storey and Paul Givan are reportedly being considered for the post.  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularLIVE UPDATES: DUP in crisis - Edwin Poots says Jeffrey Donaldson should report allegations of UDA intimidation influencing DUP leadership contest to PSNIDUP member dramatically resigns from party after Edwin Poots ratied as leaderEx-DUP MLA: Arlene Foster has undermined the Union and NI is in a dangerous place – but a united Ireland could workEdwin Poots is ratied as DUP leader as key figures leave meeting before speechArlene Foster awarded six figure sum in damages from TV presenter Dr. Christian JessenMost PopularAllister turns question on speeding into Bobby Storey funeral barbI hope this sentence brings you comfort, judge tells family, as she jails drink driver who killed friend in head-on smashIreland shows itself to be Europe’s most anti-Israel nationIt is now time for those murdered by the IRA also to get full legacy inquests Huge fireball spotted in NI night sky was like something from the film Armageddon                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kafWEX sc-feJyhm dbjzDR\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedFashion and BeautyDealsHome and GardenPublic NoticesFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

There are also around  to  cases of the India iant in parts of Scotland, including Glasgow, with these cases again connected to travel.The India Covid iant, officially known as B.., was first detected in India in October.It has been designated a ldquoiant of concern by PHE as it is thought to be at least as transmissible as the iant detected in Kent last year, known as B, which is now dominant in the UK.PHE said there is currently no evidence to suggest that the new Indian iant is more serious than previous mutations, nor is there evidence which indicates that this version of the Indian iant is resistant to current vaccines.Health experts said they ldquohavenrsquot seen any hint of a current Covid iant that can fully evade the effectiveness of vaccines.On Wednesday , the European Medicines Agency said it was ldquopretty confident that vaccines currently in use will be effective against the Indian iant, a view that has been echoed by some British scientists.However, Professor James Naismith from the University of Oxford said not enough is known to say for sure whether the iant could frustrate the UKrsquos vaccination programme.Speaking on BBC Radio rsquos Today programme, he said: ldquoThe vaccines donrsquot  per cent prevent infection for people.ldquoWhat they do is, they almost  per cent prevent hospitalisation and serious illness.ldquoWe donrsquot know enough to know yet whether the Indian strain will behave dferently than that.ldquoSo even the regular virus can infect people who have been vaccinated and sometimes you do get reinfection.Could the iant delay lockdown ending The growing number of India Covid iant cases in the UK has sparked concerns that the lting of lockdown restrictions, which is set for  June in England, could now be delayed.Ministers have also not ruled out re-introducing local lockdowns in areas where the iant of concern is increasing.Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said that the government will make decisions based on the data, and measures will be eased ldquoat a pace and in a way which is safe.Symptoms to look forThe main symptoms of coronavirus to look for include:a high temperature ndash this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back a new, continuous cough ndash this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing episodes in  hours a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste ndash this means youve noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste dferent to normalMost people with symptoms have at least one of these symptoms, although some do not experience any. As such, it is advised that everyone gets tested regularly to help prevent further spread of the virus. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments are closed on this article. -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt was girl power when ten female walkers joined Joy and sheepdog Bracken from Penarth and District Ramblers at Penarth clftop for an . mile walk, with no stiles only gates and which would see them experiencing the weather of all four seasons in one day. They set off on a socially distanced walk in lovely spring sunshine across the old pitch and putt course before joining part of the old railway line, now a walk and cycle way, and heading through a built up area Lavernock Road led them into Cosmeston Country Park.Past the eastern lake with its floating jetty where canoes can be safely launched and making their way through the eastern paddock with its carpet of pretty cowslips, open meadows led them towards Old Cogan Hall Farm, where they deviated into the churchyard of St Peterrsquos for morning break in glorious warm sunshine reminiscent of summer. Admiring the herring bone masonry which dates to Celtic and Saxon times and the ancient yew trees that could even pre-date this lovely old church, which allegedly is the oldest building in Penarth and hearing some of its long and interesting history, it fell into disrepair in the th century. By the th century the ruinous building was a cattle shelter until the latter part of the rsquos when the rd Marquis of Bute was persuaded to pay for its renovation.Mile Road built by the Bute family led them to the western paddock and through the sun-dappled Cogan Wood to re-enter fields where a footbridge led them across the Sully Brook for the short climb up to Home Farm, with its glorious views towards the eastern end of Barry and the surrounding farmland. Exiting through a gate, some road walking in a southerly direction brought them into Sully village and pounding pavements to reach the Jubilee Hall and the cricket field, the full beauty of Sully Bay with its views across the Bristol Channel towards the Somerset coastline and Hayes Point to the west confronted them.     With the wind beginning to pick up they tramped by track and field to the public slipway at Sully beach and stopped for lunch utilising rocks for seating whilst gazing eastwards towards Sully Island and Flat and Steep Holm beyond, as clouds thickened overhead and the temperature dropped making it feel more like autumn.Time to move on along part of the long distance Wales Coast Path, through the playing fields to exit onto Beach Road, following it to the car park of the Captainrsquos We where there were only a few people sitting at outdoor tables for food and drink, not really enjoyable in the cool breeze.The fairly quiet St Maryrsquos Well Bay Road brought them up past The Bay Caravan Park and into fields with growing crops where, without any warning a sudden short sharp shower of rain engulfed the group forcing coats to be swtly donned.Crossing a wooden footbridge into the delightful Lavernock Nature Reserve the grassy path led them into the remains of the WW gun emplacements. Initially in the late rsquos the original Lavernock Gun Battery was built to protect the Bristol and Cardf shipyards and the Bristol Channel, but unfortunately most of the original buildings now lie underneath the caravan park.Being bombarded by a short hail storm whilst moving on through the nature reserve, lovingly cared for by volunteers and passing the man-made pond with its surrounding carpet of bluish violet bugle, a plant which attracts moths, butterflies and bees, before exiting onto Fort Road their route led them past the Marconi Holiday Village and the Church of St Lawrence before heading along the clftop. With thick black clouds heading up the English side of the Bristol Channel, the race was on to get back before the rain hit. As the weather turned wintry and the wind increased, a huge shower of hailstones and heavy rain struck them on the open Penarth clftop soaking them as they made their way back to their start point.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits before, during and after lockdown on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He raised concerns that the hundreds of new houses in and around Llantwit Major arenrsquot seeing the increased investment in local public services needed to cater for the growing population.He said: ldquoThere are more and more houses in the town. Therersquos hardly any green space left and our services are really struggling.Two doctors surgeries currently cater for the town: Coastal Vale and Western Vale. Cllr John claimed Coastal Vale is ldquoat capacity and the Western Vale building is ldquoover  years old.He said: ldquoThe actual building needs replacing, itrsquos not in a great condition. It needs replacing and modernising.Cardf and Vale UHB is drawing up plans for major changes on how clinical services are delivered.

These wellbeing hubs will include GP services, midwery, and primary mental health care.     The idea is to move clinical services away from large hospitals like the University Hospital of Wales, at the Heath in Cardf, avoiding the need for people to travel long distances for care.Cllr John supports this move but says residents in the western part of the Vale of Glamorgan are currently undeserved with health services mdash and with the hundreds of new houses being built in the area, Llantwit would be ideal for a new health centre.He is hoping to get many more signatures for his petition to build the new health centre in Llantwit Major, with a table set up on the precinct in the town on Saturday, for residents who arenrsquot on the internet or havenrsquot seen the campaign online yet.He said: ldquoItrsquos all very well building homes, thatrsquos fine. But we have to have the infrastructure.The health board said any investment in new health and wellbeing centres or wellbeing hubs is some time away.A Cardf and Vale UHB spokesperson said: ldquoThe intention is for a wellbeing hub to be placed in the western Vale, but this may be some years away as part of our overall plan. In terms of where the site will be based, this will be subject to an engagement process.ldquoThere will be a health and wellbeing centre in the Vale work will be commencing in terms of engagement in relation to this within the next few months.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoAny need for a new medical centre would be a matter for the Cardf and Vale University Health Board.ldquoNo planning application for such a building has been submitted and currently the land in question has been allocated as a signicant strategic development site for the councilrsquos house building programme.

Data for England published on Friday by the Office for National Statisticsshows an estimated one in , people in private households had Covid- in the week to May  ndash broadly unchanged from one in , in the previous week. The estimate for Scotland is around one in , up from one in ,, putting Scotland back to where it was around a month ago.Meanwhile, the reproduction number ndash the R value ndash for England is  to ., up from . and . the previous week.The growth rate, which estimates how quickly the number of infections is changing day-by-day, is between % and %, meaning the number of new infections could be broadly flat or growing by up to % every day.The latest seven-day average for daily hospital admissions in England is  , which is an increase of % on seven days earlier.The figure means hospital admissions are back to where they were at the start of May and remain % below the second-wave peak in January. vw,vw,px, px\"Public Health Englanddata shows that the majority of people with the Indian iant have not been vaccinated, with just % of casesfrom February  to May  having received both doses.Of  people who ended up in AE, just five people had had both vaccine doses, while  were unvaccinated and  had had their first dose more than three weeks previously.Of  patients who needed to be admitted to hospital overnight, only one person had had both vaccines, the PHE data showed.Over the period there were  deaths linked to the iant, of which eight were among the unvaccinated.Dr Helen Wall, senior responsible officer for the Covid vaccine programme in Bolton, which is one of the hotspots for the iant, said there are ldquosignicant numbers of - and -year-olds going into hospital there, and tens of thousands of people in the area who have only just become eligible for the vaccine. vw,vw,px, px\"Bolton is one of the areas of the UK where the Covid iant first identied in India is spreading fastest But she told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme that hospitals were seeing patients who were far less sick than previous Covid patients.ldquoIn terms of how ill theyrsquore getting, I think the vaccine definitely seems to be working, she said.ldquoWe are not seeing, certainly not many people as sick as we would have done pre-vaccine, certainly the picture in hospital is much better to previous times when wersquove been at this position.Dr Mike Tildesley, from the University of Warwick and a member of the Scientic Pandemic Influenza Group on Modellinggroup, told BBC Breakfast that cases will go up but the vaccines are proving to help.He said: ldquoWe would expect, with these restrictions being lted, at some point the R number would go above , and it looks like thatrsquos probably whatrsquos happening now, given that wersquore starting to see cases going up.ldquoBut the important thing for us is, given we now have the vaccines, we are in a very dferent place from, say, in October hellip Because hopefully the vaccines can help us along the way, andwe sort of kick the can down the road a little bit, we can allow the vaccines to help us and hopefully allow us ultimately to lt restrictions. vw,vw,px, px\"He said experts needed to ldquogather as much evidence as we can over the next week or two then ldquotry to predict what we expect may happen should this June  relaxation go ahead.Professor Andrew Hayward, from University College London and a member of New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group , said cases of the Indian iant were doubling every week and ldquoit only takes five or six doublings for that to get up to say a quarter million cases.He saidfurther easing was brought in ldquoinstead of doubling every week itrsquos likely to double more frequently than that of course, so I think there is a good argument for caution until such time as wersquove got a much higher proportion of the population double vaccinated.Fellow Nervtag member, Robert Dingwall, from Nottingham Trent University, told Times Radio it was ldquohard to see any reason why June  could not go ahead, adding that those who currently catching Covid tended to be younger and would get less sick.Asked whether hospital admissions could get out of hand, leading to local lockdowns, he said: ldquoI think wersquove got to look quite carefully at what hospitalisation means.ldquoThe anecdotes that the clinicians are coming up with is to say these are not really, really sick people like they were seeing in January, so more people who just need a little bit of extra help with breathing, they come in, they get oxygen and dexamethasone for maybe three or four days, and then they go home again.ldquoAnd in that sense I think hospitalisations may not be a very good indicator of the severity of these infections.He said there was a need to ldquobreak this link in our minds between lsquothis is very transmissible, this spreads very easilyrsquo.. and lsquothis is as dangerous as things were when the Wuhan virus first hit last spring.\" data-title\"HEALTH Coronavirus\" data--holder\"PA Graphics\" data--notice\"PA Graphics Press Association Images\" data-credit\"PA Graphics\" data-usage-terms\"\" srcset\"https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production aaaeaeddbdYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjIyMjkzOTk ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production aaaeaeddbdYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjIyMjkzOTk ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production aaaeaeddbdYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjIyMjkzOTk ..jpg w w\" sizes\" vw,vw,px, px\"Independent Sagemember Prof Pagel called for the road map for England to be delayed.She told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme: ldquoI think whatrsquos demoralising is having a third wave.ldquoIf we can just delay international travel, delay Stage  of the road map until we have a much higher proportion of people vaccinated with two doses, wersquore in a much, much better position.ldquoWersquore only two months away from that, itrsquos not long to wait.
