It will take you, I’d guess, about an hour to read and for every one of those 60 minutes you’ll be somewhere else entirely: the galleries of the Louvre, a Spanish beach, the streets of Mexico City. Even better, you’ll be in the company of three smart and sexy female criminals who take the men on at their own game and win.When The Grande Odalisque begins, Carole and Alex, best friends for many years, are in the middle of casually stealing a Manet from the Musée d’Orsay in Paris and it’s all going pretty well until Alex’s mobile phone bleeps (she’s waiting outside, in the getaway car, while Carole cuts the canvas from its frame). Uh oh. It’s so unhelpful when boyfriend trouble arrives to distract you just as your accomplice is about to be attacked by an alsatian. “Sorry, I got another call,” she says, sounding not very apologetic at all, as Carole, having ninja-kicked the dog and its handler to the ground, finally appears with the booty.But no matter: there’s no catching them. Moments later, they’re splashing around in a hot tub with their Mr Big, an armless gangster called Durieux. He has a client who would very much like to own Ingres’s oil of 1814 La Grande Odalisque. Having cracked the Orsay, would they now be able to penetrate the Louvre? Hmm. This, thinks Carole, is an altogether tricky proposition, one for which they will need reinforcement – and so it is that they come to recruit Sam, motorcyclist extraordinaire (there’s almost nothing this girl cannot do on two wheels). Before Paris, however, there is Mexico, where our glossy-haired triumvirate must rescue the hunky guy who supplies them with their weapons from the drug cartel that has kidnapped him.Naturally, I like the way this book flips things around, the women getting up to all the stuff, and with such relish, that’s ordinarily the province only of men. But such reversals have been done before. Its real originality lies, I think, in the undercurrents that flow between these young women, a complex dynamic that ultimately binds them together. Their backstory, which I won’t spoil here, lends the narrative an unlikely tenderness, one that will keep you reading even when the action is at its most preposterous (think hang-gliders and tranquilliser darts), though I must also admit to experiencing a certain horrible delight whenever our heroines blow the head off some lecherous villain. (Even at my age, there’s excitement in being given licence to enjoy this kind of thrill.) Will our daring trio be back for more? A note at the end of The Grande Odalisque announces that, yes, they are to return, in a book to be called Olympia (the name of another famous painting). Welcome, then, to a new franchise.

For one, the scope for a short squeeze in silver is far less obvious: money managers have had a net-long position on the metal since mid-2019, futures and options data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.The market for silver is also by some measures much deeper than those for smaller stocks like GameStop. The bricks-and-mortar video game retailer had a market capitalization of about $1.4 billion in mid-January, before the Reddit frenzy sent the company’s value soaring more than 16-fold. By contrast, the value of silver sitting in vaults in London is alone worth about $48 billion.Wall Street is on track to open higher today, after sharp falls last week.Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser for Allianz, says there is talk that the rush into silver could take some pressure off the hedge funds who have shorted GameStop and AMC Entertainment (although only if enough retail investors change their focus...).The broader market is rallying too, with the FTSE 100 index gaining 50 points to 6457 points. That recovers some of last week’s losses, which saw the ‘Footsie’ end at a five-week low on Friday as the GameSpot frenzy roiled markets.Dr Elvis Jarnecic, senior lecturer at the University of Sydney Business School, said silver was a “much much more liquid market with a lot more buyers and sellers” so that the newly empowered investors will represent much less significant percentage of traders.Jarnecic was critical of what he described as market manipulation.“If institutions did this to inflate prices in this way away from fundamental values they’d receive enormous fines in regards to manipulating the market.”Here’s our news story on the surge into silver:U.S. bullion broker Apmex has warned that it expects a 1-3 delay in processing silver transactions, due to a surge of orders in recent days.Ken Lewis, CEO of Apmex (which sells silver coins and bars) says a “dramatic shift in silver demand” forced the company to stop sales over the weekend.In the last week, we have seen a dramatic shift in Silver demand from our customers. For example, the ratio of ounces sold per day was running about two times earlier in the week and closer to four times the average demand by the end of the week. Once markets closed on Friday, we saw demand hit as much as six times a typical business day and more than 12 times a normal weekend day. Combined with the extremely high demand levels, we are also seeing a surge in new customers. On Saturday alone, we added as many new customers as we usually add in a week.Any Precious Metal dealer will take a long position in the futures market to protect against spot price exposure when the markets open. We do this because it is our goal not to take a speculative position on metal. The weekends are unique as we are not able to real-time hedge our position. We took an aggressive position this weekend, but clearly could not have predicted the volumes that were seen. We have partnerships around to world that allowed us to cover these long positions, but only to a point. Once we exceeded our comfort levels, we had little choice but to stop the sale of Silver on our website. This was a difficult decision to make and unprecedented in our history.As we evaluate the markets, it is difficult to know where Silver’s price and demand will go in the coming day and weeks. APMEX is highly capitalized and has more than $150 million in inventory to support demand. We have made strategic decisions to procure additional metal, locking up any metal we can find in the market place. We suspect premiums will rise and rise quickly, as we are seeing significant increases in our costs, when we can even locate the metal. It is also highly likely that we will need an additional day or two to fill orders based on current order counts.Bloomberg points out that other retail sites were also unable to process new orders over the weekend until the markets reopened last night:Retail sites for silver have been overwhelmed with demand for bars and coins, suggesting the frenzy that roiled commodities markets last week is spilling over into physical assets.Ipek Ozkardeskaya, Senior Analyst at Swissquote Bank, says a ‘mass move’ of retail investors have piled into silver, sending its price rocketing today.On Sunday, silver coins and bars were taken by assault outlets were unable to process orders until markets opened in Asia. Silver jumpstarted the week hitting $29 an ounce, as pajama traders piled into the metal they considered undervalued in a mass move.This time, the move didn’t come as a pure surprise, as last week’s rush to iShares Silver Trust has thrown the foundation of what we saw on Sunday. From a pricing perspective, we had already discussed the fact that silver lagged behind gold amid an impressive flight to safety sent the yellow metal to its all-time highs last year. Empirical data shows that the gold-silver ratio stands near 60 on average, and the price of an ounce of silver could have well consolidated within the $30-32 band given that the gold price held ground near $1800 per ounce.Therefore, the rise in silver doesn’t seem far-stretched just yet. So far, it is not exactly the GameStop anomaly, but it is a hint that the retail traders who just discovered the strength of their unity are out there, looking for new targets – and apparently bigger ones.But, she also urges caution - highlighting that such speculative charges can stumble:For silver though, the rally could be short-lived as some leading members of Reddit wallstreetbets platform are already ided over the question, and advise against the move in silver.One important thing to remember in this game is, if you lose full support, and momentum, it’s over. This is why, the speculative rush is a prosperous, but a dangerous game.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.Having blasted GameSpot’s shares dramatically higher in the last week, some of the new wave of retail traders shaking up Wall Street have another target -- silver.The move began late last week, with a surge of money into the iShares Silver Trust, an exchange traded fund which is backed by physical silver and tracks its price.Retail sites are also reporting a surge in demand for silver bars and coins on Sunday, indicating a scramble to get hold of physical silver assets.Kyle Rodda of brokerage IG explains:Like the GameStop situation, there’s a back-story to the attempted pumping over silver prices: angered by the perception of a manipulated market for paper silver, the traders are looking squeeze the shorts on the silver market, and force correction in price that, so the argument goes, better reflects the supply and demand of the underlying commodity.But squeezing the silver market will be much harder than moving a single company’s stock price, and trapping hedge funds who had aggressively shorted it.And other WallStreetBets users are urging against piling into silver, with one post claiming it’s an attempt by hedge funds to distract from the GameStop squeeze. Jeffrey Halley, Senior Market Analyst at Asia Pacific, OANDA, says retail investors should be careful when targeting silver.With a large physical off-exchange market, and a lot more liquidity theoretically, then the sparely traded stocks dallied with so far, the retail wolf pack is in dangerous waters.The wolves of Wall Street may well be luring them into a trap in their Bunker Hunt for Reddit October. Last week, the US stock market had its worst week in three months, with the attack on short selling in recent days leaving some large stablished funds nursing huge losses.This is forcing hedge funds and other major investors to cut their short positions in stocks identified by the Reddit readertrader community. But they’re also closing their long holdings in stocks, to keep their portfolios balanced. This ‘de-grossing’ was a factor behind last week’s volatility.Investors are also more anxious about the fight against the pandemic, given the deepening row between the European Union and AstraZeneca over vaccine supplies. But despite that, European markets are on track for a positive open.Also coming up today, a flurry of purchasing manager surveys will show how factories across the world fared in January.The UK data is expected to confirm there was a sharp slowdown last month, with supply delays, rising costs and weak exports due to the pandemic and the end of the Brexit withdrawal agreement.The picture in Australia is more encouraging, with the manufacturing PMI strengthening last month:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b37b0eccbfc509a98a1c6a20bc455f97b7d3075/0_0_3168_1901/master/3168.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f783ffc5679fff08a7099565b48d22ce","title":"global heating alpine plants extinction melting glaciers aoe","story":"‘Escalator to extinction’ means aggressive species will eventually take over, threatening the entire mountain ecosystemAlpine flowers could go extinct after glaciers disappear as more competitive species colonise terrain higher up the mountain, new research has warned.Glaciers are retreating at historically unprecedented rates, exposing new land for plants to grow, which benefits delicate alpine species in the short term. However, these early pioneers – some of which are endemic – soon become endangered as more aggressive species take over, driving them out of their remaining habitat and decreasing overall bioersity, according to the paper published in Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution.Proglacial environments are highly sensitive to global warming, and mountain species are subject to the “escalator to extinction”. They need to move to a higher-altitude habitat as the climate warms, but there is no more space for them to do this. “I think we can be relatively confident that our results can be extended to elsewhere in the Alps and other mountain ecosystems, like the Himalayas, the Karakoram and the Andes,” Losapio said.Alpine plants are a key part of fragile mountain ecosystems so their disappearance is likely to lead to other local extinctions, said Losapio. “They are the primary producers … they are not only our food but fuel for all of the ecosystem – the consumers, predators, parasites, herbivores and pollinators.”Researchers used geological records to reconstruct glaciers so they could work out when ice retreated from different parts of the mountain. This information was combined with a survey of 117 plant species observed in hundreds of plots up to 50m2 in size, alongside analysis of local environmental conditions.They studied the Vedretta d’Amola glacier, the Western Trobio glacier, Rutor glacier and Vedretta di Cedec glacier. By combining datasets, researchers could examine changes over the past 5,000 years and make predictions for the future.In terms of what the Italian Alps will look like in 100 years, it depends on what happens to precipitation, and there is no consensus on this. “Like the boreal forest in Scandinavia or Canada, if it rains a lot it could be a continuous forest, with wet, humid, deep productive soil. If it doesn’t, it will look more like the Sierra Nevada in Spain or California,” said Losapio.Research from the University of Zurich has previously shown that alpine plants are not keeping up with climate change, with invasive species colonising the tops of mountains faster. Botanists working in the Highlands of Scotland also found Britain’s rarest mountain plants were retreating higher and being replaced by grasses normally found at lower altitudes.As well as working to reduce emissions, educating people and raising awareness about fragile mountain ecosystems could help protect these environments, according to Losapio. Encouraging people to stick to paths and not build additional ski slopes would also help.“Rock faces that are home to fragile flowers such as tufted saxifrage, mountain avens and moss campion are now choked with grasses, mosses and rushes as the fertility of the thin soil increases.

The 25-year-old, who had been in talks with Celtic about an end-of-season move, is expected to complete a medical this morning and could be joined at Liverpool’s well appointed new training ground by Marseille’s Croatian defender Duje Caleta Car.Despite hankering for a move to Paris Saint-Germain, Dele Alli looks increasingly likely to stay at Tottenham Hotspur for the foreseeable future. In José Mourinho’s bad books and out of the Tottenham side that lost against Brighton on Sunday night, the midfielder will only be allowed leave if Christian Eriksen returns on loan from Inter. All available evidence – specifically, some unsubstantiated hearsay – suggests there is little or no chance of the English club reaching an agreement with their Italian counterparts ahead of Monday’s 11pm GMT deadline.Elsewhere in north London, Arsenal are reported to be mulling over a late “swoop” for Crystal Palace left-back Patrick van Aanholt, and could free up a dressing-room peg for the Dutchman by sending Ainsley Maitland-Niles out on loan to Leicester City. The England international also has admirers in Newcastle, West Brom and Southampton but is believed to prefer the idea of a move to the King Power Stadium. On what could be a busy day in the Arsenal departures lounge, Joe Willock and Reiss Nelson may also be shipped out on loan to destinations as yet unknown. Skodhran Mustafi has also been told he can leave and remains endearingly hopeful of a call from Liverpool.West Brom plan to boost their increasingly forlorn hopes of survival in the Premier League by bringing in Tottenham’s 21-year-old right-back Japhet Tanganga. The Baggies are also closing in on Celta Vigo midfielder Okay Yokuslu, who is expected to sign on loan until the end of the season. Further north, Newcastle want to bring Leicester midfielder Hamza Choudhury to St James’ Park on loan, and could send Matty Longstaff off to Watford.Meanwhile in Istanbul, Cenk Tosun has completed his loan move to Besiktas, following an underwhelming spell at Everton in which he scored just nine goals in 49 appearances since arriving from the Turkish club in 2018.And finally, it wouldn’t be deadline day without speculation regarding the future of Josh King, who remains at Bournemouth despite having been linked with more clubs than you can shake a rolled-up copy of Four-Four-Two magazine at in recent windows. Burnley are the latest Premier League outfit to express interest in the Norwegian’s goalscoring services but his apparently prohibitive wage demands mean a deal seems unlikely."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aaef5569f2b8dc38308b786174f6391bb71c1eeb/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a76cc587b697cefe5da70305b5ff07ef","title":"caffeine dehydrates you and other common hydration myths busted","story":"We all know that a healthy intake of water is crucial for our health, but there is still a lack of clarity around how we give our body the fluid it needsLack of hydration is often the culprit when it comes to fine lines and dullness, as well as other skincare concerns. London-based dermatology registrar Dr Cristina Psomadakis says skin hydration is absolutely paramount to maintaining a healthy skin barrier and ensuring that skin cells shed at a normal pace. Adequate hydration is one of the key elements of a fresh-faced glow and minimises the appearance of cracks, flakes or wrinkles in the skin.This is true for all skin types and all skin tones, which is why hydration is so important. Oily skin and dry skin can both be dehydrated. Drier skin types are usually classified by having fewer oil-producing glands compared with oily or combination skin. However, dry skin can be thirsty with a lack of water as well as oil. By the same rule, oily skin types can also be dehydrated with a lack of water and not oil.But drinking eight glasses of water isn’t the only way to get hydrated. You should also aim to consume water through food too. Eating foods rich in water helps the body to absorb the water more slowly, which means the water we get from foods such as cucumbers, watermelon, bell peppers, strawberries, celery and iceberg lettuce keeps us hydrated as well as giving the body a boost of minerals, vitamins and fibre.There is also a myth that caffeine excessively dehydrates you. It is true that caffeine can act as a mild diuretic, but according to a study by the University of Birmingham, where 50 men habitually consumed three to six cups of coffee a day, there was no evidence to show that they were more dehydrated than those who drank water alone.But when it comes to drinking water, you can get too much of a good thing. Overhydration – or hyponatremia – is a condition where sodium and electrolyte levels can become dangerously low due to drinking too much water. This can cause headaches, nausea, muscle weakness and can even be fatal in extreme cases. So finding the right balance is key.Stress, pollution, blue light from devices, exposure to UV and a lack of sleep can all affect the skin and its ability to retain water and stay plump. Staying hydrated is great for the body and helps to regulate mood. As our brain is mostly made up of water, drinking the right amount of it helps keep headaches at bay. Water is also great for helping us stay more focused. But how can the skin also get a drink of water to help boost its function?Hyaluronic acid – due to the “acid” in its name – might sound a bit scary, but it’s known as a souped-up skincare wonder ingredient for its hydrating properties. ”Hyaluronic acid is a sugary substance that we make naturally in our body – it is found in the skin, eyes, joints, even the umbilical cord,” says Psomadakis. “Hyaluronic acid is classed as a humectant, which basically means it’s a hydration magnet – it helps draw moisture from the environment and surface of your skin.”Whether it’s upping your water intake by drinking it, consuming food with high water content, or slathering on great skincare to help boost hydration, water is definitely key for bouncy, radiant and plump skin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19b616cbd50e4d69d434649fd135693336e1ad19/0_20_1731_1039/master/1731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d8b6e0e39fbe0132fe230e98ab26292","title":"dry patches tightness and redness signs your skin is dehydrated and how to fix it","story":"Dehydration can leave your skin looking dull and lifeless – but luckily it’s totally fixable. Here’s expert advice on how to get glowing skin no matter what time of year it isWhen skin suddenly feels tight and looks dull, with fine lines and wrinkles more apparent than ever, it’s easy to panic. But, while it might be easy to assume that the stress of the past year has irredeemably accelerated the ageing process, it’s far more likely that such skin issues are simply down to dehydration. And while that’s not ideal, the good news is that it can be put right.Unlike dry skin, which tends to be a long-term issue caused by your skin not producing enough oil, dehydrated skin is down to lack of water and is usually temporary.“Skin hydration is absolutely paramount to maintaining a healthy skin barrier and ensuring that skin cells shed at a normal pace,” says Dr Cristina Psomadakis, a London-based dermatology registrar. “Adequate hydration is one of the key elements of a fresh-faced glow and minimises the appearances of cracks, flakes or wrinkles in the skin.” In other words, hydration is key to maintaining skin is in tiptop condition. So what causes dehydration in skin?We lose about half a litre of water through our skin on a daily basis. But that varies greatly with climate and exercise. And while it stands to reason that if you’re getting your sweat on, you’re losing water, cold weather – and the sort of lifestyle that goes with it – can be just as much of an issue as hot weather, when it comes to drying out your skin.“Cold weather, indoor heating and hot showers can all wreak havoc on our skin and cause it to lose moisture and become dry and flaky,” says Psomadakis.“It is really important to be proactive and try to protect our skin before it suffers from seasonal assaults. This usually means swapping to a richer moisturiser – or moisturising more frequently.”The top layer of the skin – known as the skin barrier – is the body’s defence against everything the outside world has to throw at it. It not only stops stuff getting in, but it’s also the layer responsible for protecting your skin and holding in moisture, and it has to put up with a lot of abuse in daily life.Stress, pollution, blue light from devices and infrared radiation can also compromise our skin barrier. When the barrier is damaged, the mechanisms that usually help keep skin hydrated and plump don’t work as effectively, resulting in dry patches, tightness, redness and dull skin tone.And it’s worth remembering that skin health doesn’t just work from the outside in. What you eat and drink can also have an impact – as you’ll know if you’ve ever felt desiccated after a big night out. Alcohol – and caffeine too – can take moisture out of your body, and that will show on your skin too.Psomadakis recommends swapping to a richer moisturiser (or using moisturiser more frequently), making sure to wear sunscreen even on cold days and limiting the amount of active or exfoliating ingredients and swapping them for gentler ones instead.Drinking a few more glasses of the stuff isn’t going to do anyone any harm, but there’s no guarantee that all of the H2O you drink is going to make it to your skin. So what’s the answer? Putting water on the skin doesn’t seem to make much sense, either, given how tight skin can feel without body lotion after even a lukewarm shower.Crucially, Vichy Minéral 89 pairs this mineral-rich water with hyaluronic acid, which is increasingly being viewed as the secret ingredient when it comes to radiant, hydrated skin.“Hyaluronic acid is a sugary substance that we make naturally in our body – it is found in the skin, eyes, joints, even the umbilical cord,” says Psomadakis. “As people grow older, they lose some of the hyaluronic acid found on the epidermis, the upper layer of our skin.”Hyaluronic acid, which is a very safe ingredient for all skin types, can be natural, or synthetic, and comes in different sizes. While smaller molecules with lower molecular weights can penetrate the skin, higher molecular weight hyaluronic acid is a larger molecule that sits on the surface drawing water to it, helping to smooth and plump the skin.The hyaluronic acid in Minéral 89 is of natural origin, and is a larger molecule, perfect for counteracting the sort of winter dehydration that your skin is likely to be suffering from. As such, Minéral 89 is the only serum to get the British Skin Foundation stamp of approval, which means the foundation has checked over its research and agrees that it stands up. No wonder beauty editor Funmi Fetto described the easy-to-use serum as being “like a glass of water for your skin”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94e5c5b14b518c644178e963b0bc9ff38ea3349c/0_0_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a498d586dc5ff29d892ecfdccfa63b34","title":"me and my water bottle my journey to drinking eight glasses a day","story":"Drinking the recommended amount may seem like an easy target, but many of us find ourselves consuming less water than we should. Writer Anna Fielding describes how she met her hydration goalsThis is by no means a heroic journey, I’m aware of that. Hydration shouldn’t be hard: eight glasses of water a day – sounds pretty simple, right? It comes out of the tap, ready to drink, right there in your kitchen. You don’t even have to leave the house for it.It should feel miraculous, if you think about it in a historical and global context – all this available water, but its abundance works against it. After all, when choosing what to drink, the taste of water doesn’t quite compare with the bite of a short, sharp coffee, or the sugary funk of pineapple juice.Don’t get me wrong, I’m not against water – that would be ridiculous, like being against land or air. I love to mix it with rose oil and bathe in it. I swim in it. I get mesmerised by fountains. I even enjoy drinking it most of the time.Water, when I have enough of it, makes me feel more fluid. My thoughts flow. My skin is plumped up and glows. My eyes are less tired. My online yoga class is easier and, without sounding like a yoghurt advert evangelist, digesting food is easier too. And this personal experience is backed up by medical advice: staying hydrated improves everything from concentration to kidney function. We’re better, all around, with water and we all know that.The problem I have is that I’m easily distracted, which leads to me not drinking enough water throughout the day. Every time I make the conscious effort to hydrate myself, something gets in the way. It might sound ridiculous to you, but it’s true. Even working from home, a measly 15 steps from the kitchen sink, I get caught up in something else – the news, social media, a message from a friend, something interesting on the radio. In non-Covid times, the distractions were even greater.So I finally made the decision that in order to drink more, I’d have to make a very conscious effort to make drinking a part of my daily routine. I started putting a pint glass on the kitchen counter before going to bed. In the morning, I fill it up and drink it while waiting for the kettle to boil. One pint down without even thinking about it – win! I also keep my water bottle in my bicycle basket now. Even if I’m not cycling, the size of my flat means my bike functions as a hallway table and the bottle sits by my keys, purse and gloves. It’s no longer a kitchen object, it’s a leaving-the-house object.There are times, however, when I still need more – and my skin is the first to tell me. As I get older, hangovers increasingly leave me looking like a dried apricot. Coming in from a cold, windy walk to the central heating pinches my face. Some years ago, I discovered hyaluronic acid. It’s a substance we produce in our bodies, found mostly in our skin, eyes and connective tissues, and its main function is to draw and hold water. It’s a key ingredient in Vichy’s Minéral 89 Serum and designed for daily use. But the Minéral 89 Serum also works wonders for when the skin needs an extra boost: when you’ve spent too long in the sun, or when you’re red-faced post-exercise. When my body needs more hydration than I’ve given it, this serum means that at least it won’t show on my skin.One of the main issues I have with drinking the recommended amount is the fact that I have been told so often to drink more water – usually by a strangely serene person on Instagram or a magazine page – and that it has turned into a chore. There’s something to be said about approaching water drinking in the same way as changing the duvet cover or filing a tax return: not bad once you start and you feel better when it’s done.Adding a mild element of fun to the equation can help too, as I’ve discovered. I now fill a blue glass jug to keep on my desk, with ice and some mint in the summer. For colder days, I fill an old teapot with herbal tea, or slices of ginger to flavour my water. We take our pleasures where we can these days, so using my grandmother’s china or the glass I bought in Venice does give a small lift and certainly makes me drink more.We all want easy fixes – and luckily they are available: apply the product, get the good china out, put things where you can see them, and marvel at how quickly you can drink it all in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/008fde4de742d95b8ac40136d6fa89751880d6a6/0_190_5123_3074/master/5123.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0834da4def5a06979e43c4e93780c76","title":"prioritise beauty sleep five tips to help boost skin hydration","story":"Even mild dehydration can leave skin looking dry and lacklustre, energy levels depleted and our mood low.

Sound familiar?But for a truly solid hydration routine, it’s important we don’t stop at the external. Water, after all, is crucial fuel for the whole body, not just a glowy complexion. Muscles can cramp up when we teeter towards dehydration – water keeps clicky knees at bay by ensuring joints stay lubricated and flexible, while the kidneys need plenty of it to remove toxins from our bodies.Optimum water levels also help our mental health studies show that even mild dehydration can dampen moods, increase irritability, make focusing on tasks far trickier, and leave our motivation for just about anything seriously flagging. So if your hydration routine is somewhat lacking, these easy tips can deliver the boost you need …Drink eight glasses of waterNothing beats getting your hydration straight from the source. Official advice recommends we drink six to eight glasses (around two litres) of water a day, sipping on small amounts often. You can take it one step further by opting for electrolyte-infused drinks such as coconut water or watermelon juice, which are natural sources of minerals including sodium, calcium, potassium and magnesium.Helping to regulate the fluid balance in your body, electrolytes are essential for sparking healthy cell function and are thought to help speed up recovery after exercising too, particularly if you’ve gone all-out during a sweaty session.Look to smart skincareJust as certain foods deliver key hydration from the inside, smart skincare powered by ingredients that draw in moisture and protect your skin’s natural moisture barrier can work wonders on the outside. “Skin hydration is absolutely paramount to maintaining a healthy skin barrier and ensuring that skin cells shed at a normal pace. Adequate hydration is one of the key elements of a fresh-faced glow and minimises the appearances of cracks, flakes or wrinkles in the skin,” says Psomadakis. “Key ingredients to look for are glycerin and hyaluronic acid.”Vichy Minéral 89 Hyaluronic Acid Hydration Booster, aptly described by beauty editor Funmi Fetto as “a glass of water for your skin”, combines both of these hydrators with the brand’s signature mineralising water to plump up tired skin and protect its barrier function.Calm your mindOur state of mind can have wide-reaching effects on the body, and during bouts of stress or anxiety our skin – the body’s largest organ – can bear the brunt of it. Hormones such as cortisol, which increase in the body when we’re stressed, can lead to inflammation, and flare conditions such as acne, eczema and psoriasis. They have also been shown to impair our skin barrier and increase transepidermal water loss (when moisture is lost through our skin). Daily mindfulness and meditation can help to break the cycle if you’re feeling overwhelmed. Try it with the meditation experts at Headspace, who are currently offering three months of free membership with every Vichy Minéral 89 purchase made on lookfantastic*. “With as little as three minutes practice a day, people can experience the benefits of science-backed meditation, helping the mind to be calmer, clearer, kinder, and more resilient,” says Eve Lewis, director of meditation at Headspace.Prioritise beauty sleepDuring sleep the body repairs itself and replenishes moisture levels in the skin. But studies show that about a third of us don’t get the recommended seven hours of sleep each night. “There is actually some scientific basis to the concept of beauty sleep,” says Psomadakis. “Sleep deprivation leads to increased production of stress hormones and decreased production of antioxidants. This imbalance impairs our skin’s natural defences against external aggressors. This can contribute to loss of hydration, also known as transepidermal water loss, making moisturising all the more essential.”Creating a relaxing bedtime routine can help your mind to switch off before sleep, making good quality rest easier to come by. Try avoiding electronic devices for an hour before bedtime, enjoy an evening meditation to clear your mind, or incorporate a few minutes of relaxing massage into your skincare routine with a hydrating serum to replenish tired skin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42aea3005be4cd41583dd72b2862238eb774e939/0_1126_2508_1503/master/2508.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2f3898f09d8d41d08eb67f361632342","title":"my kids and parents rely on me is it selfish to put my own needs first","story":"You must prioritise your own wellbeing – it’s what your two adopted children and your elderly parents depend onThe dilemma My husband and I have two adopted children with complex and lifelong learning disabilities who attend a specialist school. I left my job to stay at home with them as their needs were much greater than we ever anticipated, but I have struggled. I feel I have lost my own sense of being and identity. I am exhausted, on antidepressants and suffer with anxiety, PTSD and chronic depression. I also have elderly parents with a history of illness.I do have some joy in the form of gardening, which has given me a purpose, a sanctuary, and brings me beauty and hope. We have a small garden, and I want to expand it into a larger business, which may even support the children in the future, much like a care farm.Lockdown meant my husband could work at home and because we don’t need to live near his office any more we started to think about getting a bigger house and garden near a specialist college for the children.We found one which ticks many requirements, but I’m now struggling to leave my parents and all we’ve known. They don’t want to move and I’m worried in case either becomes ill or has an accident. I feel like I’m on a runaway train that I can’t stop. I can see all the benefits, but I am completely torn between the needs of us four as a family and those of my ageing parents.Mariella replies That’s a toughie. It’s been illuminating during this past year, defined by the pandemic, to see how many among us have close and supportive relationships with ageing parents. Before the virus there seemed an assumption that Britons were a heartless lot, abandoning those who gave birth to us the moment we were capable of independence or they became frail. So to see so many go far out of their way to protect their parents, to care for them in lockdown, to place the oldest at the front of the queue for the vaccine and deliver their weekly shopping, has turned those notions on their heads. We’re very good at self-criticism in this country. Indeed, I’d say that as a nation we suffer from a crippling dose of insecurity. As the octogenarian firecracker Dame Sheila Hancock told me the other day in an interview, insecurity is as crippling as any disease and should be considered one. So your letter, which sees you torn between the new lease of life you clearly need and maintaining the status quo in order to do your duty, is a particularly timely one.There’s no question that the measure of a society is in how it treats its most vulnerable and I’d say that, apart from some major lapses during the past nine months, the elderly have generally been protected, considered, valued and prioritised. If only I could say the same for the young. While we’ve been clapping for the carers, professional and voluntary, our kids have lost educational opportunities and a big chunk of their childhood to this miserable period in history.And let’s not forget those, like you, who are trapped in the middle of these generational extremities, trying to balance your own needs against those pressing in on you from both sides. I’m presuming you are getting professional help with the mental health difficulties you outline (if not, Mencap would be a good place to start) so it’s the lifestyle question you need me to chew over.What’s clear is that it is time you spared a thought for your own wellbeing, on which not just your two children but also your parents depend. Covid has encouraged many of us to reevaluate our lifestyles and the choices presenting themselves to your family are being echoed up and down the land. Only you can work out the logistics, but in terms of the future wellbeing of your family I can’t see how you can turn down this opportunity.There’s a limit to how much each human can carry and although there are those who shoulder devastating loads with barely a whimper there’s a hefty price to pay for not taking your own fulfilment and happiness seriously enough. Even without the mitigating circumstances you describe, I would be urging you to look after number one and let numbers two, three, four, five and six follow. Your parents will have what’s best for you as their priority. That’s what parenting is about, a long painful process of letting go – the very thing you least want to do from the start.They’ve been lucky to have you in their close vicinity for as long as they have and I presume you will remain available to them when they need you – and a regular visitor. But now you must tend to your own needs as committedly as you would your garden. Your family, like your plants, needs you to be in full bloom. So take this chance to expand your lungs and kickstart an alternative lifestyle. Judging by the circumstances you deserve this spell in daylight – and you won’t be the only beneficiary.

Antares contains 12 times the mass of the sun and its radius is about 680 times larger than our star. Its surface temperature of about 3,400C is what gives it such a deep red colour. It is much easier to see the pair the further south you are located. From Australia, the best view will be on the morning of 7 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e43a9d81c8936dbfdc27f17149a7bdd57d159f8e/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=2f86db7ce98c331ba95c82d203145263","title":"british irish lions hosting offer australia","story":"The British \u0026amp Irish Lions have confirmed Australia’s surprise offer to stage this summer’s series against South Africa is on the table, but the  understands it is likely to be rejected despite the prospect of bumper crowds in the alternative host nation.Relocating the tour to Australia is among the contingency options but financial and logistical complications mean the proposal is the least likely compared with switching to the UK and Ireland, or going ahead in South Africa behind closed doors.The Rugby Australia chairman, Hamish McLennan, confirmed the offer had been tabled, with the Lions and South Africa sharing the profits once his organisation had been reimbursed costs. The offer has been received as “generous” and there is the obvious carrot that crowds could attend the matches – a prospect that looks highly unlikely in South Africa and uncertain in the home nations.It is accepted that Australia would still not be able to welcome 30,000 travelling Lions supporters, but McLennan told the Sydney Morning Herald: “What we learnt from the Tri Nations last year and the tennis that’s happening now is that Australia can successfully stage global tournaments in a Covid world. There are so many expats living around Australia that we still feel we could fill the grounds. We’re here to help.”Australia’s strict border controls are considered a potential stumbling block, however. There is not enough time in the calendar for the Lions to complete their respective seasons, undergo the quarantine period required and fulfil a tour completewith matches against provincial teams. Truncating the tour to accommodate the quarantine period would raise questions about whether going to Australia is worthwhile financially.In addition, the greater time difference would not be well received by Sky Sports – not least as it would mean more clashes with high‑profile events such as the rescheduled Tokyo Olympics – and well-placed sources in South Africa have poured cold water on the proposal.Discussions are ongoing between the Lions and the South Africa union on how best to proceed, with a decision expected by mid to late February. South Africa favour postponement by a year but that is considered highly unlikely because it would be too close to the 2023 World Cup while the home nations have summer tours arranged. It would also require the approval of World Rugby, which would then need to overhaul the international calendar.South Africa’s next preference is whichever solution is most financially beneficial given the economic gains a full Lions tour can bring.Playing in the UK and Ireland could provide that on the basis that crowds are allowed into stadiums but that remains a huge if and the logistical planning for moving the tour to the northern hemisphere would need to start sooner rather than later.As a result, there is an increasing sense that playing the tour in South Africa in empty stadiums is a realistic option. It would be devastating for South Africa, given the revenues they would be missing, but it would be the broadcasters’ preferred option, as well as the most straightforward logistically."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c58e42272da5fdb01395ace9ebcbcdd091e5e13/0_0_5432_3259/master/5432.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=7706afa24860649c1a400cefa8af5fc5","title":"lost on the frontline covid nurse coronavirus","story":"Yolanda Coar was 40 when she died of Covid-19 in August 2020 in Augusta, Georgia.

It said the army had declared a state of emergency, and had detained senior government leaders in response to “fraud” during last year’s general election.Phone and mobile internet services in Yangon were down on Monday morning and military trucks, one carrying barbed-wire barriers, were parked outside City Hall. State-run MRTV television said it had been unable to broadcast. Banks were closed across the nation.The military’s actions brought swift condemnation from leaders and human rights experts around the world.US president Joe Biden’s press secretary, Jen Psaki, said the US opposed “any attempt to alter the outcome of recent elections or impede Myanmar’s democratic transition, and will take action against those responsible if these steps are not reversed.”US secretary of state Antony Blinken also called for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other detainees. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres said the developments represented “a serious blow to democratic reforms in Myanmar”.Over the past week, there has been mounting concern that the military, which ran Myanmar – also known as Burma – for some 50 years until 2011, was preparing to retake power. The army has alleged widespread irregularities in November’s election, which Aung San Suu Kyi’s party won in a landslide victory. It said last week that a coup could not be ruled out, prompting the United Nations and several foreign missions in the country to express alarm.The military later backtracked, claiming comments by its commander-in-chief had been misunderstood. Over the weekend, however, armed police patrolled the housing where lawmakers were quarantining ahead of the opening of parliament this week.On Monday morning, spokesman Myo Nyunt told Reuters that Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and other leaders had been “taken” by the military. “I want to tell our people not to respond rashly and I want them to act according to the law,” he said, adding he also expected to be detained.A National League for Democracy (NLD) lawmaker, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation, said also detained was Han Thar Myint, a member of the party’s central executive committee. A student union leader was also reportedly held.Author and historian Thant Myint-U wrote on on Twitter: “The doors just opened to a very different future.“I have a sinking feeling that no one will really be able to control what comes next. And remember Myanmar’s a country awash in weapons, with deep isions across ethnic \u0026amp religious lines, where millions can barely feed themselves.”On the streets of Yangon, long queues formed outside supermarkets as people rushed to stock up on supplies. Crowds huddled at an ATM to try to withdraw cash, only to find the machines were down. Two Muslim men said it was safer to stay home and take shelter.A 25-year-old woman, who works in public relations, said she feared her country was once again “back in the dark age”. “My mum shook me awake with the news that Aung San Suu Kyi had been detained. I was shocked and didn’t know how to respond. I rushed to my brother’s house to pick him up and buy groceries. On the way back I was in tears. I feel so angry and so anxious.”Tom Andrews, UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, said the situation was “very disturbing”. “What many have feared is indeed unfolding in Myanmar,” he said.Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) won a landslide victory in November’s elections, securing 396 out of 476 seats, which granted it another five years in government. The military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party won just 33 seats.The military-aligned opposition has challenged the results, while the army has claimed to have found 8.6m cases of fraud. The election commission has denied fraud, though it has conceded there were “flaws” in voter lists.Last week, a military spokesman refused to rule out the possibility of a coup, while, a day later, army chief General Min Aung Hlaing said that revoking the constitution could be “necessary” under certain circumstances.Aung San Suu Kyi spent nearly 15 years in detention as part of a decades-long struggle against military rule, before leading the NLD to a sweeping victory in Myanmar’s first openly contested election in 2015. Though her international reputation has been severely undermined by her treatment of the Rohingya, and her decision to defend Myanmar against allegations of genocide, she is revered by many in the Bamar majority as the mother of the nation.The army, however, remains hugely powerful due to a junta-backed constitution that gives it control over key ministries and guarantees it a quarter of parliamentary seats.“The military junta that ruled Myanmar for decades never really stepped away from power in the first place,” said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said on Monday. “They never really submitted to civilian authority in the first place, so today’s events in some sense are merely revealing a political reality that already existed.”Governments around the world have expressed alarm over the developments. Charles Santiago, a Malaysian MP and chairperson of Asean Parliamentarians for Human Rights, said the military should “send their tanks back to the barracks, and restore communication services.”“The people of Myanmar had their say in November’s vote, and overwhelmingly sent the message that they reject army rule. The military must respect the will of the people and allow parliament to proceed.”Canada’s ambassador to the United Nations, Bob Rae, added that there was “no justification for the military detention of Aung Sang Suu Kyi”.“The Burmese military – the Tatmadaw – must be held to account,” he said.Australian foreign minister Marise Payne said the Australian government was “deeply concerned” by the developments. “We call on the military to respect the rule of law, to resolve disputes through lawful mechanisms and to release immediately all civilian leaders and others who have been detained unlawfully,” she said in a statement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa1d1ac66473b7f9434c76465f8c456e6cf58488/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=592fa6ea3fa2622c954273ab1d44c002","title":"jacinda ardern faces waitangi day reckoning with maori as progress stalls","story":"Three years after the prime minister asked Māori to hold her to account, many are disillusioned with her governmentIn an oft-repeated story New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has recalled how growing up in the small, largely Māori town of Murupara, she would see children going to school hungry, and with no shoes on their feet.It was these scenes of entrenched inequality and poverty, often along racial lines, that drove a teenage Ardern into the Labour party, where she has dedicated herself to combating child poverty.But fast-forward to the second term of the Labour government and Indigenous political experts say Ardern’s track record in tackling systemic Māori disadvantage has been underwhelming. Despite a record number of Māori MPs in government, little has changed in the appalling socio-economic statistics that reflect the lives of New Zealand’s Indigenous people.“Among Māori there seems to be an increasingly clear understanding that we can’t wait for the government to meet our needs any more,” says Garrick Cooper, a senior lecturer at the school of Māori and Indigenous studies at the University of Canterbury.Waitangi Day, at this stage still slated to go ahead in Northland on the 6 February, celebrates the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi between Māori chiefs and British colonisers in 1840.But modern-day Waitangi has become a reckoning between the crown and its Indigenous treaty partners, with protests common and bottomless promises from politicians to improve Indigenous wellbeing.Over the years many politicians have chosen not to attend – fearful of protest and acrimony – and in 1990, Queen Elizabeth was greeted with a mixture of cheering and boos, as well as having a black T-shirt thrown at her by a young Māori woman.Promising change, Ardern swept into Waitangi in 2018 for an unprecedented five-day visit – the longest of any prime minister.Ngāpuhi, the local tribe, showed respect to Ardern by allowing her to speak on the marae (meeting ground) – the first female prime minister to be granted that right – and also invited her to bury the placenta of her baby on tribal grounds.Memorably, Ardern asked the people gathered at Waitangi to hold her government to account, particularly regarding its commitments to lift Māori children out of poverty, create more jobs and reduce the high incarceration rate of Māori.The first 49 seconds of her speech were delivered in te reo, the Māori language, a skill she said she would like to improve.“When we return, in one year, in three years, I ask you to ask of us what we have done …. Ask us, hold us to account,” she said. “Because one day I want to be able to tell my child that I earned the right to stand here, and only you can tell me when I have done that.”But three years on, and many Māori are feeling disillusioned at the progress of their treaty partner, despite some wins, such as the appointment of Māori woman Nanaia Mahuta as foreign minister, and the growth of the flourishing Whānau Ora, a culturally based, and whānau-centred, government social agency.Māori are also routinely over-represented in poor health and mortality outcomes across the board, in addition to facing entrenched issues of poverty, homelessness and drug and alcohol abuse.The human rights commissioner, Meng Foon, who speaks fluent Māori, recently said racism was “alive and well” in New Zealand. Indeed, racism has been entrenched in many institutions. Media giant Stuff issued a public apology last year for its past portrayal of Māori, which it said had ranged from blinkered to racist until the present day.But in government change has been much slower, and experts say a series of crises in Labour’s first-term stalled their efforts towards tackling Indigenous issues, including the March 2019 mosque attacks in Christchurch, the global pandemic, and the eruption of the Whakaari White Island volcano.Usually renowned for her warmth and human touch, Ardern’s stand-back approach on pivotal Indigenous issues has also communicated to many that she’s reluctant to be drawn into the maelstrom of modern-day Māori politics.The occupation of Ihumātao by Māori activists wanting to reclaim tribal land from private property developers galvanised a new generation of young Māori – but Ardern never showed, despite months of pleas by locals.Likewise, when the row over the removal of Māori babies from their mothers blew up after a 2019 Newsroom report, Ardern staunchly refused to comment or intervene, or even watch the video of a Māori infant being taken from its mother in a North Island hospital by police and social services.And on the controversial police armed response teams, which disproportionately target Māori communities, Ardern was silent, saying their deployment was an “operational issue”.“Her Māori MPs, you could tell they were really uncomfortable when they eventually turned up at Ihumātao,” says Cooper.“Because Jacinda would not go. She was in Christchurch in a flash, she was at Whakaari in a flash, and we’d hope and expect that she’d be at Ihumātao. But instead she was very wary, and she remains very wary.”The Labour party have drawn Māori support for decades, but Cooper notes that the most significant treaty of Waitangi settlements have actually occurred under the National party.The trust between Māori and any New Zealand government is more fragile than ever, says Cooper, and despite a certain amount of feel-good warmth on display in recent years at Waitangi, structural change, or a “by Māori, for Māori” approach, is farther away than ever.“Māori need to drive the transformation for change, and government need to understand that their role is supporting us – not telling us how to do it,” Cooper says.The transformational change promised by Ardern has been a let-down for many New Zealanders. They expected to see massive policy overhauls in the realm of the environment, housing and child poverty, and have instead seen minor, sometimes imperceptible, tweaks.Dr Lara Greaves, a lecturer in New Zealand politics at the University of Auckland, says Indigenous wellbeing has suffered the same fate under Labour as under previous governments, and that ultimately “there were no giant leap forwards on Māori policy or equality”.“Labour have that mandate for transformational change and that needs to happen,” she said. But that is “quite scary” for them and their “broad church” of middle New Zealand supporters, she added.“Otherwise, at this point, it’s really not clear what Labour want to do in terms of their long-term legacy.”For Kelvin Davis, the government’s minister for Māori crown relations and a Ngāpuhi man, trust is something to be garnered slowly.“The question is, who has crossed the bridge from that world to the other the most? and it’s almost exclusively been Māori … we’ve learnt the English language, the custom, the laws – the question is how many people have crossed over from te ao Pakeha to te ao Maori? It has happened, but it’s very rare,” Davis said.“My vision is that hopefully in the not too distant future people can just cross from one world into the other, at will totally comfortable, flipping in and out of languages as they see fit. That to me is a vision of Aotearoa into the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c08a2734e8ab779241d924eb417210c15c380c50/0_681_6165_3699/master/6165.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90022760bfc83a43b37d868384fd93f8","title":"monday briefing aung san suu kyi held in coup","story":"Myanmar military also detains senior government figures … NHS will take months to return to normal … Charlene White on being ‘authentically me’ Good morning and welcome to this Monday briefing with me, Alison Rourke.Aung San Suu Kyi and senior members of the government of Myanmar, including the president, have been detained in early morning raids. She has called for public protests and encouraged her supporters to resist: “I urge people not to accept this, to respond and wholeheartedly to protest against the coup by the military,” a statement released in her name said. Phone lines to the capital were down, state TV said it could not broadcast, and soldiers were on the streets of the capital. The military announced it had taken control and declared a state of emergency for a year, with power handed to commander-in-chief General Min Aung Hlaing. Viewed as the country’s de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi spent nearly 15 years under house arrest until 2010. She became a symbol of resistance against 50 years of junta and despite being criticised internationally for not stopping the persecution of Rohingya Muslims, remains beloved inside the country. Her party’s landslide victory in November was questioned by the generals, who alleged voter fraud. Her arrest came hours before parliament was due to hold its first session. ‘Exhausted and traumatised’ – The NHS will take months to return to normal after Covid, because its workforce is “exhausted and traumatised”, according to a senior hospital trusts boss. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, says “very large numbers” will go on long-term sick leave or leave their jobs because of the stress of seeing huge numbers of people die and being unable to decompress after working so intensely. Patients should not expect a speedy return to treatment services and cancelled surgeries, including for cancer, will take time to return to normal. “There’s potentially quite a tension between giving staff who are completely exhausted the space and support they need to recover, and at the same time the NHS recovering the backlogs of care that have built up, particularly in the hospital sector,” said Hopson, whose organisation represents England’s 240 NHS trusts. The warning comes as the NHS is expected to reveal today that it has offered vaccines to all older residents in care homes in England. In another milestone, a record nearly 600,000 people were vaccinated on Saturday. Meanwhile, Captain Tom Moore, whose charity walks raised £39m for the NHS, was admitted to hospital yesterday with Covid-19 and pneumonia. A family spokesperson said he had not been vaccinated because of the medication that was treating the pneumonia.In other Covid news, the pandemic could cost children £350bn in earnings due to lost learning, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. UK patients are dying needlessly due to unfounded fears about ventilators, doctors say, with some critically ill people refusing intubation, wrongly associating it with a higher risk of death.

We have also made clear that the government’s role is to remind the Iranian authorities that Nazanin has the UK’s protection not to act as a messenger for the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps mafia tactics and suppression.” Zaghari-Ratcliffe is under house arrest at her parents’ home in Tehran and is due to complete her five-year sentence for spying on 7 March.Steer clear – Thames Water has been discharging untreated sewage into a chalk stream in Buckinghamshire, causing what campaigners say is untold harm to infant trout and habitats in the river.

Paul Jennings, chairman of the River Chess Association, said it had been notified of the sewage releases, which Thames Water says are legally permitted, every day except one over the past week. Jennings is planning to erect signs along the river to alert the public to the discharges.‘Couldn’t be prouder’ – Veteran environmental activist Dan Hooper, known as Swampy, who is one of nine protesters in a tunnel in central London to raise the alarm about the environmental destruction they believe the high speed rail project HS2 will cause, is in the tunnel with his 16-year-old son, Rory, it has emerged. “To begin with, I didn’t want Rory to be in the tunnel for the eviction, but he was absolutely adamant that he would stay down there with me for it,” Hooper said. “He did help dig it and it is his future at stake, and that of other young people like him, so I couldn’t really argue.

A recent report by MPs on the women and equalities committee found one of the causes of the disparity to be “entrenched health inequalities”.The decision by the Tory minister and Labour mayor to make a joint appeal demonstrates how seriously they believe the issue of resistance to, and suspicion of, the Covid-19 vaccines could be for iniduals and communities, and the national effort to get on top of the virus.Writing jointly in the Observer, they emphasise how important it is to understand why people from BAME backgrounds may be reluctant to support the vaccination programme because of a wider mistrust of political leaders who have failed to do more for their communities. They say they will continue to work to address “these lower levels of trust that some from Black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds have in the institutions set up to represent them”.But after a week in which the total number of UK deaths from Covid-19 passed 100,000 they say it is more vital than ever for those with doubts to seek reassurances from people with knowledge who they trust.“People of black African ethnicity in England are over twice as likely to die from this virus than white people, according to the Office for National Statistics.

In a sign of how much pressure the country’s political leaders are under amid a stalling vaccine rollout, Bavaria’s minister president - or state premier - Markus Soeder said Germany should look at approving Sputnik V and Sinovac jabs. On Monday morning, his Brandenburg counterpart Dietmar Woidke agreed that Germany could look at vaccines from other countries. He told German state broadcaster ARD that those vaccines would have to pass regulatory assessments first ‘and maybe that can be done as quickly as it was for BioNTech and other vaccines’. “I think it is necessary and possible to assess these vaccines if they are available. And if they are safe and work then they should be used.” The COVAX global vaccine sharing scheme expects to deliver 35.3 million doses of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine to 36 Caribbean and Latin American states from mid-February to the end of June, the World Health Organization’s regional office said.The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said the Americas region needed to immunise about 500 million people to control the pandemic.According to a Reuters report, PAHO said WHO would complete its review in a few days of the AstraZeneca vaccine for emergency use listing (EUL).“The number of doses and delivery schedule are still subject to EUL and manufacturing production capacity,” PAHO said, adding that supply deals also had to be agreed with producers.Of the 36 nations receiving AstraZeneca’s shot, it said four countries, namely Bolivia, Colombia, El Salvador and Peru, would also receive a total of 377,910 doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine from mid-February.The GAVI alliance, the group that co-leads COVAX with WHO, said last week it aimed to deliver 2.3 billion vaccines worldwide by the end of 2021, including 1.8 billion free doses to lower-income countries.Geneva-based GAVI was expected to publish details of its allocations by country on Monday. The 36 Caribbean and Latin American nations to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine ranged from regional giants Brazil and Mexico to small islands such as Dominica and Montserrat.In the UK, the government has ordered an extra 40m doses of the Valneva Covid-19 vaccine.The move means 100m doses of Valneva have been put on order, enough for every adult in the UK, with the latest batch earmarked for delivery in 2022. The government has also retained options over a further 90m doses for supply between 2023 and 2025.Valneva said the total value of the entire order was up to €1.4bn (£1.24bn). The vaccine is still in clinical trials, with the early-stage phase 12 study expected to read out within the next three months.With the UK having secured more than 400m vaccine doses, the international trade secretary, Liz Truss, said on Sunday it is “too early” to determine when the government will send vaccines abroad.She said “we first need to make sure that our population is vaccinated” but added that it would be damaging to become a “vaccinated island” while other countries go without.“It’s a bit too early to say about how we would deploy ‘XX’ vaccine, but we certainly want to work with friends and neighbours, we want to work with developing countries because we’re only going to solve this issue once everybody in the world is vaccinated,” Truss told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday.Russia reported 17,648 new Covid-19 cases on Monday, including 2,037 in Moscow, taking its official national tally to 3,868,087. That figure was down from 18,359 the day before.Authorities also confirmed 437 deaths in the last 24 hours, pushing the official death toll to 73,619.

His is the first known exit ban imposed by China on an Irish citizen.Mr Higgins wrote to Mr Xi on December 23rd raising humanitarian concerns about the south Co Dublin man, whose family has expressed deep concerns about his deteriorating physical and mental health.According to a spokesman for Mr Higgins, the Chinese leader replied last Friday to the President’s letter suggesting “the relevant authorities on both sides may maintain communication and co-ordination to create conditions for an early and proper solution to the case”.The businessman’s wife, Tara O’Halloran, said last night she was constantly asking the Government and Irish authorities “to make more noise about Richard’s case” but there had been “no line of communication” from the Government to the family about his case.Second anniversaryFebruary 26th will mark the second anniversary of Mr O’Halloran last seeing his family.Details of the exchange between the presidents over Mr O’Halloran’s continued detention come three weeks after the father of four from Foxrock was denied entry on to a flight home from Shanghai after being told his exit ban had been lifted.Mr O’Halloran, a relative of former Fine Gael taoiseach Garret FitzGerald, was told by police during an interrogation three weeks ago that the ban had been lifted but he was escorted out of the airport by seven police officers.He travelled to China in February 2019 to try to resolve the affairs of the leasing firm. He has never been charged with any wrongdoing and has testified as a witness several times in the prosecution of Mr Min.Mr O’Halloran was asked during a recent interrogation by the Chinese authorities that he personally repatriate a $36 million (€30 million) payment to China.The Chinese authorities have demanded the return of a leased aircraft owned by the company but Mr O’Halloran’s family have said he is not permitted to do this under Irish law."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4472829.1612162592!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"crucial talks today on leaving cert and restarting classes for special needs students","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCrucial talks on the Leaving Certificate, efforts to restart classes for children with special educational needs and the likely timetable for reopening the State’s schools will go ahead this week.Ministers and senior officials will meet this afternoon for crucial talks on the Leaving Certificate, efforts to restart classes for children with special educational needs and the likely timetable for reopening the State’s schools.There was a growing expectation ahead of the Cabinet committee on education’s meeting that Leaving Cert students will be offered a choice between sitting their exams in June or being awarded calculated grades.A final decision could be made at tomorrow’s Cabinet meeting, though sources said it could also be delayed until the end of the week.There is rising optimism in Government that special education could reopen next week, though this is contingent on the agreement of trade unions.Prof Philip Nolan, head of modelling for the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet), yesterday said Ireland was moving “rapidly towards the point at which the cautious and phased reopening of education would be feasible”.Senior Government sources said they believed that if the rate of Covid-19 infections continues to fall in line with current trends, the phased reopening of schools should begin in early March. Taoiseach Micheál Martin suggested yesterday there would be a “phased return to school commencing at primary”.ConstructionMr Martin also gave some insights into the emerging plans for the reopening of society and the economy when the current lockdown ends on March 5th. He said resuming education and construction were priorities but that wider commercial life was likely to remain closed.Two senior sources said that non-essential retail was likely to remain closed for several weeks beyond March 5th, while hospitality would remain shut for longer. Both also said that as general restrictions are eased, further curbs are likely to be introduced on incoming air travel, with mandatory quarantine in hotels for all passengers looking increasingly likely.Meanwhile, the vaccination of older people in the community is expected to start from next week, beginning with those aged 85 and over. People aged over 80 should receive their first dose in mid-February, officials said, while vaccination of the over 70s is expected to begin in early March.Despite recent controversies over the supply of vaccines to Ireland and other EU countries, sources involved in the Irish rollout are confident that a substantial proportion of the population will be inoculated by the summer.VaccineEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen last night announced that AstraZeneca had agreed to supply an extra nine million doses of the vaccine in the first quarter, with Ireland to receive 100,000 doses more than expected last week. However, this is still 200,000 fewer than originally expected.There was continued criticism over the weekend of the commission’s proposed and later halted move to trigger article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol to control the movement of vaccines out of the bloc. Ireland’s European commissioner Mairead McGuinness said the commission’s move was a mistake and had caused justified anger and political fallout.About 46,000 second doses will be administered this week to frontline healthcare workers and staff and residents of long-term care facilities, the first two priority groups.Older peopleNext week, it is planned to begin giving the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine to older people through their GPs. However, the National Immunisation Advisory Committee is still finalising its recommendations on whether the vaccine should be allowed for use in over-65s.It is expected to authorise use of the vaccine for this age group, despite a lack of data so far about how effective it is in that group. Should the committee decide against authorisation for older people, they will be given the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines under a fall-back plan developed by officials.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4472384.1612107526!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no major reopening of economy likely after march 5th says taoiseach","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Micheál Martin said the priority was to reopen primary schools on a phased basis with special needs schools first. Photograph: Julien BehalThe hospitality sector will have to wait for an increased rollout of the Covid-19 vaccination programme before it can open, the Taoiseach has said.Micheál Martin said he did not “see major reopening of the economy on March 5th” – the date that Level 5 curbs are in place until – and that the Government would take a “cautious and conservative approach” to lifting restrictions.Stating that the hospitality sector’s reopening would be delayed until the inoculation programme was much further progressed, he added, “I’m not looking at the whole of hospitality – there can be different approaches”.But he said he believed “we will have a critical mass vaccinated by late summer”.“And I anticipate that as we move into quarter two and quarter three, the issue will become vaccine administration as opposed to a supply issue.”Speaking about the rollout of the vaccination programme in a wide-ranging interview on RTÉ’s This week programme, Mr Martin said, “we have to be careful about giving precision decisions” around vaccine dates because “it does depend on supply”.He said the Government had so far fulfilled the commitments they made to having nursing homes residents and staff vaccinated, bar those with Covid-19 outbreaks.They were moving to vaccinate those over 70, he said. The target date for completion of vaccination of that cohort was the end of March and Mr Martin said “we have a back-up plan” if the AstraZeneca supplies do not materialise, with other vaccines.“We’re getting increased volumes from Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna and the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine was expected in April,” he said. The Taoiseach said he was being straight with people. He could not give precise numbers given the volatility in supply. Ireland was down 300,000 doses that were expected from AstraZeneca, from 1.4 million to 1.1 million but he said “we may pick it up again”. “I do believe the rollout so far has been in line with commitments made”. He understood people’s impatience but said, “we don’t control the external environment around the manufacture of the vaccine”.He reiterated that the priority was to reopen primary schools on a phased basis with special needs schools first, and the construction sector, if virus cases get down below 1,000 daily.Mr Martin also said “there may be news this week” about options for the Leaving Certificate.The examination advisory committee had been meeting but they wanted to ensure that when an announcement is made that “all the Is are dotted and Ts crossed”.“I do get the point that Leaving Certificate students do not have classroom time – that is a very important consideration in terms of the options.”The Taoiseach said there were differing views from the wider student body but “what is clear that we do need to bring clarity and reduce stress”.He also said he did not anticipate a leadership contest within Fianna Fáil when the his term as taoiseach finishes at the end of 2022.Mr Martin also said he did not believe there would be a Border poll within the next five years and he deflected suggestions that he was softening the party’s opposition to coalition with Sinn Féin.Sinn Féin is a “party of ision” he said and wanted “to force a isive debate” in the State, adding that he was taken aback about “the degree to which they’re playing politics with Covid-19”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4472856.1612169793!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"profile the rise of aung san suu kyi","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn 2015, Aung San Suu Kyi came to power on a platform of ending civil war, drumming up foreign investment and reducing the army’s role in politics. File photograph: EPAMARTIN DIVISEK Aung San Suu Kyi (75) rode to power after a 2015 landslide election win that established Myanmar’s first civilian government in half a century.The daughter of independence hero Aung San, who was assassinated when she was two years old, Suu Kyi spent much of her youth overseas. At Oxford University, she met British academic Michael Aris, who would become her husband. They had two sons and settled in Oxford.In 1988 Suu Kyi returned to Yangon, then the capital, to care for her dying mother. There, she was swept up in student-led protests against the military, which had ruled since a 1962 coup.An eloquent public speaker, Suu Kyi was a likely candidate to lead the movement but the protests were crushed, its leaders killed and jailed, and she was soon imprisoned in her lakeside family home, where she remained until 2010 despite brief releases from house arrest.Suu Kyi made a decision to remain in Myanmar to lead a campaign for democracy. Although the military made it clear she could leave, she feared she would not be allowed to return.She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, which her elder son Alexander collected on her behalf.In August 2011, Suu Kyi had her first meeting with then president Thein Sein, a former general and head of the quasi-civilian administration, marking the start of a pragmatic period of engagement with the government of former soldiers.PowerIn 2015, she came to power on a platform of ending civil war, drumming up foreign investment and reducing the army’s role in politics. Suu Kyi also promised Western allies she would address the plight of the Rohingya Muslim people, forming an advisory commission headed by former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan. A day after Annan’s report was released in August 2017, advising sweeping changes, Rohingya militants attacked security forces in Rakhine State. The military responded with a campaign that included the torching of hundreds of villages and killings, and was described by the UN human rights high commissioner as “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing”.Suu Kyi blamed “terrorists” for an “iceberg of misinformation” about the crisis and said the military was exercising the “rule of law”. In a September 2017 address to the nation, she appeared baffled about the exodus, saying in reference to refugees: “We want to know why they are leaving.”She went to the Hague in 2019 to face charges of genocide brought against Myanmar at the International Court of Justice at the Hague. She acknowledged the possibility war crimes had been committed but framed the crackdown as a legitimate military operation against terrorists.In 2020, a survey by election watchdog the People’s Alliance for Credible Elections, found that 79 per cent of people had trust in Suu Kyi – still beloved as “the Lady” – up from 70 per cent the year before.After a November 2020 parliamentary election, official results show her ruling party, the National League of Democracy (NLD), had won enough parliamentary seats to form the next administration. The NLD said it would seek to form a government of national unity.After weeks of disputes about the election results involving the military, in the early hours of February 1st Suu Kyi, president Win Myint and other senior figures from the ruling party were detained in an early morning raid. – Reuters Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4472520.1612131978!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"astrazeneca to deliver 9m more vaccine doses to eu says von der leyen","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen in Brussels last week.

The company would expand its manufacturing capacity in Europe, she said.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said on Twitter that the additional doses “is progress and will mean more vaccines for Ireland in the next two months”.Ireland is likely to receive about 99,000 of the nine million additional doses. The State makes up about 1.1 per cent of the EU’s population of 448 million and doses are allocated in proportion to population. This is progress and will mean more vaccines for Ireland 🇮🇪 in the next two months. https:t.co1XeDDLBqks— Stephen Donnelly (@DonnellyStephen) Last week, AstraZeneca had offered to bring forward some deliveries to the EU. It had also offered eight million more doses to the European Union to try to defuse the dispute but an EU official told Reuters that was too far short of what was originally promised as AstraZeneca had committed to at least 80 million shots in the first quarter.Earlier on Sunday, the European Commission president held a videoconference with CEOs of companies manufacturing vaccines and warned of the threat of coronavirus variants.“It is crucial to prepare for the appearance of such variants,” Dr Von der Leyen said in a statement. On Sunday night, Dr Von der Leyen rejected suggestions that Europe was in a race to vaccinate its population against the coronavirus faster than other countries, saying that it was important to co-operate at this stage of the pandemic.“We want 70 per cent of the grownup population to be vaccinated by the end of the summer,” Dr Von der Leyen said in an interview Sunday with German broadcaster ZDF. She added that supplies should increase significantly in the second quarter when Johnson and Johnson and other pharmaceutical companies overcome early hurdles. A spokesman for AstraZeneca declined to comment on the additional deliveries.The European Union’s civil service is under fire over the slow pace of vaccination in the bloc, with critics pointing to faster progress being made in Britain, Israel and the United States as evidence of a planning failure in Brussels. “I think the only race we are in is with the virus and against time,” Dr Von der Leyen told German television on Sunday evening, adding that she had agreed with British prime minister Boris Johnson that factories in both regions would deliver doses to each region.– Reuters Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Politics latest news: Care home visits could start before second doses given out, says ministerCoronavirus latest news: UK secures extra 40 million doses of Valneva jab amid plans for repeat vaccinesTravel news latest: Portugal becomes latest country to ban foreign travel Myanmar coup: Suu Kyi calls for protests after military seizes power — latest updatesComment: Conservatives need a transformational plan for Northern EnglandComment: A reckoning is coming for Vladimir PutinPrivate firms with multi-million pound covid contracts should be open to public scrutiny, says information commissionerBritish troops in Mali are being commanded by a Chinese officer it emerges, as first patrol on UN mission is completedDonald Trump impeachment: when is the Senate trial and what are his chances of a comeback?Rape victims offered advisers in campaign to boost prosecutionsJonathan Aitken demands ‘root and branch reform’ of Church of England’s \u0026#39culture of secrecy\u0026#39Blair v Brown: Inside one of the fiercest feuds in politicsSelf-harm hospital admissions among teenage girls triple in a decade, NHS figures show‘Are there any planes flying towards Downing Street?’: Behind the scenes at Number 10 on 911Comment: The Union isn\u0026#39t just about keeping Scotland happyMilitary power grab deals killer blow to Myanmar\u0026#39s fledgling democracyMyanmar coup: Aung San Suu Kyi detained as military declares state of emergencyCaptain Tom Moore in hospital with CovidDonald Trump appoints new team of lawyers for impeachment trialHousebound elderly have \u0026#39slipped through cracks\u0026#39 in Covid jabs rolloutBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"europhiles have finally had eyes opened hideous reality eu","story":"Remainers were right. Brexit has indeed led to an outbreak of populism, protectionism and chauvinism. But not on the side of the Channel they expected. The EU’s behaviour over the past 72 hours has been so demented, so self-wounding, that it is hard to know where criticism should begin. Let’s start with the bare facts. Brussels is in dispute with AstraZeneca, the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company, over the late delivery of some Covid vaccines. For what it’s worth, the EU seems to have a staggeringly weak case. It published its contract with the firm but, far from being any kind of “gotcha”, that contract showed that AstraZeneca had simply promised to use its “reasonable best efforts” to fulfil the order, the same form of words it used with the UK, which also saw some late deliveries. The rights and wrongs of that dispute, though, are beside the point. The EU’s quarrel is with AstraZeneca, not with Britain.In pursuit of its quarrel, Brussels announced plans to block the export of vaccines from a completely unrelated company, the American corporation Pfizer, to Britain – vaccines which no one disputed that the UK had purchased, and on which the EU did not pretend to have any legal claim. In other words, Brussels was threatening to halt the sale of life-saving drugs to a neighbouring country, not in response to any provocation, but simply because it was cross that that country was further advanced in its vaccination programme. It gets worse. In order to deflect criticism from its hopeless record in ordering vaccines, the European Commission aimed its law expressly at Britain. Its export ban did not apply to other neighbouring states, such as Iceland, Morocco, Egypt, Syria, Ukraine or Belarus. The only country in the vicinity to be targeted was the UK.It gets worse still. To make sure that no vaccines could enter the UK, the Commission announced that it was excluding Northern Ireland from the single market arrangements which it had previously insisted were so critical to the peace process. Incredibly, it didn’t notify Britain or Ireland in advance, and its move united every party in Dublin and Belfast against it (as well, for that matter, as every party at Westminster except the SNP), eventually forcing it to back down. Still, a point was made – a point that cannot now be unmade. For four years, EU negotiators claimed that the merest possibility of a border in Ireland would risk a return to terrorism, and worked to convince the world that this was a risk that Britain was somehow prepared to run. Yet it took precisely 29 days before the EU itself announced such a border.It gets even worse than that. Annoyed at Britain’s success, European leaders started casting doubt on the efficacy of the AstraZeneca product. Engaging in the kind of nuttiness which gets people banned from social media, Emmanuel Macron claimed that the vaccine “didn’t work”. In other words, the EU is breaking every norm of civilised behaviour and threatening expropriation over a vaccine which, from sheer sour grapes, its leaders claim is ineffective.Let’s summarise. The European Commission elbowed aside its member states, which had begun their own procurement programmes, and insisted on negotiating en bloc for the 27. It moved slowly and bureaucratically, reportedly because it was holding out for vaccines produced by Continental firms. In the end, three months after Britain, it signed a contract with AstraZeneca similar to that which some of its nations had tried to sign earlier. As criticism mounted, it panicked and lashed out – smashing the principles of due process, private property and free trade in the process.Eurocrats are behaving not so much like mini-Trumps as like 1960s Nasserite dictators. They are deliberately disrupting supply at the height of a pandemic. And their petulance, shockingly, is aimed at the only pharmaceutical company in the world which is high-mindedly offering the vaccine to all comers on a not-for-profit basis. The British government, like AstraZeneca, wants to spread the inoculation programme globally, reaching countries that can’t afford their own vaccines. This is the thanks we get.For at least some British Remainers, the events of this week have served as what Western Communists used to call a “Kronstadt moment”. Kronstadt, the site of a naval mutiny against the Bolsheviks in 1921, became a shorthand for the moment when a previously loyal party member suddenly grasped the true nature of the Soviet regime. For some, it came with the 1956 Hungarian rising, for others the 1968 Prague Spring. For some, it never came at all. But it always involved a wrenching mental reset, a readiness to look again at old certainties.Consider the assertions made by the two sides in the 2016 referendum. Eurosceptics argued that the EU was slow, introverted, bureaucratic, inefficient, ready to make up the rules as it went along, a bully and a bad neighbour. Europhiles saw it as principled, internationalist, effective, generous, rules-based and committed to global trade. If we treat those two views as verifiable claims, which has just been falsified? When Remainers, including Labour and Lib Dem MPs and every expert that  could wheel out, argued last year that Britain’s refusal to join in the EU’s procurement scheme would cause needless deaths here, they undoubtedly believed it. But it is Boris Johnson’s conviction that Brexit would mean a more agile Britain that turned out to be right.More agile – and, I hope, more generous. It is a pity that, instead of quietly asking Britain to sell it some spare doses, the EU behaved so peevishly. But the UK should hold itself to a higher standard. Because of our successful procurement programme, we will end up with a vaccine surplus this year. We should use that surplus to benefit less well-stocked nations – our friends in the Commonwealth, naturally, but others, too. We might, for example, prioritise Ireland, to which every town in Britain has family connections. We might help our oldest ally, Portugal, currently experiencing a surge of infections. We should, in short, be the positive global force that the EU is failing to be.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pressure mounts von der leyen shortcomings brutally exposed","story":"Ursula von der Leyen was sitting in her converted flat next to her office in the EU\u0027s palatial HQ in Berlaymont when the phone started ringing.It was Friday evening, around 9.20pm, and on the line was the British Prime Minister.Boris Johnson was demanding to know why the EU had invoked Article 19 of the Northern Ireland Brexit protocol, effectively blocking imports of Covid vaccines through the Irish Republic to the UK.At 9.50pm - about half an hour after the call had concluded - Number 10 issued a damning account of that call, saying that the PM expressed his grave concerns about the potential impact which the steps the EU has taken today on vaccine exports could have.An hour after their call - around 10.30pm London time - Mrs Von der Leyen called back making clear to Mr Johnson that the EU would not disrupt vaccine supplies into the UK.Number 10 stressed there were no raised voices on the calls, but it was a torrid end to what had been a dreadful few days for the EU - days had seen the Commission accused of trying to bully the UK and drugs companies into giving up Britain’s share of precious vaccines.Mr Johnson and his team in London had caught wind of the Commission\u0027s plans earlier last week, but chose to adopt a low key approach, arranging for a call between Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, and his counterpart in Brussels on Wednesday.By Friday morning the talks had gone up a notch and the emerging crisis was discussed at the Prime Minister\u0027s 8.30am meeting in Number 10.Although officials had been gaming what the Commission might do and how the UK would respond the response from the Commission to invoke Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol still came as a shock.Following a meeting between Mr Johnson and his senior officials Number 10 made public the concerns in London, saying they did not expect the EU - a “friend and ally” - would do “anything to disrupt the fulfilment of these contracts.Mr Johnson decided to call Micheal Martin, the Irish Prime Minister, to discuss the Commission\u0027s actions. Again concerns about peace in Northern Ireland were raised and the PM stressed the UK’s enduring commitment to the BelfastGood Friday agreement.Mr Johnson then phoned Mrs von der Leyen.By now the warnings about threats to the Good Friday Agreement had been heard in Washington DC, where sources said the White House was urgently trying to clarify what the move would mean.In the face of such raw anger and growing international concern, Brussels backed down.Just before midnight UK time on Friday Ms Von der Leyen posted a message on Twitter saying she agreed with Mr Johnson not to add restrictions to vaccine exports.It was a week that began very differently. Brussels had been determined to force AstraZeneca to its knees. It ended, however, with the European Union humiliated.Mrs von der Leyen was facing calls to resign on Saturday, and fierce criticism in her home country of Germany.It was after all the Commission President who, having taken personal charge of the AstraZeneca issue, and was now seen to have badly botched the response to the pharmaceutical company’s failure to fulfil EU orders of jabs.By moving to impose a “vaccine border” on the island of Ireland she was seen as having trashed the bloc’s reputation worldwide and sacrificed the moral high ground the Commission had taken over the Irish border during the Brexit negotiations.Her decision to trigger Article 16 of the Brexit treaty’s Northern Irish protocol, achieved the once unimaginable feat of uniting an unimpressed Michel Barnier, Irish prime minister Micheál Martin and Boris Johnson against her.Mrs von der Leyen may have ordered a U-turn late on Friday and blamed the crisis on “an oversight”, but the damage was done.It should have been very different. Brussels had planned for the first AstraZeneca jabs to be rolled out across the bloc once the European Medicines Agency approved the vaccine on Friday.The European Commission, which negotiated the supplies on behalf of the 27 member states, would use the delivery as a symbol of the benefits of EU unity.The inconvenient fact that the EU’s vaccination roll-out was lagging far behind Brexit Britain would soon be forgotten in a flood of up to 400 million jabs enough to vaccinate about half of all EU citizens.The day couldn’t come soon enough for the EU’s heads of state and government, who had decided not to use the emergency authorisation procedures Britain used to fast-track the approval of the AstraZeneca vaccine.Commissioners in Brussels sneered that this was a safer, more responsible route than that taken by Boris Johnson.Many EU governments had chosen not to buy doses of rival vaccines, preferring to wait for the cheaper and easier to store jab from the British-Swedish company.The slower pace was, however, exacting a political price on the bloc’s national leaders.Polls in France showed Marine Le Pen trailing Emmanuel Macron by just 48 to 52 in second round voting intentions for next year’s presidential elections.While the UK has distributed 11.86 jab doses per 100 people, France, where anti-vax beliefs have taken root, has only managed 2.08.European newspapers were reporting that Mr Johnson’s vaccine gamble had paid off, which they said was a source of great frustration to the French.Perhaps that is what motivated Mr Macron to trash the AstraZeneca vaccine, saying it was almost ineffective for those over 65, and some say over 60.The cynical ploy came on Friday, the same day that the European Medicines Authority approved the vaccine for all ages, despite an earlier decision by German regulators to restrict it to the over 65s.The German government was also facing questions about why it was lagging so far behind the UK, US and Israel.The strain was showing elsewhere in Europe as well. The normally docile Dutch erupted into days of rioting, their worst in 40 years.The Italian government was tearing itself apart over the handling of the second coronavirus wave. On Tuesday, Italy’s prime minister Giuseppe Conte resigned as his coalition government collapsed.The pressure was on the European Commission to deliver, which explains the furious reaction after AstraZeneca broke the news that there would be a shortfall in the supply.The company would only be able to deliver a quarter of the jabs promised in the first quarter of the year, it said. There would be about 75 million vaccines missing because of production problems at its Belgian plant.Mrs von der Leyen was determined that the member states would not point the finger of blame for the delays at her commission and so the decision was made to launch a full frontal, and unprecedented, attack on AstraZeneca.Suspicions grew in Brussels that AstraZeneca may have sold reserved EU vaccine stock to countries such as Britain, which they claimed had paid a higher price for the jab.Despite the fact that AstraZeneca was providing the vaccine at cost price, the story was given legs by the Brussels spin machine. Their message was clear this was not our fault.Diplomats from the EU’s capitals in the Belgian capital began circulating news stories from last year, when the UK signed a deal with AstraZeneca first.AstraZeneca had imported millions of vaccines from its EU plants to compensate for a delay in production of UK supplies of the jab. Perhaps these were jabs meant for the bloc, the anonymous briefers suggested.The commission, which prides itself on its legal expertise and respect for the rule of law,  turned the screws on AstraZeneca, accusing it of breaching its contract with Brussels.Mrs von der Leyen gave Pascal Soriot, the CEO of AstraZeneca, a dressing down in a morning phone call. It was the first of three grillings for the boss, who was summoned to further two video conference meetings with the EU and national officials later that day.Then Stella Kyriakides, the European commissioner for health and food safety, dropped a bombshell. Brussels would introduce an “export transparency mechanism” by the end of the week, Ms Kyriakides said.  Cyprus’s EU commissioner said that manufacturers in the EU would have to ask Brussels for permission before exporting vaccines out of the bloc.The threat of an EU export ban was clear. Britain, less than a month out of the Brexit transition period and expecting almost 3.5 million vaccines from Pfizer’s Belgian plant, was in the firing line.It was the first of many signals that, as far as the commission was concerned, British public opinion of Brussels simply no longer mattered.On Tuesday, AstraZeneca’s CEO hit back. There was no contractual obligation to supply the vaccines beyond an obligation on the company to make “best reasonable efforts” to provide it, he said.The company’s two production plants in Britain could help with the EU supply but, under the terms of the supply contract with the UK, only after a British order of 100 million jabs had been supplied.An infuriated Brussels hit back hard on Wednesday. It demanded that AstraZeneca ert supplies of millions of UK-manufactured vaccines to the bloc and accused Mr Soriot of breaching confidentiality by revealing details of the contract.Ms Kyriakides said the firm had contractual, societal and moral obligations to use all its facilities to make up the shortfall, and that there was no hierarchy of factories.MEPs began to talk of a vaccine trade war unless the pharma company caved to the demands. Meanwhile Mr Johnson was looking like the only adult in the room.On Thursday, Belgian authorities, acting on a European Commission request, raided AstraZeneca’s plant in the French-speaking region in Wallonia.The reason was to see if the company’s explanation of production problems was genuine but another motivation was to keep the pressure on the company.Having secured AstraZeneca’s permission to release a redacted version of its contract with the EU, Mrs von der Leyen had a salvo planned for Friday.After the contract was released, the commission pointed to clauses it claimed supported its arguments.In one, AstraZeneca appeared to confirm that no other agreement would interfere with its supplies. Another clause said that, for the purposes of the deal, the two UK factories should be considered part of the EU.But eyebrows were raised as Mrs von der Leyen had, that very day, said there were no “best endeavours” clauses in the contract. The published deal, which in another sign the wheels were coming off, was accidentally released unredacted. It had those clauses.She either told an intentional lie to 447 million people or she didn\u0027t know what was in her own contract, Germany’s Bild Zeitung said on Saturday.As EU officials demanded Britain publish its contract with the pharma company, there was growing disquiet among some member states the commission was going too far.But despite the warnings of her own trade experts over the triggering of Article 16, Mrs von der Leyen was set on imposing the hard vaccine border on the island of Ireland.Among the voices arguing against the move was Sabine Weyand, the EU’s top official on trade and former deputy Brexit negotiator. She was the woman who designed the Irish border backstop during the Brexit talks, which was ultimately ditched in favour of a regulatory and customs border in the Irish Sea.In an astonishing gaffe, Mrs von der Leyen only informed Ireland she was triggering one of the most sensitive clauses in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement after the announcement.She also did not give notice to Britain about the move, which was meant to prevent Northern Ireland becoming a backdoor entry of vaccine supplies to the UK.Considering that the European Commission had spent the previous four years preaching the importance of open borders and peace on the island of Ireland, as well as criticising any suggestion from Britain of using the clause, it was an astonishing move.It wasn’t long before both the Irish and British prime ministers were on the phone to Mrs von der Leyen, both urging a change of tack.So it was that at 11.45pm local time, about eight hours after the announcement, a statement was released saying that Article 16 , the so-called safeguard clause, would not be triggered after all.What Mrs von der Leyen planned as a show of strength and a reassertion of control had demonstrated anything but.The European press was unforgiving, describing it as the “Brexit own goal” and potentially Mrs von der Leyen’s greatest failure.As one EU diplomat told the : “The pressure on von der Leyen is huge and increasing. This is not a good look.”The question for Britain this weekend is how will Mr Johnson use the moral high ground he has gained in the row over vaccine supplies, perhaps to improve Brexit relations with Brussels?One Government source said: There is a window of opportunity and we want to work together, we want things to get better.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britain needs astrazenecas thrive future","story":"Almost seven years ago, Pfizer launched its bid to take over AstraZeneca, Britain’s second biggest pharmaceutical company. After a tense stand-off, and no little controversy, the AstraZeneca board stood firm, Pfizer opted not to “go hostile” by taking its bid to shareholders, and the company remained independent and based in Britain.Yet things could have turned out very differently. Pfizer might have made a direct offer to AstraZeneca shareholders. Or the AstraZeneca board might have accepted the bid: they told Pfizer they would have negotiated had the offer been higher. Had a sale been agreed, George Osborne, then Chancellor, would not have intervened. It was, he said, simply a commercial matter. Without AstraZeneca, Britain might not have had a reliable supply of home-produced Covid vaccines.We cannot know for sure. But we do know that Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, intervened to make sure Oxford University did not partner with Merck, a US pharmaceutical, and teamed up with AstraZeneca instead. We know that the European Union has introduced export controls on vaccines manufactured within its borders. And we know that Canada – a country with advance orders of vaccines but no production capacity of its own – has been exposed to delays in production in European factories, and the risk that it will be caught up in EU export controls.The security of supply made possible by Oxford University’s collaboration with a British company, together with the arbitrary and erratic decisions made by the European Union over the last week, has led many Conservative MPs to a policy position they would have resisted in the days before the pandemic. There is such thing as a strategically important industry, they now accept, and such thing as a strategically important company. In other words, not everything can be left to the market: industrial strategy and takeover laws will need to change to make Britain more resilient.This is just one example of how Covid is likely to transform our politics radically. For the pandemic has diagnosed many problems with how we were governed before the virus reached our shores. It has exposed the truth that many of the things we believed and were told were unavoidable, inevitable and natural – just the way things are – were no such thing at all.Take our immediate response to the pandemic. It is often said that it is unfair to judge the quality of Britain’s response to the virus with hindsight. But Covid was not a bolt from the blue. While Asian countries had learned from outbreaks of novel coronaviruses, like SARS and MERS, the West did not. Even as Asian countries started to get to grips with Covid, Britain and other Western countries failed to follow them.In part, this is because the ideological, liberal assumptions of our politicians and officials prevented them from considering the full array of choices at their disposal. As the virus first raged in China, the idea of closing our borders was simply unthinkable to them. Even later, as other countries closed their borders, Britain’s airports were full of people arriving from virus hotspots, like Italy and Spain.More recently, ministers took weeks to restrict travel from regions affected by new strains of the virus, and even then the restrictions were limited in scope. Other measures taken by Asian countries were dismissed as too intrusive for us. It took Britain until last week – more than a year after the virus emerged – to introduce quarantine hotels for new arrivals here. Even now, the rules apply only for travellers from particular countries, and the policy has not yet been put into operational effect.Similarly, despite a willingness to spend £22 billion on Britain’s test-and-trace scheme, there was no willingness to seek access to the kind of personal information, like credit card records and GPS location data, that made the equivalent scheme successful in South Korea. Neither were lawmakers willing to enforce rules on social distancing and wearing masks in high-risk places like supermarkets and public transport.Such shortcomings were not just a question of queasiness over taking emergency decisions. The pandemic exposed the lack of capacity and weakness of the British state. Central government lacked the expertise and logistical capabilities to foresee and fix several important problems, like the procurement of protective equipment for health workers and the wider population.Local government – which could have played an important role in test-and-trace, for example – was neither trusted enough nor powerful enough to perform key tasks. Devolution to Scotland and Wales, and even to the metro mayors, was exposed as haphazard and poorly constructed. And poor state capacity was matched by limited capacity in our domestic economy.The decline of British manufacturing, we had been told for years, did not matter, because our future depended on our success as a services economy. But our struggles with procuring protective equipment, getting testing up and running, and even the early obstacles to vaccine production, were all connected to this lack of capacity at home and a competition for scarce resources internationally. As we now, slowly but surely, begin to turn the corner, Britain’s Covid successes give an indication of how we might do things better in future.Britain was at the forefront of genome sequencing Covid and discovering ways of treating Covid patients. We now run more tests per head than almost any other developed country, and we are racing ahead of Europe with our vaccination programme. Almost nine million Brits have now received one dose of a Covid vaccine, and almost 600,000 received a dose on Saturday alone. Just as our failures can be explained in part by an unbalanced economy, an enfeebled state, and assumptions about the limits of state intervention in an emergency, our successes have occurred where the state has worked strategically, in partnership, with scientific institutions and the private sector.It is this model – a strategic state, seeking to achieve a rebalanced economy, investing in science and working in partnership with the private sector – that can put right our past failures and put our country back onto a path to security and prosperity.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britain poised become pacific player","story":"Tomorrow, I will be presenting our formal letter of application to New Zealand and Japan to join them in one of the world’s largest trading areas: the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. Global Britain is not resting on its laurels after a year as an independent trading nation – we are picking up speed.We are stepping up as G7 President this year to rally an alliance of like-minded democracies in the fight for free and fair trade. We are speaking up at the World Trade Organisation for global rules fit for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century. And we have a great deal with the EU, alongside agreements covering 63 countries.Our trade policy is about the future, but also the here and now. We are now moving decisively towards joining the dynamic CPTPP trading area. I will be pushing on negotiations to secure opportunities for British businesses in the vibrant markets of its 11 members: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, Japan, Peru, New Zealand, Singapore and Vietnam.Turbo-charging trade with these economies, which cover nearly £9  trillion of world GDP, will be key to fuelling our economic recovery by supporting jobs and growth for our key industries in every region and nation of the United Kingdom.This high-standards pact removes tariffs on 95 per cent of goods traded between members, provides deeper market access for services – of which we are the second largest global exporter, and cutting-edge rules for digital trade. That will play to our strengths as a world-leading services and technology hub, with fantastic food and drink and advanced manufacturing industries.We will be able to sell more to growing Pacific markets full of consumers craving the best of Britain, whether it’s an Aston Martin classic car, a dram of Bell’s Scotch Whisky, or an innovative service like Deliveroo.This means businesses will have more money to invest in their staff and commercial future. The benefits will be felt across the country, from the Dundee game developers behind Minecraft to the Solihull carmakers building Land Rovers.We will be able to enjoy the full benefits of CPTPP without having to compromise on our sovereignty, our borders or handing over cash to join. This club is all about free trade, and nothing else.We are only able to seize this golden opportunity as an independent trading nation. No longer constrained by the EU, a newly nimble Global Britain is free to go further and faster.The UK is already the first Western nation to start vaccinating people against Covid-19. We are the first new country to apply to join CPTPP since it was set up in 2018. Countries such as South Korea, Thailand and Colombia are queuing up to join.We can be proud that Global Britain is at the front of the queue. It is testament to our preparedness for the negotiations and our close relationships abroad. I have already held discussions with all 11 members – a first for any aspiring member – which shows how seriously they are taking our candidacy.We will negotiate firmly but fairly in the interests of the British people. Our red lines are well-known: the NHS remains off the table, as do our world-class standards – from food and animal welfare to the environment and data protection.Together with like-minded allies, we can take on unfair practices such as forced labour and forced technology transfer, which give free trade a bad name. In doing so, we will demonstrate how much better things should be.Trade is not just an economic boon, but an insurance policy against future shocks. As we have learnt from the Covid crisis, erse supply chains are vital. We must always have friends to supply vital goods, whether food or PPE.CPTPP is an exciting club of sovereign nations, and I believe more will want to join. By positioning Global Britain as the first new entrant, we are helping shape the rules and will reap future rewards.We are out in the world once again championing free and fair trade, driven by our fierce belief that this is the best way forward. This is Global Britain in action. Joining CPTPP will help build a better trading system for us all.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dogs womans best friend new study reveals","story":"While kings, poets and philosophers have repeated the adage ‘dog is a man’s best friend’ a new study argues that it was women who first created the bond between canines and humans thousands of years ago.In one of the first anthropological studies of its kind, researchers at Washington State University revealed that dogs’ relationships with women “might have had a greater impact on the dog-human bond than relationships with men”.  Men may have wanted dogs for hunting or herding livestock but it was women who gave them names and treated them with affection in the way humans do today, they said. “Humans were more likely to regard dogs as a type of person if the dogs had a special relationship with women, the study in the Journal of Ethnobiology found.  Although dogs are one of the oldest and most widespread domesticated animals, very few anthropological studies have directly focused on the human relationship with canines. Anthropologists at the university examined earlier studies on 144 ancient communities from all over the world where there was evidence of dogs being kept. Researchers found thousands of mentions of dogs in the ethnographic documents inside the Human Relations Area files database. In the earliest human settlements where dogs were associated with women, they were given names, allowed to sleep indoors with people and mourned when they died. This bond also allowed the dogs to be more easily trained and thus their \u0027usefulness\u0027 to humans also increased as they were used more for hunting. Conversely, when food production increased, due to advances in crop growing and herding of livestock, the ‘utility’ of the dogs diminished. Jaime Chambers, lead author of the study and PHD student at the university said: “Humans were more likely to regard dogs as a type of person if the dogs had a special relationship with women.“They were more likely to be included in family life, treated as subjects of affection and generally, people had greater regard for them.“We found that dogs’ relationships with women might have had a greater impact on the dog-human bond than relationships with men.” The team also discovered that the warmer the climate the less useful dogs tended to be to humans. Robert Quinlan, a professor of anthropology and co-author of the paper said: “Relative to humans, dogs are really not particularly energy efficient.  “Their body temperature is higher than humans, and just a bit of exercise can make them overheat on a hot day. We saw this trend that they had less utility to humans in warmer environments.” Although there were some exceptions to this with a few dog-loving cultures in the tropics, it was a fairly consistent trend, he added. The findings of the study adds evidence to the evolutionary theory that dogs and humans chose each other, rather than the older theory that humans intentionally sought out wolf pups to raise on their own.  Ms Chambers said: “Dogs are everywhere humans are.  “If we think that dogs are successful as a species if there are lots of them, then they have been able to thrive. They have hitched themselves to us and followed us all over the world. It’s been a very successful relationship.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive manly fingers point way masculine food choices hungry","story":"When you are looking at a menu, torn between ordering healthily or unhealthily, you would be forgiven for thinking your rumbling stomach might decide for you.But it turns out the answer lies in your hands, because hungry people with manly fingers make more masculine food choices, such as a hamburger and chips, rather than choosing a Caesar salad, a study has found.People who have a ring and index finger similar in length – a biomarker of masculinity – are more likely to reach for stodgy and meaty foods when their stomach is rumbling, according to scientists from Scandinavia. Those with a longer index finger are more likely to crave feminine foods such as fish and salads, the research showed.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that a biomarker linked to prenatal testosterone exposure – ie the digit ratio – interacts with consumers\u0027 hunger levels to affect their preference patterns and choice behavior towards food options with a more masculine gender image, the study says.These findings expand the knowledge on when and how prenatal exposure to sex hormones may affect consumers\u0027 food preferences.Although those with a low digit ratio were men most of the time, there were some exceptions – meaning women can also make masculine food choices under the right conditions and vice-versa.Researchers measured the index and ring finger length of 216 Chinese people, half of whom were female. Each person was assigned a ratio figure that captured how different those two fingers were in length. Those with less difference in length between the two fingers were categorised as more masculine, as a low digit ratio is associated with exposure to higher levels of testosterone in the womb.Participants were asked to rate their hunger level and then asked to select from foods deemed masculine and feminine. The masculine foods included a fillet of beef, regular Coke, hamburger with chips, hard liquor and lobster. Feminine foods included fillet of fish, Diet Coke, Caesar salad, white wine and shrimps.The researchers suggest adverts promoting masculine food products on television may be more likely to persuade a shopper to buy them if the person has a masculine digit ratio and is feeling hungry at the time, with their findings published in the journal Food Quality and Preference.Differences in finger length have been repeatedly linked to a range of human traits, from aggression to musical ability to sexual orientation.An Oxford University study previously found that women with a longer index finger and shorter ring finger tend to be more attractive to men, making them more likely to have an affair. Men with longer ring fingers than index fingers have been found to be better sportsmen.Those with an index and ring finger the same length are more likely to be heterosexual, while when the lengths differ the person is more likely to be gay.Those with similar length of index and ring finger have also been found to display behaviour traditionally considered more masculine, such as aggression, dominance, competitiveness and risk-taking. Those with a bigger difference in length are more likely to exhibit feminine traits such as co-operativeness and passivity.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"housebound elderly have slipped cracks covid jabs rollout","story":"Elderly housebound patients have slipped through the cracks of the coronavirus vaccination rollout, experts have warned – in stark contrast to the huge success of the Government\u0027s Covid jab delivery to care homes.On Sunday night, homecare providers urged Downing Street to introduce mobile vaccination units to drive from home to home, delivering jabs to elderly and vulnerable people too frail to attend a vaccination centre.The warning came as care homes praised ministers for their success in ensuring that vaccinations had reached their residents.The rollout of Covid vaccines is in stark contrast to the catastrophic death toll in March and April, when the virus took a grip in many care homes. In total it is estimated that more than 30,000 care home residents in the UK have died of Covid during the pandemic – around a third of all fatalities.Concern over the treatment of homecare patients will ring new alarm bells. Dr Ben Maruthappu, the chief executive of Cera, which provides care to about 100,000 vulnerable older people in their homes, said he estimated only around 100 of his clients had so far received jabs. About 55 per cent are over 80, with the remainder in their 60s and 70s and in the most vulnerable group of elderly adults.In all, about one million people are thought to be home care patients, suggesting many hundreds of thousands remain unprotected.Dr Maruthappu said: It\u0027s great that the majority of people in care homes have been vaccinated, but elderly housebound people, stuck in their own homes, are at present not being vaccinated as quickly and effectively as those in care homes. Unfortunately, these people are slipping through the cracks. We look after 10,000 people but only about one per cent – no more than about 100 people – have been vaccinated. Dr Maruthappu said other countries had organised house-to-house mobile vaccination units, adding: We need to do the same. One care home owner who has still to lose a resident to Covid said that, although the battle was being won, he would not celebrate until the war against the pandemic is over. We are so close to the end, said Dr Kevin O\u0027Sullivan, the owner of the Peregrine House care home in Whitby, North Yorkshire. I invoke Armistice Day where, in the six to eight hours between the armistice agreement being signed and enforced, something like 3,000 people lost their lives. I don\u0027t want any of our residents to be in that group.Yesterday marked 21 days since the residents were all vaccinated. We have still not had any outbreaks. A doctor and a nurse visited and administered all the jabs to residents in just under three hours. It has gone incredibly smoothly. We were very pleased. None of his 36 residents, the oldest of whom is 103, has died from Covid in either the first or second waves. However, despite the vaccine rollout Dr O\u0027Sullivan will not lift any of the tight rules in place and visits from loved ones will remain banned in a bid to risk any further infections spreading. The vaccines minister, Nadhim Zahawi, described the inoculation programme as a race against deaths as GPs scrambled to deliver jabs to care home residents. Despite the Government meeting its target to vaccinate the priority group, still more care home residents are continuing to fall victim to the virus. Last week, Pemberley House, a care home in Basingstoke, Hampshire, announced that 22 residents had died of Covid in January. David Crabtree, who manages Crabtree Care Homes, with premises in Bradford and Keighley, West Yorkshire, lost 16 residents to Covid during the first wave of the pandemic. Last weekend, all his residents were vaccinated, and currently 98 per cent of his staff have had their first jab. However, he said he had noticed a slight spike in outbreaks in care homes since the vaccine rollout, adding: If, after everyone\u0027s had two vaccines and we\u0027re still spiking in care homes, something\u0027s wrong, because you can still catch it and transmit it after you\u0027ve had both injections.We still need to be conscious of wearing PPE, and the social distancing precautions which will have to be in place for the foreseeable future.  Meanwhile, care homes have praised the efforts of frontline workers who have pulled off a mammoth task in rolling out the vaccine to residents and said it was a magnificent landmark.Nadra Ahmed, who chairs the National Care Association, said: Although there have been bumps in the road, to use the Prime Minister\u0027s words, I think the fact that the care sector and the NHS have managed to get this done is absolutely phenomenal.She added that there may be a small number of care home residents who have not yet received the jab because a home was enduring another outbreak, meaning it was unsafe for GPs to enter. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"myanmar leader aung san suu kyi detained raid","story":"A military coup took place in Myanmar early on Monday as the country\u0027s leader Aung San Suu Kyi was detained in an early morning raid.The army said it had carried out the detentions in response to election fraud, handing power to military chief Min Aung Hlaing and imposing a state of emergency for one year, according to a statement on a military-owned television station. The announcement on military-owned Myawaddy TV followed days of concern about the threat of a military coup and comes as the country\u0027s new Parliament session was to begin.Myo Nyunt, spokesman for the ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) party, told Reuters by phone that Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and other leaders had been taken in the early hours of the morning.Adding that he also expected to be detained, he said: I want to tell our people not to respond rashly and I want them to act according to the law.”He told AFP that  he was extremely worried about the pair. With the situation we see happening now, we have to assume that the military is staging a coup, he said.The Irrawaddy, an established online news service, said that the party\u0027s Central Executive Committee members, lawmakers and regional Cabinet members had also been taken into custody.Soldiers took up positions at city hall in Yangon and mobile internet data and phone services in the NLD stronghold were disrupted, residents said. Internet connectivity also had fallen dramatically, monitoring service NetBlocks said.State-run MRTV television said in a Facebook post that it was unable to broadcast due to technical issues.The NLD said Suu Kyi was calling on the public not to accept the coup by the military and urged them to protest.The actions of the military are actions to put the country back under a dictatorship, the NLD said in a statement which carried leader Suu Kyi\u0027s name.I urge people not to accept this, to respond and wholeheartedly to protest against the coup by the military.The US, Australia and others were concerned by the reports and urged Myanmar\u0027s military to respect the rule of law.The United States is alarmed by reports that the Burmese military has taken steps to undermine the country\u0027s democratic transition, including the arrest of State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi and other civilian officials in Burma, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said in a statement from Washington.She said President Joe Biden had been briefed on the reported developments.The United States opposes any attempt to alter the outcome of recent elections or impede Myanmar\u0027s democratic transition, and will take action against those responsible if these steps are not reversed, the statement said. Burma is the former name of Myanmar.Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne called for the release of Suu Kyi and others reported to be detained. We strongly support the peaceful reconvening of the National Assembly, consistent with the results of the November 2020 general election, she said.Japan said it was watching the situation and currently had no plans to repatriate Japanese nationals from Myanmar.Tension had been rising between the civilian government and the military in Myanmar, with the army describing the recent election as fraudulent.In November Ms Suu Kyi ‘s party offered to form a government of national unity after winning an overall majority in the election.She had approached 39 ethnic minority parties to work with the NLD, which had trounced the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), which was backed by the military.According to international observers the vote had gone smoothly without any major irregularities, although this was disputed by the opposition. But polls in some parts of the country were cancelled for “security reasons”, leaving an estimated 1.5 million voters disenfranchised – including hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims.Tension had also been reported in Rakhine state in the west of the country, where clashes between the Rakhine militant group, the Arakan Army and the military is estimated to have displaced  around 200,000 peopleThe party’s win represented a vindication for Ms Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Laureate, who had endured a turbulent first term having restored democracy in a country which had been under military rule for nearly five decades.The party’s spokesman at the time described the win as a “landslide” which had shown the Myanmar people still had faith in Ms Suu Kyi’s leadership.After years under house arrest, Ms Suu Kyi’s release and electoral victory was hailed by human rights groups as bringing an end the military’s grip on the country.She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, while still under house arrest.Ma Suu Kyi was hailed as an outstanding example of the power of the powerless.However her international reputation was severely dented by the country’s treatment of the Rohingya Muslims.It saw the country accused of genocide, an accusation which has been strongly denied by Myanmar.Daniel Russel, the top US diplomat for East Asia under President Barack Obama, who fostered close ties with Suu Kyi, said another military takeover in Myanmar would be a severe blow to democracy in the region.If true, this is a huge setback - not only for democracy in Myanmar, but for U.S. interests. It’s yet another reminder that the extended absence of credible and steady U.S. engagement in the region has emboldened anti-democratic forces, he said.Murray Hiebert, a Southeast Asia expert at Washington’s Centre for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said the situation was a challenge for the new US administration.The US as recently as Friday had joined other nations in urging the military not to move forward on its coup threats. China will stand by Myanmar like it did when the military kicked out the Rohingya,” he said.John Sifton, Asia advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, said Myanmar\u0027s military had never submitted to civilian rule and called on the United States and other countries to impose strict and directed economic sanctions on the military leadership and its economic interests.As the news broke, Avinash Paliwal, associate professor in International Relations at SOAS tweeted: “One step side-ways, two steps back.“These last 48-hrs have altered Myanmar’s political trajectory —it was never liberal democratic, even if elections took place— again. And I think this might the be end of Suu Kyi’s pol. journey (hopefully not life).”​More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"public should told consider face masks outdoor spaces scientists","story":"The public should be told to consider wearing face coverings in outdoor spaces such as crowded parks, markets and playgrounds, Government scientists have said. Ministers have been urged to draw up stronger messages on the wearing of face coverings in outdoor areas where people are close together and communal areas in workplaces.Papers released by the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) reveal that it is working with the Government on communication strategies about the risks of outdoor transmission.The documents, drawn up by a sub-committeees and endorsed by Sage, says public advice should be strengthened so rules are applied more consistently and effectively to slow the spread of the Kent Covid variant. Consideration should be given to using face coverings in a wider range of settings where people could be asymptomatic and may be in close proximity (less than two metres). This may include outdoor spaces where it is difficult to maintain distance and people may be close together for extended periods, it says. The paper, from Sage\u0027s Environmental Modelling Group says risks are particularly high in semi-enclosed spaces such as transport shelters and street market stalls. But it suggests face coverings may be recommended for any outdoor spaces which are crowded or in which it it difficult to maintain social distance.Drawn up on January 13 and endorsed by Sage the next day, it says face coverings should also be considered in corridors and communal areas of workplaces to prevent the spread of the Kent variant, which may be up to 70 per cent more infectious. It also says workplaces that cannot fully enforce social distancing should consider other strategies to protect workers, such as bubbling groups together, offering regular testing and providing more support to workers to ensure they isolate. It adds that the benefit of face coverings in blocking transmission is difficult to quantify, with estimates ranging from seven to 45 per cent. Studies have found it difficult to distinguish between the effect of face coverings compared to other interventions used at the same time, such as the introduction of social distancing measures.  Current guidance does not say people need to wear face coverings outdoors. Earlier this month, Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, said people should think about wearing face coverings in situations where they had to huddle together even if outdoors.If people, for example, are crowded together in a queue outdoors, if they\u0027re really huddled together round a market stall or something, that is a risk with this virus and in that situation there might be some logic to people thinking about wearing masks, he said. Asked whether people should wear masks in all outdoor settings, he said the most important thing was that people stayed home unless their journey was essential. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rusty pilots admit making mistakes lack flying time","story":"Airline pilots are making mistakes because they have become rusty because of the lack of flying time during the coronavirus pandemic.Dozens of pilots have told NASA’s Aviation Safety Reporting System that they have made errors since getting back into the cockpit.On one occasion a pilot forgot to disengage the parking brake when pulling away from the gate.Another pilot struggled to land a plane in heavy wind, only succeeding in doing so at the third attempt.Other incidents included a first officer forgetting to turn on the de-icing system, which ensures that the altitude and speed sensors operate properly.The coronavirus pandemic has wrought havoc on the aviation industry with thousands of flights being grounded as demand for air travel slumped.Also, the Boeing 737 Max, which was grounded in March 2019 after two crashes, only returned to the skies last month.According to the aviation analytics company Cirium, nearly a third of the world’s passenger jets have been parked either in central Australia or the Mojave Desert in California.It has seen pilots being laid off as airlines try to weather the financial storm.

I started pressing him to rest but his workload was increasing again, with the Prime Minister keen to launch new thinking on how the government could help the lives of the poorest and saying that, if he managed to negotiate a new settlement for Britain in the run-up to the European Council in mid-February 2016, he would call the in-out referendum that he’d promised in his manifesto. In anticipation, one Remain and two Leave campaign teams had already been set up, with Vote Leave activists disrupting the Prime Minister’s speech to the CBI in November.Within days it became clear how ferocious this throw of the constitutional dice was going to be. Michael Gove, the Prime Minister’s hitherto ally and friend, had declared his intention to campaign against the government even before the Prime Minister arrived back from Brussels. More unexpected was Boris Johnson’s decision to join Michael, since Boris’s position on the referendum had until then been unclear. In total, five Cabinet ministers and over a hundred Tory MPs decided to campaign for Britain to leave the European UnionI got home that evening to find Jeremy already immersed in practicalities. “We have a massive amount to do. For a start, we need to get ready to negotiate agreements with every trading bloc in the world. And the pound has plummeted, so we need to find a way to reassure the markets. But do you know what the most difficult issue is?’The Brexit negotiating challenge became even tougher after the Prime Minister’s next speech, which she gave in the gold-leaf-embossed long gallery in Lancaster House in mid-January 2017. This time, she added another red line – there should be no new barriers within the United Kingdom.The political rationale for this new pledge was clear. A hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would jeopardise the Good Friday Agreement, which had allowed the previously heavily guarded military checkpoints between them to be removed. Many members of the Conservative Party were shocked by May’s decision – including her Cabinet, which was only told on the morning of her announcement. But, since the Conservatives were twenty points ahead in the polls, there seemed little doubt about the outcome...The 10 pm exit poll changed all that – suggesting instead that the Conservatives had lost their majority. After watching some of the media commentary, Jeremy texted Jeremy Corbyn’s office in case they needed to talk later and then went to bed to try to get some sleep.On the same day, after completing his third and final round of immunotherapy, Jeremy had another scan. It had been a difficult week, he told me. He’d spent hours on the phone after the DUP had rejected the original version of the backstop, which had only included Northern Ireland. It had taken days of negotiation before they’d found an acceptable compromise – broadening it to include the whole of the UK – though the DUP still didn’t like it.On 22 March, the other member states broadly endorsed the Prime Minister’s thinking and confirmed that the next stage of the negotiations could begin. The following day, Jeremy put out his quarterly blog to the Civil Service. ‘There are few, if any, peace-time precedents for the scale and complexity of the constitutional and organisational challenge of withdrawing from the EU,’ he wrote.He looked at me, his eyes puffy. ‘No. Not now. But I worry about where we’re going. We have a referendum result and we have what our elected MPs want. And, in the gap between the two, our democracy is ripping itself apart.Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, had used an informal summit of heads of state in Salzburg to attack the Chequers plan.*Witney was Cameron’s constituency in Oxfordshire.Jeremy told himself to stay calm, a message he knew he would soon be repeating to his colleagues.

It encourages ministers to consider options to increase learning time once the pandemic is under control, including allowing students to repeat a whole school year, lengthening the school day, or extending the academic year.By the February half-term, children across the UK will have missed more than half a year of face-to-face learning, which is more than five per cent of their schooling. Pupils will have lost out on two-thirds of regular in-person teaching if they do not return to classrooms until after Easter.The report highlights the difficulties and inequalities in accessing high-quality remote learning, citing a Dutch study which found that little educational progress was made by pupils learning remotely when schools shut for eight weeks last spring, with the negative effects 50 per cent worse for disadvantaged children.Boris Johnson last week announced that classrooms will not reopen until March 8 at the earliest, but unveiled £300 million of extra cash on top of a previous £1 billion package, to help fund tutoring and summer schools. He told MPs the Government would work with teachers to develop a long-term plan to ensure pupils had the chance to make up their learning over the course of this Parliament.The IFS report bases its headline calculation about lost earnings – which it describes as an illustration rather than a precise estimate – on a 10-year global review of the returns to investment in education.The review found that a year of schooling increases iniduals\u0027 earnings in advanced and high-income countries by an average of eight per cent annually for the rest of their lives. If children have missed out on half a year of regular schooling, they could therefore lose half of this forecast eight per cent, meaning the lifetime costs of this could be very large indeed, the report says.It adds: Imagine someone earning £1 million over their working life (not far off the likely average in the UK). For this person, losing half a year of schooling will mean losing £40,000 in income over their lifetime.While that works out at an astronomical £350 billion collectively, the paper says that even if society manages to mitigate three-quarters of the long-term effects of learning loss the total would still be nearly £90 billion.Luke Sibieta, an IFS research fellow and author of the report, said: Even if there are only relatively tiny losses over the course of each inidual\u0027s lifetime, once you multiply any small loss of earnings by nine million pupils you get a huge loss very quickly.Without sufficient catch-up help, children will leave school with less knowledge and fewer skills that can be applied to a job, as well as reduced ability to gain further skills. A slower rate of technological progress and innovation could result, the report warns, adding: Without significant remedial action, lost learning will translate into reduced productivity, lower incomes, lower tax revenues, higher inequality and potentially expensive social ills. The necessary responses are likely to be complex, hard and expensive.Kate Green, Labour\u0027s shadow education secretary, said: It is clear that the Government\u0027s response is simply not up to the scale of the challenge. She urged ministers to urgently ensure every child has the equipment needed to learn from home.A Government spokesman said: We will invest a further £300 million in tutoring programmes, building on the existing £1 billion Covid Catch Up Fund, but the Prime Minister was clear last week that extended schools closures have had a huge impact on pupils learning, which will take more than a year to make up.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"reckoning coming vladimir putin","story":"Even in the depths of a Russian winter and under pain of a beating from the police or years in jail, thousands of protesters took to the streets yesterday in the biggest series of demonstrations seen in the post-Soviet era. Ostensibly, they were demanding the release of Alexei Navalny, the opposition politician who returned to Moscow after recovering in Germany from an attempt to kill him with a nerve agent.His courage in risking imprisonment or even assassination by going back has helped galvanise a growing hostility to Vladimir Putin, whose 20-year grip on power is facing its biggest challenge. The Russian president has seen off similar protests in the past because they were largely limited to activists in the major cities. He has relied on the support of the vast bulk of the populace, using military adventurism to stoke nationalist fervour, such as the annexation of Crimea.But in the midst of a pandemic that has thrown world economic growth into reverse, Russia is suffering more than most. Sanctions have caused foreign investment to dry up apart from in the energy sector and there is not much domestic investment either. The Russian people can see that Mr Putin’s two decades in power have not brought prosperity, nor made “Russia great again”. His one advantage is that the opposition is disunited and has no coherent vision of Russia’s future.This year will see elections that Mr Putin will try to manipulate by banning opponents from standing against his United Russia party. In a bid to stifle demonstrations, Moscow has portrayed Mr Navalny as a “puppet” of the West seeking to undermine Russia. But these protests are not about Mr Navalny.

Last time, we rushed north to say “please stay!”, and some of us will do so again. But fewer. Is it any wonder? We’ve had seven years of being told we’re rich Tory monsters and the average Scot hates us. This has had its effect on British self-perception. Unionists shoulder some of the blame.The SNP are just being the SNP, and the irony is that their most successful theatre of operation isn’t the Scottish Parliament, which no one bothers to watch, least of all the Scottish, but Westminster where they have reinforced the lie that Scotland is a one party nation and a one issue polity.The strategy is to go on and on about the same damn subject to the point that English (or Welsh or Northern Irish) voters are no longer angry about it, they’re sick of hearing about it. It’s like living with a grumpy teenager. You love them, sure, but they’re so relentlessly morose that you’re secretly looking forward for the day they move out, when you can get on with your life and turn their bedroom into a gym.The Cabinet is ided over the best way forward. Some Tories, linked to Michael Gove, want to work constructively with devolved administrations others, closer to the PM, favour a “muscular unionism” that perhaps takes powers away from Edinburgh and redistributes them to local authorities – with agreement on both sides that they should splash the cash on big projects and smother them in the Union Jack (not unlike the EU used to do).But the wider problem is that since 2014, Westminster has conceded that the future of the Union is a wholly Scottish question, that whenever it comes up the priority is to ine what the Scots want and what will keep them happy. All our establishment really has to say to the Scottish people is “how much will it cost to persuade you to stay?”, which is tawdry. Unions are meant to last “in sickness or in health”. We all like a bit of romance.I love Scotland. I can say that more intelligently than I did in 2014 because, since then, I’ve made an effort to get to know it and now have an infinitely better appreciation for its landscape, art and people - and how they relate to my own identity (I bet I’m the only  journalist who goes to bed in Celtic pyjamas).I’ve also realised that I like Unionism precisely because, like my Catholicism, it connects me to utter strangers. The English and the Scottish are chalk-and-cheese, ain’t that the truth, but the idea that very different cultures can be united in a single national project is exhilarating and provides a necessary alternative to ethnic chauvinism. Britishness is both provincial and cosmopolitan the differences between us can be a point of tension but also, as in a marriage, of fascination and affection. Crucially, however, that interest has to go both ways.Right now, Unionism is uni-directional: it feels like everything is focused on pouring love on Scotland. When did we last hear a Unionist hymn for the wonders of Wales, Northern Ireland or England, which has its own poverty as well as treasures?When the PM visited Scotland last week, the tour was treated as politically awkward. Even some Scottish Unionists were on edge, warning that Boris embodies the qualities of England most Scots dislike.This is not on. Putting aside the fact that 38 per cent of Scots voted for Brexit, and a quarter of them voted Tory in 2019, the claim that Boris is beyond the pale because he is posh and conservative can only be read as an insult by Englishmen who are posh and conservative, along with the millions who are neither of those things but still think it should be uncontroversial for a British PM to visit a part of Britain in the middle of a pandemic that Britons are fighting together.And we know full well that this isn’t just about Boris. It was also agreed that David Cameron should avoid campaigning in person during the 2014 referendum in case he reminded some Scots of why they hate us – and even the appearance of Ed Miliband in Edinburgh, the most inoffensive man you could hope to meet, was a PR disaster. He had to escape through a side-door, chased by protestors calling him a “liar” and, bizarrely, a “serial murderer.”Those people, of course, are the worst of the nationalists, and another reason to fight for the Union is to defeat them and their risible claim that they are Scotland and anyone who doesn’t sign up to their narrow, often spiteful definition of Scottishness isn’t.But it’s hard to conceive of a bigger, cross-class, cross-national unionism when the English politicians who most love the Union are regarded as best kept away from the debate. When that happens, one has to ask, first, “what is the acceptable face of England in 21st century Scotland?” and, second, “what kind of Unionism are we fighting for here?” One in which we are all included, or which is packaged purely to keep one constituent group on board?My fear is that unionists will have to fight the next referendum on two fronts, not just one, and that while the battle for the Union is being waged in Scotland, the war is being quietly lost in England.

Make UK’s Ben Fletcher said the last month had been “like Dante’s fth circle of hell” for importers and exporters unable to move supplies because of new red tape.He claimed that one major automative manufacturer had , partially-built cars sitting in its car park because they could not get the parts in time. “There is real anger and incredible frustration for people who either import or export that they are simply not able to move stuff,” he added. “It is just incredibly dficult to get the paperwork right and there have been very low levels of support from Government.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brits should enjoy happy free","story":"NewsBrits should enjoy a happy and free summer in six months, Matt Hancock declaresThe Health Secretary declared he hoped there will be a happy and free Great British summer - minutes before his Cabinet colleague Liz Truss said it was too early to tellmirrorShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video matt-hancock-pledges-happy-free-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

The Health Secretary warned we’re going to have a tough few months before lockdown can be eased in England. And he refused to put a date on when restrictions can start to lt - with schools not due to open until at least March . But he struck a rare optimistic note when asked how Britain will look at the start of the school summer holidays. He told regional TV show BBC Politics East: In six months weaposll be in the middle of, I hope, a happy and free Great British summer.  It comes despite Cabinet minister Liz Truss saying - half an hour later - that it was far too early to knowBrits will be able to go on summer holidays abroad. Brits ing from aposred listapos countries will soon have to quarantine in expensive guarded hotels, while others will have to quarantine in their homes on arrival. Asked when the policy would end, she told LBC the virus was unpredictable and it would be very dangerous for a government minister to go on your show making promises about peopleaposs summer holidays. Ms Truss was also unable to say whether pubs , restaurants and theatres would have to remain shut over the summer. The Trade Secretary told the BBC: I donapost think any of us have a crystal ball where we know what is going to happen in the autumn. What we need to do is work really hard now rather than speculating into the medium and long term. When he was asked about July , Mr Hancock did not talk about and was not asked about foreign holidays specically. But he said: I have a high degree of confidence that by then the vast majority of adults will have been vaccinated. “That’s not just the clinically vulnerable groups but then going to all groups, people like me, I’m in my s and healthy and we’ll have got through everybody. “That will give a high level of protection. The more people take up the vaccine the more we’ll be protected as a society… “So I think we’re going to have a great summer but we’re going to have a tough few months between now and then.”  It came as the UK vaccine rollout rose by more than , first doses in a single day for the first time. NHS England had given first doses of a jab to ,, people as of yesterday - up , on the day before. That was more than % of the entire adult population of England, according to NHS statistics. Englandaposs figures alone mean the UK has broken the half a million barrier on one day for the first time. The previous record for the UK was , first doses on January . The figures represent when people were recorded as getting a first doses. They do not always exactly match the date when people had the jab.  Britain has already given first doses of the Covid vaccine to more than million vulnerable people and NHS and care staff. Scientists are waiting for data to show whether getting a jab will stop people passing Covid on to others - rather than simply preventing them getting sick themselves. Dr Susan Hopkins, Incident Director for COVID- at Public Health England, told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “What we’d like to see is a ergence in the case rates in the over-s and over-s who’ve been vaccinated from the younger age groups, to show they’re declining faster. “We’ve now hit % of the over-s being vaccinated and really fast numbers climbing in the under- age group as well. “So we expect over the next two weeks to start seeing that impact of that vaccine in that age group, and also an impact on hospitalisation.” Confirmed cases are also coming down - the rolling average of confirmed new daily cases in the UK has dipped from , on New Year’s Day to , by January . But the Sundaytoday reported social distancing may be needed for the rest of the year despite the vaccine rollout. Government scientists have warned that unless a vaccine is % effective at stopping Covid being passed on - as well as preventing severe illness - they wonapost be able to abandon other restrictions. Modelling by SPI-M, a subgroup of Sage, suggests the UK will suffer a third huge spike in deaths unless the jabs cuts transmission dramatically. It comes as figures show that cases of both the South African and Brazilian iants, which are thought to be more contagious, have increased in the last few days. The vaccines are thought to cut transmissions by around % but it is unclear. Ms Truss declined to rule out that some social distancing measures will have to be in place for the rest of the year. The autumn is a very long time away. We need to concentrate on getting the proper policies and measures in place now, so we can exit the virus crisis as soon as possible, she told the BBC. She added: We can only open the economy, open schools, when it is safe to do so and when we have reduced community transmission. At each decision point we will decide... what steps itaposs safe to take."},{"url":null,"title":"first time buyers dream homes","story":"NewsFirst-time buyers dream homes become living nightmare costing them thousandsUnder Labour’s plans, a National Cladding Taskforce would conduct an audit on the extent of dangerous materials still on buildingsmirrorShareCommentsByPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political EditorAmy-Clare Martin:,  JAN Updated:,  FEB NewsSarah Rennies high-rise block is unsafe \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Labour is setting out a list of demands as analysis shows that up to  million people are at risk from huge costs and unsellable properties. The Opposition is calling for a new National Cladding Taskforce after years of Government delays to protect leaseholders from bearing the cost. And on Monday night they will force a symbolic Parliamentary vote to pile pressure on dozens of Tory MPs who are understood to want the Government to do more. Boris Johnson last week said ministers would set out plans “very shortly” with Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick pushing for a more generous rescue package. This could include a levy on construction firms, caps on inidual repair bills and grants for those in the riskiest high-rise blocks. But campaigners have warned ministers are looking at a controversial “cladding tax” proposal where building owners would be offered long-term loads which would then be passed on to leaseholders through service charges. Labour leader Keir Starmer said: “Today needs to be a turning point for those affected by the cladding scandal. “Millions of people have been sucked into this crisis due to years of dither, delay and half-baked solutions from the Government. “For many leaseholders, the dream of home ownership has become a nightmare. They feel abandoned, locked down in flammable homes and facing ruinous costs for repair work and interim safety measures.”  Under Labour’s plans, a National Cladding Taskforce would conduct an audit on the extent of dangerous materials still on buildings. They would then prioritise them according to risk and ensure enforcement against owners that fail to start imrovement work. There would be up-front funding to remove deadly cladding immediately, with those responsible for putting cladding on buildings taken to court to recover costs. And a hard deadline of June  would be brought in for all high-risk buildings to be made safe. Labour will amend the Fire Safety Bill to protect leaseholders from being passed historic fire safety costs and ban ‘gagging clauses’ for residents in unsafe blocks. There are still  buildings with Grenfell-style ACM cladding on them more than three years after the disaster, which took  lives. The fire exposed decades of weakened regulation, failed inspections and substandard construction. Since then, the Government has put forward £m to fund the removal of ACM and a further £bn for other types of cladding. But this covers a fraction of the tall buildings affected by dangerous cladding, and excludes buildings below m high. An MHCLG spokesperson said: “We are considering a range of options to fund future remediation work and this work is ongoing. “We continue to work with stakeholders including leaseholders and the finance industry, and we will set out further detail in due course.” Jenni Garratt  Jenni Garratt, , is forking out £ a month - double her mortgage payments - for a waking watch until a fire alarm system is installed. An intensive fire safety inspection of the development in Sheffield also forced leaseholders in the top five floors to evacuate over safety fears. Remediation costs for the cladding have been estimated at £.-.million. And as a leaseholder she will be landed with a bill of £-,their application to the Building Safety Fund is unsuccessful. She told the Mirror: “I was  when I bought my flat. I would describe it as the proudest moment of my le. “I have graduated from uni and I worked since I was  to save up and buy as soon as possible. “It feels completely unfair that I am now being subject to these costs for something I never could have foreseen.” Sarah Rennie   Leaseholder and wheelchair user Sarah Rennie, , must evacuate down  flights of stairs in the event of a fire after discovering cladding on her high-rise block is unsafe. When she bought the flat, which she has adapted for her needs, the advice was to stay put. “It’s definitely impacting on my physical and mental health,” she told the Mirror. “Emotionally I feel betrayed that I was mis-sold my flat. “I also feel frightened thatthere is a fire I am going to be the last one out -I get out at all.” The accessibility specialist has already received a £, service charge bill for increased buildings insurance and a -hour waking watch. She will also face a £, bill for remedial works on her high-rise block in Birmingham,their application to the Building Safety Fund is unsuccessful.

Boris Johnson wants schools to be the first thing to reopen from March , but the dates after that are shrouded in uncertainty.Leaked reports - downplayed by No - have suggested England’s shops could reopen in April and pubs in May. UK Hospitality have called for pubs and restaurants to reopen on April  - much earlier - in time for the Easter bank holiday weekend, as long as cases are still falling. But the reality is no one knows exactly when lockdown can end because it depends on so many factors.  A plan will only be presented by the government in the week of February . And some measures are likely to be with us long-term - with one report today claiming social distancing could stay all year. So what are the factors that would allow us to ease lockdown more quickly, and what are the factors that would slow it down  According to Sunday Times calculations, on current trajectories cases could drop to , a day by March . That’s still higher than they were when SAGE demanded a ‘circuit-break’ lockdown in November. Only in May  would we reach the -odd daily cases we managed last July, when pubs reopened after the first lockdown. That trajectory, though, will be affected by all sorts of things that could dramatically change our dealings with the disease.The government is using four conditions before easing the lockdown:A new iant isn’t causing dficulties The vaccination programme is working Hospitalisations are coming down Deaths are coming down.We can be pretty sure the vaccine will bring down deaths, because the aim is to give first doses to the % of people most likely to die by February . But that will take time, and as we know, younger healthy people die of Covid- too. We also know there are no “fixed thresholds” for these four factors - it’s the general progress and direction of travel that will matter. So with that in mind, here are three things that would help improve the odds of easing lockdown - and three things that would make those odds worse. things that would help us ease lockdown If the vaccine reduces transmissionSo far we know getting a vaccine - even just the first dose - makes you much less likely to get sick and die of Covid. What we don’t know, and the government are still looking at, is whether it prevents you passing it on to other people. Government advisors believe it’s almost certain there will be some kind of cut to transmission, they just don’t know how much. If the vaccine has a dramatic impact on people transmitting the virus, then it will help drive down case numbers more quickly. It’d mean a -year-old gran meeting her -year-old daughter wouldn’t just be protected herself the daughter would be safer too.  Dr Susan Hopkins, Incident Director for COVID- at Public Health England, said cases are declining in the over-s and over-s. She’s looking closely to work outthat’s linked to the vaccine - and we should have some idea “over the next two weeks”. She told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “It’s a bit early to say whether those declines are directly related to the vaccine. “What we’d like to see is a ergence in the case rates in the over-s and over-s who’ve been vaccinated from the younger age groups, to show they’re declining faster. “We’ve now hit % of the over-s being vaccinated and really fast numbers climbing in the under- age group as well. “So we expect over the next two weeks to start seeing that impact of that vaccine in that age group, and also an impact on hospitalisation.” If schools reopen without driving cases upSchools will be the first bit of lockdown to end - so will be crucial to showing whether other ‘unlocking’ should go ahead or wait longer. Ministers say schools themselves are safe for pupils, but they can act as a “vector” to spread Covid in the wider community. That means while it’s rare for kids to get seriously ill, they can take the virus home to their families without showing symptoms. But the data on exactly how much this happens, and how much it’s driven in the classroom itself, is mixed and disputed. A Department for Education study in December, presented to SAGE, concluded secondary schools have “an effect” on increasing the spread of the virus amongst children - “but we cannot tell how large this effect is, nor can we tell what the impact of it ison the wider community”. Meanwhile a Public Health England study claimed infection rates remained “very low” in primary schools after they reopened in September . If, as government advisors hope, there is no big leap in cases after schools reopen it will help clear the way to other reopenings. Butcases start rising they will have to rethink. If warmer weather helps cases fall in Spring This winter has felt so long, it’s easy to forget the effect the seasons can have on coronavirus.The fact we got down below  cases a day in July  wasn’t just due to the long lockdown - Spring helped too. It’s now well-established that good ventilation, either being outdoors or opening a window, makes the virus less likely to spread. This is something that happens less in schools, workplaces and homes in winter. Heat and light itself can even have an impact, though it’s less signicant. A paper by a SAGE subgroup on October  said winter conditions “increase viral persistence on outdoor surfaces” and in unheated indoor spaces, due to the cold and low UV light. SAGE member Graham Medley said on January : “Weaposre very hopeful now that this virus is seasonal so that it will reduce once the spring and summer comes. Then that gives us an additional chance to be able to prepare and in particular to get vaccination done for everybody. Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said in the same week: “Winter will benefit the virus.”While Britain’s gloomy weather suggests we won’t get much joy until at least April, it could be one factor that drives cases down.   things that would make easing lockdown harder If new iants get into the UKOne reason for Britain’s Christmas explosion in cases was the new iant which began in Kent. Scientists believe it is more transmissible than ‘original’ Covid and it may be more deadly - around a % rise in men aged . So far, early studies have suggested that ious Covid vaccines will work fairly well against the Kent iant. But scientists are worried about South African and Brazilian iants, as well as potential future iants that could resist a vaccine. Early trials for one yet-to-be-approved vaccine, Novavax, estimated it had % efficacy in South Africa compared to % in the UK. Dr Susan Hopkins of PHE insisted this was still “reassuring news” telling the BBC: “I expect that all of the vaccines will have similar levels of effectiveness against [strains] like the South African iant.” Butvaccines have to be tweaked or are less effective against new strains, it could slow down the fall in cases and deathsthose strains become common in the UK. Ministers are also accused of dragging their feet over tightening up the border. Brits ing from Brazil and South Africa will have to quarantine in hotels, rather than in their own homes, but there’s still no start date for the policy.If we unlock too quickly at firstWhen lockdown was eased in July, Boris Johnson steamed ahead by reopening pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and more on the same day. Scientists are warning we must go in two-week intervals to check that unlockings are not driving cases up. If we go too fast, or people are given the impression it’s a free-for-all and break the rules, we could end up with cases and deaths rising and our “unlockdown” going into reverse. Dr Susan Hopkins of PHE warned the BBC: “We have to relax things really quite slowly so thatcases start to increase, we can clamp down quite fast. “The NHS is going to be under pressure until the end of March, as normal in winter, but even more so with the amount of inpatients they still have with Covid-. “Any releases that we have will have to happen very slowly, very cautiously, watching and waiting as we go with a two-week period to watch and see the impact of that relaxation. Because it takes that to see what’s happening in the population.” "},{"url":null,"title":"vaccine success cannot hide tories","story":"NewsopinionVaccine success cannot hide Tories failures in the coronavirus warChurchill won the war and lost the peace when the British people kicked him out in  - could Boris Johnson who lost the virus war go on to win the peace mirrorShareCommentsByKevin MaguireAssociate editor:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsopinionThe clumsy stupidity of the European Union threw a leline to a Prime Minister, says Kevin Maguire \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Could a fan boy Boris Johnson who lost the virus war go on to win the peace  The clumsy stupidity of the European Union threw a leline to a Prime Minister betting on staying afloat on vaccines after his Conservative Government’s calamitous errors contributed to the deaths of more than , blameless victims. Mistake after mistake resulting in the world’s worst mortality rate should be chiselled onto Johnson’s political tombstone yet he’s increasingly hopeful an incompetent reign will be rescued and extended by the successful NHS vaccine programme. The near , new jabs announced emphasised how much the country finally has a world-beating response to be proud of after topping body count tables. Much of the credit must go to the NHS, delivering the doses at breakneck speed and illustrating one of Johnson’s earlier lethal mistakes was to put profit-hungry companies in charge of test and disgrace. But a discredited Government also deserves recognition for ordering vaccines when the faltering European Commission was still filling in forms. Britain could’ve legally pursued its own inoculation programme while in European Union member, the jingo-istic bile of Brextremist vaccine nationalists deeply unpleasant with lives also endangered on other sides of the Channel.

Rogeraposs Wholesale opened its fth branch in Stockport on Saturday, having already opened its doors to excited customers in Poole, Plymouth, Southampton and Bilston. Masked shoppers eager for a bargain queued up outside the warehouse on the Bredbury Park Industrial Estate, Stockport, before flooding in to have their pick of the bargains. Great towers of tinned food stacked up on huge pallets and row-upon-row of colourful drink bottles greeted the shoppers as they rushed inside. Bargains on offer include  Lucoade originals in a case for just £, .kg of Honeycomb Cinder Toffee for £ and  Starbucks Double Shot Intenso for £. The storeaposs managing Mark King, , said he was inspired to open the huge warehouse stores after becoming annoyed about the amount of food waste.He told the MailOnline : I myself hit hard times and had lost my job through no fault of my own and did not have much money.I was struggling to afford to feed myself even though I had no kids or family. People who are homeless are covered by good charities and get a lot of help from supermarkets. The scenes moments after Rogeraposs opened were reminiscent of the first lockdown back in March, when shoppers piled food and drink into trolleys and baskets to stock up on essentials. Mask and glove wearing shoppers streamed into the store, enthusiastically wheeling their trolleys around the colourful, maze like aisles. They were channelling a bulk buying energy seen in supermarkets up and down the land since the pandemic first began. While empty shelves have not been as common in sight in the third national lockdown as they were in the first, many Brits are still doing extra big shops to avoid making too many trips out.At the beginning of January pictures emerged of supermarket shelves being stripped of frozen and cupboard goods. The need for affordable food has never been so vital, especially with many people left unable to work during the Covid crisis and not able to access government financial support. The hunger charity The Trussell Trustaposs most recent analysis forecasted a  per cent increase in food parcels needed across its UK network in October to December, which works out as six parcels given out every minute.During the start of the pandemic, around half of people who used a food bank had never needed one before, the charity added. Trust chief executive Emma Revie said: “Throughout  communities across the country have stepped in to provide vital support to people left without enough money. Volunteers in foodbanks have been working hard under extremely dficult circumstances to make sure support is there for people struggling to afford essentials.

Jon Holbrook criticised Ruby Williams, now , after she was awarded £, following an Equality Act case against her school. She was sent home from Urswick Church of England School in Hackney, East London, four years ago because she had her hair in an Afro. The school claimed this broke their school unorm policy. Mr Holbrook - who has been a barrister for  years - retweeted a video about the case by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, raging against the Equality Act. He tweeted: “The Equality Act undermines school discipline by empowering the stroppy teenager of colour.” After he refused to take down the January  post his association with Cornerstone Barristers was ended by the firm yesterday. He claims he resigned four days before he was to be expelled. Before he did critics piled in on Mr Holbrook for his reaction. Labour MP David Lammy, who is trained as a barrister, wrote: “What a pathetic response from a barrister.“No one should be discriminated against because of their race, or because their hair is dferent. “You shame the Bar and undermine your profession.” David Turner QC said: “This is the most shameful tweet that I have ever seen from a barrister. “I am so sorry Kate Williams - you and Ruby do not deserve this.” Mr Holbrook has stood firm by his views however, claiming online that he has been cancelled for challenging the woke and that a Twitterati of bien pensantsorganised a pile-on against him. In an essay online the lawyer wrote: The only reason that Chambers proceeded to expel me, despite my resignation, was because the salivating attack dogs wanted some red meat to chew.  Chambers was compliant enough to jump to their barking but it made no dference to me – save to enhance my reputation as a free speech advocate. I will now have more time to polemicise against the woke whose contempt for reasoned debate becomes clearer with each attempted cancellation. Mr Holbrook went on to write that he plans to finish his legal career doing pro bono work in unfair dismissal cases of women sacked for saying that a woman does not have a penis, presumably referring to trans rights cases.Reacting to the news of his departure, Miss Williams, who is now studying at the University of Manchester, told  the Daily Mail : I am pleased that the chambers have taken this seriously and acted so quickly.Iaposm not against people expressing their opinions but it was unfair for him to talk about what I went through at the age of , and to call me a aposstroppy teenager of colourapos for simply calling out a discriminatory policy. I know there are lots of people out there who have those thoughts, but he had such confidence to say what he did publicly, even with the position that he holds.  In February last year Miss Williams received an £, payout. Urswick Schoolaposs governing body agreed to the out-of-court settlement but denied Miss Williams was discriminated against and did not admit liability. Her family took legal action against the school in Hackney, east London, with the backing of the European Human Rights Commisssion. They claim Miss Williams, who was  at the time, was sent home while studying for her GCSEs for breaching the schoolaposs unorm policy. The family also claimed that in the teenageraposs Year  year book a photo of her from Year  was used where she had straight hair. Parents Kate and Lenny Williams, told the Independent the three-year battle has “destroyed” their daughter’s confidence during her vital school years and she missed a lot of lessons amid the dispute. Miss Williams herself said she felt humiliated and stressed for being sent home, after letting her natural hair grow. She said: The reason I was given is that my hair might block someone seeing the whiteboard or teacher. As my dad is a Rastafarian he has always stressed that hair is very important, but it was only after I faced this that I understood what he meant by that.

Blue Sandford, , has become the public face of the underground protest against the proposed high-speed rail line. She and her fellow protesters have spent the past five days ft under the capital’s streets as bailfs try to evict them. Blue, whose wealthy father Roc lives off-grid on a Scottish island, has accused the bailfs of risking their lives by removing drainage systems. But the defiant teenager is still refusing to leave the tunnels - saying she is more terried of climate change. Blue, who is ‘on strike’ from her studies at her £,-a-year school, told the Mail on Sunday she hates the comparison to Greta Thunberg. She said: “It’s really strange being right at the centre of this huge thing but I canapost just sit at home. “I am really terried of the climate change disaster we are facing and I donapost know what  to do to change things.  “HS is incredibly damaging and despite the Government declaring a climate emergency they are not following through on it at all.” She accused bailfs of “dirty tricks” - something they deny - but said she and her fellow protesters remain “in good health”. “It’s been cold since the eviction team brought in a huge compressor and sent a hose down blasting air along the tunnels,” added Blue.“Weaposve got lots of sleeping bags, though, and weaposre taking it in shts,with some sleeping, others awake having some food.“We have enough stores to last six weeks. Iaposm surviving on rice and tins of jackfruit, as well as pastries and other stuff collected from skips.”  Her dad Roc, a environmental activist, defended his daughter’s actions and the green campaigning carried out by his other children. “They have completely outclassed me in their protests, which proves it isnapost coming from me,” he said. “I am always begging them to be careful. I sometimes feel like I’m going to collapse with fear, but I am also so proud of what they are achieving.  “I’m a parent, not an eco-warrior, and I am terried of the future we are cooking up for our children. “I have been going through a really dark and miserable place knowing I could lose them.” The government claims HS - which is set to link London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds - will lower carbon emissions.  But protesters say the lines will destroy or irreparably damage  ancient woodlands and  wildle sites. They also claim Euston Square Gardens will be built over by a temporary taxi rank before being sold to developers. An HS spokesman denied claims bailfs are flooding the tunnel system to remove the protesters. “We are pumping air so that the protesters can breathe. The activists have dug a crude and poorly constructed tunnel.

The seven-year-old was riding her scooter through Boltonaposs Queens Park in March last year when Eltiona Skana jumped from a nearby bench and grabbed her before cutting her throat.The -year-old, who suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, had been under the treatment of mental health services and had been assigned a nurse, Manchester Evening News reports. At the time of the killing she was living at home and had not seen a psychiatric professional for three months, with police finding a monthaposs worth of unused anti-psychotic medication when they raided her house. After pleading guilty to manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility, Skana was sentenced to le with a minimum of ten years and eight  months behind bars. Emilyaposs father, Mark Jones, believes that his daughteraposs death could have been preventedGreater Manchester Mental Health NHS Trust , the group offering mental health care in Bolton, had acted dferently. She was like a ticking time bomb -it wasnapost Emily it would have been somebody , he said. The fact that the trust allowed her to go three months without checking up on her and her sister had made noises to say that she wasnapost right but they didnapost act on it. Thereaposs so many failings there. GMMH undertook an internal review into Skanaaposs treatment following the trial, but concluded that she had shown no signs in her mental state which could have helped them predict the tragedy. Mark believes the inquiry into the events surrounding his daughteraposs death wasnapost adequate and welcomed a further NHS England investigation into the incident, announced last week. The trust said they think it was unpreventable that Eltiona Skana attacked Emily which is absolute nonsense, Iaposm not having that, he said. She was, and we know this as a result of the case and what was unearthed throughout the trial, she was a danger to children - sheaposd shown signs of that. She obviously was a very angry inidual and had heightened anger when she wasnapost on medication.They let her out there knowing full well that sheaposs a very violent inidual when she hasnapost had her medication. That in itself is appalling to start with. They didnapost see her for a few months. Itaposs just one thing after another itaposs so lax and sheaposs a dangerous inidual as we know. She should have been in hospital at the time of Emilyaposs attack or she should have been properly medicated. Mark referred to Skana being sectioned twice before the killing, including one occasion where she attacked her own mother and her sister reported it to authorities. During the trial the jury heard that Skana had hit her mother over the head with an iron.  On one occasion police were called when she visited a friendaposs home and demanded to see her teenage daughter, while she is believed to have been carrying a kne. Mark believes thatmore care had been taken to monitor Skana and ensure she had been taking her medication, Emilyaposs death would not have happened. I feel sheaposs a nasty piece of work, we know that she has got her issues but I think sheaposs evil, he said. But, it was shown that sheaposs in a much better state when sheaposs in medication.  We can only say sheaposs never been in prison before for violence, sheaposs never done an atrocity to anyone  apart from her family so we can assume she wouldnapost have done itshe was properly medicated. Hence why Iaposve said I blame  percent her and  percent the mental health team. It might be  , it could have been prevented without a doubt. Since the trial finished, Mark has been working with Hundred Families, a charity which supports people who have lost loved ones to killings perpetrated by people with serious mental health conditions.

Infact,it wasn’t for the familiar white gown she wore on her own wedding day, she would struggle to recognise herself as the bride in her own wedding album. For Lauren suffers from a condition known as face blindness which means she struggles to recognise people. While most people admit to forgetting a face sometimes, Lauren’s problem is so severe that she doesn’t always realise she’s looking at her own reflection, can’t recognise her best friends, famous people and struggles to spot herself in photographs. There is no cure for her condition but she has learnt to rely on mannerisms, habits and the way people speak before she recognises people. Lauren, , of Derbyshire, said: “It can make le pretty tricky sometimes. “I can’t always see myself in photographs which can be embarrassing. If someone shows me a picture and the person had dark hair and is about my height I think ‘why am I being shown this photo, it must be me.’ “There’s been times I’ve looked at pictures and thought ‘that looks like a nice place, when did I go there ’ Then I’ve realised it’s someone  entirely.” Lauren’s condition has led to some very red-faced situations.  She didn’t recognise a woman at her birthday lunch who came hurtling towards her with a huge grin. Yet the mystery female had been her best friend from the age of  – and Lauren was bridesmaid at her wedding less than a month before. It was only when her friend Hannah started talking that Lauren realised her pal had flown more than , miles from Australia as a birthday surprise. Lauren said: “I try to deal with it with humour and there have been some very hilarious things happen, like spending  minutes talking to the wrong person on a video call or mistaking an ex boyfriend for someone .  “On the serious side it can impact on your-self esteem and sense of competence, that general feeling of being able to negotiate the world and people. “I spend a lot of time jumping through hoops under the surface trying to work out who I’m talking to.” Lauren gets embarrassed as she tells how she failed to recognise Hannah – but she’s not the only close person she’s got confused over. She said: “I think the problem was Hannah was out of context. She was meant to be in Melbourne, not Britain, and something like that can really throw me. “We’d been together just over three weeks earlier when I flew to Australia to be her bridesmaid. “The funniest thing was, I knew my husband Jonathan had planned some sort of surprise for my birthday and at one point I was staring out the window, looking at this blonde woman in the car park, not realising it was the woman who had been my best friend for years.”  Lauren’s condition is so bad that she sometimes thinks she is looking at someone  when she sees herself in a mirror. She said: “I’ve been at a busy restaurant and found myself apologising to someone in front of me for getting in their way. I’ve taken a few side steps before realising it was my own reflection in a fullmirror. “I’ve given up watching movies because it’s too confusing. If there are two blonde women who look similar in the same film I can’t tell them apart and the plot gets very mixed up. I prefer reading books. “I can’t recognise famous faces eitherthey are out of context. I’d be able to tell you who Alan Sugar washe was sitting behind a desk in The Apprentice, for instance, but I’d struggle to recognise The Queenshe was wearing a tracksuit.” Despite not recognising her best pal, Lauren rarely has a problem recognising others and family, including husband Jonathan, because she is so close to them.  Lauren only realised she suffered from prosopagnosia aged  when she read a book by neurologist and famed author Oliver Sacks, who also has the condition. Around one in  people are thought to suffer from face-blindness to ying degrees.Some may fail to recognise people they’ve met a handful of times while others, like Lauren, struggle on a day-to-day basis. Lauren said: “When I was younger I guess I must have thought everyone was the same. “I went all through primary school thinking two boys were the same person and once thought a girl in my class was a boy until she wore a skirt one day. It was only when I read about prosopagnosia that I realised ‘that’s me’. “If I meet someone on the street I can sometimes tell who it is because they have a distinctive beard or glasses. If I’m not sure who it is I’ll ask a few questions and try and place them. “I don’t tend to tell people about my condition because it just leads to more questions about it.

The property in Neese Lane in Moss Point, Mississippi, US, is blurred when on street view, although it is not blurred on satellite. Google will permanently blur properties on street view for privacy reasons, but not on its satellite view which has resulted in the fuming homeowner writing F**k you on their roof, Daily Star reports.Posting their finding on January , the Reddit user said: Theyaposve had their property image blurred from StreetView as well... hah!

Little Archie was born on May , , and his birth was registered  days later before an amendment was made on June . The totaposs birth papers no longer shows aposRachel Meghanapos as his mum instead it reads aposHer Royal Highness the Duchess of Sussexapos. The unusual change occurred as rumours were growing of a rt between Harry, brother William and their partners, The Sun reports. They claim the move is a snub to the Cambridges as all three of their children have Kateaposs names on their birth certicates. It may also be viewed as Harry placing Meghan at equals with his mum Princess Diana who always used “Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales”. Days after the changes were made, Harry and Meghan walked away from the Fab Four’s joint charity and had quit the Royal family within months. The caustic split from the royals was dubbed aposMegxitapos by commentators. Harry and Meghan have since moved to North America with Archie and secured lucrative deals with powerhouse companies like Netflix and Spoty.  Lady Colin Campbell, who discovered the amendment, said: “It is extraordinary and raises all kinds of questions about what the Sussexes were thinking.” Dickie Arbiter, the Queen’s ex-press secretary, said the changes could be an early part of their plan.” Royal expert Ingrid Seward added: “For a royal to change a birth certicate is unprecedented but to remove forenames is remarkable. “Perhaps this is another sign they were desperate to do something dferent to the Cambridges.”  The news comes as reports claim Meghan may notto Britain with Harry during several planned visits later this year. The Duchess of Sussex is said to be unlikely to accompany her husband at a number of s this summer - although the move is not said to be a snub. Sources, speaking to the Daily Mail, said the choice has been made for several reasons and her absence will avoid the inevitable public and media hype a joint appearance would bring. Insiders also stressed that the situation is still very much up in the air due to the ongoing global pandemic and other factors.

Our team watched as families braved the cold and rain to collect much-needed supplies. Caring school staff set up the mobile scheme after realising youngsters were going short of essentials during the lockdown. Patrick Ottley-O’Connor, head of Westhoughton High School said: “We found that the students were writing on any bits of paper they could find because they were running out of resources at home. “So we set it up a bit like an ice cream van, stopping off at places at certain times so people know where it is, delivering paper, calculators, pens, that sort of stuff. “It went really well on the first day and then we had requests for things like yellow paper.”  The van has also started carrying sanitary products for pupils, who would normally have been able to access them at school. He added: “We have got some hardshipso we put snacks and fruit and those sorts of things on, so the bus has started to grow.”To donate to the appeal please click  hereNext week staff will also start collecting donated items for the local foodbank. “We have had a real outpouring from parents to support what the school has been doing” he said. “A group of parents are now asking what they can do to help. Some parents have said ‘can we give money’, so we are setting up something so we can target and donate to those families who are in need.”  Deputy head Claire Cronin said: “In order to make sure no student was left behind we spent a huge portion of out budget purchasing laptops back in September. We have been distributing to families who had IT issues,it was just a phone or one laptop between a whole home, they have been our first priority. “But then some of the parental feedback showed that parents were running out of stationary and that was the idea behind the bus from our business manager, Ann Butler.” Three days a week the bus leaves the school and drives to pre-arranged distribution points. The school has more than , pupils and has had up to  parents a week using the service. We met the van in a leisure centre car park alongside the school in Westhoughton, near Bolton, Greater Manchester.

So she was stunned to receive a message from kind-hearted Adam Simpson-York to say he had bought Charles’s medals on eBay.

Adam, from Ipswich, Suffolk, has now gted her the service medal and victory medal, which he bought for £ for the pair. Jocelyn has also contacted the  surviving second-cousins she had no idea existed - including some living down the road from her. The social worker, from Peterborough, Cambs, said: “What Adam did was absolutely incredible.  “He went through so many stages of research to contact me, and was able to tell me things I never knew about my own family. “All I knew about my grandad was that he had lived in Doncaster and worked on the railroad for  years. “And then to find out I have  second cousins that I never knew about - it’s been an overwhelming experience. “It’s like I gained a new family in the space of  hours. I’m going to hold these medals close to me for the rest of my le. It’s unbelievable.”  “I don’t know how to describe what this means to me. “Covid- has brought some dark days, but this feels like suddenly there is a light in my le.” Charles’s medals had been lost for over  years before appearing for sale on eBay before Christmas. Adam secured the help of Jocelyn’s second cousin Rob Sharman - who she did not know existed - to learn more about the soldier. Jocelyn said: “Thanks to Adam and Rob, I now know pages and pages of information about my grandfather that I never knew before.

Plus he recently became the worldaposs richest person with a net worth crossing £ billion, so itaposs not a surprise that everyone wants to know his hiring trick.Musk is not interested in which school a prospective employee attended or even their level of education, reports the Daily Star.“There’s no need even to have a college degree at all, or even high school, Musk said during a  interview with Auto Bild. Instead, the father-of-seven looks for evidence of exceptional ability when it comes to hiring new staff. If there’s a track record of exceptional achievement, then it’s likely that that will continue into the future, he said. Of course, itaposs easy for someone to lie on their CV or about their achievements, but Musk has a question that is designed to catch liars out. Speaking at the World Government Summit in , Musk admitted he asks each candidate he interviews the same question: Tell me about some of the most dficult problems you worked on and how you solved them. A study published in the Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition in December  uncovered several approaches to spotting liars based on a job interviewing technique that actually backs up Muskaposs technique.  One such method is called “Asymmetric Information Management”and is designed to provide an interviewee with a clear means to demonstrate their innocence or guilt to the investigator by providing detailed information. Small details are the leblood of forensic investigations and can provide investigators with facts to check and witnesses to question,” Cody Porter, one of the study’s authors and a Senior Teaching Fellow at the University of Portsmouth, wrote in an article for The Conversation. She specically said that interviewers should give clear instructions to interviewees thatthey provide longer, more detailed statements about the event of interest, then the investigator will be better able to detectthey are telling the truth or lying.  In contrast, liars wish to conceal their guilt,” Porter explained. This means they are more likely to strategically withhold information in response to the AIM method. Their assumption here is that providing more information will make it easier for the investigator to detect their lie, so instead, they provide less information. The study also found that using the AIM method can increase the likelihood of detecting liars by nearly  per cent.

The takeover has sparked condemnation and a threat of retaliation from the US. Aung San Suu Kyi and other senior figures from the Myanmar ruling party were detained in an early morning raid thought to be the start of a military coup earlier. The Myanmar army said it had carried out the detentions in response to election fraud, according to a statement on a military-owned television station. Soldiers have taken up positions at city hall in the main city of Yangon and mobile internet data and phone services in the NLD stronghold were disrupted, residents said. Internet connectivity has also had fallen dramatically, monitoring service NetBlocks said. Now, Myanmaraposs army has declared that power has been handed to the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Reuters reports. A video address broadcast on military-owned television said power had been handed to Senior General Min Aung Hlaing The move comes after rising tensions between the civilian government and the powerful military that stirred fears of a takeover the aftermath of an election the army claims was fraudulent. Spokesman Myo Nyunt told Reuters by phone that Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and other leaders had been apostakenapos in the early hours of the morning. He said: I want to tell our people not to respond rashly and I want them to act according to the law. He added that he also expected to be detained. Phone lines to Naypyitaw, the capital, were said to be not reachable in the early hours of Monday and a military spokesperson did not answer phone calls seeking comment. There are reports the internet has been blocked by the military. An NLD lawmaker, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation told Reuters that another of those detained was Han Thar Myint, a member of the partyaposs central executive committee.  The move comes after days of escalating tension between the civilian government and the powerful military that stirred fears of a coup in the aftermath of an election the army says was fraudulent. Myanmaraposs military, which had declined to rule out a coup to overturn an election result it disputes from last year, previously said that it remains committed to democracy. The new parliament was due to meet on Monday for the first time since the November election, which was won in a landslide by Aung San Suu Kyiaposs party, but which the military says was marred by fraud. The White House has since fired a warning shot and said the US will apostake actionaposapossteps are not reversed.apos Spokesperson Jen Psaki said in a statement: The United States opposes any attempt to alter the outcome of recent elections or impede Myanmaraposs democratic transition, and will take action against those responsiblethese steps are not reversed. The Australian government said it was deeply concerned at reports the Myanmar military is once again seeking to seize control of Myanmar and called for the immediate release of the unlawfully detained leaders. Japan said it was watching the situation and currently had no plans to repatriate Japanese nationals from Myanmar. A group of Western countries, including the United States had issued a joint statement on Friday warning against aposany attempt to alter the outcome of the elections or impede Myanmaraposs democratic transition.apos "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2021/02/medw-dani-mather-new-shop-2_37783724-scaled.jpg ","title":"artisan scottish goods broughty ferry","story":"A German-native who made Dundee home has revealed plans for a new shop in Broughty Ferry.Daniela Mather, who was born in East Germany in , will sell artisan Scottish goods from the shop on Brook Street, which is situated next to the Willows coffee shop.Daniela said: #I#ve owned my own business, Spice Harmony, for about two and a half years now, selling dferent kinds of unique chutneys.#We sell them at fairs all over the country in the past to sell our chutney, so we have had plenty of chances to see what was on offer from dferent businesses.#This year, because of everything that#s been going on, we haven#t been able to travel so when we saw that the shop was vacant we thought that yes, we may as well go for that.#The new store, which is to be named Coorie Fine Scottish Food and Homeware, will open on April .Daniela plans to sell as wide iety of local goods, including candles, furniture and food.She added: #We want the shop to support Scotland and all the local businesses that we are going to be buying from.#We plan to have lots of nice food and unique products for people.#We expect it to be a success because it#s going to be a shop for everyone. We#ll have something to interest everyone that comes in, whether it#s Broughty Ferry people, Monieth people, tourists, anyone.#Daniela first fell in love with Scotland after meeting her husband, David, at an Oktoberfest celebration in Germany.She said: #We met  years ago in Munich, at Oktoberfest.#He was wearing a kilt and I had never met a Scotsman before, so I had to ask what was under his kilt.#Things moved quite quickly and we got married in a year, then we had our first son  years ago, the our second, before moving to Scotland five and a half years ago.#I was born in East Germany and grew up on the Baltic Coast, so for me Broughty Ferry is the nicest place ever.#Scotland has given me so much.

The sound of them scuttling around in the walls or roof can also be extremely distressing.“And while one rat in the home is an immediate problem, they have a rapid breeding cycle, so an infestation can escalate quickly.“Rats should be dealt with by a professional pest controller who knows the area, can identy their likely habitat, and has the knowledge and experience to treat any particular issue.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/20051869_37713582-e1612033299254-620x372.jpg ","title":"scotland under 21 international fraser hornby agrees deal to join aberdeen","story":"Scotland under- international Fraser Hornby has agreed a deal to join Aberdeen, according to reports.The Dons are searching for a new forward with Sam Cosgrove set to move to Birmingham City in a £million deal.According to a report in the Daily Record, Hornby has agreed to join Aberdeen on loan for the rest of the season.Hornby has made only three appearances for French Ligue  side Reims since moving from Everton in a £.million deal last summer.Speaking after Birmingham’s - draw with Coventry City at St Andrews on Saturday, Birmingham City boss Aitor Karanka said he was looking forward to working with Cosgrove.He said: “He is big, he is powerful, he has something that sometimes we are missing, that power to hold the ball, to go into space, to head to the corners and the set-pieces.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities.

Some do exist, however, and while not attempting to be a comprehensive history, there is a nicely illustrated booklet about the hospital and its past entitled #Up The Brae#, produced a few years ago by Brenda Bratt, Jess Grant and my former colleague Dr Grace Fergusson .These photographs are a reminder of the loss of a signicant social and economic element in the fabric of Mid Argyll, where for generations it would have been dficult to find a family without some connection to #the AB#. For those who worked there, myself included, any sadness however is much more about the loss of a self-sufficient and widely respected mental health service.I was a late participant in the story of the AB, being appointed physician superintendent in , a post I held in addition to that of clinical director for mental health services for Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire until , and I feel a duty to the many splendid colleagues with whom I worked to comment on the loss of the service in which the AB served as the nucleus.During the course of   the hospital was awarded the accolade #Best Mental Illness Hospital in Britain# as the result of a national competition launched by the King’s Fund and sponsored by the Sunday Times. This was a recognition of the multi-disciplinary spirit and enthusiasm for innovation that characterised the service, and the ethos of best clinical practice being led by academic excellence. The service went on to be recognised as a centre of excellence by many visiting accreditation bodies.My reason for making these points has nothing to do with nostalgia.The past has no utility in the present or the future except as a source for learning how best to proceed.The ingredients for a good mental health service are the same today as they were in  and they have little to do with buildings or even location. Staff have to feel they #belong# to something there must be a collegiate spirit binding together the ious disciplines shared professional development and peer support and clear lines of accountability. It is frankly hard to see any such features in the current delivery of mental health care.Someone once said #psychiatry isn’t sexy#, meaning that in any competition for resources with other clinical specialities, psychiatry will always lose, and so to get the best out of the NHS for folk with psychiatric disorder, exceptional effort is required. The achievements and values of the past can act as a springboard for such effort, but here they seem to have been squandered by a distant and disinterested health board.It is all too easy to avoid investing in a service by reorganising it into invisibility, but the people who pay the cost are those who deserve the best of specialist professional help.So I am certainly sad at the disappearance of the old AB, because it is symbolic of something having been lost that is much more important than stones and mortar.Professor Angus Mackay OBE FRCPsych, ArdrishaigSir,Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns over whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But though customers# usage of data more than doubled, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m also proud of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.We#ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland Director, Alexander Graham Bell House, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 8 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is ridiculous. I have attended  years of meetings on the A and all we get is fobbed off with pathetic excuses.We need a government which will deliver results, not spend all its time plotting to get independence while ignoring the real issues like a closed A which blight people#s lives.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,As we move into  and parents, teachers and pupils once again find themselves facing additional challenges to deliver and attain a full and rounded education, it is worthwhile remembering the role that music can and should play in improving our lives.Firstly, music will help to support and sustain our young people through the coming months. For children and adults alike, the creative arts play a vital role in promoting wellbeing and positive mental health, providing both a means of expression during the isolation of #lockdown# and a practical as well as enjoyable pastime.Secondly # and just as importantly # playing an instrument is complementary to academic subjects and has been shown emphatically to improve wider educational success. As we consider the often daunting challenge of theto home schooling, those parents whose children can mix domestic timetables with musical lessons will understand the release and stimulation playing an instrument can deliver.Across society music is integral to our identities and is made to be shared. We now have the means to do that successfully and safely with online tools whose use has been well-honed by recent experience.So whether you#re at the start of a musical journey, or are well advanced in music-making let#s keep singing, keep dancing and keep music lessons flowing, particularly while the restrictions necessitated by the pandemic keep us apart in our own homes.Dr Kenneth Taylor, head teacher, St Mary’s Music School, EdinburghSir,As Scotland faces a second national lockdown, the country#s national walking charity, Paths for All, is encouraging the public to explore local walking routes in a bid to help combat social isolation, anxiety and loneliness while maintaining physical health.The call follows the launch of the charity#s Walk Once a Day this Winter campaign, which asks people to make the pledge of walking every day throughout January.The campaign includes an online hub which outlines the importance of walking and regular physical activity during the winter months. A iety of activities and ideas, designed to motivate iniduals of all ages, are available on the hub with podcast recommendations, creative walking advice and prize incentives.In what is traditionally the time of year which sees a surge of gym memberships and fitness plans we suggest taking up walking instead as part of our new year resolutions.With walking being one of the few essential reasons for leaving your home, it is the perfect exercise and now is the time to get into a walking exercise routine which is consistent with the current government guidelines. Walking can help with our social health as the guidelines allow us to meet with one person from one other household outside.Last year we saw an increase in Scots taking up walking during the first lockdown and the outcome has highlighted just how many benefits are attributed to walking and how outdoor exercise as many times a day as we can has become an important way to look after physical and mental wellbeing.Follow the campaign over on Paths for All social media channels #WalkOnceADay.For more information on the Walk Once a Day this Winter campaign, visit the Paths for All website.Ian Findlay CBE, chief officer, Paths for AllSir,The New Year is usually a time for a fresh start – making resolutions, getting fit, setting new challenges and goals. But with the continuing uncertainty caused by the COVID- pandemic, it seems harder to commit to making a change.With restrictions ongoing, it’s becoming even more important for us to find new and innovative ways to raise vital funds for NSPCC Scotland to help children at risk of abuse and neglect.Children have been greatly affected by the pandemic. Since the first lockdown measures were introduced, the average monthly number of referrals from the NSPCC’s helpline to agencies in Scotland, such as the police or children’s services, have been more than  per cent higher than the first three months of . And the effects are far from over.Even with social distancing, there are still many ways you can fundraise for us.From hosting a virtual quiz or coffee morning to selling handmade crafts, cakes or old clothes, we’ve got lots of great virtual fundraising ideas you can try while following the Scottish Government#s advice on social distancing.By volunteering just a couple of hours each month to fundraise in your  area, you can help to make  a better year for children.So please think about using your new year passion and enthusiasm to come up with some ideas to fundraise and help us be there when children need us most.To find out more or to request your fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk or contact jen.lindsay@nspcc.org.uk by email.Jen Lindsay, community fundraising manager, NSPCC Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"boaters urged to abide by covid rules","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The revised guidance recognises that travel is severely restricted by law and owners may only travel to their boatit is kept in the same local authority area they live in.RYA Scotland, Sail Scotland and British Marine Scotland have joined together to encourage boat owners to use the services of staff where their boat is stored,at all possible, in an effort to avoid making a journey, to respect that storage providers may not be able to open and to advise owners to contact providers before travelling to confirm access.The information is tailored towards RYA affiliated clubs and recognised training centres as well as inidual members and the wider boating community across Scotland.James Allan, chief executive officer at RYA Scotland, said: #Lockdown will be disappointing for everyone, but it is still possible to go boating as a form of exercise and spending some time afloat or near the water is great for our wellbeing. It is important to remember we are in the grip of a pandemic that has become signicantly worse in recent weeks. The overriding message for Scotland’s boating community is to stay at home wherever possible as we must all help stop the spread of the virus.#Importantly in this lockdown, owners may travel within their local authority to undertake essential maintenance on their boat but may not stay longer than theof time required to undertake essential maintenance.To check what level of measures apply in your area or venue where you intend to participate in activity, please check the postcode on the Scottish Government webpage.In the meantime, RYA Scotland has decided to postpone its directly organised, non-virtual events and training in response to these measures to protect participants, volunteers and others and to reduce the risk of placing an additional burden on the emergency services at what is a hugely testing time.The RYA will be providing a range of online events and #SailFromHome activities. RYA Scotland will continue to host online sessions for clubs and training centres and deliver its regular podcast #Off the Water# to keep the boating community informed.PIC:Owners may only travel to their boatit is kept in the same local authority area they live in. _aTarbertHarbour"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 15 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In the end he agreed a deal that the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation described as #desperately poor# and #the worst of both worlds#.Fishermen are restricted to catch fewer fish in most key species. Lorries carrying stocks that have been caught were left to sit at Larkhall – unable to penetrate the new fog of bureaucracy. Scottish fishermen are forced to land the fish they can catch in Denmark, which is grim news for Scottish fish processors.Instead of trying to fix the problem, Tory Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg says the fish are happier to be British. Of course they are # the fishermen aren’t catching them.The Tories must sort out this mess they have created. Our fishermen and fish processing workers deserve better than silly remarks about happy fish.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,In order to avoid fishermen being adversely impacted by export delays, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross has called on the UK Government to bring forward compensation to the affected fishermen and deliver it immediately.The SNP government must also accept responsibility and deal with ongoing issues involving their agency, Food Standards Scotland, which are holding up exports within Scotland.Both of Scotland’s governments must work together to deliver for Scottish fishermen.We in the Scottish Conservatives will back Scotland’s fishing communities all the way.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,The Scottish SPCA is appealing to animal lovers in Scotland to donate much-needed food to its National Wildle Rescue Centre in Fishcross, Alloa.Scotland#s animal welfare charity had its busiest ever year in  with over , wildle casualties admitted.The pandemic caused quite a signicant drop in the number of animals arriving at the wildle hospital. Over , wild animals were brought to the centre in .As we are entering fox cub season, we are appealing for Pedigree puppy food and puppy milk.Last year, we cared for  foxes, of which  were cubs. It can be a struggle to keep up with so many hungry mouths to feed.We expect to be even busier with admissions this year so we need help from members of the public.If anyone can help with food for these young mammals, we would appreciate anything that people can spare.Puppy meat can be purchased from the wildle centre#s Amazon wishlist http:amzn.to xkUe.Steven Gray Scottish SPCA National Wildle Rescue Centre managerSir,New Year resolutions can be a good starting point for making longer term health and lestyle improvements, but most people do not stick to them. Reasons for quitting include a lack of time, a lack of support from other people and feeling daunted by unrealistic targets.Often, goals are unachievable because they are too dficult, or they do not allow enough time for you to make gradual changes.There is nothing wrong with aiming high and being ambitious, but it is important that your goal is not too dficult or time-consuming as this could leave you feeling daunted.Ask yourself the following questions: Is the goal too ambitious  Is the timeframe realistic  What specic changes do I need to make  Can I fit my new healthy behaviour around my other commitments Breaking large goals down into smaller goals can make them feel more achievable and less daunting.For example,you are aiming to lose weight, the NHS recommends that you aim to lose around  to lbsa week. You should be able to achieve this by cutting down your calorie intake by about  to  calories each day. It might take longer than planned to lose the weight, but you are more likely to stick to it and not give up.Plan how you will achieve your goal and what changes you will make to ensure you stick to it. There are online resources available to help you plan your healthy activities, such as the NHS couch to km programme or the NHS programmes for stopping smoking, cutting down alcohol and losing weight.Try to be patient and don’t expect the results from just one or two weeks of dieting to show on the weighing scales, as it may take longer.A good way to motivate you is to involve other people. If you know someone who has a similar goal to yours, try to involve them as a #buddy# to provide mutual support.They may even be able to push you a little bit harder, helping you to achieve your goals sooner. Look for groups on social media who share your goal.If you miss a fitness session or have an alcoholic drink, cigarette or bar of chocolate, try not to feel guilty. Think about what might have triggered the deviation from your goal and try to avoid it in future. Forgive yourself and aim to get back to achieving your goal as soon as possible.On average, it takes between  and  days for something to become a long-term habit. Make goals that you want to be able to stick to long term, such as improving your overall fitness, stopping smoking or maintaining your weight.If you can make it through these first few weeks, you will notice that things will become much easier.Dr Helen Flaherty, head of health promotion and education, Heart Research UK"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 22 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We can set up a chat within  hours and the service can be used as many times as needed.James Adams, director, Royal National Institute of Blind People Scotland, EdinburghDear Alister,In the weeks since the UK left the European Union, I have been contacted by numerous Argyll and Bute residents and businesses who share my very deep concerns about the future sustainability and, indeed, the survival of our vital shellfish and fishing sector.The seafood sector is a vital component of our already-fragile regional economy and is now hit by the inability, virtually overnight, for producers and processors to get their time-sensitive products to market or to customers.If allowed to go unresolved, this sector is likely to disappear, badly affecting Argyll and Bute’s overall recovery and future growth.Fish and shellfish from Argyll and Bute are high quality products of international renown.The industry has been a mainstay and a major employer in the area for many decades, sustaining not only the local economy but making a signicant contribution to the Scottish and UK economies.I am now hearing from long-standing fishing families, newer start-up businesses and companies employing hundreds of people that,urgent action is not taken, they will have to close their doors for good.This would be devastating for Argyll and Bute, where the sector comprises many single-family operated vessels, smaller fleets and artisan producers as well as some medium to larger enterprises.As a council we are doing all that we can to support these businesses and prevent this imminent disaster.Our officers are working behind the scenes to assist and are in constant discussions with the Scottish Government to reiterate the critical need for the commercial hubs to operate smoothly, ensuring that the right processes are in place to help businesses get their goods to their customers.We are also speaking to Argyll and Bute producers to help them navigate these new processes and to issue all the necessary paperwork where appropriate, so that these valuable products reach buyers.Delays on both sides of the border have already seen valuable products being lost, together with valued customers who are seeking their produce where.Very urgent action and assistance is needed now from your government in order to prevent this traditional Scottish industry sector from disappearing altogether.Most urgently of all, getting products to market must be streamlined, simplied and speeded up.These products need to be prioritised over products with longer shelf lives –the situation is allowed to persist then very many companies will have no choice but to give up, costing jobs and much-needed revenue to the treasury.In addition to improving processes and the speed of delivery here in the UK, these businesses, so vital to Argyll and Bute and Scotland’s economic recovery and future success, need your government to negotiate urgently with its counterparts in Europe to identy and resolve the delays in allowing fresh goods to arrive in and then to progress on to customers.I cannot state strongly enough that these actions are needed now. More is required, though, in the medium and longer terms, to help this beleaguered industry to get afloat again and regain some buoyancy.Producers and customers need reassurance that future supplies will be prioritised and to regain confidence in the industry through dedicated marketing and investment where possible through the £m fisheries fund your government announced following the publication of the agreement.Our seafood sector desperately needs Government to take action to secure its survival. Please do what you can, urgently, to avoid its demise.Robin Currie, Argyll and Bute Council leader"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 29 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Thatrsquos because it helps build up your immune system. Vitamin C is thought to increase the production of white blood cells. These are key to fighting infections.Popular citrus fruits include grapefruit, oranges, tangerines, lemons, limesand clementines.ZincldquoZinc is necessary for a healthy immune system,\" according toMelissa Snover, founder and CEO of Nourished.\"A lack of zinc can make a person more susceptible to disease and illness.\"This essential nutrient helps maintain the bodyrsquos ability to make new cells and enzymes, process carbohydrate, fat and protein in food and also increases the speed of healing muscles and wounds.\"Foods high in zinc include red meat, shellfish, eggs, nuts, wholegrainsand legumes, such as chickpeas, lentilsand beans.BroccoliBroccoli is supercharged with vitamins and minerals. Packed with vitamins A, C, and E, as well as many other antioxidants and fibre, broccoli is one of the healthiest vegetables you can put on your table. The key to keeping its power intact is to cook it as little as possible - or better yet, not at all.GingerGinger is another ingredient many turn to when they are feeling under the weather. The antioxidant is believed to fight off cold and flu symptoms, combat nausea, and is full of iron, zinc, calcium and magnesium.However, itrsquos worth noting that a study from  showed fresh ginger may help boost the bodyrsquos respiratory system, but dry ginger did not show the same results.GarlicBefore it became a staple in cooking, garlic was actually used for medicinal purposes. From manganese to vitamin B and C, as well as selenium and fibre, it is high in immune-boosting compounds.\"Garlic is a potent anti-viral, anti-fungal agent, and eating it raw, or as an uncooked puree alongside your normal foodwill wipe-out most miscreants,\" Sara Davenport, health expert and author of Reboot Your Health told the .YogurtLook for yogurts that have live and active cultures printed on the label, like Greek yogurt. These cultures may stimulate your immune system to help fight diseases.According to Healthline, yogurt can also be a great source of vitamin D, so try to select brands fortied with vitamin D. Vitamin D helps regulate the immune system and is thought to boost our bodyrsquos natural defences against diseases.Sunflower seedsSunflower seeds are full of nutrients, including phosphorus, magnesium, and vitamin B. Theyrsquore also incredibly high in vitamin E, a powerful antioxidant.Vitamin E is important in regulating and maintaining immune system . Other foods with high amounts of vitamin E include avocadosand dark leafy greens.Mushrooms\"There are approximately  species of fungi that have been identied with medicinal properties, and many have antiviral, antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory qualities,\" says Euan MacLennan, herbal director at Pukka Herbs and medical herbalist at an NHS practice in London.\"Mushrooms are high in beta glucans ndash natural substances found to help prime our immune system, making sure itrsquos ready for action to fight off infection.\"Red peppersAccording to Healthline, red peppers contain twice as much vitamin C as citrus. Theyrsquore also a rich source of beta carotene. Besides boosting your immune system, vitamin C may help maintain healthy skin. Beta carotene helps keep your eyes and skin healthy.Fermented foodsldquoIf you like saurkraut, miso, kefir and their immune-boosting relatives, add just a spoonful or two each day to your diet, says Sara Davenport.ldquoFermented foods encourage the growth of good bacteria in your gut and when their levels are high, so are your immune levels, defending you from viral infections."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-man-ordered-80-hours-unpaid-work","story":"WHEN police officers visited a womans house in Galashiels while enforcing a warrant, they discovered a -year-old man in the premises.But Andrew Atkinson was already the subject of a non-harassment order not to contact the woman and was subsequently arrested.Depute fiscal Ross Price told Selkirk Sherf Court the police had visited the house in connection with an unrelated matter at around .pm on December .They discovered Atkinson and also his partner who he was banned from contacting.The court heard that the partner had asked for the non-harassment order to be revoked.Atkinson, who gave an alternative address in Galashiels, was sentenced to  hours of unpaid work for breaching the order.Sherf Kenneth McGowan agreed with a request from defence lawyer Mat Patrick to revoke the non-harassment order."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-vaccine-passport","story":"A Covid- vaccine passport system may soon be introduced in Scotland.Jason Leitch, the countrys national clinical director, said the passports are an \"interesting concept\".But what are the passports, and how would they work in Scotland What is a vaccine passport A vaccine passport is an internationally recognised travel pass which would prove whether or not people have had a Covid vaccine.It could,implemented, allow people to prove their status and potentially travel abroad.It is being pushed forward by former prime minister Tony Blair, who told Boris Johnson thatBritain should use itspresidency of the G to launch theldquointernational Covid Pass.What would a vaccine passport look like It is far too early to say, however Mr Blair says he believes the passport scheme should consist of a single, standardised digital system. He says it should be capable of tracking and verying an iniduals vaccine status across the world.It could, according to Blair, involve not only how many vaccinations someone has had , but also any test results they may have had in the past.It is hoped that the data would be transferred using a QR code, which would be scanned by participating countries at borders and ports.Will vaccine passports be introduced in Scotland In evidence to the Scottish Parliamentrsquos Covid- Committee on Thursday, Professor Leitch said coronavirus is likely to be present in some sort of ldquoendemic form for years to come.When he was asked about vaccine passports, hesaid: ldquoI agree it is an interesting concept, the WHOhave begun to look at it.He stressed the latest scientic evidence suggests vaccination is not a ldquobinary state, but there is precedent for travel restrictions based on vaccination ndash including yellow fever certicates.Prof Leitch said: ldquoI think we will probably move towards that.

I was brought up in Princes Street and it was the first time I had been out the Wee Toon. I was only  or  so it was strange to me.I loved the folks on the island who made us so welcome. Once I qualied, I went around a bit, to Africa, west and east, and the West Indies, but Jura was better than anywhere I went. I hope the people of Jura see this.Leslie McArthur, Carluke, South Lanarkshire.I have contacted our roads department about the icy and, at times, ungritted pavements in my council ward.Many of my justiably concerned constituents have been in regular contact with me on this matter.With all that is going on, whether it#s the latest lockdown or a decreasing local authority budget, our hard-working roads workers are thinly stretched and do not have an easy task. However, when it comes to our pavements and roads, safety must always come first.Our pavements must be safe to walk on all year round.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands.The Scottish Government spin machine’s use of phrases last week like #encouraging progress# about the works at the Rest and Be Thankful cannot disguise its failure to make any real progress towards a solution.At an online briefing session last month, I questioned Transport Minister Michael Matheson on why it says it could take at least five years before it even starts work on a proper solution.He waffled on about planning permission, environmental impact assessments and compensating landowners. This is ridiculous. I’ve attended  years of meetings on the A and all we get is fobbed off with pathetic excuses.We need a government which will delivers results, not spends all its time plotting to get independence while ignoring the real issues like a closed A which blight people’s lives.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal.The new year is usually a time for a fresh start – making resolutions, getting fit, setting new challenges and goals. But with the continuing uncertainty caused by the Covid- pandemic, it seems harder to commit to making a change.With restrictions ongoing, it’s becoming even more important for us to find new and innovative ways to raise vital funds for NSPCC Scotland to help children at risk of abuse and neglect.Children have been greatly affected by the pandemic. Since the first lockdown measures were introduced, the average monthly number of referrals from the NSPCC’s helpline to agencies in Scotland, such as the police or children’s services, have been more than  per cent higher than the first three months of . And the effects are far from over.Even with social distancing, there are still many ways you can fundraise for us. From hosting a virtual quiz or coffee morning to selling handmade crafts, cakes or old clothes, we’ve got lots of great virtual fundraising ideas you can try while following the Scottish Government’s advice on social distancing.By volunteering just a couple of hours each month, fundraising in your local area, you can help make  a better year for children.So please think about using your new year passion and enthusiasm to come up with some ideas to fundraise and help us be there when children need us most.To find out more or to request your fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk support-us events-fundraising new-year-challenge or email jen.lindsay@nspcc.org,ukJen Lindsay, community fundraising manager for NSPCC Scotland.A new survey by the Stroke Association shows that  per cent of people in Scotland don’t know that high blood pressure is the biggest risk factor for stroke, one of the leading causes of death and disability in Scotland.This is really worrying because . per cent of people in Scotland have high blood pressure.Smoking, drinking alcohol, being physically inactive and sitting for long periods, can contribute to high blood pressure, diabetes, and being an unhealthy weight, all of which increase your risk of stroke.You can start to reduce your risk of stroke by making small changes to your lestyle.To launch the first ever national Stroke Prevention Day on January , we’ve worked with our partners at the Rotary Club, LoSalt and OMRON Healthcare to help you make #OneSmallChange to reduce your risk of stroke.It’s often easiest to start off small and pick something that’s achievable for you.This may be swapping your after-work alcoholic drink for a soft one, getting up and moving regularly during the day, cutting down on salt or sugar, or joining an online exercise group.Just go to our website www.stroke.org.uk PreventionDay and receive tailored advice plus monthly emails with hints and tips.We would like you to pledge to make the change for three months, then let us know how you get on and how you found ways of sticking to your pledge.The things you tell us will help others across the UK to reduce their risk of stroke and lead a healthier lestyle in .Juliet Bouverie, chief executive, The Stroke Association. "},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 15 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It is stating the obvious, I know, but as we live through another lockdown, it is tempting to focus on the liberties lost and freedoms curtailed, when there are many good things still to celebrate.Not least of these is hope, another word that is used a lot in these days. We hope the vaccines will make a dference we hope things will get better we hope our children will get back to school we hope the planet can be brought back into balance we hope.But where is the ground for hope  Science and human skill A talk on the radio a few weeks ago, before Christmas, spoke about gts, and posed the question that the vaccines that have been developed might be God’s gt to humanity this Christmas, and the skills of the scientists ultimately come from God.Because for people of faith, the ultimate hope is in the God who is the source of le and who Christians believe came to earth in Jesus to show us the way forward.#For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son…# John :Where is our ground for hope  Surely the power of love is our only hope, the steadfast love of the Lord who #never leaves us nor forsakes us#and is with us every step of the way.Just be glad you have a glass.Reverend Steve Fulcher,"},{"url":null,"title":"sponsors kit out young pupils players","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The problem is, Smithy, a teacher#s nightmare, causes so much chaos that the head teacher ends up on a le support machine.Enter Dr Hannibal Lecture, the replacement head, and the stage is set for a war of nerves. The musical is on next Thursday, Friday and Saturday, with the curtain going up at .pm.West Coast Motors will be extending its local town service to include the school on the three nights of the production.FIFTY YEARS AGOPaul abroadWhile the financial problems of the Beatles are being investigated in London, Paul McCartney is believed to be in America. He left his farm, High Park, on January , after celebrating the New Year there with his we and children.Visit on # but support is neededConfirmation has been received from the mayor of the French village of Montbeliard that a party of Campbeltonians will be welcome at the village#s music festival on July - this year.Provost Dan McKinven told the Courier: #I now propose to call a meeting within the Town Council Chambers of all interested in taking part. I would expect representation from pipers, Highland and Scottish country dancers, choirs and pop groups. Any inidual performer would also be welcome as a cross-section of our community and its talent is essential.#The present plan is to travel directly from Campbeltown to Montbeliard by luxury coach. The village is about km from the Swiss border and the city of Basel.Provost McKinven added: #We would expect to form a committee which would be responsible for organising the finance and travel arrangements for about  people inclusive of press, photographer and artists.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOTwo boys birchedAt a children#s court last Friday – Sherf McMaster Campbell on the bench – two boys were charged with the theft of purses containing money from a house in Burn Road. The crime was admitted.The boys, it appeared, were messengers, and the younger one was in the habit of calling at the house in this capacity daily. The purses were taken on separate days. On the first occasion a purse containing £ s d had been left lying on a small table near the window of one of the rooms. The window was probably partially open. After the younger boy#s visit in the afternoon it was missed.Next day a purse containing s d was left in the same position, and on the boy calling at the house, the occupier challenged him with the theft. He admitted taking the purse and handed it over to the owner. Only  shillings of the  shillings and sixpence remained in the purse.While this interview was going on at the back door of the residence, the older boy, who accompanied the other on the second occasion, appeared to have devoted his attention to the room where the first purse was got, and he possessed himself of the second purse and its contents. His lordship sentenced each of the culprits to receive seven strokes with the birch rod."},{"url":null,"title":"letters january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I see Loch Fyne langoustines are sent to the EU but, living fairly close to Loch Fyne, I don#t seem to be able to purchase the product locally.I am sure UK supermarkets would be only too happy to sell, crabs, lobsters and langoustines provided by Scottish fishermen but it seems they would prefer to supply the EU rather than the home market.Fishing boats enter Campbeltown Loch regularly but there is no local supply of their catch as this is transported #up the road# as soon as it is landed.I just suggest that supplying the UK market is maybe a way out of the continual problems with our #friendly# neighbours who seem hell bent on putting continual obstacles in the way of sensible trading partnerships.Keith Abendroth, Campbeltown.I grew up in Peninver and have been hiking on the hills around the Rest and Be Thankful many times, all year round. My initial thought a few years ago was that the best solution to the problem of landslides on the Rest was building avalanche tunnels like there are on the A at Lochcarron but there is practically zero ground to build on on the downhill side of the A.The big catch-pits along the uphill side of the road do seem to work but, in the long-term, removing the unstable soil and planting lots of trees and shrubs on the rest of the hillside to hold it in place, might be the best solution.Rather than replace the road through the Rest and Be Thankful with a new route through another glen or to continue trying to stop an unstable hillside from obeying the laws of gravity, how much would it cost to remove all the soil in these watercourses which regularly slide Maybe cost-wise removing the unstable soil from the Rest would be cheaper # and quicker  # than building a whole new road If there is a landslide in a watercourse, it weakens the soil directly above it so that will slide next, followed by the soil above it, etc. The bedrock at the Rest is only a couple of feet below the surface so removing the soil in gullies liable to slide after rain might be a lot cheaper than building a new road through another glen.For a permanent solution, perhaps close off the road from Ardgartan to the Lochgoilhead junction for six months in the winter, pipe water from Loch Restil to the top of the gullies prone to sliding # at the base of the first exposed bedrock high up the gullies # let the water run for three or four months, and hydraulically remove all the loose soil, then in the spring shovel all the accumulated debris of the other side of the road It would mean short-term inconvenience for a lot of people but it might save a lot of money, time, and perhaps lives, in the long-term.Harry Hood, New Hampshire, USA. As children and young peopleto being home-schooled due to the new lockdown, there is no doubt that this will have a continued detrimental impact on mental health and wellbeing.As a coalition, we applaud the Scottish Government’s greater investment in mental health services. However, a view we share with other organisations, is that this investment is simply not sufficient.Mental health services were already under immense strain prior to Covid-, with children waiting considerable s of time for support. Recent statistics from December, for example, point to the fact that more than , children have been waiting over a year for treatment.This pandemic will only serve to make matters even worse as services deal with a backlog of those already suffering from mental health problems, added to which will be those who have developed problems over the course of lockdown.What is needed is a national crusade, delivering signicant investment in the public, private and third sectors to deliver adequate mental health support, both during and as we recover from Covid-. We must also use this as an opportunity to radically transform our mental health services, both for now and for the future, refocusing on prevention and early intervention.In the meantime, we would urge those children and their families who feel they need help not to hold back and look to get the support they need.The Scottish Children’s Services Coalition: Kenny Graham, Falkland House School Lynn Bell, LOVE Learning Stephen McGhee, Spark of Genius Niall Kelly, Young Foundations.The serious neurological condition Myalgic Encephalomylitiswill sadly be all too familiar to some of your readers at least , children and adults in Scotland live with ME, also diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome .Many face barriers in accessing health and social care services that meet their needs, and some professionals still don’t understand the impact of ME and its symptoms.UK charity Action for ME is trying to change this by offering people with ME across Scotland one-to-one advocacy, via phone and email, to help them be heard, understand their rights and access support.We want to expand this much-needed service, and are seeking enthusiastic volunteers in Scotland who can make the most of our online advocate training programme to develop their skills, gain valuable experience, and help improve the lives of vulnerable people with ME, all from home.Anyone who is interested in finding out more can call , emailor visit our website– we would love to hear from good listeners who can spare two hours a week.Alice Cranston, advocacy coordinator, Action for ME."},{"url":null,"title":"mark beaumont goes the extra mile for marys meals","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It’s a fantastic way to get more active and also help feed hungry children in the world’s poorest communities.#Funds raised will allow Mary’s Meals to provide hungry children in some of the world’s poorest areas with a nutritious daily meal. The promise of food attracts impoverished children to the classroom, where they can gain an education that will one day hopefully be their ladder out of poverty.And thanks to Double the Love, donations made will go twice as far. Give until January , and the UK government with match public donations to the charity, up to £ million.Gillian McMahon, director of supporter engagement at Mary’s Meals, said: #Whether it’s doing your regular run, getting on your bike or upping your daily step count, we hope that lots of people will get moving and take part in Miles For Mary’s Meals.#Those taking part in Miles For Mary’s Meals are asked to ensure that they participate in their chosen exercise challenge safely and in line with Covid- restrictions in their local area.To find out more about organising your own Miles For Mary’s Meals fundraiser, visit marysmeals.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I’m anticipating an end to the pandemic – coming out of the gloom. And there have been many episodes in le in which I’ve lived in the hope of emerging through the other side of the dark night. I thank God for the hope he gives me. But, how do we know when the darkness of night has ended In a rabbinic school, a very old rabbi posed a clever question to his young students: #When can it be said that night truly ends and the day begins  When is that moment when from darkness there comes light, when it can really be said the gloom has passed and brightness is here #The first student, still a bit immature, replied: #Well, it’s when it says so on the internet.#The rabbi smiled and told him: #That’s not what I mean.#The next student said: #It’s when you can distinguish sheep from goats, because in the dark they look very similar, but when light appears they can be told apart.#The rabbi told him it was a wiser answer, but not the one.The third student said: #When you can tell the fig tree and palm tree apart.#This interested the rabbi, but, no, this wasn’t it. The rabbi askedthere were any other ideas, but there weren’t.

After nearly a year of people taking exercise and essential journeys on foot during Covid- lockdowns, plans to keep the nation walking are more important than ever.#The increases in people walking, has highlighted the lack of good infrastructure to support safe and enjoyable travel by foot. Communities that lack local facilities within walking distance have had challenges. That’s why we are calling for investment in everyday walking to build back better after the pandemic, and respond to the challenges of air pollution, climate change and Scotland#s health record.#Ian Findlay CBE, chief officer of Paths for All, said: #We launch our manesto at a crucial point of change for Scotland as we begin to plan for le after Covid-. During lockdown, we have seen a rise in the number of people walking as many used it as a way to cope with the pressures of everyday le, to reach essential shops and services in their  area, and to connect with others and nature in a safe way.#But we need to do more to make regular walking an enjoyable and accessible choice for everyone in Scotland, from all walks of le. By investing in walking programmes and safe, attractive places to walk we can signicantly improve the nation’s health, reducing health inequalities and pressure on our NHS.#Brendan Paddy, director of Ramblers Scotland, said: #Our joint manesto makes a compelling case for investment to make walking safe and attractive for everyone in Scotland.#We believe walking can play a vital role in Scotland’s response to the challenges of Covid- and climate change # and the obesity, bioersity and mental health crises we face. Booming numbers are enjoying the outdoors in the Covid era and we need to support these people to continue to get all the health and wellbeing benefits of outdoor recreation for years to come.#"},{"url":null,"title":"why your business must act now to continue trading with europe","story":"Wyvex MediaUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

His we Esther also features on the programme.The film takes viewers through the remarkable achievements of the Lighthouse Stevensons over the course of five generations from the late s to the early s.The programme also features Fair Isle South Lighthouse, which was the last in Scotland to be automated in , with interviews from the keepers serving at the time. It will be aired on March  at pm.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOPressure piled on for quick Irish ferry decisionPressure was growing earlier this week on the Scottish Secretary to give Caledonian MacBrayne the go-ahead to operate the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Ballycastle in Northern Ireland.Scottish Office officials are said to oppose state-owned CalMac’s participation in the project.But earlier this week it was revealed they had asked CalMac to submit a business plan for the route. The news was welcomed by the prospective Conservative candidate for Argyll and Bute, Mr Ralph Leishman.He told the Courier: ‘This is a definite step forward and knocks on the head suggestions that the Scottish Office is totally opposed to CalMac as the operator on this route.’Scottish Office reservations are believed to centre on proposals to use the MV Claymore on the route. This would mean £, would have to be spent upgrading another vessel for relief work for its west coast services.They are also said to be concerned that no private firm appeared to be interested in running the service all year-round.CalMac’s participation in the project has been backed by politicians on both sides of the Irish Sea.Both Scottish Secretary Mr Michael Forsyth and Prime Minister Mr John Major were believed this week to have been lobbied at Westminster by CalMac’s supporters.Northern Ireland secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew is said to be among those who have contacted Mr Forsyth to support CalMac’s involvement.The project supporters have been asking the Scottish Office to consider the economic benefits the ferry could bring to Ballycastle and Campbeltown, which are both areas of high unemployment. The project is expected to create around  jobs,  of them in Argyll.The only other company which has expressed an interest in running the service, Seacat, only wants to operate it over a four-month summer season.FIFTY YEARS AGOMr Noble ill # so Provost steps in to open new airport terminalThe new passenger terminal at Machrihanish Airport will be opened on Friday at pm by Provost Dan McKinven, in the absence of Mr Michael Noble MP Minister of Trade, through illness.The new building, which has been provided by the Department of Trade and Industry in conjunction with the Ministry of Defence, is a small one situated within a self-contained enclave and is designed to improve the facilities of BEA passengers using Machrihanish.Before the terminal was built, all BEA passengers had to be taken by bus between the aircraft and the old terminal building near the main entrance of the airport, and, latterly, to a dispersal point on the south side.Under the new improvements, BEA aircraft will now taxi directly to the new terminal area, and passengers will be able to walk the short distance from the aircraft to the terminal.A new road traffic control system has also been provided because aircraft taxiing from the runway to the terminal have to cross a public road.The new arrangements have the additional advantage of reducing the distance, and, consequently, the journey time between the airport and Campbeltown.A complete shake-up of BEA Highland services is on the way. It could mean higher fares and smaller planes and the end of the name British European Airways on some routes.Last year the Highlands and Islands routes cost the company more than £,.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and FlashesThe annual meeting in connection with the Campbeltown Cottage Hospital will be held on Tuesday first at . in the Council Room.Local footballers had again an idle Saturday last week on account of bad weather.

His solution is even more batty.Driven by resentment and sepia-tinted post-Empire English nationalism, cloaked in talk of Britain and the UK, the Tories have jemmied the UK out of the world’s largest and most successful single market.Having placed the UK as a #third country# outside the EU, alongside Somalia and Kazakhstan, it is not the EU to blame for the barriers to free trade, Mr Abendroth, but the UK government and those who parroted the cruel myths of Brexiteer #sunny uplands#.Mr Abendroth suggests that the fishing industry merely sells into the domestic market as a replacement to EU trade, without thought to the timescales required to repurpose supply lines and create a viable home market # evenit could be done fishing businesses would already be bankrupt.Scotland’s economy and the living standards and opportunities of Scots have been thrown under the wheels of England’s red Brexit bus. Never have the consequences of permitting Westminster to rule our country been more stark.But the time is coming when Scotland will have the historic opportunity to regain the huge benefits of EU membership and become a normal, thriving, independent state at the heart of Europe. There is an empty seat at the top table in Europe # and it won’t be empty for long.Ron Wilson, secretary, Kintyre SNP.Remember the closing stages of the Brexit negotiations  Boris Johnson pretended he was holding out to get the best deal for fishermen. In the end he agreed a deal that the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation described as #desperately poor# and #the worst of both worlds#.Fishermen are restricted to catch fewer fish in most key species. Lorries carrying stocks that have been caught were left to sit at Larkhall – unable to penetrate the new fog of bureaucracy. Scottish fishermen are forced to land the fish they can catch in Denmark – grim news for Scottish fish processors.Instead of trying to fix the problem, Tory Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg says the fish are happier to be British. Of course they are – the fishermen aren’t catching them.The Tories must sort out this mess they have created. Our fishermen and fish processing workers deserve better than silly remarks about happy fish.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal ward.Keith Abendroth is spot on with his call for the fishing industry in Campbeltown to supply the home market.During my three-and-a-half years in the town it was possible to buy directly from the boat on occasion but it was nigh on impossible to buy fresh live lobster in the town#s fish shop.When I was new to the town , I experienced some shocking service at the some of the small retailers who I always endeavour to support. It is easier to get a full range of seafood and fish in Peebles, about  miles from the sea, which has an excellent fish shop supplied from Eyemouth on the East Coast.Much Welsh shellfish is sent by air to Europe. I often wondered why lorries trundled from Campbeltown across the Rest and Be Thankful and all the way to the English Channel crossings.Much of the st century supply chain is a mystery to me. For instance, much Pacic wild salmon is processed in China before being exported to the UK.  It is an excellent alternative to the farmed version at roughly the same price.Surely a town with an airport could develop a sea product freight service or is it simply down to volume, weight and cost Mark Davey, Peebles.Two weeks ago, at Campbeltown Free Church, we received a letter of thanks from Blythswood Care for filling shoeboxes to support the  Shoe Box Appeal.However, we are aware that many who contributed do not belong to Campbeltown Free Church.So, through the pages of the Courier, can I thank them for their kindness towards people they have never met but whose lives have been enriched by their generosity Dr Rodger M Crooks, Campbeltown Free Church minister.Like many, many other residents in Argyll and Bute I have received through the post a bizarre leaflet from the Liberal Democrats. Bizarre, because it promotes a candidate standing in a completely dferent seat # Caithness, Sutherland and Ross.Meanwhile, the good folk of Caithness, Sutherland and Ross have been equally mystied as to why the hapless Lib Dems have sent them leaflets promoting a candidate in Argyll and Bute!The Lib Dems have certainly lost their way when it comes to their policy on the EU # but it seems that they#ve lost their way in Scotland too.Les Wilson, Islay.Earlier this month the Prime Minister announced a third national lockdown. Although necessary, these measures mean many of our veterans will be facing the next several weeks – or months – completely alone.And while the vaccine rollout out across the country provides some hope, social isolation and loneliness poses a real threat to our elderly this winter, among them many former RAF personnel and their partners supported by the fund.To help combat this, last year the RAF Benevolent Fund introduced a weekly Check and Chat service to support members of the RAF Family experiencing loneliness. I speak to one such gentleman every Tuesday. He lives alone and spent much of  totally isolated and, for him, this service truly is a leline. We chat about what he’s been up to, what he’s cooking for tea, to his time in the RAF and often I’m the only person he will speak to for days.The fund also organises weekly telephone friendship groups, provides access to a listening and counselling service, relationship counselling support, and an online wellbeing portal to help support emotional wellbeing amongst the veteran community.Throughout the pandemic, many of us have learnt more about our neighbours and local community. That’s why we are calling on the people of Scotland to consider whether they know any RAF veterans, or their spouses or widows, who may be experiencing loneliness.To refer someone to the RAF Benevolent Fund, please visit rafbf.org or call   .Air Vice-Marshal Chris Elliot, chief executive, RAF Benevolent Fund."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 29 2021","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I cannot help but think that it bodes well for the future of that great nation to have a man of faith leading it.Returning to the words, some of the finest and most moving that day came from a young woman called Amanda Gorman.She spoke of lting the gaze of the nation not to what stands between its people, but to what stands before them, of closing ides because they know that, to put their future first, they must first put dferences aside.#The new dawn,# she said, #blooms as we free it. For there is always light,only we’re brave enough to see itonly we’re brave enough to BE it.#In the first chapter of his Gospel, John says: #The light continues to shine in the darkness and the darkness has never put it out.#We are called, all of us, to be part of that light and to be bearers of it into a dark and troubled world.

This adaptation means that they are ideally suited to being houseplants, particularly in homes where the owners are forgetful waterers!Succulent is a general description for plants that have tissues adapted to store water but doesnrsquot refer to a specic plant. On the other hand, cactus is a botanical name for plants belonging to the plant family Cactaceae and, for specic physiological reasons, may not always be regarded as succulents.Succulent suggestionsAmongst the toughest, most robust indoor succulents is the sanseveria, a wide range of plants whose common names include mother-in-lawrsquos tongue , snake plantand birds nest plant .With bold, thick, simple leaves, theyrsquore almost sculptural in appearance, tolerant of low light levels and, because they require minimal attention, theyrsquore an obvious choice for those with little or no experience of houseplants.Sanseveria are particularly good at improving the indoor air quality theyrsquore known to remove air pollutants including formaldehyde, xylene and toluene and, because they convert carbon dioxide to oxygen at night, theyrsquore popular bedroom plants.Another group of plants that are particularly easy to care for are the aloes, which the ancient Egyptians called lsquoimmortality plantsrsquo because they are almost indestructible.The natural healing benefits of aloe vera has made it popular for centuries and is iously credited with the ability to soothe irritated or burned skin, improve skin, hair, oral hygiene and digestion and to treat acne and arthritis.Like sanseveria, aloe requires very little care, tolerates low light levels and infrequent watering, removes air-borne pollutants and oxygenates the air at night, which aids sleep.One of our favourite succulents is the echiveria, which grows in compact rosettes of succulent, sometimes coloured leaves from which flowering stalks may grow.These plants like a reasonable amount of light, some dilute feed when actively growing and prefer under-watering to over-watering. A happy echiveria will produce little plantlets which can be removed and grown into new plants.Carefree cactusIt would be impossible to talk about easy-to-care for plants without mentioning cacti, which have well-developed survival adaptations.Most cacti have developed spines which in fact are highly modied leaves. Not only do these spines help prevent the plant being grazed, but they also reduce the airflow around the plant, which helps it conserve water.Photosynthesis takes place on the stemand its shallow, far-reaching root system enables the cactus to react quickly and absorb any water reaching the ground.Whilst the enormous tree-like cacti of the American desert may be the first cactus that springs to mind, wersquove highlighted some interesting houseplant types below that are incredibly easy to look after and certainly wonrsquot take over your home!There are many dferent shapes of cacti, including round, flat, columnar, smooth, bumpy, ribbed and fluted, and itrsquos important to note that some of these actually change shape depending on how much water is stored in the stem at the time!Not all cacti have fully developed spines. For example, the popular schlumbergera, of which the best-known culti is the Christmas-flowering cactus, has less modied leaves which look like lsquoteethrsquo along the edge of their stems.

 per cent more than in a normal year.A report lodged in the councils members library service describes a \"motorhome invasion\" in the summer with parking bays taken up.And it said July  was the busiest day in  years, according to East Lothians countryside rangers service.Coastal car parks overflowed with people parking illegally on access roads and wild camping incidents regularly saw groups of  tents gathered at any given site.The report said it was only face to face engagement with visitors by countryside rangers which helped the county avoid many of the dirty camping issues other Scottish beauty spots experienced but there were still issues with indiscriminate toileting and litter as well as fires causing damage to woodlands.Between June and August, , tents and motorhomes were recorded in the coastal car parks.RECAP: Patrols carried out after human waste left by campersThe report said: \"The number of tents at both Yellowcraig and Tyninghame was particularly high and the most affected compared to other coastal sites, with one weekend recording tents at Tyninghame and  tents at Yellowcraig.\"Associated issues were fire damage to the SSSI grassland and dune habitats, irresponsible toileting, tree damage bythose scavenging for wood and generally camping out with the guidance with the Scottish Outdoor Access Code, to the inconvenience of other users or detriment of their experience with coastal sites.\"New camping information signage was installed although high levels of camping and fire sites persisted.\"The proposed changes to car parking rules would mean motorhomes would be unable to use any coastal car parks overnight and would be directed to the new park.The report revealed: \"The council is in talks with Tarmac for Barns Ness to be a potential site specically designated for motorhomes.\" In relation to existing coastal car park provision, it is proposed to ban overnight parking, and control through a twilight parking enforcement service in the evenings and overnight.\"In this way, motorhome and campers can be directed to purpose-built accommodation.

He says it should be capable of tracking and verying an iniduals vaccine status across the world.It could, according to Blair, involve not only how many vaccinations someone has had , but also any test results they may have had in the past.It is hoped that the data would be transferred using a QR code, which would be scanned by participating countries at borders and ports.In evidence to the Scottish Parliamentrsquos Covid- Committee on Thursday, Professor Leitch said coronavirus is likely to be present in some sort of ldquoendemic form for years to come.When he was asked about vaccine passports, hesaid: ldquoI agree it is an interesting concept, the WHOhave begun to look at it.He stressed the latest scientic evidence suggests vaccination is not a ldquobinary state, but there is precedent for travel restrictions based on vaccination ndash including yellow fever certicates.Prof Leitch said: ldquoI think we will probably move towards that.

While weve ditched single-use plastic bags at stores and supermarkets, cut out microplastics in face washes, and scrapped plastic-stemmed cotton buds, theres still a way to go in effectively reducing our use of non-recyclable plastics - especially in the kitchen.From yoghurt pot films and confusion over meat packaging, to crisp packets and anything that continues to be depressingly labelled not yet recycled, for many of us, the majority of our plastics usage stems from breakfast, lunch and dinner.Bamboo food containers, beeswax food wrap and brown paper snack and sandwich bags are all helping improve things, and are becoming increasingly available and familiar. Sometimes though, you really do just need a bit of cling film, and the traditional kind can make you feel so guilty.But things are changing,Lakelands new compostable cling film is anything to go by. We tested it out...Whats this new cling film Lakelands Compostable Cling Film - it comes in a mxcm roll, inside a cardboard box like the usual PVC kind.How much does it cost pound. - which equates to roughly p a metre.Compare that to Lakelands usual cling filmas well as Tescos own brand cling filmand their recyclablecling film, which comes in at p. Sainsburys PVC stuff meanwhile is p, and Asdas non-PVC version is a mere p a metre.Lakelands compostable version is undoubtedly more expensive, but arguably its worth it, considering you can sling it on the compost, rather than adding to the recycling system. Presumably, as more brands develop their own compostable cling film, costs will shuffle down.Whats it made of The box says its a polyester film specially designed to break down under home and industrial composting conditions, while Lakeland adds the film is derived from fossil origin.Do you feel confident putting it in the compost The cling film is fully certied for home composting, and is designed to break down and disappear within  months. Still, its quite weird to ball up a used stretch of it, and chuck it in with banana skins, mouldy bread and potato peelings. That said, Ive used biodegradable compost bags previously, and they really have vanished over time in the compost bin. Its a case of overcoming the feeling of wrongness when putting what looks like plastic in with the used coffee granules.How dferent is it to normal cling film It behaves almost identically to normal cling film - right down to the box falling apart as soon as it goes in the drawer, the serrated edge nipping your fingers, and, like with sellotape, never being able to find the edge without rucking the whole roll up.I was prepared for it to feel dferent, stickier maybe, or lacking stickiness altogether, but in fact,you hadnt bought it in the knowledge it was designed to rejoin the soil, you likely wouldnt notice any dference.VerdictOften adhering to the stick a plate on top school of storing fridge leftovers , I have long struggled with cling film. One that considers the environment though, does have a certain appeal.I found Lakelands eco iety does un-cling slightly after a couple of days, and doesnt crinkle quite so steadfastly as the truly plasticky original you also cant use it in the oven or the microwave.Butyoure prone to making too much soup, scraping the last of the risotto into a bowl for later, or have been making extra meal portions for neighbours or family members in need, its definitely a feel-good substitute worth investigating."},{"url":null,"title":"headline","story":"Every Saturday night throughout February and until March  get your ticket and join Susie McCabe alongside a host of Scotlandrsquos best comedy acts, all from the comfort of your own home.

Majestic Suilven looms over Elphin where she farms her five hectares, cares for her sheep and chickens, and tends to her market garden crops.Covered with a layer of snow in winter, or blooming with wildflowers in spring, it could scarcely be less like Western Australiarsquos sun-baked Kalgoorlie desert, scared by one of the continentrsquos largest open-cut gold mines, pancake flat and where, until a few years ago was her home.From the heat of Australia and the le of an elite sportswoman ndash she once trained as an elite rower ndash Helen is now either welly deep trudging across the rolling landscape gathering her sheep or driving forward yet another idea for teasing food and profit from her small corner of Sutherland.ldquoI hated the heat in Australia, she confides. ldquoLast time I went back, I couldnrsquot handle it. And now I canrsquot imagine being anywhere . This feels like home.The -year-old Aussiersquos switch from her former le as a mining engineer in Kalgoorlie, an eight-hour drive from Perth on the continentrsquos west coast, to Middleton Croft in the north west Highlands was crowned last week when she was named Scottish Crofting Federationrsquos Young Crofter of the Year.The award recognised her remarkable effort and passion for croftersrsquo ideals: she has increased her flock of Shetland sheep from six to almost , has grown a successful meat business and sells fleeces and yarn.Her chickens provide the occasional Sunday roast for her and her mother, Ann ndash who she persuaded to join her in Sutherland. The eggs are sold with fruit from the orchard and vegetables from her garden through the online community food hub, The Green Bowl, which she set up with a fellow villager and which now distributes meat, vegetables and fruit from growers from Elphin to Ullapool, Coigach and Assynt.The embodiment of the multi-tasking crofter, Helen also runs a tearoom selling her own croft produce and baking, is the townshiprsquos Grazings Clerk, a Soil Association ambassador, and is embedded within the arearsquos crofting community.Itrsquos been achieved over just four years, after Helen arrived in Scotland on holiday, fell in love with the landscape and decided to embark on the ultimate lestyle switch.ldquoSometimes itrsquos been hard ndash mainly because there are times I feel Irsquom juggling so much and not achieving anything. But I love it ndash Irsquove no regrets, she says.She is not the only one to be attracted to the croftersrsquo way of le. Traditionally handed down from one generation to another, crofting has undergone a mini revolution in recent years, with family crofts once left to drt now fetching six figure sums in certain highly desirable locations, sought after by a new breed of modern crofter seeking an alternative way of le.And in many cases, agrees Donald MacKinnon, a young crofter and chair of the Scottish Crofting Federation, the stampede to the croft is being led by women.ldquoThere does seem to be something going on there, he says. ldquoBut there has always been a history of women being the crofter while the men used to go and work in the merchant Navy or fishing. Therersquos a symmetry there with the past.ldquoTherersquos also a general resurgence in interest in working the land. At one point in time crofts didnrsquot have a value. Now in Harris it can cost pound, or more to buy a croft.Research carried out by the Scottish Crofting Federation in  showed increasing numbers of women turning to crofting: whereas women made up just % of crofters in , within four years that figure had jumped to % with women making up one in eery four registered crofters in Scotland. While the rise in connectivity which enables people to work remotely, awareness of environmental issues along with demand for sustainable lestyles and the simplicity of working with the land are all said to be behind a general rise demand from a new breed of would-be crofter.But while swapping the rat race for a croft appears to be gaining momentum ndash with demand expected to rise in light of Covid- - there are concerns that not all who want the lestyle will be able to afford it.ldquoIrsquom lucky enough to have inherited a croft, says MacKinnon, ldquobut there are people who have grown up in crofting communities who donrsquot have access to a croft.ldquoOur communities need people to move in, but we know there are barriers.It includes unworked crofts being sat on, potential land for new crofts not being released and dficulties for would-be crofters accessing financial support from banks. Rising demand from tourism has also led to traditional crofts being used for holiday accommodation.According to the Crofting Commission, there were just  crofters under the age of  in its Register of Crofts last year - almost the same number as the over-s. The bulk of crofters, , is within the  to  age group.In Skye, former Glasgow-based primary school teacher Cheryl McIntyre is among a new generation of crofter who has traded city le for dirt beneath her fingernails and who sees a rise in the number of younger people seeking the croftersrsquo way of le.ldquoThere are more and more young crofters coming up ndash in our community of eight, the shepherd is in his mid-s, therersquos another crofter whorsquos , same as me, and another one whorsquos .ldquoIt used to be thatyour parents were crofters, you would be too. But opportunities have changed. Now someone from a rural setting might want to go to the city to work but keep the option of coming back.ldquoAndyoursquore from the city, you can make a le like this.She was in her final year Glasgow University when, in search of ldquopeace and quiet she took a job at a croft near Fort William and fell for the way of le.Eventually she found a five-hectare croft at Portnalong on the Isle of Skye, where she keeps her ten Hebridean sheep, six Highland cows, bees and grows vegetables and potatoes. Therersquos also a pig which has been known to break out and run riot through her front garden.ldquoItrsquos not without its challenges, says Cheryl, who was shortlisted for the Young Crofter of the Year title. ldquoIf you have livestock, you have dead stock and that can be hard. But every day is a school day and things you never think will happen, will happen.Having studied Rural Skills at the University of the Highlands and Islands, shersquos now the course teacher helping the next generation of crofters find their feet.She warns them that it is hard but with rewards. ldquoThere have been challenges, especially when yoursquove not got wider family around. For me itrsquos the cold - insulated dungarees that help.ldquoBut crofting is great, because therersquos community support and people always willing to give a hand.Speaking of the awards, Convener of the Crofting Commission, Rod MacKenzie, said: ldquoIt is extremely encouraging that there is so much enthusiasm, energy and innovation from the young crofters who were nominated.ldquoThe Crofting Commission acknowledge the demand from young people who wish to occupy a croft and make a contribution to the sustainability of local communities, local food networks and population retention especially in remote areas of the crofting counties."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12273788.jpg?type=article-full","title":"gorbals-can-inspire-scotlands-town-centres-future","story":"Densely populated, roamed by razor gangs and gripped by appalling poverty, the Gorbals became synonymous with everything that was wrong with Scottish housing while its hard done by residents were admired for their strong community bonds, spirit and compassion.Now, in a remarkable turnaround that would no doubt have tenants of the past reeling, the Gorbals is being held up as a prime example of the neighbourhood of the future.According to Craig McLaren, Director of Scotland, Ireland and English Regions at the Royal Town Planning Institute , the arearsquos regeneration has created the kind of ldquo-minute neighbourhood ndash where almost all of whatrsquos required by its residents can be reached within a short walk or cycle - that could become a blueprint for the post-Covid- landscape.:High-rise in Glasgows Gorbals to be demolished on SundayThe organisation is now calling for Scottish Government funding to help communities across Scotland lay down plans for their own neighbourhoods of the future.ldquoThe Gorbals has high quality housing, quite high density and a lot of it built on ideas of the past, he says.ldquoThere is a library, a community centre, supermarket and a range of other shops and it has green space. Itrsquos well designed. There are links to public transport so people who need to go outside the area for other services can get to the city centre easily, by walking or by bus.ldquoRegeneration was reusing land that had been used before, not digging up greenfield sites.ldquoIt was developed through a masterplan put in place that set out how to develop it over a long period, so it was phased and with the public and private sectors working together.Last September the First Ministerrsquos Programme for Government pledged poundm investment over five years to support active travel and poundm to support investment in communities including lsquo-minute neighbourhoodsrsquo.Originally developed in Portland, Oregon, and intended to boost prosperity, health, equality and educational outcomes, -minute neighbourhoods are carefully planned to give residents with almost everything they need for day to day living on their doorstep, undoing the need for a car.The idea has been adopted in Paris, where authorities are championing a rsquo-minute cityrsquo, and Melbourne in Australia where it is embedded in the cityrsquos long-term planning strategy.Momentum here has grown in the wake of Covid- pandemic lockdowns, which have left city centres deserted and highlighted the benefits of communities with services alongside homes, where residents can access public green space, walk or cycle instead of using cars, and with good digital connectivity to enable working from home or at local digital hubs.The idea harks back to generations past before key services such as libraries, GP surgeries, Post Offices and shops were centralised in sometimes hard to reach locations, retail parks and out of town developments.Supporters say a knock-on impact of -minute neighbourhoods would be less congestion in city centres, with urban office space potentially converted into affordable housing and an expansion of leisure facilities.The high-rise flats were destroyed in The RTPI Scotland is now calling on the Scottish Government to release funds so communities can work with the public and private sector to develop their own Local Place Plans and -minute neighbourhoods.It is also highlighting the need for a greater role for professional planners, including investment in planning jobs and ato days when town planners were highly influential with influence on local authoritiesrsquo asset management and spending.According to Mr McLaren, carefully planned -minute neighbourhoods could bring a wide range of benefits.ldquoIn terms of trying to reach zero carbon targets, people will not need to travel as much, he says. ldquoTherersquod be health benefits for people because people can access green spaces. Covid- has shown how people have valued having local amenities and green spaces around them.:A walking tour of Glasgows transformed Laurieston districtRedesigning neighbourhoods around the -minute model could help address inequality in how services, amenities and work can be accessed by the third of Scottish households who do not own a car, a figure which increases to half in deprived areas.It would also align with active travel and public transport strategies, helping to lower car use and boost demand for buses while bringing health benefits of more walking and cycling.Reduced need for roads and car parking would then open up green areas for play, community use and growing food.An important element of creating -minute neighbourhoods is ensuring local communities are empowered to design the places in which they live, adds Mr McLaren.ldquoThe way people engage with planning tends to be through objections to a planning application. We want to flip that so people tell us what they want rather than what they donrsquot want.RITP Scotland has called for investment in planning departments, which have faced the largest cuts in local government expenditure since   and seen % staffing cuts.ldquoWe currently have a fairly opportunist and short-term uncoordinated approach to how we plan things. Planning is not used to full effect, he adds.ldquoWe do need to change the way we live our lives and the way our places feel and look. We need to start thinking to longer term and move away from very opportunistic ways of developing our towns and cities.Stuart Hay, Director, Living Streets Scotland says the disruption to work and travel brought by Covid- is a ldquoonce in a generation opportunity to tackle a host of transport-based societal problems, including carbon emissions, air pollution, inactivity-related diseases, traffic accidents and weak community connections.He adds: ldquoWe need to get more people walking their short everyday journeyswersquore to tackle the climate emergency, boost our local economies and become healthier. This means getting the basics right and improving infrastructure.ldquoBy creating rsquo-minute neighbourhoodsrsquo, which build facilities close to where people live and work, we can make walking a more pleasant and convenient option for many more people.ldquoIf you plan for cars - you get traffic and emissions. Butyou plan for people and places ndash you get more walking and great places to live.Sustainable transport charity Sustrans also supports the idea of -minute neighbourhoods.Daisy Narayanan, Director of Urbanism, says: ldquoCities and towns should be places that connect us to each other and the things we need, and should be places where everyone can thrive without being locked into car dependency.ldquoThe best way to do this is to ensure that it is easy for people to meet most of their everyday needs in their local area.ldquoNeighbourhoods are defined by the communities who live there, and each will have unique expectations of the services and facilities they need.ldquoHowever, the coronavirus pandemic, and the subsequent lockdowns that have been put in place across the country, highlight how vital it is for people to be able to live locally, and to be able to access shops, health centres and schools by using safe and physically distanced modes of transport such as walking and cycling.ldquoToo many neighbourhoods have been planned around car travel at the expense of providing the local jobs and services that a community needs to thrive. It is important that we learn from what we are experiencing now to shape our towns and cities of the future."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-vaccine-nationalism-shows-not-together","story":"In fact, the very reverse has been the case, as nations have rediscovered their primary role in protecting their own people first. Borders are back. The globalisation trend of the last half century is being thrown into reverse as travel is banned indefinitely and international supply chains collapse. When Donald Trump closed the borders to EU travellers back in March he was attacked for being xenophobic, even racist. Now everyonersquos shutting borders. Nationalism is on the march: from Scotland to New Zealand.Vaccine nationalism has now ripped through Europe. Brussels has resorted to the modern equivalent of gunboat diplomacy: issuing threats, raiding factories, seeking to halt the movement of vaccines, even ldquomistakenly trying to create a hard border in Ireland.

Nicola Sturgeon has also got in the blame game, apparently claiming UK responsibility for the delays in the Scottish vaccine programme.Opposition parties claim it is rather a result of her inefficiency.Brussels, meanwhile, is trying to strong arm AstraZeneca into redirecting some of its UK vaccine supply to Europe. It is also threatening to block exports of the Pfizer vaccine from Europe.This would be an extraordinary lapse into vaccine protectionism. It would arguably be illegal under EU laws on state intervention and free movement. But when lives are at stake, who cares about laws.The situation in Europe is undoubtedly dire. Countries like Spain and Portugal, which are struggling to cope with a menacing third wave of Covid, have been forced to cancel immunisation programmes. Old people could die as a result of not getting their jags on time.The European press is furious and has accused Brussels of a catastrophic failure to meet its obligations.Brussels had insisted on negotiating for vaccines collectively for all countries above the heads of inidual nation states.This was to prevent a recurrence of the chaotic border closures last April, and the unedying sight of EU countries squabbling over the delivery of PPE masks and gowns. It didnrsquot want smaller countries to be left behind, either. Unfortunately, the whole of the EU has now found itself in the vaccine slow lane.Britain got ahead of the curve, for once.In March, long before it was even known whether a vaccine against Covid- was possible, the UK Government decided to invest massively in the development of what it regarded as the most likely candidates.It pumped money into the Oxford research and, more importantly, into AstraZenecarsquos manufacturing supply chain. The UK Vaccine Taskforce recruited , volunteers to test future vaccines. This meant thatand when new ones emerged they could receive regulatory approval very quickly.The UK Government signed contracts with AstraZeneca for  million doses three months before Brussels.:Covid vaccine Scotland: How many jags in my area The EU held out for a lower cost and got caught in bureaucratic delays trying to negotiate for all  nations in the Union. The EU had still not authorised the AstraZeneca vaccine for use last week, even as it was accusing the firm ndash which makes no profit from the vaccine ndash of selling to the highest bidder.All hell broke loose on January  when AstraZeneca told Brussels that because of problems in its Belgian plant, it could only supply one-quarter of the  million odd doses it had agreed to deliver by March.The company insists that it had entered into what is called a ldquobest effort agreement, and that it gave no cast-iron commitment to deliver come what may.The UK Government has sought to keep out of the row. There has been some injudicious crowing from Brexiters like Nigel Farage. But Boris Johnson has tried to sound magnanimous, offering to help out in the EU once its UK order has been fulfilled.But no way is he agreeing to give up British vaccines ordered and paid for. If he did, the immunisation schedule would be delayed here and people in the UK might die.Itrsquos the age-old question of altruism: are you willing to risk the lives of British people in order to save lives in other countries As in wartime, the first responsibility of any government in a national crisis is always going to be the welfare of its own people. This is a legal responsibility of the state, though one so obvious that it rarely needs to be stated.The sight of the richest countries on the planet squabbling over millions of vaccines is unedying, to put it mildly. Many African countries have been able only to get their hands on hundreds or less. However, the poor countries have been cautious in their condemnation.They need this to be resolved quickly so they can get sorted with vaccines under the UN-sponsored COVAX programme. The UK has pledged pound million, rather more than the EU.With the world watching there is a moral imperative for this disgraceful row to be resolved as quickly as possible.Fortunately, new vaccines seem to be arriving almost by the week, like the Valneva vaccine which is to be manufactured in Livingston. Once again, the UK pre-ordered  million doses and invested heavily in manufacturing before there was any guarantee of success.Boris Johnson made a point of visiting the plant last week to demonstrate the ldquobenefits of the Union.The question being asked in the capitals of Europe, and in Germany in particular, is why the European Union, with all its buying power, was left so flat-footed.It underlines a basic contradiction in the constitutional arrangements. It is baked into the DNA of the EU that nationalism is a curse, which in many ways it is. They talk of ldquoBritish exceptionalism and ldquoBrexit nativism asthis is a character defect.However, the problem with Brussels is precisely that it is not a nation and does not see itself as responsible to any one national community.The European Commission is not a democratic institution and cannot be held to account through a general election. It is a bureaucracy which, like all bureaucracies, puts its own protocols first.Everything has to be processed through the national governments of  member states. Nimble it is not.A delay in supply might have seemed a small price to pay for ensuring that all of Europe moved at the same pace. However, it failed to appreciate that the voters in member countries would not see it that way.In future, Europe may have to become a proper state or the nations may, to coin a phrase, take back control."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/5916691.jpg?type=article-full","title":"mike-russell-indyref2-could-held-christmas","story":"Mike Russell is reported to have said that another poll could be held six months after the May elections, during an online discussion event.However Scottish Secretary Alister Jack has hit back at the suggestion, saying any referendum held without permission from the UK Government would be illegal.According to the Sunday Times, Mike Russell MSP, Scottish Government constitution secretary, said: ldquoI think itrsquos really impossible to say when it will be.

With most of the English editions of the Sunday papers applauding the Prime Ministerrsquos ldquovictory over the European Commission on vaccine supply, she had a relatively easy sht, her interviews as featureless as the stark white background on her video call.: BBC dismisses third tranche of complaintsThat would have suited Downing Street just fine. It might even have met with a sigh of relief from the Marr team. The programme has hardly wanted for controversy lately. Since last November there have been complaints about three interviews conducted by the Glasgow-born Marr. Allowing for the Christmas break, that is quite a run.Is there something particular to The Andrew Marr Show, or its titular host, that makes it a target for complaints The first batch of complaints arrived after he interviewed Scotlandrsquos First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, on November . Marr had said that when it came to the First Ministerrsquos record on Covid, education, and the Alex Salmond row, there was a ldquogap between presentation and reality.The BBC did not agree that the interview was biased or unfair. It ruled: ldquoThe Andrew Marr Show is known for its rigorous and in depth interviews in which politicians and others in positions of power are held to account. The FM was asked a range of challenging questions as were the other politicians interviewed. Every interview is dferent but we believe each showed the scrutiny, detail and due impartiality the audience would expect.Next came complaints about a clash with Ed Miliband, Shadow Secretary of State for Business, on December . Marr was accused of interrupting too much and defending the Government over Brexit. The BBC did not agree, repeating the ldquoeach interview is dferent line as it rebutted the claims.: Protests over Marr-Miliband interview rejectedMost recently, complaints were made about Marrrsquos interview with the Prime Minister on January . Again, they mainly centred on interruptions and perceived bias. Again, the BBC response said the show was known for its rigorous interviews, etc. Again, the complaints were rejected.The broadcast regulator Ofcom received  complaints against the BBC as a whole for ldquodue accuracy or ldquodue impartiality bias in the first half of last year . That does not give an exact picture of the volume of complaints because cases only go to Ofcom after they have been through the BBCrsquos own system. By the end of the first week of January, for example, there had been  complaints to the BBC about the Marr-Johnson encounter.This is not the first time the Marr show has made the headlines for the wrong reasons. In  the BBC apologised for the presenter wrongly accusing Home Secretary Priti Patel of laughing about a no-deal Brexit. The year before, there had been a heated encounter with Shami Chakrabarti, then Shadow Attorney General, during which Marr said she was trying to patronise him.In Marrrsquos defence he had a long, distinguished career in newspapers before switching to broadcasting. Like fellow Scot Andrew Neil, he has interviewed enough politicians to fill the benches of the Commons many times over. With such experience comes confidence.Add to this the obvious preparation Marr does, and his determination to get answers for viewers, and you can see how interviews can become lively. Moreover, in the cases of Johnson Sturgeon Marr he was dealing with experienced politicians able to stand their ground.: The Herald will always strive for balancePost-interview protests, from iniduals or parties, have become an accepted part of the cut and thrust of politics today. Some shows may see complaints, particularlythey come from dferent points on the political spectrum, as a badge of honour, or a sign that they are roughly getting the balance right. If everyone is grumbling no-one is being shown favouritism goes the theory.Social media adds to the impression that there are more complaints about interviews than before. There is no need for the unhappy viewer to go through what can be a relatively y process of lodging a complaint when a tweet, complete with video clip, will make their point.As to why viewers protest, one has to believe they genuinely feel an interview has been unfair. For some, complaining will be a case of ldquosupporting the team regardless. Parties and governments may complain to put the record straight, or to fire a shot across the bow of a broadcaster in the hope their man or woman will get an easier interview next time.Perhaps the increased willingness to complain is part of growing consumer confidence in general. People speak out about interviews because they can. Whether they feel it does any good is another matter.As for the programme that bears his name, it still attracts the biggest names on the Sunday circuit, and the most attention. Marr is certainly not complaining about that."},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-independence-unholy-alliance-scots-nationalists-liberals","story":"First up, the videos confirm what everybody already knows, that the SNP is a bit like any other party: an alliance of opposites, a church of zealots and agnostics, a boatful of dferent people sailing under the same flag . Hence Labour includes Tony Blair and Jeremy Corbyn, the Tories include Kenneth Clarke and Jacob Rees-Mogg, and the SNP includes Joanna Cherry and Kirsty Blackman. Everybody is supposedly on the same side, but on certain issuesthey are ided.Read more:Why is Nicola Sturgeon backing Goliath and not David Faced with such a problem, every party tries to keep a lid on it, and sometimes they succeed and sometimes they donrsquot. For a while, Labour under Blair had control of the hard left because everyone saw that Blair could beat the Tories, and much the same has happened with the SNP. Nationalists can see their strategy works at elections so therersquos an incentive to keep schtum, and still is. Teddy Hope, a former trans officer with Out for Independence, says people have been encouraged to stay quiet on transphobia for the sake of the bigger cause ndash in other words, to stay wheesht for indy.However, in recent months, the issue of trans rights has increasingly put a strain on the unity-for-indy strategy. There have always been isions in the SNP, between right and left, hard-liners and play-it-safers, and latterly between Sturgeonistas and Salmondistas, but the trans issue is particularly signicant because it touches on something that, in one way, is the SNPrsquos greatest achievement and in another its greatest paradox: the alliance it has managed to forge between hardcore nationalists and modern liberals.The best analysis Irsquove seen of this phenomenon is in the new book by the political scientists Maria Sobolewska and Robert Ford. The main focus of their book, Brexitland, is the trends that led to the vote to leave the EU, but it also looks at Scottish nationalism and the similaritieswith Brexit. The political histories of the two movements may be dferent, they say, but the cores are exactly the same.What theyrsquore referring to is the ethnocentrist: the type of voter who has a view of the world in which their own group is the centre of everything. Sobolewska and Ford suggest the phenomenon may be an aspect of the authoritarian personality type ndash a tendency to value and insist upon conformity . They also point out that ethnocentrism ies by education, with graduates much less likely to express loyalty to a national unit. Ethnocentrists are also likely to reduce society to ldquous and them and feel aggressive towards ldquothem .The point the authors are making is that both the campaigns for Brexit and Scottish independence found their strongest early support from these ethnocentrist types and they still form the core of both movements. Whatrsquos dferent about the SNP is they were able to expand beyond the core and bring together a coalition encompassing ethnocentrists and ldquoidentity liberals: generally more educated voters who express higher support for inidual and minority rights. Identity liberals are the most likely to champion LGBT people in general and trans rights in particular.Read more:If a second independence referendum happens, the question has to be dferentWhat the SNP has been able to do is attract both of these groups by offering ndash in plain sight ndash something for everyone. Herersquos how Sobolewska and Ford describe it: the SNPrsquos narrative, they say, ldquomarried ethnocentric resentment of the English with centre-left economic ideology and promises of a liberal, multicultural Scotland hellip negative views of migrants and minorities wereroughly as widely held in Scotland as in England and Wales, but they were ignored by the SNP, who directed ethnocentric votersrsquo resentments towards London and the Tories.So far, it has to be said, the strategy has worked well, but it isnrsquot easy to hold together. As Sobolewska and Ford point out, levels of ethnocentrism in Scotland are comparable with those in the wider UK ndash similar numbers believe ldquobeing born in your country is important. It also ies in similar ways by education: English school-leavers see European migrants as threatening and many Scottish school-leavers feel similarly about English migrants. Voters of this kind form a big part of Yes support and the SNP needs them.The problem it creates for the party is that theyrsquore left trying to hold together a group that encompasses ethnocentrists who may hate the English and progressive identity liberals championing the rights of trans people. In any ordinary world, these two types wouldnrsquot belong to the same party and, as it turns out, not even independence is enough to keep some of the liberals within the SNP.The important question is where it goes from here and Sobolewska and Ford point out an apparent contradiction. The Brexit movement relied on its ethnocentrist hard-core while the SNP reached out beyond it, and yet Leave won and Yes lost. Why  Sobolewska and Ford say itrsquos because the attachment to Europe in England is weaker than the attachment many Scots feel for Britain. In other words, the SNP church was broad but still not broad enough.The obvious problem this creates for the SNP for the future is they need to broaden their congregation even furtherYes is to win, which means they cannot afford a threat to the coalition they already have. The likelihood, of course, is that people quitting the SNP over trans rights would still vote Yes, but elections could be dferent. If Sturgeon is to stay, and the SNP is to keep on winning, not just this election but the one after that too, the unholy alliance ndash the alliance that is under considerable strain ndash needs to hold for a long time yet.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

However, there is still some way to go before our inter-island service is of a standard we see where in Scotland.#Orkney SNP candidate for the Scottish Parliament elections Robert Leslie said that the additional funding was brilliant news for the islands. He said: “This delivers on the fairer ferry funding calls that have been made by Lib Dems and the local authority and shows that the SNP government is in full listening mode when it comes to island issues.“I look forward to these enhanced services and reduced fares being put in place. The next step will be to engage further with the local authority and other parties on the replacement of Orkney’s ancient internal ferry fleet.”SNP MSP for the Highlands and Islands Maree Todd added: “The additional £.m in funding for inter-island ferries is a positive development and delivers on a key ask from local authority partners at a time of unprecedented financial pressure on the Scottish budget.“Whilst it is the local authority that is wholly responsible for the ferry services they provide, the SNP Government is sympathetic to the financial pressures which fall on inidual local authorities, which we know have been heightened as a result of COVID-.#She added: “It’s worth pointing out that for a long time, local authorities received no funding from the Scottish Government to support inter-island ferries, it is only under the SNP that this has changed and increased over the years. Today, we have a pledge to meet the revenue ask in full, fulfilling the SNP government’s commitment to fair ferry funding.“Considering the draft Budget meets a key ask from the Liberal Democrats, I hope to see the party get behind the budget and support it through Parliament.”Orkney#s MSP, Liberal Democrat Liam McArthur said: “This additional funding for our leline internal ferry services is undoubtedly welcome. Having been promised ‘fair funding’ by the First Minister since the last election, it’s remarkable how the prospect of an upcoming election concentrates the minds of SNP ministers.“Welcome too is the proposal to fund RET on internal ferry services. Some of these are amongst the most expensive routes mile-for-mile anywhere in the country.“Given we are still waiting for RET on Pentland Firth routes three years after it was due to be introduced and  years after it was introduced on west coast routes, it may be premature to celebrate just yet.“Of course, this will not stop SNP politicians from being first in the queue to pat themselves on the back. Let’s not forget, however, that Orkney has consistently been short-changed on ferry funding over the course of this parliament since the promises made at the last election.“There is a strong argument for the millions in under-funding now to be repaid. Indeed, it is a case SNP ministers themselves have been making to the UK Government over VAT payments for Police Scotland. If it’s good enough for police funding, it’s good enough for ferry funding.”The co-covener of the Orkney Greens, Councillor Steve Sankey welcomed the #long overdue# news.#The Scottish Greens won an additional £.million for Orkney’s ferries out of the budget settlement in , and this time around the Scottish Government has finally got there itself, after years of pressure from the three island councils involved and opposition parties,# Councillor Sankey said.“We’ve been saying for years that the knock-on effect of having to fund the deficit in ferry funding has impacted on us here greatly, and has precipitated budgetary pressures throughout Orkney. We emphasised that the situation was grossly unfair, particularly when compared to the huge increases in funding afforded to Calmac out west. The news that OIC will receive £. million next year is a relief, and will enable improvements in service such as Sunday sailings to the outer isles.#Councillor Sankey concluded: “Fairness with funding is all we’ve ever asked for, and now  years after Road Equivalent Tarf was first piloted, it seems that it will also finally be rolled out on our internal routes, although there is still no mention of the Pentland Firth.“Whilst this is good news, it now means that we turn our attention to the replacement process for our ancient ferry fleet which ranges in age from  to  years. It’s essential that any replacement proposals commit to a renewable fuel component, be it hydrogen, ammonia or electric, so that we can greatly reduce the high carbon emissions that afflict our marine transport sector.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The vote of the people must be respected and civilian leaders released.mdash Boris JohnsonFebruary , The militaryrsquos actions received swt and widespread international condemnation.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Twitter: ldquoI condemn the coup and unlawful imprisonment of civilians, including Aung San Suu Kyi, in Myanmar. The vote of the people must be respected and civilian leaders released.New US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken issued a statement expressing ldquograve concern and alarm over the reported detentions.ldquoWe call on Burmese military leaders to release all government officials and civil society leaders and respect the will of the people of Burma as expressed in democratic elections, he wrote, using Myanmarrsquos former name.ldquoThe United States stands with the people of Burma in their aspirations for democracy, freedom, peace, and development. vw,vw,px, px\"A cyclist rides past a sign with an image of Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi in Yangon on Friday. Reports say Ms Suu Kyi has been placed under house arrest The office of the UN secretary-general was also among those to issue a statement condemning the developments as a ldquoserious blow to democratic reforms.Officials in China ndash one of Myanmarrsquos most important economic partners ndash said they are still gathering information about the latest developments.A foreign ministry spokesman said: ldquoChina is a friendly neighbour of Myanmar. We hope that all parties in Myanmar will properly handle their dferences under the constitutional and legal framework and maintain political and social stability.While Chinarsquos ruling Communist Party tends to favour fellow authoritarian regimes, it has had a fractious history with Myanmarrsquos military, sometimes related to its campaigns against ethnic Chinese minority groups and the drug trade along their long, mountainous border.The detention of the politicians and cuts in television signals and communication services on Monday were the first signs that plans to seize power were in motion. Phone and internet access to Naypyitaw was lost and Ms Suu Kyirsquos National League for Democracy party could not be reached. Phone service in other parts of the country was also reported down, though people were still able to use the internet in many areas.The Irrawaddy, an established online news service, reported that Ms Suu Kyi, who as state counsellor is the nationrsquos top leader, and the countryrsquos president, Win Myint, were both detained in the pre-dawn hours. The news service cited Myo Nyunt, a spokesman for the NLD.Its report said that the partyrsquos Central Executive Committee members, lawmakers and regional Cabinet members had also been taken into custody.A list of other people believed to have been detained, compiled by political activists who asked not to be named for security reasons, included filmmaker Min Htin Ko Ko Gyi, writer Maung Thar Cho, and prominent veterans of the countryrsquos  student protest movement, such as Ko Ko Gyi and Min Ko Naing. Their detention could not immediately be confirmed. vw,vw,px, px\"Aung San Suu Kyi watches the vaccination of health workers at a hospital in Naypyitaw last week Amid the bickering over the allegations, the military last Tuesday ramped up political tension when a spokesman at its weekly news conference, responding to a reporterrsquos question, declined to rule out the possibility of a coup.Major General Zaw Min Tun elaborated by saying the military would ldquofollow the laws in accordance with the constitution.Using similar language the Commander-in-Chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, told senior officers in a speech on Wednesday that the constitution could be revokedthe laws were not being properly enforced. Adding to the concern was the unusual deployment of armoured vehicles in the streets of several large cities.On Saturday, however, the military denied it had threatened a coup, accusing unnamed organisations and media of misrepresenting its position and taking the generalrsquos words out of context.On Sunday, it reiterated its denial, this time blaming unspecied foreign embassies of misinterpreting the militaryrsquos position and calling on them ldquonot to make unwarranted assumptions about the situation.copy -.

In the islands, Highland and rural areas and villages across the country, BBs and self-catering properties are often the only tourism accommodation, and the spend by their guests supports these fragile economies.“The business owners on today’s webinar were understandably very concerned that the poorly-drafted ‘Short-Term Lets’ licensing legislation would be hugely onerous to microbusinesses in Skye and right across Scotland and would be a catastrophic ‘double whammy’ after these very same, small family businesses have been so disproportionately hit by Covid-.”SkyeConnect maintain that the fees for licensing accommodation with the council could be as high as £, per business. that the process to determine the fees has not been completed, and urged those affected to respond to the Parliamentary consultation before the cut-off date of this Friday. The draft regulations, published just before Christmas, will then be considered by the Local Government and Communities Committee.A spokeswoman added: “The fees are not proposed to be the subject of a statutory instrument but instead are at the discretion of each local authority to set. However, the fees must be set to ensure they are sufficient to cover the local authority’s administrative expenses.“In order to calculate this, it requires work to be carried out with our finance department as to the cost of processing and determining a licence taking into account income vs expenditure. It also requires to take into account the cost of resourcing the new licensing regime including factors such as recruiting additional staff, building and IT costs.“In terms of setting dfering levels of fees, this also needs to be assessed based on whether the processing of these applications will take longer, ie be more costly to administer.“This is an ongoing exercise and ultimately cannot be completed until the draft Regulations are finalised and we know for certain what types of letting premises will or will not be included within the licensing regime. Once this is known, it will require a paper to go to the Licensing Committee on the setting of fees for their determination.” she had “raised the concerns of constituents# with the Housing Minister Kevin Stewart. She also stressed the importance of responding to the consultation.She added: “I fully understand the concern of those across Skye and Lochalsh. In particular, I realise that the tourism industry has been through the most awful time. To that end, the deadlines associated with this have been extended to April  so that the sector has some breathing space. The purpose of the licensing scheme is a set of mandatory standards which apply to all short-term lets and I imagine that the vast majority of hosts already comply with all of these standards – and more.”A working group is currently being established to develop guidance, she said, and there will “definitely be a representative from the BB sector, as well as self-catering to “influence, inform and shape” that guidance.She also maintained that the Scottish BB Association responded to both Scottish Government consultations on the issue, in  and , and were “clear that they were in favour of levelling the playing field between BBs and properties listed on s such as Airbnb.”Ms Forbes added: “In terms of fees, there has been much concern about fees of several thousand points. The Scottish Government has not specied the specic fee level that local authorities should charge, and there is scope for local authorities to consider setting dferent fees for dferent types of short-term lets.“As the MSP for Skye and Lochalsh I will ensure that the concerns of SkyeConnect and others are passed on to those steering the legislation through parliament.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CARBOST-SHOP-1.jpg","title":"community purchase secures future for carbost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe project was delayed due to the first covid lockdown and since then the Carbost Community Shop Community Interest Company has been working hard to organise the legal side of the purchase.: “We are so pleased that everything has gone through at last and the current owner, Sharon Thacker, has been so supportive and patient during the whole process.

Officials recommended approval.A motion tabled by Skye councillor John Gordon to reject the application was seconded and supported by Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and fellow Skye councillor Calum MacLeod. It was defeated by eight votes to six.A statement on behalf of a number of Stein locals opposed to the Morgans’ development said: “Obviously, the community is shocked and deeply disappointed at the decision made at planning committee yesterday.“It is widely felt that what we are seeing is the result of a planning system that is broken. A system that has lost all integrity of intention and total collapse in community trust and respect.

Neither does it take account of the numerous natural heritage and wildle issues raised.”Approving the application “makes a mockery of the term conservation area and neither does the proposal comply with the terms” of Highland Council’s own local plan, the statement said.It added: “From the moment this application, with very signicant potential for detrimental impact, was accepted into the system amidst the strictest part of the pandemic lockdown, it has been felt that it sought to subvert the right of the local community to fair comment.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/James-Rebanks-and-dogs-credit-Andrew-Heading-edited.jpg","title":"we can learn a lot from old henry of the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineHis debut book, ‘It’s A Shepherd’s Le’ — which I stumbled on by accident— went on to become a best-seller.It’s a wonderfully evocative account of the massive challenges and privilege of being a hill farmer in the fells of the Lake District.Like all good writing, it doesn’t feel like reading you are just taken on an effortless journey of the imagination.I’ve never been to the Lake District myself, but from all accounts it’s quite spectacular — a bit like our own Highlands — and Rebanks captures that vividly.But what comes across more than anything is the sense of privilege he feels from being connected to the land, the massive challenges of trying to make a living from a harsh environment and his profound sadness that a way of le which was once the bedrock of rural communities is now fast disappearing. The parallels to our own circumstances is quite striking.His second offering, ‘English Pastoral’, offers a bit more optimism. Once again it’s a tremendously easy read and we are back on the fells, among the distinctive Herdwick sheep, the cattle, the characters — in particular his grandfather whose farm he inherited —and the drystone dykes. Except this time we are offered a lesson, and it is one that should make us sit up and take notice.Through charting the history of his home valley, Rebanks shows how agricultural practices have changed over the course of time and goes on to explain how similar trends have taken place throughout the UK and, indeed, across the globe.After the Second World War, governments rigorously pursued policies of producing more and more food. Farmers were offered huge subsidies and incentives, so farms became bigger, semi unproductive land improved through mechanisation and modern practices, and on and on the juggernaut ploughed.Then came the supermarkets. Their over-riding aim was to drive down prices, so farms had to become more efficient. Economies of scale became the mantra. Traditional family farms disappeared, swallowed up by larger businesses, machines became bigger and more expensive and farmers became captains of industry and capitalists.None of this happened overnight, of course, but it is heartbreaking to read of the struggles of the Rebanks’ own traditional family farm, trying to stay afloat financially while competing with the drive for modernisation going on all around them. The le of a hill farmer —or crofter for that matter — can seem romantic, but the reality is often very dferent.Eventually, Rebanks’ father had an epiphany – and it was something that the younger ones had also realised. And it was all to do with ‘Old Henry’.Old Henry was a neighbouring farmer, an eccentric bachelor. As all those around him invested in new machinery and chemical fertilisers, Old Henry never bothered, or even seemed to care.He just continued in his own stubborn way, farming the way it had been done for generations with native breeds of livestock, cutting hay well into the autumn , thistle and weeds adorning every nook and cranny and his old stone barns more a haven for birdle than serving any useful practical purpose.Rebanks always used to take more than a passing glance at this farm. With its vast array of wildle and ancient practices, it reminded him of the way his grandfather’s farm used to be.When Old Henry passed away, the inevitable happened and the farm was broken up and sold to larger businesses. The agronomists came with their scientic degrees to survey the land and assess what inputs were required to transform this antiquated model into profitable production. Their conclusion astounded them: never before had they seen soil so healthy. It required not a jot of chemical input.And here’s the crux of the lesson: Old Henry was onto something, whether knowingly or not. And the Rebanks were to take heed.Over the course of time, as the drive for greater efficiency became ever more necessary, farmers began to specialise in one or maybe two products – whether that was focusing on huge livestock numbers or on a particular crop. Traditional mixed rotation became a thing of the past. It was seen as unnecessary, as chemical fertilisers and pesticides could ensure continued productivity and profitability.But, through time, it all led, perhaps inevitably, to the destruction of the soil and natural environment. The evidence was there all along, but perhaps no-one had the time or inclination to see. The farmland birds — the curlew, the lapwing, the corncrake — were disappearing the earthworms, such a crucial indicator of soil health, non-existent. ‘Modernisation’ had come at a very heavy price indeed.And so the Rebanks family began to reassess. Fast-forward to today and their family hill farm now derives part of its income from subsidies geared towards environmental improvement: from the hedgerows planted, the trees, the fenced off waterways, from ious bits of wildle havens dotted around the farm.But, be under no mistake, this is still very much a working livestock business, just that the main enterprise is now dove-tailed with nature and bioersity, just as it once was through natural occurrence back in his grandfather’s day.There is a growing realisation that this is the way forward for agriculture and land use – and might even be a way of getting the wider populace to warmly embrace the countryside once again.Due to simple economics and geography, a lot of the ‘modernisation’ of which the book speaks passed crofting by, so who knows maybe we could be in the vanguard of this new agricultural and land-use enlightenment – given the proper vision and the right political will, of course.As Old Henry of the fells so ably demonstrated in his own idiosyncratic way, there’s a lot to be said for the old ways. Maybe it is time to re-connect with the past."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3595857.jpg--.jpg?1611825143000\n","title":"big ballymena response sought for big garden birdwatch 2021","story":"RSPB NI is hoping that more people from the Ballymena area than ever will celebrate their love of nature and unite to count garden birds at the end of January for the annual Big Garden Birdwatch.In the past year, it’s been clear to see how important the natural world is to everyone’s mental health and wellbeing. There has been a surge in interest in the nature on our doorsteps and many people have come to rely on garden birds to bring joy and comfort in these unsettling times. This year’s event takes place on Friday , Saturday  and Sunday  January. People are being asked to spend just one hour watching and recording the birds in their garden, then send their results to the RSPB. Close to half a million people join in the Birdwatch every year across the UK. Just under , people from Northern Ireland took part last year.Anne-Marie McDevitt, RSPB NI Head of Species, said: “With more people having to stay at home over the past year, everyone has been spending more time outdoors and in gardens and I think as a result have been noticing nature more and having more time to engage with it.“Last year people were asking usmore birds were singing during the lockdown, but it’s not that there has been more wildle about it’s just that we’ve had more time and space to notice it.“By taking part in the Big Garden Birdwatch, you are helping to build an annual snapshot of how our birdle is doing. It is only by us understanding how our wildle is faring that we can protect it. We’ve noticed that more people have signed up now for the Birdwatch than had at this stage last year, which is fantastic. We know that nature is in crisis and together we can all take action to solve the problems facing it. Nature needs us.”Just one hour every year for the last four decades has made the RSPB’s Big Garden Birdwatch the world’s largest garden wildle citizen science project. Now in its nd year,  million birds have been counted. Last year’s results showed that house sparrows remained at the top of the Big Garden Birdwatch rankings in Northern Ireland, with an average of almost five sparrows being spotted in gardens. Collared doves flew into the top , replacing coal tits, while sightings of goldfinches and robins were up too.While counties Down and Tyrone both had the same top two in  , starlings were the most-spotted birds in counties Antrim, Armagh and Derry-Londonderry – ahead of house sparrows – while Fermanagh’s number one bird was the chaffinch.Big Garden Birdwatch continues to highlight the winners and losers in the garden bird world. While house sparrows and starlings may be the UK’s most commonly sighted birds, a closer look at Big Garden Birdwatch data shows that numbers have dropped dramatically since the Birdwatch began in .

I have always been clear that the furlough and the self-employed schemes are essential and must remain in place until there are clear signs of economic recovery.“Since last March, I have lobbied hard with national government on this issue and I will continue to do so. It is vital workers across Northern Ireland must be able to access the support they need, not just to protect their livelihoods now, but to be in a position to plan ahead towards recovery with some degree of certainty.“It is so important that we get infections under control and allow people and business to get back to work as soon as is feasible in order to begin the process of recovery. However, these figures demonstrate that too many workers are still reliant on this essential support. Therefore it is too early to consider stopping it.“That is why I am calling on the Chancellor to extend both schemes beyond the end of April .”According to HMRC figure, Northern Ireland has a % take-up rate on the CJRS of eligible employments as at  December. This is as increase on the % take-up rate at the end of September.Around , self-employed iniduals in Northern Ireland had claimed the third SEISS grant up to  December , totalling poundm.

The latest figures show a total of , first doses and , second doses – bringing the overall number of vaccines administered to , Today’s figures provide a further indication of important progress in the roll-out of vaccines to combat the virus. In addition: * Mobile vaccination teams have administered first doses in all of Northern Ireland’s care homes - and second doses to over % of the homes. * We have vaccinated % of the  year olds and over, and have started to vaccinate  –  year olds through the GP programme. * Online booking was opened on Wednesday night for - year-olds to book their vaccination appointments in one of NI’s seven regional vaccination centres. In the first  hours of the online portal, , people had booked their vaccination jabs. Intensive work has been undertaken to address teething problems with the online system, linked to high levels of demand. * A further signicant consignment of the Astra Zeneca vaccine is due in NI next week, for immediate distribution to GPs. This will help facilitate a rapid acceleration of vaccinations for those over  and patients who are Clinical Extremely Vulnerableto Covid-. * In another important development on the vaccine front, a large-scale UK trial for a new coronavirus vaccine indicates it to be .% effective against the virus. The Novavax vaccine is expected to be available across the UK in the second half of this year,approved for use by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency  People in Northern Ireland have played a key role in the development of Novavax. Nearly  participants were recruited from Northern Ireland for the trial which was led locally by researchers from Queen’s University Belfast and the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust. Health Minister Robin Swann said: “I want to thank everyone working on the vaccination programme right across Northern Ireland. “This is a massive logistical exercise and I am very encouraged by the strong start we have made. It should be remembered that the first Covid- vaccine approval was only announced last month, with the second approval coming some four weeks later. We have made great strides forward since then. “There will inevitably be frustrations along the way. We will get to everyone - we are getting to thousands more each day.” Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride thanked everyone involved in the Novavax trial. He said: “The rapid development of Covid- vaccines is our long-term route map out of this pandemic. We should be rightly proud that Northern Ireland continues to play its part in the historic global effort to develop new drug treatments and vaccines. Throughout our response we have all come together in support of each other. We continue to see the benefits of the partnership between academia, health and industry and this another example.” The Department of Health this week announced a twin track approach to accelerating NI’s vaccination programme - ensuring more people can take up the offer of vaccination and help protect themselves against Covid-. GPs will be focusing on the  plus age group with the Astra Zeneca vaccine, while the seven regional vaccination centres will in parallel be offeringPfizer vaccination appointments to - year-olds. The plans are to offer everyone over  in NI a vaccine by the end of February. People who are Clinical Extremely Vulnerableto Covid- are also a priority for February. GPs will be vaccinating a large proportion of CEV patients. The twin track approach will see the Trust vaccination centres offering vaccines to CEV patients who are frequent hospital attenders."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1612024107217.jpg--covid_19___sat_30th_jan_figures.jpg?1612024107000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20210130newscovid 19 sat 30th jan figures","story":" The NI Department of Health dashboard shows a further  coronavirus related deaths and  new positive cases.  deaths occurred outside of the current reporting period.

The duo also raised money during last summer#s lockdown to buy washing machines for a group of vulnerable families. My background is in teaching and I do a lot of school support work for the organisation I am with now, explained Peter.The big thing over the last while is laptops and devices for homeschooling. The fact we are in another lockdown means this issue has raised its head again.Jackie is a social worker and works directly with families in the area. We spoke a couple of weeks ago and he said this was a real problem.As soon as the money clears from the crowdfunding, we are going to buy loads of devices and second-hand refurbished ones and get them out to local schools around Leicester. If those kids haven#t got broadband and Wi-Fi, we will also be trying to work with companies to get dongles and access sorted.It is quite a local project, but it will make a big dference to those families. I have two kids of my own and it is hard enough as an ex-teacher even to motivate them to do home learning. I just can#t imagine what it is like for families with no devices, or maybe only one between three kids.The Northern Ireland connection to the project doesn#t end with Peter and Jackie, with the studio space for the gigs provided by Jon O#Neill - whose family is originally from Omagh - and his Yellow Bean Studios.Formerly gigging around Belfast in his student days, Peter explained having the chance to play to the virtual audience over the weekend has been a great buzz.It was brilliant being back in a room - albeit socially distanced - and seeing mates and colleagues, added Peter.Lots of the guys have lost out on touring and their careers have been put on hold. They continue to dig deep themselves and are so generous with their talent. Getting to play music again is fantastic. We#re delighted with the amount raised so far and the response to the gigs.Anyone wishing to donate to the BroadBand Aid project should visit: https:www.crowdfunder broadband-aidBelfast Most ReadCovid rules dead and buried: UVF chiefs caught breaking regulations at loyalist funeral Michael Stone#s gun used by IRA to kill babyCo Armagh woman accused of forcing man into sexual activityEamon McCourt#s family cut ties with Sinn Fein after funeralSinn Fein councillor praises #great send-off# for ex-IRA prisoner Eamon McCourtLatest EducationDeluge of parents wanting kids to repeat year #a recipe for chaos#Controversial plans to merge three Co Down schools into new , pupil grammar school press aheadViewpointOpinionDecision on schools tough but necessarySteps must be taken to help pupils prepare forto the classroom, urges AllianceLatest from Belfast Bloody Sunday: low key memorial service heldExplainer: Why is the military taking control in Myanmar Pernille Harder says equality fight should focus on facilities and opportunitiesBoy, , with brain injury raises £, to save disability activity centreIs Self-Build on your Agenda for  ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The trusts and boards that did not use this method instead used direct culture for their testing, out of step with national guidance.No health boards in Wales or trusts in Northern Ireland reported using ECM methodology for testing while % of trusts in England and % of regional NHS boards in England carried out this form of testing.Jane Plumb MBE, Group B Strep Support chief executive, said: There#s no point in expert bodies like the RCOG producing clinical best practice guidelinesthey#re not being adopted on the front line.Our research has found many trusts and boards are not giving pregnant women information on GBS, denying them an informed choice about their care. Equally worryingly, a majority are using the wrong test to look for GBS carriage, potentially leaving them vulnerable to expensive legal challengethings go wrong.The investigation, which received a % response rate from all organisations in England, Scotland and Wales, found two-thirdsof trusts used the wrong swab test to try and detect GBS in a pregnant woman - just % of organisations took both vaginal and rectal swabs to test for the bacteria, in line with national guidance.Less than halfof the  organisations surveyed gave information about the bacteria to all pregnant women, with % saying they provided informationGBS was detected and % also providing it upon request.Almost a fthof NHS trusts had not updated their local guidelines since the RCOG guidance was published in .While women can harmlessly carry the bacteria, GBS is the UK#s most common cause of severe infection in newborn babies, causing sepsis, pneumonia and meningitis.Approximately  babies a year in the UK develop the infection in their first three months of le. Of these,  babies will die, with another  survivors left with le-changing disabilities.The charity gave one example, Baby Quinn, born in January  and developed GBS.His mother, Laura Sparks, had heard about GBS in her second pregnancy and made a mental note to get tested but because she was not given any further information at the hospital, it slipped her mind.This meant she did not know she was a carrier and could not take action to prevent his infection.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNew guidance on hauliers picking up multiple loads for transfer from Great Britain to Northern Ireland has been published By Michael McHugh, PAJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailNew guidance on hauliers picking up mixed food loads for transfer from Great Britain to Northern Ireland has been published.The industry gave a cautious welcome to the Government advice.The Northern Ireland Protocol keeps the country in line with EU trade rules and animal products require special certication.A statement from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairssaid: “Freight volumes into Northern Ireland’s ports are at normal levels for this time of year and there have been no signicant queues.Our new approach to the movement of mixed food loads into Northern Ireland, known as groupage, is more flexible and gives businesses further options as to how they meet the required SPS checksDefra statement“We have always been clear that as the Northern Ireland Protocol is implemented we would work very closely with industry and DAERAto improve ways of operating.“Our new approach to the movement of mixed food loads into Northern Ireland, known as groupage, is more flexible and gives businesses further options as to how they meet the required SPSchecks and we will continue to offer our support to hauliers and suppliers as this beds in.”Agriculture departments in Northern Ireland and Great Britain have worked with hauliers to establish the new groupage model which will aid the movements of these loads into Northern Ireland.Following successful trials with industry involving taking goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, two groupage models have been agreed.Groupage means lorries in the rest of the UK picking up goods at multiple points for transit across the Irish Sea.It is a common method of reducing delivery costs for smaller retailers.Paperwork required due to the protocol had created problems with that because lorry containers were being opened and resealed multiple times.Defra proposed two models, one using “consolidation hubs” in which all mixed products arrived at one premises, were consolidated and certied as a single unit then sealed.Logistics UK is cautiously optimistic that the solution proposed will help prevent delaysAlex Veitch, Logistics UKThe other, known as a “linear model”, meant every inidual consignment like an inidual pallet would be checked and sealed by a certying officer before the haulier moved on to the next pick-up.The consolidated load would be sealed at the final point of dispatch before leaving for the port.Haulage industry body Logistics UK’s general manager of policy Alex Veitch said it followed pressure from the sector to ease the administrative burden after Brexit.He said: “Logistics UK is cautiously optimistic that the solution proposed will help prevent delays, by reducing the number of vehicles needing to be inspected on arrival in Northern Irelandadministered correctly.“The sector will continue to work closely with both Defra and DAERA as the scheme develops, because it is still untested for larger volumes of traffic and it is clear that further IT developments will be required as the system evolves.“As the scheme expands, it will be vital for government to work closely with Great Britain companies sending goods to Northern Ireland to ensure they are fully briefed on how to prepare groupage loads of SPS goods for Northern Ireland.”PAMost ReadCovid rules dead and buried: UVF chiefs caught breaking regulations

As that snow starts to fall as rain later on and falling on cold ground, it could turn to black ice and turn the snow rather slushy.This could cause further issues as we head into Tuesday evening and is likely to leave many untreated rural roads particularly troublesome for drivers and essential workers.The message is to take extra precautions. We always advise people to keep up-to-date and we do review the warnings regularly. The government advice at the moment is to keep all travel essential. Any journey that can be delayed by a day would be advisable and suggested.Moving beyond Tuesday, while it will briefly turn milder on Wednesday, there is still the potential for further wintry weather into Thursday and the weekend, with colder air ing from the north. More likely is that any precipitation will fall as rain. However, the risk of ice is likely to remain.The middle of the week and onwards will be temporarily less cold for a short time, but ing colder weather is expected for the end of the week and indeed into next weekend, added Mr Miall.We are definitely not out of the woods just yet with regard to winter weather.Belfast Most ReadCovid rules dead and buried: UVF chiefs caught breaking regulations at loyalist funeral Michael Stone#s gun used by IRA to kill babyCo Armagh woman accused of forcing man into sexual activityEamon McCourt#s family cut ties with Sinn Fein after funeralSinn Fein councillor praises #great send-off# for ex-IRA prisoner Eamon McCourtLatest Northern IrelandBloody Sunday: low key memorial service heldStrep test not given to pregnant women in NIDissidents protect fugitive gangster Hutch on visits to NI relativesOnline hit: Busker hopes to keep #special boy# Noah in our hearts with his songUnionists urged to work together to #unstitch wicked NI protocol#Latest from Belfast Bloody Sunday: low key memorial service heldPunish football hooligans who direct racist abuse at players, says Gene SimmonsTSB plummets to £m loss amid impairments and branch closuresBoris Johnson condemns Myanmar coup and calls for people’s vote to be respectedJane Fonda shares Covid vaccine moment,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Covid lockdowns and travel restrictions across the EU  UK will reduce forecast FY traffic to between m and m , with more risk towards the lower end of the range.“While Q visibility remains limited due

It eyes a small bird skipping along in front of it. The cat crouches and snarls, but its all a bit half-hearted. The bird flies off. The cat continues its stroll up the hill towards the Heaney HomePlace. Nonplussed. Its a common feeling at the moment as people battle the lockdown-enhanced January blues. Though it isnt quite business as usual, Bellaghy is far from a ghost town.  The scene last week at Bellaghys mini-roundabout. A steady flow of lorries navigate its narrow streets as they head for the roomier surroundings promised by A dual carriageway. googletag.cmd.push Occasionally, a slow-moving vehicle leads a convoy of frustrated motorists through the town. There are no traffic lights, but an unwritten system appears to be in place. Motorists wave pedestrians across the road and traffic pauses accordingly to facilitate their safe passage. Polite waves are offered in . Several notices placed on buildings up and down Main Street implore drivers not to park in front of their access gates. One is particularly vocerous in its insistence, with a huge notice in red above the entry and a smaller one on either side. I find myself hoping someone does park there. Ive a feeling the fallout would be spectacular. googletag.cmd.push A neon sign above the Spar shop transmits a silent traders call. Hawking wares for the st century. Skinny whips - pound. Coors  pack - pound.. Tempting. The intermittent thermometer displayed on the screen keeps passers-by up to date on the current temperature. Greying sky unleashes a squall of hail, prompting a waiting NI Electricity worker to take shelter under the canopy of Poets Corner.  The cafe itself is open for takeaway food and drinks. Inside, the woman behind the screen says it has been quiet so far today. Its cold outside, she offers by way of explanation. “Seven degrees,” I inform her, drawing on Spars meteorological information.     It doesnt stay quiet too long as the lunch time trade begins to build. The cafe operates responsibly, only permitting two customers inside at a time. Mask compliance is high in the village. Owner Rebecca explains they take the safety precautions seriously. “We try our best to make sure there arent many queues, we cant have people standing in the shop, or anything like that,” she says. “Its horrible to see the other places closed. I would know the owner of the bar next door very well, its a sin to see everywhere closed and people not working. “We closed during the first lockdown and didnt open again until June, but we didnt get any grants or anything because we were a new business. “This time we stayed open because we have got so busy with the takeaways that we can still operate, which is a good thing. “There werent as many people about at all during the first lockdown, but there seem to be more out walking about now. “The shops are definitely quieter, but there are more people out walking around to exercise.” A man in the cafe who had greeted me exuberantly up the street does so again. His enthusiasm is infectious, social distancing or not. Those brief interchanges, that leave a smile on your face, have even greater effect these days. People remain resolute despite all setbacks. Heading up Castle Street, it becomes apparent just how quiet the shops actually are. A sign in the charity shop window informs passers-by it is closed until further notice. Turf Man hard at it. The hairdressers next door lies in darkness, as does the barber further up the street. Outside the Bellaghy Bawn, though, Turf Man is perpetually busy. I tweet out a picture, asking people to guess the location. One reply suggests I wont get many quotes off Turf Man. The quiet man at the quiet end of town. Walking down the Ballyscullion Road towards Paacuteirc Seaacuten de Bruacuten, the traffic noise subsides to a faint rumble. My footsteps begin to echo off the low walls of the houses on my left. A bottle blown across the road by the stf breeze rattles into earshot, against a backdrop of chirping birds. It is quiet down here. Some walkers are braving the changeable weather to get their steps in. A woman walking her dog walks along the empty stand on the far side of the pitch. I contemplate the plaque commemorating Sean Brown. The words remembering his tragic death are framed by a bleak sky. In need of inspiration, I head for Seamus Heaneys grave. At the chapel, two men are standing on scaffolding that reaches half way up its tower, staring upwards. With all churches closed, they can work largely undisturbed. The grave of Seamus Heaney. There is no one  in the graveyard, not even weary home-schooling parents taking a school trip to the Poet Laureates resting place. On the way back into the town, three children are playing in the yard of Bellaghy Primary School. A member of staff supervises. Their laughter carries on the breeze all the way down the hill. If only the drivers shooting disapproving looks at each other on the roundabout could hear it. Throughout Bellaghy, there are sets of outdoor chairs set into the concrete pavements. Under normal circumstances, people would be passing their lunchtime sitting in them, chatting to others. As I sit outside the pharmacy, the postman pulls up to the Spar, collecting letters and parcels from its post office. An NI Water van passes through. An Ulsterbus carrying just two passengers. Tractors rattle busily up and down the street. A DHL delivery van approaches the roundabout, the driver glancing at the street signs before turning left towards Castledawson. The unsung are quietly grafting away, navigating the pandemic and ensuring le goes on. No rest for the essential.  Back in the car, a radio bulletin announces the Northern Ireland Executive have extended lockdown measures for a month. Normalitys odds have ened. So much of normal le feels empty at present. The constant cycle of infection, sickness and death has hollowed it out. Leaving Bellaghy, Im struck by the symbolism of those empty chairs. Despite your best efforts, sometimes grim reminders are impossible to avoid.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ladies football and camogie, while they bring so much to the association, are still on the fringes. To a few, they have the same respect as their male counterparts, but not by all. I write this as the news breaks of Kamala Harris being sworn in as the first female Vice President of the USA, at a time when new President Joe Biden set about uniting the country. The camogieand ladies footballboards were formed after the main body of the GAA in , but to many they have always come under the loose GAA umbrella. But officially, and more importantly, they should all be part of one association. googletag.cmd.push At county level, venues for camogie and ladies are rolled out after football and hurling have theirs set in stone. Its not uncommon for teams to be finalising their training without knowing where they are playing. Just like in Croke Park, all provinces and counties have their separate fixtures boards. But Id like to see it all rolled into one. It just makes sense on so many levels. Teresa McKennaand Colette Darraghare exceptionally helpful when seeking information for games. Likewise, Breige ONeill with all things football and hurling. No doubt there will be a degree of working together in the background. Why not take it a step further, with a central committee that leads the ious codes  googletag.cmd.push There is so much common ground. And, overall, it would help on so many fronts – promotion, sponsorship, links to the media, sorting referees and venues. The benefits are endless. God rest Hugh McWilliams, but his HA brand is emblazoned across all Derry and Ballinascreen gear. Hurling and camogie. Ladies and mens football. That says it all. Uniting all parties is not something that could be done over night and it wouldnt be without its teething problems, but it should be granted adequate time at the committee table. When you think of the households across Ireland, where players are representing the ious codes. It makes sense to have a more joined up approach.     Last week, I spoke to Magherafelts Sara Gribben who has been the clubs camogie Chairperson for  years and she is very highly thought of for the efforts she puts in. Likewise, a lot of males have channelled a lot of effort for the betterment of camogie and ladies football. As a wider association, total integration is the way forward. A few years back, Slaughtneil ran a highly successful fundraising draw. At the heart of it was Bernie McEldowney, who worked diligently with her husband Eamon, as they kept tabs on over poundk. The Emmets adopted the GAAs One Club model. The senior captains and coaching officers of all three codes are on it. There is also a fair sprinkling of all codes across the main committee. And so it should. Desertmartin Chairman Pat Kidd is proud that their club committee has many women on board as men. In , the GAA, Ladies Football and Camogie Association came together to produce a -page set of guidelines for clubs to run their affairs. When you think about the amount of dferent skills a clubs membership now has, the potential is endless. There are experts in fundraising, coaching, running events, health and well-being, all with the personality to link into the local community. It can betied together with the use of technology. It gives everyone the chance of belonging. The only drawback can be those looking out for their own kids, but a strong chairperson and high standards will quickly knock that on the head. I just think that all this potential can be railroadedthe GAA is not totally united. There is a school of thought that feels the mens side have invested all the money in sponsorship and infrastructure and should keep the mainstream GAA on its own. In my opinion, thats a very shallow mindset. In this day and age, equality is everything. Any organisation worth its salt will want the best people involved. Thats how the GAA needs to be sold. The USA, for the circus it has become over the past four years, has made a seismic statement by appointing Kamala Harris. Why  Because, like newly appointed Galway United manager Lisa Fallon, she is the best candidate. For the GAA, they know what all the ingredients have to offer at the top tables finest feast. So, its time to put them all on the official shopping list.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The boat, named Day Dawn N , ran ashore on August  last year and has remained anchored to the spot ever since. The retired fishing vessel had been acquired by Nathan Ross and Druso Martinez de Riquelme with a view to mooring it at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast as an Air B ‘n’ B. However, after running into dficulty last August, those plans have been put on hold. It was initially suspected that the tide was too low to refloat the boat. googletag.cmd.push However, the owners later revealed that the bigger issue was the fact that it’s suspended over a three and a half metre crater in the mudflats. In late November, the stars seemed to align to the sailors’ delight a high tide arrived and they secured the services of marine specialists to dig a channel under the boat in order to move it to a nearby marina. The drones were out to capture the moment Day Dawn made it back to sea. Unfortunately, their efforts proved unfruitful and, according to the owners, the operation cost a substantial sum of money. There has been little to no activity around the boat since the start of this year. googletag.cmd.push The Derry News asked Foyle Portthere will come a time when it may have to intervene orit’s possible the boat could become a permanent fixture on the River Foyle landscape. In response, a spokesperson said: “The responsibility for the movement of the boat remains firmly with the owners and we would encourage them to continue to do all they can to have the vessel re-floated. “This is an unfortunate situation that they have created and now must make every effort to employ further resources to deal with this problem. “We continue to monitor the location to ensure that the vessel poses no threat to the main navigation channel, nor that it is causing any unnecessary impact to the local environment.”     The boat owners were contacted for comment but none was provided at the time of publishing.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Colmcille  is a year-long commemoration marking the thanniversary of the birth of Colmcille - also known as Columba. Donegal County Council and Derry City  Strabane District Council are co-ordinating a programme for the year which includes a community grants scheme now open for applications until .pm on Friday thFebruary . Grants of €, or pound, are available for projects that primarily take place within the Donegal County Council or Derry City  Strabane District Council areas and the scheme is open to community organisations or groups iniduals working in partnership with communities. googletag.cmd.push The thanniversary recognises the importance and legacy of the th-century saint, not only for Donegal and Derry but for the island of Ireland, Scotland and across the world. The year-long celebrations will last from the thDecember  to thDecember . The programme being co-ordinated by the two councils is supported by key partners including the North West Development Fund, in conjunction with and supported by The Executive Office and The Irish Government. The programme builds on an Audit of Columban Heritage undertaken in  and is being delivered in partnership with a range of local, regional, national and international organisations. A dedicated Colmcille  Project Manager has recently been appointed as part of the programme to lead and co-ordinate cross-border commemorations for the year. googletag.cmd.push This will include a range of projects, events and activities as well as the grant scheme. The programme aims to raise knowledge and understanding of Colmcille and to establish a lasting legacy. The grant scheme will play an important role in this by supporting local communities to contribute to the year and its legacy. Colmcille  Project Manager, Deirdre Harte said Im delighted to be in post and excited for the year ahead. One of the first tasks has been to get a small grant scheme up and running to provide funding for projects that relate to any aspect of Colmcilles legacy, for example, through culture, heritage, arts, literature, spirituality, language, music or storytelling.     I would really encourage local groups to come up with creative ideas to mark this signicant anniversary which could include activities such as events, exhibitions, artwork or other projects with a strong Colmcille theme. COVID has provided unique challenges to commemorating Colmcille this year but there is an opportunity to bring celebrations to an international audience through virtual events for example. This is an exciting opportunity to showcase the creativity of our local communities and to open up Colmcilles legacy to new audiences of all ages. We look forward to seeing what ideas emerge.

Dr McGinley set up a small steering committee in  to fundraise before officially opening the Foyle Hospice in the city in  and, since that opening, the deeply-valued palliative care centre has been a source of great comfort and assistance to thousands of families across not only the city, but the entire district.

Mayor Tierney said his thoughts were with Dr McGinleys children Ciaran, Aisling, Ronan and Sinead, and his extended family and friends. I was deeply saddened today to learn of the news of Dr McGinleys passing, a man who has had such a profound effect on the lives of acountless number of families across our district and the wider North West region. It was after an encounter with a young man with terminal cancer that Dr McGinley pursued the idea of opening a palliative care facility in the city, and we are all immensely grateful for his determination, dedication and passion in following through and opening the Foyle Hospice. googletag.cmd.push Dr McGinley has left a legacy on this city and its people that will last for generations to come and we know that his vision will continue to be delivered by the hard-working team at Foyle Hospice. The Freedom of Derry was one of many deserving honours that Dr McGinley received but for him thats not what it was about – he wanted to help as many people and as many families as he could through some of their toughest days. My thoughts and prayers are with Dr McGinleys children, his wider family circle and his many friends. I hope that they can take some comfort in knowing how deeply loved and appreciated he was by all across this city, district and region.

He said: “The rapid development of Covid- vaccines is our long-term route map out of this pandemic. We should be rightly proud that Northern Ireland continues to play its part in the historic global effort to develop new drug treatments and vaccines. Throughout our response we have all come together in support of each other. We continue to see the benefits of the partnership between academia, health and industry and this another example.” The Department of Health this week announced a twin track approach to accelerating NI’s vaccination programme - ensuring more people can take up the offer of vaccination and help protect themselves against Covid-.

GPs will be vaccinating a large proportion of CEV patients. The twin track approach will see the Trust vaccination centres offering vaccines to CEV patients who are frequent hospital attenders.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The -year-old, captain at Derry City last season, had one year left on his contract at the Brandywell, but made a transfer request, which the club had reluctantly accepted. “I’m absolutely delighted to join Galway United,”McCormack said today. “I’m really looking forward to the start of the season now. It’s been a busy few days getting the deal over the line – I’m just pleased to finally get it done now. “John is a great manager, you can see what he did with Cork City, we had great success there together. I spent three years playing under him down there, now John’s come to Galway United, and hopefully we can replicate that success here. googletag.cmd.push “We will be targetinga strong start and hopefully the fans can get back into the stadium and drive us on until the end of the season.” It is a reunion for Galway manager John Caulfield and the midfielder who enjoyed success at Cork City together and the manager was understandably delighted to get his man. “Conor has got great leadership qualities, he’s a top player on the park and with the young squad that we have, I think he’s a perfect fit to come into what we’re trying to build at the club. “It’s taken a bit of time, Derry have been very cooperative, they obviously didn’t want to lose one of their top players, but Conor wanted to move further down and it’s a great fit for us. I’m thankful to our board for going out and helping to get him into the club and obviously our sponsors too. googletag.cmd.push “We’re getting a player that has won major trophies and played in several European games. Conor is going to come into our team and hopefully drive it forward, so that we can compete at the top of the table, that’s the reason we’ve gone out and brought him into the club. “Conor is only , he’s played with huge clubs in this league, and he’s won a lot of major honours. I’ve had Conor for a number of years, I’ve seen how he applies himself every day, he trains how he plays, and that’s what you want. His overall presence, not just on match night, but around the training ground and in the dressing room, he’s just a great leader.     “Conor is someone that our young players can look up to, because he’s a thorough professional. We’re really excited to have him at the club.” McCormack is understood to have had discussions with manager Declan Devine in the latter stages of last season about his desire to move closer to home. Club CEO Sean Barrett confirmed the move this weekend, adding: We reluctantly accepted Conors request to move closer to home for family reasons. We also had to be clear however that any move would have to be on Derry City FCs terms and as a consequence, we came to a suitable arrangement with Galway United. As a club we would like to thank Conor for his efforts both as a player and as our captain and we wish him every success in the future.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He has represented Ireland in multiple events over recent years and has quietly built up a reputation as one of the finest runners to come from the city.Eamon, a runner himself, decided to combine his passion of athletics and cinema, and, taking the skills he has learned working with McMatic Media, has directed and produced his first documentary.It has been a labour of love over the past two years for the -year-old.“Myself and my friend Paul Gormley, who is a producer alongside me on the project, went to Vienna to see Eliud Kipchoge break the two-hour barrier,” he explained.“We were going to make a film about running in general but when we were in Vienna we saw that it wasn’t really what we were looking for, so we talked about it and decided that instead of starting out globally, for our first film we would take it back home and start local.“One of the main characters in the film is Malcolm McCausland who is a real character in the film. We went to his house one night and talked about who we should make the film about. He said Conor was the man because he was a humble guy who has a great story about someone who wanted to represent Ireland internationally. He always showed great potential but once he hit really good form he would get injured, so it was about shining some light on him. The further I got into it, I studied Conor and realised that there was this wealth of archive spread across Ireland.“I rang Conor and asked himhe would be interested in an independent documentary and he said he would, which is where it was conceived.”Eamon’s approach to the film has evolved from that first trip to Vienna and that first conversation with Conor, and whilst the Spartan is the focus, the story is also about Derry itself and the impact of running in Ireland.“When I really honed in on it, I wanted to make the story Derry-based,” Eamon admitted.“The story is just as much about Derry and Ireland as it is about Conor. I started filming with Conor and then the story started to develop.“Conor had that summer when he ran in the Morton Games in Cork and was the fastest guy over m, running sub- which was the first time in  years that someone from Derry did that. He ultimately ends up running in the European Athletics Cross-Country.“Because his story expanded, I was able to follow him and show the European Athletics Association what I was doing.“They could see that I was doing it at a professional level so they allowed me their archive. They gave me unbelievable footage, so the story really expands at the end – it’s not just about Conor.” googletag.cmd.push  Film FestivalsOnce the film is complete, it will be entered into the Cork and Galway Film Festivals in the hope of being accepted.“It’s been quite the journey,” he stated.“It’s just under two years since I started. If it gets traction it might be later this year when we’ll be able to share it. I’m really excited about sharing it online. For me I want to go the professional route. I’ve invested my own money into this. No-one would help us, no-one would back us. It was just an idea.”The entire product is almost exclusively local and Eamon admits he could not have made it this far without a dedicated team.“It is home made,” he emphasises. “The music composed in it is very obvious and prominent and that’s by Composer James Curran. He’s done an unbelievable amount of work and he is someone who people should keep an eye on.“Colm Herron, who is Cameraman and Producer, went to Barcelona with me to film. Caoimhe Sweeney, who has a full other story herself, is a great artist. Her artwork is outstanding.“Jason Bonner also did fabulous work with the animation, while Fiachra OLongain was on nd Camera. There is a wealth of talent in it. The Derry creatives really came together and my friends really helped me bring it to fruition.“I’m just excited about it. We’ve needed a lot of patience during these teams but we’ve just been quietly working away and Conor has been amazing. The whole running community has also been amazing, so many of them have reached out.“When it’s released, I think it will just be a nice piece for the running community and for Conor. He is a really humble guy who doesn’t promote himself. All those nights he was out running, it will just be nice to see that. He has a lot more to come as well.”The challenges brought about by Covid- were unexpected but ultimately manageable for Eamon and his team, and they were finally able to show their work to Conor himself, ahead of the big realse later on this year.“It was scary showing it to Conor because we didn’t show him anything for a year,” Eamon laughed. “Fortunately his reaction was very positive.“Once that happened I could just enjoy it more. On the technical side, I’ve shown some other directors and they have given me good feedback for some tweaks. It’s exciting.“ It’s very much a Derry film and it will be nice to have Conor and Derry on the map for athletics.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He has represented Ireland in multiple events over recent years and has quietly built up a reputation as one of the finest runners to come from the city.Eamon, a runner himself, decided to combine his passion of athletics and cinema, and, taking the skills he has learned working with McMatic Media, has directed and produced his first documentary.It has been a labour of love over the past two years for the -year-old.“Myself and my friend Paul Gormley, who is a producer alongside me on the project, went to Vienna to see Eliud Kipchoge break the two-hour barrier,” he explained.“We were going to make a film about running in general but when we were in Vienna we saw that it wasn’t really what we were looking for, so we talked about it and decided that instead of starting out globally, for our first film we would take it back home and start local.“One of the main characters in the film is Malcolm McCausland who is a real character in the film. We went to his house one night and talked about who we should make the film about. He said Conor was the man because he was a humble guy who has a great story about someone who wanted to represent Ireland internationally. He always showed great potential but once he hit really good form he would get injured, so it was about shining some light on him. The further I got into it, I studied Conor and realised that there was this wealth of archive spread across Ireland.“I rang Conor and asked himhe would be interested in an independent documentary and he said he would, which is where it was conceived.”Eamon’s approach to the film has evolved from that first trip to Vienna and that first conversation with Conor, and whilst the Spartan is the focus, the story is also about Derry itself and the impact of running in Ireland.“When I really honed in on it, I wanted to make the story Derry-based,” Eamon admitted.“The story is just as much about Derry and Ireland as it is about Conor. I started filming with Conor and then the story started to develop.“Conor had that summer when he ran in the Morton Games in Cork and was the fastest guy over m, running sub- which was the first time in  years that someone from Derry did that. He ultimately ends up running in the European Athletics Cross-Country.“Because his story expanded, I was able to follow him and show the European Athletics Association what I was doing.“They could see that I was doing it at a professional level so they allowed me their archive. They gave me unbelievable footage, so the story really expands at the end – it’s not just about Conor.” googletag.cmd.push  Film FestivalsOnce the film is complete, it will be entered into the Cork and Galway Film Festivals in the hope of being accepted.“It’s been quite the journey,” he stated.“It’s just under two years since I started. If it gets traction it might be later this year when we’ll be able to share it. I’m really excited about sharing it online. For me I want to go the professional route. I’ve invested my own money into this. No-one would help us, no-one would back us. It was just an idea.”The entire product is almost exclusively local and Eamon admits he could not have made it this far without a dedicated team.“It is home made,” he emphasises. “The music composed in it is very obvious and prominent and that’s by Composer James Curran. He’s done an unbelievable amount of work and he is someone who people should keep an eye on.“Colm Herron, who is Cameraman and Producer, went to Barcelona with me to film. Caoimhe Sweeney, who has a full other story herself, is a great artist. Her artwork is outstanding.“Jason Bonner also did fabulous work with the animation, while Fiachra OLongain was on nd Camera. There is a wealth of talent in it. The Derry creatives really came together and my friends really helped me bring it to fruition.“I’m just excited about it. We’ve needed a lot of patience during these teams but we’ve just been quietly working away and Conor has been amazing. The whole running community has also been amazing, so many of them have reached out.“When it’s released, I think it will just be a nice piece for the running community and for Conor. He is a really humble guy who doesn’t promote himself. All those nights he was out running, it will just be nice to see that. He has a lot more to come as well.”The challenges brought about by Covid- were unexpected but ultimately manageable for Eamon and his team, and they were finally able to show their work to Conor himself, ahead of the big realse later on this year.“It was scary showing it to Conor because we didn’t show him anything for a year,” Eamon laughed. “Fortunately his reaction was very positive.“Once that happened I could just enjoy it more. On the technical side, I’ve shown some other directors and they have given me good feedback for some tweaks. It’s exciting.“ It’s very much a Derry film and it will be nice to have Conor and Derry on the map for athletics.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He also managed the club for  games over  and , saving the club from relegation in that infamous play-off against Finn Harps just over  years ago.Dykes, now assistant manager at Warrenpoint Town, has a wealth of League of Ireland experience and knows what it takes to succeed, having won the First Division title and FAI Cup with Sligo in , the Premier Division title with Derry City in  and again with Sligo Rovers in , as assistant manager to Ian Baraclough.Dykes is still an occasional visitor to the Brandywell and keeps up to date with his former team and after a disappointing year at the club last year, he can empathise with current boss Declan Devine on the pressure he may now be facing as he heads towards another season.“Its a dficult job and theres pressure on it,” he said.“The team that I played in were part-time, but Felix was the manager and we had a good core of lads in from Dublin and it worked really well. Derry have now gone full time andyoure bringing in a lot of players from England and Scotland youre taking a chance.“The football world being the way it is, you lose three games and youre under pressure. Its a really dficult job. In this modern world, does Derry have the financial punch to compete with the Dundalks and Shamrock Rovers  They didnt make Europe last year so Im sure that will affect their budget this year. We all know that Philip ODoherty puts a lot of his own money into it and only for him, where would it be  Its a very dficult job and theres no quick fix in it. I think Decky will do wellhes given time.” googletag.cmd.push  Highs and lowsDykes has experienced the highs and lows at Derry City and believes that with certain structures in place, consistent progress could be made at the club over the next few years.“I would always go with local players with Derry City because that helps,” he continued. “They finally got the Academy going and there was a lot of work that went on, but there was always a sprinkle of locals like Coyler, Peter Hutton, Paul Curran or Sean Hargan, there were always a few. You need that, and you need to look where, but thats dficult.“I always think the model that suits is the Bohemians model. You have Keith Long and Trevor Croly and they are part-time, but they are part time-full time. They are in Monday Tuesday, then theyre off, they have brought players back from England, they have got their education, and they work alongside football and that works really well for them.“For a club that was in serious trouble four years ago, they are going to be up challenging for titles. It should give Derry hope.“The other side of that is trying to attract players to Derry, and I know from being manager of Sligo and trying to attract players to Sligo, its not easy. Its very challenging.”That challenge is one which many Derry City managers have found challenging over the years. With the recent signings of Danny Lafferty and David Parkhouse, the numberplayers signed to the club in the past six years now stands at , with last season highlighting the risks of bringing players to Derry, who dont know the club, the league or the city.“Recruitment is key,” Dykes agreed.“If you have good recruitment, there are a lot of good players out there but a lot of players who might come over as well and see Derry as just a wage packet.“If you want to take a gamble on a player, you sign them for a season, buta player does well for a season, one of the bigger clubs come looking, so maybe it should be a policy to sign players on two-year contracts. I dont know.“A lot of it is geared by finances. I know when I was manager, Jim Roddy was a gentleman and really, really good to me, but it is dficult. We were part-time back then and we were trying to attract players from Dublin, and you werent getting the top players from Dublin, but yet you were paying top dollar to get them up the road.“Maybe they should look a wee bit at the Northern market. At the moment thats flying and there are some really, really good players. Coleraine are going well and they have some good young players andthey got some players who were originally from Derry and brought them back, I think that would be a great start for them. It ticks a box for them because youre getting good players and theres also that local Derry identity with it.”PressuresDespite the disappointment of , and the renewed expectation on the manager heading into the  season, Dykes believes that Devine will get the time to show that he can bring success to the club again, and is expecting, based on his own experience as manager, the current boss to get the backing he needs from the fans.“Derry and Sligo are very much alike in my opinion,” he explained. “Derry will always hold a special place for me and I love going back there. I always found the people there to be very friendly, even when things were going bad, it was really well supported. It is dficult though because youre in a glass bowl. I didnt live up there so I was still travelling up and down and that might have been a wee bit easier.“Sometimes, with full time players, you go to training in the morning, but what do you do in the afternoons  Idle hearts sometimes doesnt do much good, so I think the Bohemians model is something that Derry should look at.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Life.jpg","title":"A life in football well worth it for Andy  ","story":"ANDREW Waterworth has made his mark as one of the best Irish League strikers of his generation.Having started at Kilmore Rec, the  year-old Crossgar hit-man went on to get a taste of the full-time game with a move in  to Hamiliton in the Scottish Premiership after signing from Lisburn Distillery in a pound, deal.Following hishome he joined Glentoran, claiming Irish Cup and Irish Premiership titles during a five-year spell which ended in  when he made the switch to the Glensrsquo great rivals Linfield where he has enjoyed eight trophy-laden years.The Recorder caught up Waterworth to chat about his career, his work away from Linfield, and his hopes and ambitions for his post-playing days.CB: How have you been keeping during lockdown Andrew AW: It has been very strange. I suppose with the first lockdown, things were definitely easier. It was spring, coming into summer, we all had the good weather and there was a novelty to it really. Now though, it has been slightly tougher. But listen, overall I canrsquot complain at all. Irsquom still in training, working in football too, so I am very lucky I have that.CB: How did you find things at the start of lockdown because there did appear to be some ambiguity as to whether the Irish League players could be classed as elite athletes and continue playing  That must have been confusing and unsettling AW: It was a strange one no doubt. Certainly everyone involved in the Irish League, especially at Premiership level, strives to be elite. A lot of us are full-time. I have certainly no problem with the extra training that comes with that and the extra work.But the players do need to be subject to regular testing for Covid-. It is counter-productive to what we, as a society, are trying to do in terms of curtailing this disease otherwise.There has been a lot of ambiguity, but certainly I havenrsquot encountered a player who didnrsquot want to be playing. But obviously we are all concerned that we are able to do so in as safe a manner as possible.At the end of the day, after a match or a training session, we are all going back to loved ones and people who may be vulnerable too. We want to ensure they are as protected as possible.CB: In terms of your role and your standing now at Linfield, you would be considered to be one of the veterans of the side, but you still seem as hungry as ever for goals and success.AW: Absolutely, and in many ways you know that has been the case even more since the first lockdown. At that stage I had so much on with my work with the Irish FA, I probably didnrsquot have the time I would have liked to have dedicated to my own football.But certainly you can see the dference it makes to your season and your ability to hit the ground runningyou do get that good pre-season base in.I was doing my own fitness work in the house during the lockdown.I embrace where I am at now in my career and my age. But I am fortunate in that sense. I know a lot of people who get to my stage and they basically dread retirement. I am  now, so I suppose you do think about when retirement will come.Over the past while, as one of the more senior players at Linfield, I have been able to take on more, I suppose, of that advisory role to younger players. You know those younger guys coming to me asking me about fitness programmes, looking for advice about clubs and things like that, it is great.I am still, believe it or not, learning about the game. I am adapting my role on the pitch too as I move into this latter phase of my playing career. Sometimes you have to do that.But I am going back to foundations and in many ways that has really helped my form this season.Things like learning about playing more with your back to goal, how to use that to your advantage. It is something I have really enjoyed and as I say, embraced.CB: You have played under many of the top managers in the Irish League during your time. David Healy, another local figure at the club like yourself, obviously went into the Linfield job very much managerially as a rookie, although having of course achieved so much as a player. How would you rate him as a manager and indeed how he has made that switch from the pitch to the dugout AW: David I know, never really foresaw becoming a manager. He would tell you that himself. What I do notice about him is, despite everything he achieved, he never talks about his playing days. He is a huge Linfield supporter and he is results-driven. Make no mistake though, he rules with an iron fist.He expects very high standards. It is the job of the players who are there to win. Thatrsquos it, no excuses. Dferent managers bring dferent attributes to any job. But certainly with David,you fall below his standard, you will know.With playing under the like of David Jeffrey, he is a very dferent case. He loved to create that whole ethos of lsquoeverbody hates Linfieldrsquo, and I guess tap into that siege mentality side of things.DJ I suppose, would have been a bit more touchy-feely with the players than perhaps David Healy. Jeffrey would have brought the players to the side, and had the little one-to-one man management conversations with them.But I will say working with David [Healy], especially as he himself was a striker, has taken my game to a whole dferent level since I have been working with him. There is never a comfort zone at Linfield mdash that is the big thing. That has been a key part of my longevity I believe. You constantly have to be kicking on at Linfield. Anyone who coasts at Linfield, they donrsquot last long.CB: Casting your mind back to your days with Kilmore Rec, how much do you think the Amateur League and Kilmore helped you in terms of being ready for the steps up you made AW: Thatrsquos a really good question. The Amateur League is a brilliant springboard for then moving on to the Irish League. You play real first team football. As a player, you can sometimes spend too long at bigger clubsrsquo academies.I had been at the Glentoran academy for a while before I went back to Kilmore for first team football. I was lucky at that time with the Kilmore first team that was there. I played with boys like Gary Curran, Paul Smyth, Joe McMahon.They were players who wanted to win so badly, they played fair, but they played hard. I went into Duck [Donal] Bellrsquos team just as the club were going on a great Irish Cup run that season. That gave me a complete love for the game.But I quickly got to the stage where I didnrsquot just want to do two days a week with my football. Donrsquot get me wrong, the Amateur League, Premier Section is a good standard. As a footballing family, there is a lot for us to be proud of with the Amateur League.Obviously at the moment, all the clubs at that standard are in such a dficult place, but a good club at that level serves a purpose in so many ways, especially for the community. For clubs like Kilmore, and indeed all those playing at that level, it is a real tragedy that there is no football being played at the moment.CB: You are also heavily involved in the coaching side of things with your work with the IFA. Is coaching something you think you might be interested in post-playing, and indeed do you want to remain in football when you hang the boots up AW: I am definitely at the stage now I suppose where I am asking myself how can I remain in the game. It is without doubt something I want to do, to stay in football. But it is about working out exactly in what role that would be best for me.I suppose I have been able to work on a bit of a niche thing for myself with the Irish FA with a coaching and education role. I have done a bit of work with Gerard Lyttle with the Northern Ireland under-age teams and that has been something I have really enjoyed. It is great to see the progress of the younger boys through the dferent age levels with Northern Ireland.CB: You made the move for a time to Hamilton and were up against the top teams in Scotland. How was playing over there for you AW: It is funny you ask about that. My uncle only last night was asking me about all that is happening with Celtic at the moment. When I was there in Scotland you had boys like James McCarthy, Leigh Grfiths, James Forrest all up-and-coming and you could tell easily at that stage that they were boys who were going places. It is definitely a better standard of football in Scotland than a of people realise. I remember when I moved to Hamilton from Lisburn Distillery, I had played for Distillery on the Tuesday night, and then the move to Hamilton picked up momentum quickly.All of a sudden, come the Sunday of that week, there I was playing for Hamilton at Aberdeen in a Scottish Cup game in front of , people. I have to be honest, maybe I was a bit young at the time, maybe the home sickness got the better of me, but I do regret that I came home from Scotland again so soon.I have regretted it every day. You donrsquot want to let the like of that eat away at you, but I was there. I was rubbing shoulders with the gamersquos best.If I could go back and relive that experience again, I would do it in a heartbeat. But you donrsquot want to dwell on it, otherwise it could destroy you.I trained as hard as anyone over there. Maybe I would say compared to others at that standard, I struggled technically. You can get so down on yourself but when you are younger. For me, the chance came too early.It was the last day of the January transfer window when I made the move to Scotland. It actually looked for a long time that Irsquod be going to Aberdeen. However, that fell through at the last minute. I went to Hamilton then, but unfortunately it was just the wrong club for me.I did have chances again to go across the water. When Warren Feeney got the Newport job, he wanted me to go across there, but it wasnrsquot right for me. Everyone has a dferent journey. I was a late developer.Football is a tough place. People watch the Premier League and think that is what it is all about, but in many ways that is not the real picture of what football is, the glamour that is seemingly there. It is so tough to crack the code across the water.It is especially dficult for an Irish kid. If it is an English kid at an English club or a Scottish youngster at a Scottish club, they can easily go back and forth to their family, and alleviate that home-sickness.You canrsquot have thatyou are an Irish kid over there as easily. It can be lonely at times, and it is tough there is no doubt.CB: When you look at Scottish football this season, and particularly in the Premiership for Celtic and Rangers, there has been a complete transformation in fortunes and that in the season when Celtic have been chasing that historic ten-in-a-row. Has the role-reversal between the two Glasgow sides surprised you AW: There is no doubt, the change has been really drastic. I never imagined, despite how much Steven Gerrard has improved Rangers that the gap would be this big, particularly this early in the season.I know Michael Beale, a coach at Rangers from working at the IFA. He is a methodical coach, leaves nothing to chance, and I have no doubt he will have had a big role on the success Rangers are enjoying on the pitch at the moment. Gerrard has done a great job of getting that Rangers back four shored up.But things go wrong. For Celtic, I have no doubt they have found it dficult playing without fans.They definitely feed off the atmosphere that is usually generated by the supporters at Celtic Park.And the Dubai trip has been a really unwanted distraction that has not helped them at all.I do believe however for Celtic it can be a quick turn-around. I donrsquot necessarily see that they will now have to wait years for another Scottish title, the way in which it has been so long since Rangers last won it.Celtic can dust themselves down. Football can be so fluid. That is one of the great things about it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch named Irish club of the year by writers  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH RFC have been voted as the best rugby club in Ireland.The club was named Club of the Year by the Guinness Rugby Writers of Ireland Club of the Year.The club won the accolade for its outstanding community outreach work during the Covid- lockdown.This community spirit, said the Rugby writers, was nurtured from mini rugby players through to the seniors.Club chairman James Kirk said everyone at the club was delighted with the award.We are obviously very pleased. We have known about getting the award for a while before it was actually made public knowledge, so it has been in the pipeline, he remarked.ldquoWe are very proud that what it represents especially is our work with community engagement. That is something we pride ourselves on here at Ballynahinch.ldquoIt is really special to have been awarded the prize this year especially. It has been such a tough year, for everyone, and for all sports clubs. It is certainly a nice little boost that we have been able to get this.James said the club was concentrating on getting the green light for action on the pitch to .ldquoThat is what everyone wants and what everyone is missing. To not be able to get playing is dficult, but of course we absolutely recognise why it is the case. Public health is of paramount importance.Ballynahinch RFC usually fields seven adult teams, as well as youth teams, a ladiesrsquo team and a thriving mini rugby section.ldquoThere has been no action at the club since October.

It is only by us understanding how our wildle is faring that we can protect it.ldquoWersquove noticed that more people have signed up now for the Birdwatch than had at this stage last year, which is fantastic. We know that nature is in crisis and together we can all take action to solve the problems facing it. Nature needs us.Just one hour every year for the past four decades has made the RSPBrsquos big garden birdwatch the worldrsquos largest garden wildle citizen science project. Now in its nd year,  million birds have been counted.Last yearrsquos results showed that house sparrows remained at the top of the big garden birdwatch rankings in Northern Ireland, with an average of almost five sparrows being spotted in gardens.Collared doves flew into the top , replacing coal tits, while sightings of goldfinches and robins were up too.While counties Down and Tyrone both had the same top two in  mdash house sparrows followed by starlings mdashstarlings were the most-spotted birds in Antrim, Armagh and Derry-Londonderry, ahead of house sparrows, while Fermanaghrsquos number one bird was the chaffinch.The Big Garden Birdwatch continues to highlight the winners and losers in the garden bird world and while house sparrows and starlings may be the UKrsquos most commonly sighted birds, a closer look at the data shows that numbers have ped dramatically since the birdwatch began in .House sparrows are down %, while starlings are down %.Itrsquos also a pattern echoed by two more garden favourites, with blackbirds and robins down % and % respectively.To sign up for the for the big garden birdwatch visit www.rspb.org.uk birdwatch while to learn more about RSPB NIrsquos work log on at www.rspb.org.uk nireland  .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Brexit.jpg","title":"Brexit trading with Great Britain ‘complete nightmare’%2C says owner  ","story":"THE impact of Brexit and the Irish Sea border is impacting on one of the districtrsquos most popular garden centres.Beth Lunney mdash who runs the Saintfield Nursery Centre along with her family mdash has described the impact of the most signicant change to trading in decades and one that will affect many businesses.She said changes became apparent in November, just weeks before the UK formally left the EU.As part of the garden centrersquos preparations for the new sea border it, had signed up to the governmentrsquos Trader Support Service, with Beth also liaising with her suppliers in England.Her longstanding supplier of azaleas and rhododendrons got in touch and revealed that he was not going to be able to get the delivery to Saintfield, explaining that it was because of the possibility that there could be soil in the pots.The UK supplier had correctly interpreted the new rules which apply on trade in plants between Great Britain and Northern Ireland which is still in the EUrsquos plant health system and therefore must apply EU rules on products entering from Great Britain.Plants now need a plant health certicate to enter the country, but some products are completely banned, including soil as it can carry pests and diseases, but there maybe even more problems ahead.Beth said it was being suggested in some quarters that there may be an issue with pallets and even wooden handled forks and spades coming into Northern Ireland due to Brexit and the Irish Sea border and even delays in getting wooden furniture which she currently has on order.In the wake of Bethrsquos UK supplier of azaleas and rhododendrons getting in touch, her rose supplier subsequently got in contact via email to confirm that he would not be able to supply roses which had been on order since the autumn for planned deliveries throughout the season.ldquoThe problem is the peat reduced compost they use along with wood fibre and bark to pot up the roses, Beth explained, expressing sympathy for her suppliers.ldquoThe growers in GB are in a terrible position. They cannot take a chance and send plants to us as they may be delayed at our new border. A plant, like food, is perishable and a delivery could be taken and destroyed. Who will be willing to take that chance  I guess no one.Beth said Northern Ireland has the same climate as the rest of Great Britain and plants that do well there will also do well here, explaining that the local nursery is more selective about taking plants from Europe.She said the new regulations were not just a challenge for Saintfield Nurseries, but the entire Northern Ireland horticultural industry.The new reality for some businesses is that it has become easier to get key supplies from the EU, with Beth explaining that she already gets part of her stock from the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland and that this may have to increase.She said that several nurseries in the Republic of Ireland are emailing the Saintfield business saying theyrsquore going to have roses, but they may not be the particular ieties that they really want.Beth added: ldquoWe were told we would leave the EU as one country, the UK. We have been badly let down by all those that govern us. We should be equal to Scotland, Wales and England all of us members of the United Kingdom, but sadly now this is not the case.ldquoOne of my suppliers in England who contacted me last Friday thought there would be no problem supplying us but now the whole Northern Ireland and Brexit issue is a complete nightmare.The Horticultural Trades Associationis also lobbying the government, urging it to work with the EU to explore ways to ease the new rules.ldquoThe impact of these complex and burdensome changes is far-reaching for GB and NI, said the organisationrsquos chairman James Barnes, warning that the UKrsquos horticulture industry stands to lose outsolutions cannot be found..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Centennial.jpg","title":"Centennial celebrations event by Spa Wells LOL  ","story":"MEMBERS of Spa Wells LOL  kicked off their year long celebrations of the Centennial of Northern Ireland with a hike up Slieve Croob on New Yearrsquos Day.Crisp clear weather afforded enchanting views stretching to neighbouring Scotland and England.A poem was written to commemorate the occasion.On Slieve Croobrsquos lofty mountain peak:We placed our flag todayTo give a message to the worldThat we are here to stayOne hundred years have come and goneOur motto is the sameThe Union is our safeguardAnd this we will maintain.The members plan more exciting and interestingprojects throughout the year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Student.jpg","title":"Cormac secures place at prestigious Harvard University  ","story":"A TEENAGER will be swapping Downpatrick for Hard University later this year.Cormac Savage is the first pupil from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School to be offered a place at the world famous American university.Seventeen year-old Cormac, who is head boy at St Patrickrsquos, says itrsquos a dream come true to be given an opportunity to study at what is regarded as one of the top universities in the world.Hersquos also grateful to his family and the teachers at St Patrickrsquos, including the principal, Mr Joe McCann, for encouraging him to apply in the first place.Hard is one of the fabled lsquoIvy Leaguersquo universities in the United States and Cormac was one of , students to apply for a place, of which only seven per cent were successful.ldquoWhile Irsquod always wanted to study in the USA, it wasnrsquot until a year ago I seriously considered Hard, he said.ldquoIt was always my dream university but I was convinced I wouldnrsquot get in.

I have made up my mind to go abroad to work and I think a lot of other students will do that as well.The Nursing and Midwery Council , the registration body for nurses, recently extended its Emergency Standards to allow final year nursing students to undertake paid clinical placements in order to support the existing nursing workforce during the pandemic.While this has been introduced in England, Scotland and Wales, Robin Swann has declined to implement them into Northern Ireland.In early December, the Department of Health said a joint statement from the NMC and UK chief nursing officers explained that students would not be put into paid placements, as happened earlier during the pandemic.The statement said that instead, employing health trusts would protect their status as supernumerary students and continue to support them through high quality placements, which is a fundamental aspect of pre-registration nurse training.South Down MP Chris Hazzard is supporting the call from Eimear and other final year nursing students.He added: ldquoThese nurses are working at the front line and saving lives.

He has performed the role of club chairman, with his playing reduced to part-time due to the fact he suffers from arthritis in a finger.He has played for Drumaroad in the past, and in more recent seasons for the former top club in Downpatrick, De La Salle.Back in the days of the Lecale Leaguersquos Spin magazine, which was edited by the late and sadly-missed Gerry Carson, Jim provided lsquoPeople in the Newsrsquo and lsquoAt your Servicersquo on a regular basis.This was back in the late s. Starting in  he produced another magazine named Equipment Plus.At this stage, he was running his Table Tennis Servicesfrom his home in Castlewellan. However, as many will recall, for some years he ran Northern Irelandrsquos only table tennis shop in Irish Street, Downpatrick. He had a steady line of customers from near and far who came to make their purchases.As all local players will of course know, Jim is the local man to go to for advice on what rubber suits inidual players.As one who has made use of his help and advice on many occasions, it is quite common to arrive in Strangford to play a match, or indeed in another local hall, and find Jim replacing rubbers.He has also given people from ious local halls advice and has moved many on to pimpled rubbers in recent years, saving them money. A good many seasons back, Jim, anxious to give some of the Strangford clubrsquos younger players a bit of extra publicity, wrote reports for the Down Recorder.As a close associate to the long-time secretary of the Lecale League, Pat Morgan, there was never any doubt who would replace Pat when he sadly passed away.Since taking over, he has certainly done his utmost to keep the league going. He has brought in new clubs and written regular and well-received reports, as well as travelling to matches to take team photos.As well as being a great supporter of the Lecale League over many years, he has also been a great supporter of the East Down Churches League.He has attended and made donations for the leaguersquos annual charity cup match, as well as being present at their annual presentation evening.While Jim has been in regular action in recent seasons, he has proven that while form is temporary, class is permanent.When called upon to help a local team out in the Belfast  District League, he has been the only player on the team to win a game.As well as being a title-winning player, he has also proven he is a superb organiser as those that have attended the Lecale Leaguersquos th and th anniversary evenings know.In fact, so many turned up at the th anniversary event that lsquohouse fullrsquo notices had to go up.He even ran out of anniversary mugs for those who had played in the league over the years.While the Lecale League may not have as many teams as it did had in the past, the fact that it is still going is mainly thanks to Jim.It is also worth noting that with his guidance, the many charity tournaments he runs every season have raised a lot of money for Marie Curie and provided some great action for players.It is thanks to Jim and the late Pat Morgan that the league has been going now for over  years.

Even before the pandemic hit last year, wersquod got to a point where we were considering closing. Then the pandemic happened and we knew that it wasnrsquot the right time. We just had to keep going.ldquoAfter Christmas we knew we all needed to have time for ourselves and our families as we realised that so much of our own lives were being out on hold doing the voluntary work. Mum is also getting older, shersquos  now, and we just felt that we had done as much as we could.She stressed that all counselling sessions promised would continue they were complete.ldquoWe have been family run on a voluntary basis and due to the generosity of the local community, we were able to pay up to three therapists at any given time with no waiting time for those in distress or despair, added Brenda.She said that while the lockdown had presented challenges to the group regarding fund-raising and provision of support, counselling work continued through Zoom.ldquoTherersquos been some great fund-raising and we have been truly grateful but we just felt it was time to step back.Brenda said that while she hope that others may well organise and take over the gap that PIPS Downpatrickrsquos closure may leave, she felt that local mental health provision had moved on since the group started.ldquoWe would hope that the statutory services run by the Trust will continue. There are now mental health social workers in all the surgeries, yet  years ago you wouldnrsquot have heard of this, she added.Brenda said that while her family was sad at the closure, they were all very proud of what they had achieved with the help of the local community.ldquoWe truly believe we have saved lives and while it has been challenging at times, I wouldnrsquot have missed it for the world.

In , the  gained two million new members worldwide per month.The Strava team wrote in the report: ldquoAt the global level, the Covid- pandemic resulted in a rise of activity on Strava like wersquove never seen before, far surpassing our normal projections.In the UK, from March to May, members logged  per cent more outdoor activities than would be expected for that time of year, making the UK the most active global nation for outdoor activity.Alison continued: ldquoIt was a very bad year for everyone last year, and unfortunately this year has started in much the same way. With running though, it is one of those sports that is still accessible to us to take part in.When the regulations on sporting activity took hold, Alison said she and other members of the club were fastidious in following them to the letter.ldquoWe took our directive closely from Sport NI. We were able to develop a training plan that our members could follow inidually in January, and our members, because of the fact they are associated with the club, are particularly stringent about following the protocols as they should be done.ldquoRunning is something that can still be done outside, safely, and at a distance. Unless, for example you are running in a train of people, in these times, it is still a relatively low-risk activity. Both our sport and cycling have been able to proceed relatively well in terms of participation numbers.ldquoAnd from a mental health perspective, it offers so much. It has been a terrible time, for everybody for months with everything that has been happening. People have lost their lives, their loved ones, their livelihoods, running can be a nice outlet to just get away from things for that short time.Things may still be in limbo now in terms of planning any sporting activities locally in the district, but East Down AC members are still keeping their fingers crossed that the year ahead can still be one which will become more positive the longer into it we get.ldquoThis time last year, we would have had all our members training a lot, said Alison. ldquoThis year of course, we are not able to offer that. The Jimmyrsquos K is obviously a big event traditionally in the local athletics calendar, but that can attract around  runners. At the moment, it is just too dicy to even entertain that we could host that.ldquoHowever, we havenrsquot given up hope that we can still have some action to speak of later in the year with events. We would urge our members to keep training, keep themselves ready for when things can come back.ldquoWe know there are people out there who are naturally struggling with how things are. However people are there for you. The amount of virtual contact we all now have is something to embrace in these times. We have found we can even run a virtual league, which is something.Alison is hopeful that normal service can be resumed soon, as for many it is a huge leline to be a member of a running club.ldquoSome people are solitary. They may live alone, or work long hours alone.

That said, the Board and management are focused on achieving the best outcomes for all concerned.ldquoThe Board and management ask the parents of pupils, past pupils and members of the public impacted by these proposals to make their voices heard by participating in the consultation process. This is a matter for the entire community ndash not just those directly involved in education.The statement continued: ldquoFor over  years, St Patrickrsquos [the Red High] has been at the heart of the local community as a centre of learning, a resource hub and as an active contributor to civic le.ldquoPupils, past and present, have made and continue to make signicant contributions in the fields of sport, art, music, business and public service.ldquoThe motivation of the Board of Governors and management of the school is to ensure the widest range of parental and pupil choice remains available in the East Down region.Last December, the chairman of the Board of Governors, Dr Aidan Hamill, lost an application to the High Court for a judicial review questioning the Department of Educationrsquos authority to go ahead with the proposal before securing agreement from its governors.Under the merger plan the new school would educate girls and boys aged - with an admission of  pupils per year, with up to a maximum of % of pupils admitted through academic selection.Grammar schools in Northern Ireland normally admit students exclusively through academic selection.It is intended that existing school campuses would be used ldquopending capital investment for a one site solution.The closure of the three schools will also mean the loss of distinctive local school unorms as well as requiring all teaching and support staff to reapply for jobs at the proposed new school.The controversial amalgamation has been put forward by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schoolson behalf of the De La Salle Congregation, who are the trustees of all three schools.St Maryrsquos High School and De La Salle High School have declined to comment this week.However, both schools previously welcomed the proposed amalgamation, which originally included merging St Columbarsquos College in Portaferry.Mr Ciaran Maguire, principal of De La Salle, said in December that he was ldquodelighted to see the proposal going to full public consultation.He said at the time: ldquoItrsquos been a long time coming. I am reassured now that the families of the greater Downpatrick area will have an opportunity to finally get behind the vision to secure the town as a model of good practice, where childrenrsquos education is a priority.Ms Rosemary McLaughlin, principal of St Maryrsquos, said last September that the merger reflected her values and belief in all-ability schools.She said: ldquoIn terms of social justice, I feel the move is very important.

There is also a busy local authority garage and depot and a private care nursing home, with this section of road governed by a mph limit.Residents say that the overwhelming majority of drivers who speed along the road are travelling from the Strangford direction and that the issue could be addressed mdashthe speed indicator sign was relocated further back to the entrance to Lecale Park mdashit has to have any signicant impact on the speeding.Those who live at this part of Downpatrick say while the majority of drivers obey the mph speed limit, there are a number who do not.The new speed indicator devices, designed to make drivers aware of their speed and to slow down, are dotted across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area and have been warmly welcomed.South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Downpatrick councillor John Trainor say the speeding data recorded by the devices and released by the Policing and Community and Safety Partnershipshows an average speed reduction in the Downpatrick area of .% and that the new initiative is working.Mr McGrath said that when he and his SDLP colleague initially floated the idea of erecting the speed indicator signs, the feedback was that the such a scheme would not be efficient and would be too expensive, with little reward.He insists that confirmation that in the Downpatrick area alone speeds have reduced by .% in the short time the devices have been in place vindicates their installation.ldquoWhile John and I are delighted to hear that speeds are reducing across the district, we are in no way complacent about this.ldquoThe fact that the PCSP is doubling the provision of speed indicator signs is not only an indication of their efficacy, but also highlights the continued need for them.However, Mr McGrath said he was concerned about the mph speed recorded at the Strangford Road and appealed to all drivers to ensure they stick to the speed limit.Cllr Trainor said plans were in place to provide an additional seven speed indicator devices across the district.He added: ldquoCombining this with infrastructure minister Nichola Mallonrsquos scheme for mph zones at  schools across the country can only help safety on our roads.ldquoConsidering the very low temperatures we have witnessed this weekend, this is another reminder that we all need to be conscious of our speed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-St.jpg","title":"St Patrick’s parade off  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has pulled the plug on the forthcoming St Patrickrsquos Day parade in Downpatrick.The decision mdash confirmed on Monday mdash comes a week after a number of councillors urged the local authority to formally cancel the cross-community event due to the continuing coronavirus pandemic.Last yearrsquos cross-community spectacular was cancelled ahead of the first national lockdown to help combat the deadly virus and with infection rates remaining high across the district, the council has finally decided to cancel the event in the grip of the continuing public health emergency.The local authority, which last week would only confirm that it was ldquoreviewing plans for its St Patrickrsquos Day events in line with the current restrictions and ongoing response to the Covid pandemic, told councillors on Monday afternoon that the Downpatrick parade and one in Newry had been postponed, with the wider media informed yesterday.In the wake of other councils postponing their respective St Patrickrsquos Day parades, Newry, Mourne and Down was coming under increasing pressure to follow suit.The local parades have now been added to the growing list of national and international events across Northern Ireland which have been cancelled due to the pandemic, including the North West  motorcycle races.Belfast City Council has cancelled its St Patrickrsquos Day parade, with Derry City and Strabane and Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon councils currently discussing how their March  events will be celebrated.Local council officials have confirmed that following careful consideration of the current restrictions and the ongoing response to the Covid- pandemic, they have ldquoregretfully cancelled the traditional St Patrickrsquos Day celebrations.The organisation has confirmed that it will be hosting some activities and performances online via its tourism and arts social media channels.In addition, training green spotlights on a number of major buildings, including Down Cathedral and St Patrickrsquos Church in Downpatrick, is expected to go ahead as planned,restrictions allow.Council chairwoman Laura Devlin said it was with ldquogreat regret that the annual St Patrickrsquos Day parades have been cancelled for the second year in a row.She said the March  events were normally an opportunity to celebrate the districtrsquos connection with St Patrick and the arearsquos important place in his the patron saintrsquos story.ldquoI know how disappointed many will be about this decision and I share their disappointment, said Cllr Devlin. ldquoHowever, the councilrsquos priority at this time is to continue to support the ongoing response to the Covid- pandemic across wider society.She said that the decision to cancel was made in the best interests of residents, visitors, festival participants and event partners.She also confirmed that the local authority will continue to review plans for this yearrsquos tourism events programme on an ongoing basis and in line with guidance from the Northern Ireland Executive.Councillors Willie Clarke, Dermot Curran, Billy Walker and Robert Burgess, who last week appealed to the local council to cancel the parade, welcomed the decision and said they were looking forward to the  event going ahead.They said the local authority had to act to avoid any needless delay, warning that there was no way any festival parade could take place in the current Covid climate.Cllr Clarke said people needed to know that the parade would not happen, highlighting the continuing importance of protecting peoplersquos health.Cllr Curran said the event could not possibly have proceeded, given the ongoing public health emergency.He said the Covid situation remained ldquoextremely serious and that news of the parade cancellation would not come as a surprise.Cllr Walker urged council officials not to wait until the ldquoeleventh hour to pull the plug on the parade and hoped that next yearrsquos event will be one of the best ever.Cllr Burgess said current public health advice was clear, which meant the local council had no option but to cancel the parade, and urged council officials to start preparations for next yearrsquos

Liltingwas called lsquojaw musicrsquo, or lsquopuss musicrsquo.Mummers played one of the worldrsquos oldest instruments, called the jawrsquos jewrsquos harp.Also called lsquothe trumprsquo, the miniature jawrsquos jewrsquos harp produced a twang sound, which changed by altering the shape of the mouth and moving the tongue.Another mouth instrument used by mummers was the harmonica, also called lsquothe mouth organrsquo or lsquoFrench fiddlersquo.Another impoverished instrument in early mumming was spoons, which were played as a makesht percussion instrument by hitting the concave backs of one tablespoon against the other.Typically played with the palm of hands repeatedly moving down towards the knees and back upwards again, the spoons sharply hit each other, producing dferent sounds, rhythms and rattles.Dry spare ribsof animals were used before the introduction of spoons produced a similar sound.In Ederney, the sole musician was a bagpiper lending a hand for the night.During the coldness of mid-Winter, keeping the bagpipes warm until the ldquomarching in tune would be ldquostruck up was remedied by the bagpiper carrying a hot water bottle next to the skin of the pipes.Once made from dogsrsquo skin, bodhrans notndash as a home-made, open-ended, willow-framed drum ndash emerged from a farm sieve used in winnowing corn, and were extremely popular amongst mummers.The bodhranrsquos deep, hollow sound was vulnerable to Winter weather, resulting in the goatskin or leather skin loosening.Latterly, snaredrums with synthetic skins and tightening snares replaced bodhrans, providing a thundering warning of mummers approaching.Mummers joined together to purchase a melodeon, thereby the name a ldquojoined melodeon.Commonly called lsquothe squeeze boxrsquo, music box, accordion or concertina, accordion players such Jim McGrathare called lsquobox playersrsquo.The Clarkesrsquo tin penny whistles and the music from the concert flute, by John Joe lsquoThe Puckrsquo Maguire, had the ear, hands and soul of his flute when playing for both the Aughakillymaude and Kinawley mummers.Over time, instruments became personal possessions of the musician, as was the case with the fiddle of legendary Sean Dan Maguire, who played more than  years with mummers, strawboys and wrenboys.Musicians often tried music out on the spot! They may have just heard a march tune just once or twice, but they would give it a go.Gaining consent, mummers lsquoploughedrsquo into the heart of the household with a lsquoMarching Inrsquo tune, with the next interlude for music being the performance of a jig to coincide with the start of comical combat.Protaganists ndash Prince Patrick and Prince George ndash instead of duelling, were lsquoseamlessly seducedrsquo by music from the reel, and turned the combat on its head by jostling in a dancing motion, with the absurd clashing of wooden swords keeping time with the music.With the fallen hero feigning death, the musician instinctively began a slow, melodic airconducive to his impending death.Its purpose was to impinge sadness and, of necessity, was always a slow air born of mourning or regret.The musiciansrsquo opening for celebratory music came immediately post the odious fight, when dancers amongst the mummers would instinctively dance by the rendition of a reel with a lsquogood ltrsquo in it!Playing at a brisk, dance tempo, the dancers would rely on both keeping the time and in step with the rhythmic effect of the music for their foot movements.Inspired by musicians who understood the dance styles, dancers would whirl the floor with precision and elegance.Dancing in front of the hearth was revered by dancers, especially when it was customary to lsquopull outrsquo, firstly, the women of the household for social interaction.If neither residents nor mummers had dancing skills, mummers resorted to lsquoshufflingrsquo, often with cut sparable boots, armoured with tip and toe plates, i.e. a form of dancing on one spot, with feet kept close to the ground.Mummers disported themselves by entertaining and involving everyone by getting their neighbours out dancing.By having a set of slow waltz tunes, lasting longer than the play itself, this would wind up the visit.The Belcoo mummers were unquestionably the traditional set dancers of high renown.Staging either a half setor a full set , they danced with artistic interlacing and unwinding movements at very brisk speeds, to high-tempo reels.Having just one good dancer, the musician would likely play a hornpipe to allow for a display of heavy step dancing, with either Harvey leather shoes or even hobnailed boots.Mummers were known to throw matches onto concrete floors, where friction from the nails on boots struck the matches alight.Mummers also put wax shaving of candles onto floor to ease and increase their whirling.Sean-noacutes dancing was the showpiece of the Toura mummers, and twin brothers, Johnny and Paddy McGee, were foremost at exhibiting face dancing, such as the clap dance.Sean-noacutes dances, such as the half-door dance, was performed either singularly or by the twin brothers on a space or floor covering no more than the size of a half door.Undoubtedly, there was no better man at demonstrating the brush broom dance with a besom broom than Dessie Reilly of Aughakillymaude.Ballyshannon school mummersrsquo group dance was the unique ldquopot stick dance, originally from the Drumbad area , which has the remnants of English Morris Dance influence.The Ederney mummers showcased the Square Highland, involving four men at close quarters, as it didnrsquot take up much space in households, and didnrsquot involve swinging.As a Highland was a fling, it lent to being performed quickly, enabling mummers to depart sooner.The Fermanagh or Donegal Highlands iations were danced by just two dancers, and are heavily weighted with Scottish connotations.The Highlands flings are referred to by Fermanaghrsquos dancers as lsquothe Schottischersquo, or lsquoCetishrsquo.With larger venues, musicians playing North Kerry polkas and Fermanagh kick polka with two dancers ndash which allowed for swinging ndash had the musicians even imitating the dancersrsquo movements.Notably, the jig for Christmas called lsquoPaddyrsquos Returnrsquo was played marking the ing of ex-pats from England.After music, drama and dancing, a singer would sing a ballad of local signicance, or a light-hearted yarn on people grappling with the frailties of the human body, matters of the heart, and lersquos trials and tribulations.Attention was also afforded to the storytelling narrative of mummers, where the farcical spinning out of a yarn brought much laughter.Marking the end, a two-hand reel was played as the Captain led mummers outside, but unbeknownst and hidden underneath their lsquoget-uprsquo, mummers secretly had taken bread for pure devilment.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

What Mr McCausland identied was a work of “conversion” — the work of God by His Holy Spirit,— whereby Mr Cook underwent, in his own words “a road to Damascus moment”. This had nothing whatever to do with “gay conversion therapy” as quoted by those opposed to the post.

The Bible does not distinguish people by their lestyle, but rather by the fact that “All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God “ .God saved a sinner when He saved Mr Cook. His hitherto gay lestyle was inconsequential at that moment in time. Those who defend the LGBTQ rights are too sensitive, to the degree that they see every mention of God and gay people as homophobic, as criticism, as a danger! They need an understanding of God, and His Word, and His work of salvation. This event in this man’s le had nothing to do with anyone attempting to “convert” him from his lestyle. Mr Cook attended a church meeting and, it seems clearly obvious, he underwent conviction of sin, the work of God’s Holy Spirit,and was converted. There should be rejoicing that a lost sheep has been found. Instead we hear calls for Nelson McCausland to “resign”, that he should be “ashamed of himself”, that he is “advocating for ‘so called gay conversion therapy’”.There is no such thing as ‘gay conversion therapy’. The only One Who can convert the sinneris God. So let’s not get carried away here! Social media is replete with stories of conversion of sinners. It would be good to hear the same critics of McCausland Cook rejoicing over other stories of conversion on social media, instead of jumping on the one most likely to allow them to inflame passions over perceived wrongs. Was Nelson McCausland careless in all his comments  Perhaps his words weren’t best chosen. But let’s not lose the real story here. A story of God’s grace at work. Would that it were repeated over and over again, in this by-and-large Godless society we live in.Gordon McNeill, PortadownPetition begun to unseat DUP’s Nelson McCausland over ‘gay conversion therapy’ post——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Northern Ireland however has been hit by major disruption to trade within the UK, including, it now emerges, movements of military equipment.

Then, when it suited them, they discarded this position and acted aggressively, swtly and without the slightest concern for a sudden hardening of the border. A third key point in the article is that the EU have not taken using Article  off the table.A fourth is that these truths about what the EU has just done cannot be swept under the carpet.The response of the UK government has been diplomatic rather than robust. It depicts itself as unionist, yet has presided over great damage to the NI-Great Britain Union.The essay by Lord Dodds is welcome but this is not just a story of bad EU conduct. It is also a story of London’s failures.Calling out Boris Johnson is not of itself going to change someone so brazen. Yet it could cause the government, which is more focused on saving Scotland than NI, occasionally to pause. The UK will certainly not break up prior to  but it would be embarrassing even to be seen to have set the Union on a path to destruction. Unionists acting asthe border was fine would please London and make the next concession all the easier, so Lord Dodds is right to emphasise how bad it is. ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The legalistic rules-based principle lies in tatters.By Nigel DoddsMonday, st February , : am  \"       \"  \"Nigel DoddsSince the  referendum, unionists have been lectured about no hard border in Ireland under any circumstances and that overriding the provisions of the protocol is a terrible thing. Let’s just remember the outcry against the Internal Market Bill. Yet the EU turned everything on its head at the first opportunity when it suited their agenda. There was no consultation with London, Dublin or Belfast. The actions in Brussels were about putting Germany and France first. Northern Ireland was once again turned into a bargaining chip. It’s little wonder people are outraged. It’s one rule for us and a dferent rule for the EU.   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...What the EU has done is to set a precedent. They have demonstrated that it is quite legitimate according to their own standards to invoke Article  for reasons of societal dficulties to protect their single market and to do so immediately without consultation.Note that in their statement backing away from immediate invocation of Article  they reserved the right in paragraph  to invoke it at any time in the future saying that they will consider using all instruments at their disposal.So they have not reneged from the use of Article , they just deferred it and reserved the right to use it in the future at any point.There can now be no excuse for the UK government not to use the very same argument to eradicate the far worse societal dficulties being caused by the daily disruptions caused entirely by the protocol within the UK internal market. Indeed the UK government has the added ground of economic dficulties as allowed for in Article . So the UK government has an even stronger case to take action.The UK government has a solemn duty to protect everyone in Northern Ireland from the economic damage being inflicted on our businesses and consumers and the growing societal dficulties as referenced the PSNI evidence to the Northern Ireland Select Committee last week.The events of the weekend cannot simply be swept aside and a pretence that everything just carries on as normal. The EU has shown it can and will act to defend its internal market using the protocol to do so. It still remains ready to do what it takes using all instruments at its disposal as it says in its own words.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIN our bridge improvers sessions, we are continuing to deal with opening two bids, playing Benjy Acol.Here is a hand with a big point count that requires careful bidding to reach the right contract.The AuctionNorth has a hand with twenty-three points. So, playing Benjy Acol, North opens two diamonds. This shows at least nine tricks in hand or a balanced twenty-three points plus. It is forcing to game. Her partner, South, with only four points bids two hearts, which asks North, her partner, to show what she has. With a balanced hand North bids two no trumps. South now knows that between them they have more than the magic twenty-five points required to play three no trumps.But hold on a minute, whatNorth has five hearts  Four hearts would then surely be a better contract than three no trumps. So, as with last weekrsquos hand, the correct bid by South is now three clubs - five card puppet Stayman - asking Northshe has a four or five card major. North bids three hearts, showing her five-card heart suit. South now bids four hearts, as she knows that they have eight hearts and at least twenty-seven points between them. This is indeed the best contract, as three no trumps makes, but not so many tricks on a spade lead.The playEast begins with the queen of spades. North as declarer looks carefully at the hand before winning this trick with the king in dummy. She realises that this was the only way to dummy to be able to take the heart finesse. Remember - eight ever nine never is the rule. In other words, with eight cards between you in a suit the percentage play is to take the finesse. But with nine cards between you, the percentage play is usually to play the ace and then the king to try and drop the queen. So, declarer at trick two plays the two of hearts from dummy, playing the jack from her hand to execute the finesse.This wins, as West has the queen. North then plays the ace of hearts followed by the king, removing all the opponentsrsquo trumps. The odds for a   break are good, % in fact. Declarer then plays the king of diamonds from her hand. West holds up his ace of diamonds for two rounds, until declarer has played the king and queen, overtaking the third diamond with his ace. West does this in case declarer has a losing club, which could be discarded on dummyrsquos jack of diamonds.East has played first the three and then the five of diamonds, indicating he has three cards in that suit. We will see next week how he would have played his diamondshe had four cards in this suit, using what is known as a Peter. West then plays his ace of clubs, and it is all over, North winning the rest of tricks with the ace of spades, the remaining trumps, and the king and queen of clubs. So, she makes her contract of four spades with an overtrick,  tricks in all ndash two spades, five hearts, two diamonds and two clubs.Well bid and well played. Without the use of puppet Stayman North would probably play in three no trumps. On the lead of the queen of spades this only makes nine tricks - two spades, five hearts and two diamonds. Declarer takes the heart finesse and plays all her hearts. Then, she plays the king and queen of diamonds, West winning the third diamond with his ace, having refused to take the king or queen. West would thenthe ten of spades, which would be won by declarerrsquos ace. But when she plays the king of clubs, West pounces with his ace and plays the nine of spades, which wins, followed by Westrsquos last spade won by Eastrsquos queen, East West making four tricks ndash two spades and two aces, East having to discard one of his spades on the preceding tricks.What have we learnt . As we saw last week, five card Puppet Stayman, after the opening bidder has shown a strong two no trumps, is vitalyou are to find either a   of   fit in one of the majors. lsquoPuppetrsquo has sunk into bridge jargon over the past forty-five years. The convention was originally invented by Neil Silverman and developed in the s by Kit Woolsey and Steve Robinson, all American players. As well as finding a   fit in a major, -card puppet Stayman has the advantage that,there is a   fit, the person with the strong hand plays the contract, and the lead comes up to him.. Always take care to take the first trick in the right handyou want to take a finesse.. Sometimes it is advisable to hold up an ace, particularly in no trumps, to block your opponents from entering the hand with winners in it.Penarth club newsPeter Sampsonrsquos ladder competition continues.

St Valentine is the Roman patron saint of lovers as well as epileptics and beekeepers. He was said to be a Roman priest and physician who suffered martyrdom - welcoming death rather than denouncing his faith - during the persecution of Christians by emperor Claudius II Gothicus in around . He is said to have died on February  of that year and Valentines Day has been celebrated since approximately the th century.While the Welsh also celebrate Valentines Day, there is the Welsh equivalent - celebrating St Dwynwen - three weeks earlier on January . It is a popular celebration among Welsh speakers in the land, but it is becoming more widely popular across Wales, with the people of Wales professing their love to their loved ones in January.MORE NEWS:Who was St Dwynwen St Dwynwen was a Welsh princess who lived in the fourth century in what we know now as the Brecon Beacons National Park. She is the Welsh patron saint of lovers ndash despite being quite unlucky in love herself.She was said to be the prettiest of King Brychan Brycheiniogrsquos  daughters and fell in love with prince Maelon Dafodrill. To her dismay, her father had already arranged for her to marry someone .She was so upset and begged God to make her forget her love. During her sleep, she was visited by an angel carrying a sweet potion that was designed to erase all memory of Maelon and turn the prince into a block of ice.God then gave the princess three wishes. She first wished that her prince be thawed. Her second wish was that God meets the hopes and dreams of true lovers. Her final wish was that she should never marry.God granted her these three wishes and as a mark of thanks, she devoted her le to him, becoming a nun and founding a convent on Llanddwyn, located off the west coast of Anglesey. Remains of the church ndash which had a well named after Dwynwen ndash can still be seen today. The well and convent became a place of pilgrimage after her death in AD. Visitors believed that the sacred fish or eels in the well could foretell whether the visitors relationship would be happy and whether love and happiness would be theirs.She is also the patron saint of sick and injured animals. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

St Valentine is the Roman patron saint of lovers as well as epileptics and beekeepers. He was said to be a Roman priest and physician who suffered martyrdom - welcoming death rather than denouncing his faith - during the persecution of Christians by emperor Claudius II Gothicus in around . He is said to have died on February  of that year and Valentines Day has been celebrated since approximately the th century.While the Welsh also celebrate Valentines Day, there is the Welsh equivalent - celebrating St Dwynwen - three weeks earlier on January . It is a popular celebration among Welsh speakers in the land, but it is becoming more widely popular across Wales, with the people of Wales professing their love to their loved ones in January.MORE NEWS:Who was St Dwynwen St Dwynwen was a Welsh princess who lived in the fourth century in what we know now as the Brecon Beacons National Park. She is the Welsh patron saint of lovers ndash despite being quite unlucky in love herself.She was said to be the prettiest of King Brychan Brycheiniogrsquos  daughters and fell in love with prince Maelon Dafodrill. To her dismay, her father had already arranged for her to marry someone .She was so upset and begged God to make her forget her love. During her sleep, she was visited by an angel carrying a sweet potion that was designed to erase all memory of Maelon and turn the prince into a block of ice.God then gave the princess three wishes. She first wished that her prince be thawed. Her second wish was that God meets the hopes and dreams of true lovers. Her final wish was that she should never marry.God granted her these three wishes and as a mark of thanks, she devoted her le to him, becoming a nun and founding a convent on Llanddwyn, located off the west coast of Anglesey. Remains of the church ndash which had a well named after Dwynwen ndash can still be seen today. The well and convent became a place of pilgrimage after her death in AD. Visitors believed that the sacred fish or eels in the well could foretell whether the visitors relationship would be happy and whether love and happiness would be theirs.She is also the patron saint of sick and injured animals. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

He leaves a huge gap but his enormous contribution, enthusiasm and positivity will not be forgotten.Des was born in Drogheda in the Republic of Ireland but, whilst still very young, moved to NI where he grew up and was educated. He attended Portadown College before moving to Queen’s University Belfast in  to study German. He graduated with a First Class Honours Degree four years later, which included a year in Freiburg im Breisgau, a city where he made many le-long friends.Des’ first teaching job was back at his alma mater, Portadown College, where he taught German and French between  and . Keen to satisfy his thirst for travel, widen his knowledge of other cultures and experience teaching in other countries, he moved to Uganda in  where he taught French and German at the Aga Khan Secondary School, Kampala for two years. \"Des Johnston in his younger years.Des then ed to County Armagh where he was appointed Head of Modern Languages, again at Portadown College. It was during this time that I had the good fortune and privilege to be one of Des’ pupils. Des was ahead of his time. He recognised the importance of integrating language and culture.In spite of the passage of  years, I remember very clearly the lesson where he set up the screen and projector, cutting edge technology in the s, and showed us slides of his tour on a scooter through France, Luxembourg and Germany. As a class of  year olds, we were transfixed. Des was an example of Dali’s “true artist”, as two years later Keith, George and I packed our rucksacks and followed Des’ tracks, not on a scooter but by train. Des’ inspiration did not stop there as I was to follow his path to a degree in languages at Queen’s, a PGCE and a career in teaching. I was certainly not the first or the last of Des’ pupils to do this. It is striking that Des’ son, Philip, also followed in his dad’s footsteps, working in Germany for three years, studying in the Czech Republic and qualying as a German interpreter – without doubt a chip off the old block. Des knew how to manage a class. He had presence he got lessons off to a fun start he always progressed from what we knew, gave us confidence and self-belief and made us curious to learn more. Lessons were fun. Time flew by. We felt that we were achieving. Motivation was not an issue. He got the very best from each of us. Des was a master of the art of teaching.In  Des’ itchy feet took him to Luxembourg where he spent two years working as a translator for the European Commission. During this time he also won two caps for the national rugby team of Grand Duchy.Keen to pass on his pedagogical skills and knowledge and to champion modern languages teaching and learning, he joined Her Majesty’s Inspectorate, Department of Education, Northern Ireland in . We all feel apprehensive about the visit of the inspector. Des was not to be feared, however. His focus was always on the supportive and the formative. His aim was always to help and guide and build the confidence of those he visited. Des’ distinguished career did not end when he retired in  but rather took a gentle turn. He continued to teach with the University of the Third Age and at Millburn Primary School where he taught English and English as a Foreign Language to Polish children, a role in which he found particular enjoyment and fulfilment.Des was born to teach and so very many of us, across the world, have benefited from his skill, encouragement and warmth. Teaching was not his only passion, however. I have already mentioned his rugby caps for Luxembourg. He also excelled at the shot put in athletics and played badminton and table-tennis. He loved music, good food and reading. Des could talk convincingly and engagingly on a very wide range of subjects. He was knowledgeable, interested and interesting. He was a wonderfully entertaining raconteur, the perfect dinner guest.I feel very honoured to have been able to stay in contact with Des from the time I left Portadown College until a month before he sadly died. He and I always thought it an amazing but lovely coincidence that, in the small world that is language teaching, the boy who was to become his future son-in-law, Chris, was one of my pupils in the school in the north-east of England where I first taught.I was not the only former pupil to enjoy his wisdom, guidance, mentoring, support and friendship for many years after leaving school. I was one of a large number across continents. Des was always generous in investing time in people. He cared. This is why he was so respected and much loved by so many.Des is survived by his we, Irene, and his children Tanya and Philip.Des Johnston -PSNI investigation after girl found dead in NI flats Read the full story hereEditor’s Message:Thank you for reading this article.

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

The latest figures show a total of , first doses and , second doses – bringing the overall number of vaccines administered to , Today’s figures provide a further indication of important progress in the roll-out of vaccines to combat the virus. In addition: * Mobile vaccination teams have administered first doses in all of Northern Ireland’s care homes - and second doses to over % of the homes. * We have vaccinated % of the  year olds and over, and have started to vaccinate  –  year olds through the GP programme. * Online booking was opened on Wednesday night for - year-olds to book their vaccination appointments in one of NI’s seven regional vaccination centres. In the first  hours of the online portal, , people had booked their vaccination jabs. Intensive work has been undertaken to address teething problems with the online system, linked to high levels of demand. * A further signicant consignment of the Astra Zeneca vaccine is due in NI next week, for immediate distribution to GPs. This will help facilitate a rapid acceleration of vaccinations for those over  and patients who are Clinical Extremely Vulnerableto Covid-. * In another important development on the vaccine front, a large-scale UK trial for a new coronavirus vaccine indicates it to be .% effective against the virus. The Novavax vaccine is expected to be available across the UK in the second half of this year,approved for use by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency  People in Northern Ireland have played a key role in the development of Novavax. Nearly  participants were recruited from Northern Ireland for the trial which was led locally by researchers from Queen’s University Belfast and the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust. Health Minister Robin Swann said: “I want to thank everyone working on the vaccination programme right across Northern Ireland. “This is a massive logistical exercise and I am very encouraged by the strong start we have made. It should be remembered that the first Covid- vaccine approval was only announced last month, with the second approval coming some four weeks later. We have made great strides forward since then. “There will inevitably be frustrations along the way. We will get to everyone - we are getting to thousands more each day.” Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride thanked everyone involved in the Novavax trial. He said: “The rapid development of Covid- vaccines is our long-term route map out of this pandemic. We should be rightly proud that Northern Ireland continues to play its part in the historic global effort to develop new drug treatments and vaccines. Throughout our response we have all come together in support of each other. We continue to see the benefits of the partnership between academia, health and industry and this another example.” The Department of Health this week announced a twin track approach to accelerating NI’s vaccination programme - ensuring more people can take up the offer of vaccination and help protect themselves against Covid-. GPs will be focusing on the  plus age group with the Astra Zeneca vaccine, while the seven regional vaccination centres will in parallel be offeringPfizer vaccination appointments to - year-olds. The plans are to offer everyone over  in NI a vaccine by the end of February. People who are Clinical Extremely Vulnerableto Covid- are also a priority for February. GPs will be vaccinating a large proportion of CEV patients. The twin track approach will see the Trust vaccination centres offering vaccines to CEV patients who are frequent hospital attenders.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dbcdcacada   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ebefccfaf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1612024107217.jpg--covid_19___sat_30th_jan_figures.jpg?161202410700","title":"covid  sat th jan figures ","story":" The NI Department of Health dashboard shows a further  coronavirus related deaths and  new positive cases.  deaths occurred outside of the current reporting period.
