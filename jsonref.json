If you get the injection, your arm may be sore, too, or you might experience a slight fever or aching muscles for a day or two afterwards. Serious side effects with both the jab and nasal spray are extremely rare.HOW WILL MY CHILD BE VACCINATED AGAINST FLU?Most children will be vaccinated at school, but those who have not started yet, or who are in a high-risk group, can also get it from their GP.I\u0027M PREGNANT – IS IT SAFE TO GET THE COVID AND FLU JABS?Yes – both are safe for pregnant women, and it\u0027s important to have both if eligible. There are more risks for you and your pregnancy if you contract Covid-19 without the vaccine, and the flu vaccine will also help protect your unborn baby.If you catch flu when pregnant, you\u0027re at risk from complications such as bronchitis and it could cause your baby to be born prematurely, have a low birth weight and may even lead to stillbirth.If you are pregnant, you can get a free flu vaccine from your GP, pharmacist or through your maternity service.  ◼ To check your eligibility for the flu vaccine and Covid-19 booster vaccine or to find a service, visit nhs.ukwintervaccinations ■ This article is part of a paid-for partnership with the UK Government"},{"url":null,"title":"House Fraser shut iconic Oxford Street shop year","story":"Food sales volumes were also up by 0.6 per cent, the ONS added, and remain 3.9 per cent above pre-Covid levels.But while shoppers opted to avoid high streets, sales online continued to rise and now account for 28.1 per cent of all spending -

They can\u0027t even act to insulate Britain. \u0027What hope do we have of them protecting our children, our economy or our country?\u0027The statement concluded: \u0027We say to those who look on in fear and denial - this will impact you and all that you love, and look at what we did.\u0027A few hundred people captured the country\u0027s attention for months.

Instead of cracking down on climate activism, the UK Government should crack down on cold homes.\u0027One will be an international embarrassment, the other a sign of real climate leadership.\u0027An ambitious home insulation programme funded by the Government would lower energy bills, cut planet-heating emissions and boost the UK\u0027s energy security - it\u0027s a triple win.\u0027Boris Johnson must show that he hasn\u0027t left his commitment behind at Glasgow Central station and he\u0027s ready to roll up sleeves and lead by example on tackling the climate crisis.\u0027Liberty director Gracie Bradley said: \u0027We should all be able to stand up for what we believe, but when the means to do so are continually narrowed - whether that be at the ballot box, in the courts or in the streets - people will take to more urgent routes.\u0027While Insulate Britain knew that by breaching the injunction they risked jail, these sentences clearly are disproportionate and another threat to protest rights for all of us.\u0027For years, injunctions have been used by the powerful to stifle dissent and restrict protest rights, while demonstrators have been demonised.\u0027The impact has been stifling free expression, undermining the ability of all of us to stand up for what we believe in - particularly people from marginalised communities who are most cut off from the corridors of power.\u0027Today\u0027s sentences must be seen in the context of the expansive and oppressive powers in the Policing Bill, itself a grab for more power by a Government that despises scrutiny and accountability.\u0027The right to protest protects all of us and is the cornerstone of a healthy democracy.

Braun also added that current cost estimates didn’t include replacing the city’s dikes, as a cost for that is still be generated. A previous study done years ago estimated that only replacing the Sumas and Matsqui dikes would cost around $400mn.  “They said that the province will be there for us. When you start totalling those things up, you’re going to get up to $1-billion, I predict,” said Braun. A park in Abbotsford, one of the regions hit hardest by recent flooding, remains submerged.  Similar images show that while water levels are lowering slightly, the park, like many places in Abbotsford, is still badly damaged.  Similarly, many homes were still impacted by the storms, as thousands remain displaced. Shared images show some progress as water levels lower, but surveying the full damage is ongoing.  Work currently being done to fix the damaged lines owned by the Canadian national railway was slowed down due to three sink holes opening up beneath the railway.  Highways and roads in Vancouver and throughout BC are similarly flooded and out of service.  Read the full report here.“We are not out of this by a long shot,” he said. He said the damage caused to farms in the area likely cost “hundreds of millions of dollars plus”. A reminder: Much of the area lies on the former site of Sumas Lake, a vast body of water that was drained in the last century. City officials feared that pumps, which ert water from the basin at a rate of half a million gallons a minute, were on the verge of failing – meaning even more water would inundate parts of the city. Mayor Braun said the pumps were still operational as of Thursday morning.While British Columbia does not export cut Christmas trees, it is a significant domestic supplier. That means shortfalls in that province will have to be made up with supply from elsewhere, leaving fewer Canadian trees for export, Reuters reports. “We can’t ship them because all the roads are closed,” said Arthur Loewen, whose tree farm in Chilliwack, east of Vancouver, has been swamped. “We’re basically shut down until the water recedes.” Loewen said that if the waters don’t subside within the week, younger trees could be damaged, hurting future supply.Abbotsford, one of Canada’s most intensively and ersely farmed areas, was among places hardest hit. Home to more than 1,200 farms, it supplies half of the dairy, eggs and poultry consumed by British Columbia’s 5.2 million residents. Aerial footage showed several barns engulfed by flood waters. Farmers and residents have been frantically scrambling to save their animals from rising waters, resorting to motorboats and jetskis to tow partly submerged cows one by one to higher ground. Many of the farms are in Sumas Prairie, a low-lying fertile stretch of land created by the draining of a lake nearly a century ago. An evacuation order on Tuesday included 121 dairy and poultry farms, according to farmers associations. Local officials pleaded with about 300 people who defied the order. “If you are still on Sumas Prairie, you need to leave,” said Henry Braun, the mayor of Abbotsford. “I know it’s hard for farmers to leave their livestock, but people’s lives are more important to me right now than livestock or chickens.” Whether you live or work in the area, or are helping with search and rescue efforts with the emergency services, we would like to hear from you.

Hurricane scientist Jeff Masters has described the phenomenon as like “a river in the sky that acts like a pipe transporting huge amounts of water vapour out of the tropics”. The flooding has been exacerbated by clearcut logging and its effect on slope stability, the rate at which water is absorbed into the ground and the ability to hold soil in root systems. Without trees, heavy rains can wash large amounts of sediment into nearby water systems, choking creeks and streams and causing them to quickly overflow. The risk of landslides and debris flow has also been heightened by summer wildfires in the region. “There’s a very clear link between a wildfire happening and the risk of a landslide or debris flow,” Thomas Martin, a forester in the province, said on Tuesday. “If you burn a lot of the trees, grass and shrubs, there are fewer living things to intercept the water. It just flows directly off the hill. And fires can make the soil hydrophobic so the runoff increases even more.” Meanwhile, evacuation alerts have been removed in some areas of the city of Abbotsford. The Port of Vancouver is Canada’s largest port but has been cut off due to highway closures. Retail analyst Bruce Winder told the Canadian Press that the sector will feel the impact of the flood at the peak of the busiest holiday season. “It’s brutal,” Winder said. “Supply chains for retail have been under siege for some time now due to the pandemic. And this is going to add to the shortage at the worst possible time.”He said he had been “lucky” to avoid the worst of the flood. However, he adds: “The big problem is panic buying has emptied the shelves of the local supermarkets.”  The local government has asked people not to “hoard supplies”. Fuel stations in British Columbia are also facing shortages and long lines. There is limited capacity and the route is only open to passenger vehicles – allowing those who were stuck there to move on. “Though there is no confirmed closing time, we encourage anyone wanting to leave to do so now,” the local government said. Hope is located about 150km east of Vancouver.  On Wednesday, a late-night evacuation train carrying about 200 people stranded for days was also able to leave Hope.During the past few days, a powerful storm has dumped a month’s worth of rain across a swath of the Pacific north-west. Canadian military personnel will assist with evacuation efforts in British Columbia. They will also assess the damage in an area that has largely been cut off. Hello Readers.

Photograph: Getty ImagesAnyone who received a Janssen Covid-19 vaccine should get a booster after three months, under new recommendations.The 236,000 people who received the one-shot Janssen (Johnson \u0026amp Johnson) vaccine should receive an mRNA booster dose after an interval of three months because it is “less effective” than a two-shot vaccine, according to the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac).Most of this group received their vaccine in the spring as use of the vaccine in the immunisation programme was ceased thereafter.Niac has recommended the extension of the booster programme to healthcare workers, those aged 16-59 with underlying conditions and anyone aged from 50-59 years.It has also decided not to recommend the Moderna vaccine for eligible people aged under 30 years “as a precaution”. A similar approach has been taken by authorities in France and the Scandinavian countries after early data showed a higher rate of myocarditis in young males who received Moderna compared to those who were administered Pfizer. This data is being examined by the European Medicines Agency. Those aged 16-29 should be given a full dose of Pfizer vaccine, at least six months after they received their primary course of any Covid-19 vaccine. For those aged 30 and over, the Pfizer vaccine or a half-dose of Moderna should be administered after a six month interval, though for operational reasons a minimum interval of five months may be used.Niac says there is early evidence the infection rate is slowing down among those aged 75-79 years, due to the administration of boosters. Covid-19 infections have already fallen among those aged 80 and over, where booster coverage is over 80 per cent.It also describes as encouraging a decrease in the number of infections among healthcare workers in the second half of October, to 672. This was almost 5 per cent of all cases during the period.Niac says the current surge is likely due to the Delta variant, waning vaccine immunity and the opening up of society.It says there has been an “incremental increase” in ICU admissions by 10-year age cohorts since June. The vast majority have an underlying condition.“It is essential that all recommended public health and social measures to limit Covid-19 exposure are observed. Booster doses will not immediately contribute to outbreak management nor take the place of public health and social measures.”Niac says it continues to examine new evidence regarding the durability of protection of primary vaccines in other groups, such as younger age groups who received the AstraZeneca or Janssen vaccine.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan has endorsed Niac’s recommendations in a letter to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly. “There are currently no data on the long-term effectiveness of booster doses, so it remains unclear how long the benefit of boosters may persist, or the magnitude of the effect boosters have on transmission of the virus,” Dr Holohan says in the letter.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"drogheda worst affected area for covid 19 in the state","story":"Three local electoral areas in and around Drogheda are currently among the five worst affected areas in the State for the disease, new data from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre shows. Drogheda has emerged as the locality with the highest rate of Covid-19 in the State, according to the latest weekly figures on coronavirus infections broken down by local electoral area. Three local electoral areas in and around the Co Louth town are among the five worst affected areas for the disease, new data from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre shows. There were 668 infections recorded in the local electoral area covering Drogheda during the two weeks to November 15th, giving it an incidence rate of 2,415 cases per 100,000 people. This is more than double the national average of 1,160 cases per 100,000 people based on the figures for the latest fortnightly reporting period. One in every 41 people living in Drogheda, the State’s largest town, has Covid-19, based on this data.The rural electoral area located just north of the town, Drogheda Rural LEA-4, has an incidence rate of 1,963 per 100,000 people, making it the third most-infected locality in the country.Laytown-Bettystown in Co Meath, just south of the town, had the fifth highest incidence rate with 1,878 cases per 100,000.Carndonagh on the Malin Head peninsula in Co Donegal, which had the highest rate of infections last week, now has the second highest incidence rate in the State with 1,974 cases per 100,000. Ballinamore in Co Leitrim had the fourth highest incidence rate with 1,957 cases per 100,000.Other areas among the 10 worst-affected are Manorhamilton, Co Leitrim (1,829 per 100,000), Donaghmede in north Dublin (1,786 per 100,000), Tullow, Co Carlow (1,785 per 100,000), Ongar in north-west Dublin (1,783 per 100,000) and Mullingar, Co Westmeath (1,752 per 100,000).The remote west-coast town of Belmullet in Co Mayo, which had the highest incidence rate during the third wave of the pandemic in January, remains the area with the lowest infections. It had an incidence rate of 317 cases per 100,000, about a quarter of the national average. Infections last January pushed Belmullet’s incidence rate to more than 6,000 cases per 100,000.Other areas with low infection rates include Bantry and Skiberbeen in west Cork, Monaghan and south Connemara where the incidence rates range from 571 cases to 656 cases per 100,000.

File photograph: The  Up to half of all people booked for Covid-19 boosters in some vaccination centres are failing to turn up, according to HSE chief executive Paul Reid. Although the booster campaign was progressing well, there is a high level of people not coming forward, Mr Reid said, with “no show” rates of 25-50 per cent in come centres.This may be due to a “sense of security” given people are vaccinated, he speculated at a media briefing on Thursday.Mr Reid warned of “significant” curtailment of services in some larger hospitals to allow priority to be given to coronavirus patients and non-coronavirus urgent care. The HSE boss has written to all services outlining the actions being taken. Each of the model 4 hospitals will identify surge intensive care unit (ICU) beds, to be supported by the redeployment of staff from other activities they will have to curtail, he explained.As a result, the level of physiotherapy, speech and language therapy and occupational therapy being provided next month may be 53 per cent less than in December 2020, the briefing heard.Covid-enforced cancellations could also mean elective procedures cut by 65 per cent, according to HSE chief operations officer Anne O’Connor.Mr Reid said health staff are under an “inconceivable level of strain” and “at their wits’ end” due to the current virus wave. “Any organisation that had to deal with one wave of Covid would be extremely challenged. To have to deal with four waves, plus a cyberattack . . . many organisations would not have survived.”The level of risk and impact from the virus is higher now than at any other time in the pandemic, he said.Outlining actions the HSE will take to deal with the current surge, Mr Reid said staff will be redeployed to assist frontline colleagues and this will lead to curtailment of elective care.Planned use of private hospital capacity is being increased from 1,100 bed-days a week to 3,000 in the coming weeks. Testing capacity will be expanded to new centres with increased throughput and private operators will also carry out testing.The vaccination programme will also be expanded so more boosters can be administered, he added. ‘Lost a lot of staff’The HSE had had to wait “a number of weeks” while the National Immunisation Advisory Committee made recommendations on expanding the programme, during which it “lost a lot of staff”.Mr Reid said he would be very concerned if the new rule requiring close contacts to self-isolate for five days while taking antigen tests were applied to healthcare workers.The HSE is working out the details of a derogation that would allow its staff continue to work under monitored conditions, he said.On Thursday, there were 643 Covid-19 patients in hospital, up 20 per cent in a week and 40 per cent in the last fortnight. This includes 118 patients in ICU, up 34 per cent in the last week and 38 per cent in the last two weeks.Since the end of June, 43 per cent of hospital patients with the virus were unvaccinated.“The reality of it is patients from less than 10 per cent of the eligible population in terms of vaccination are taking up 43 per cent of the Covid beds, whilst patients from 90 per cent of the eligible population, ie: those who have been vaccinated, are taking up just 54 per cent,” Mr Reid said. Last January, the more than 200 patients then in ICU represented about 10 per cent of total hospitalisations, he said.At present about 19 per cent of total Covid-19 hospitalisations are patients in ICU.While there is much discussion on antigen testing and the booster programme, these are not “magic wands” and will not solve the situation instantly.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"r%C3%B3is%C3%ADn shortall to seek referendum to end presidential oath to almighty god","story":"Social Democrats co-leader Róisín Shortall is to table a Bill seeking a referendum to remove the presidential oath to ‘almighty God’ from the Constitution. File photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Social Democrats co-leader Róisín Shortall is to table a Bill seeking a referendum to remove the presidential oath to “almighty God” from the Constitution after European human rights judges dismissed her challenge to the oath.Ms Shortall’s move raises a question for the Government as to whether it would seek to block her referendum proposal. There was no comment from a Government spokesman when asked about the matter. Is it understood that the Coalition has no plan to table a Bill of its own on the question.A seven-judge chamber of the European Court of Human Rights ruled on Thursday that Ms Shortall’s challenge to the presidential oath was inadmissible. The Government had challenged the status of Ms Shortall and four co-litigants – Sinn Féin TD John Brady, Senator David Norris, former Barnardos chief Fergus Finlay and Prof David McConnell of Trinity College Dublin – to take the action and the merits of their argument.The court on Thursday said the litigants were not personally victimised by the need to take a religious oath if elected president. The five had argued the requirement to swear oaths “to which they have a conscientious objection” was a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights.On the same grounds the court also dismissed their challenge to the oath taken by members of the Council of State, which advises the President. Ms Shortall insisted the ruling was not the end of the matter and that she would seek to address the issue by other means. “I will be bringing forward a Bill proposing a referendum to amend the Constitution, to remove the requirement to make a religious oath when elected president or appointed to the Council of State.”The court appeared to have little sympathy for the Government’s argument that the clauses were not religious per se but manifestations for political and cultural heritage, she said.‘Margin of discretion’Although the judges said states enjoy a wide margin of discretion in questions concerning the relationship between them and religion, they also said that went hand in hand with European supervision. “The reference by a state to a tradition could not relieve it of its obligation to respect the rights and freedoms enshrined in the Convention,” the court said. Ms Shortall said she was surprised and disappointed at the State’s “full-throated defence” of the case.“In a modern republic, it is anathema that those elected to one of the highest political offices in the land, that of president, are required to swear an oath to ‘almighty God’,” she said, adding that such oaths “are incompatible with freedom of conscience”.Atheist Ireland said it would continue to press for the removal of religious oaths from the Constitution, arguing that they still contravene human rights law. In the group’s assessment, the ruling meant that a legal challenge to the oaths would probably require someone elected president or invited on to the Council of State to “refuse to swear the religious oath” and then take a case to the European court.An index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"lack of uk compromise on ni brexit deal deeply disappointing coveney","story":"Bertie Ahern said ‘in the areas where you are likely to get trouble, people don’t have a clue about the protocol’.  Photograph: Cyril ByrneThe UK’s unwillingness to compromise in the row with the EU over the Northern Ireland Brexit deal has been “deeply disappointing,” Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.Mr Coveney told a university conference on Brexit in Dublin that the European Commission’s proposed changes to the operation of the Northern Ireland protocol intended to resolve the dispute between the EU and the UK was a “significant compromise for the EU”.“The lack of any evident reciprocal willingness to compromise from our UK partners to date has been deeply disappointing,” he told the DCU Brexit Institute conference.Mr Coveney said the protocol was agreed by the UK prime minister Boris Johnson and Brexit minister David Frost, approved by the British government and ratified by the UK parliament.“They have a duty to deliver on their commitments,” he said.The EU and UK are engaged in negotiations to try to break the impasse over the protocol, the special arrangements agreed in 2019 to prevent Brexit creating a hard border on the island of Ireland and having a trade border between Northern Ireland and Britain.Brussels has welcomed a change in tone from London over the past week with the UK stepping back from the threat to trigger article 16 and unilaterally suspending parts of the protocol, but David Frost has said that “significant gaps” remained between the two sides.Mr Coveney said recent polls have shown that most people in Northern Ireland want the protocol “to work” and across communities “people support a pragmatic and sensible approach”.“It is very important we do not lose sight of the goal here: ensuring an outcome that is best for the people of Northern Ireland,” he said.Former taoiseach Bertie Ahern told the conference that people in Loyalist areas did not understand the protocol but saw it “as a road to the Dublin government taking over again”.“In east Belfast and in the ghettos and in the areas where you are likely to get trouble, people don’t have a clue about the protocol,” he said.Trade issuesAfter attending meetings in Northern Ireland, he said that trying to solve the issue of political identity around the protocol was “far more difficult” than solving the trade issues.“It is seen as a trick by the South to move the border from across the island and to put it down the Irish Sea as a trap for Dublin,” he said.In a discussion around any future referendum on Irish unification, Mr Ahern said having a referendum before working out the detail of how unification would happen was “insanity”.“A referendum before the detail is worked out would mean that it would be rejected both North and South. There is no doubt about that. People are far too politically wise,” he said.“They are used to referendums, particularly in the South. They will want to see the detail.”Katy Hayward, professor of political sociology at Queen’s University Belfast, told the conference t her research on Brexit had found that the level of “misinformation and misunderstanding” around the protocol and what article 16 meant was “a really serious concern”.“When you begin to ask people about it, some of the people who are concerned about it will be worried about being hauled up before a foreign court,” she said.“This will translate into how they protest or cast their vote.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Attack on renowned Memorial rights group

sewage companies have admitted pumping likely illegal levels of waste into rivers, the Environment Agency has revealed. The EA will investigate all of the firms to assess the scale of the problem and can impose unlimited fines, it announced on Thursday.Ofwat will also ask the same water companies to justify their executive bonuses and idends, and provide evidence that they have taken into account their environmental performance and compliance with their obligations.Rebecca Pow, an environment minister, said water companies should be spending more on “better infrastructure and far less on payouts to shareholders”.The EA can impose unlimited fines if it brings criminal proceedings, while Ofwat can fine companies up to 10 per cent of their turnover.Earlier this year Southern Water was told to pay a record £90m fine after pleading guilty to thousands of illegal discharges of sewage into rivers and coastal waters in Kent, Hampshire and Sussex.The investigation came after the EA asked water companies to install monitors on their sewage facilities to check they were staying within the legal limits for how much they were discharging from their facilities.Sewage should only be discharged from facilities in exceptional circumstances, such as intense rain or floods.Before they had added the monitoring devices, water companies admitted to the EA that they were likely to be in breach of current regulations, by allowing regular sewage discharges.“This new information is shocking and wholly unacceptable,” Rebecca Pow said. “We have been repeatedly clear in Parliament in recent weeks that we need to tighten up existing rules but also raise standards across the board when it comes to protecting our rivers.”She added: “I want to see water companies spending far more on better infrastructure, and far less on payouts to shareholders.”Water companies have come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks over repeated discharges of sewage into England’s rivers and coastal waters.The Government was also heavily criticised for blocking an amendment to the new Environment Bill, which would have put a legal duty on water companies to “take all reasonable steps” to stop sewage overflows.After an apparent U-turn in the wake of the vote, ministers added a duty on water companies to “secure a progressive reduction”, though many campaigners argued that it was a watering down of the earlier proposal.Philip Dunne MP, the chair of the Environmental Audit Committee who led the Tory backbench rebellion over the dropping of the Wellington Amendment, said the investigation was “frankly long overdue”.“Our waterways are the arteries of nature, far too many of which are being damaged by unacceptable sewage spills,” he said.“It is clear that with decades of under-investment in our sewerage network there are no quick fixes, but it is welcome that the Government, through the Environment Act passed into law last week, is already taking action to get a grip on this unacceptable activity.”Emma Howard Boyd, chair of the Environment Agency, said: “Any water companies in breach of their permits are acting illegally. This is a major issue of public trust.”A spokesman for Water UK, the industry body, said: “The water industry is committed to the best possible environmental outcomes.“Water companies have been investing heavily to modernise the monitoring of sewage treatment works, and in using better modelling and artificial intelligence techniques to understand and predict any issues that might occur.“Where the data identifies any problems, then action must be taken to address them.”Liv Garfield, chief executive of Severn Trent Water Paid £2.8m in 2020, including £1.9m in bonusesSteve Mogford, chief executive of United UtilitiesPaid  £2.9m in 2020, including more than £2m in annual bonuses and other incentivesSarah Bentley, chief executive at Thames WaterPaid  £782,000 in 2020, including £273,000 in annual bonusIan McAulay, chief executive of Southern WaterPaid more than £1m in 2020, including £550,900 bonusMore from NewsCovid latest news: Germany introduces tighter restrictions on unvaccinatedHuman helpers are no good if they talk like robots, too Nicola Sturgeon accused of ‘culture of cover-up’ over former official’s hospital deathJK Rowling and Churchill axed as house names by primary school to ‘boost ersity’Equal Pay Day is a cheap shot, which does nothing for womenMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hs2 unviable unaffordable undeliverable","story":"The Prime Minister’s announcement of the Integrated Rail Plan has unveiled a stark truth behind one of this country’s most disastrous megaprojects, HS2. Having begun with an utterly hollow business case, the reality of this £200 billion railway is now clear – it will not deliver for the very people it was supposedly intended for. With the Eastern Leg scaled back, the entire project is left hanging on borrowed time. It is not too late to scrutinise properly the seemingly endless pot of taxpayers’ money devoted to HS2, or to question seriously whether it is worth going ahead with at all. The Government must come forward with what the severed leg means for the overall cost.Much has happened since the original proposals for the railway were tabled over a decade ago, most notably the coronavirus pandemic. Attitudes to travel have changed fundamentally. We all know that the project’s utility is almost wholly based on purported efficiency gains for businesses operating beyond our biggest cities, yet those efficiency gains have since been met not by a multi-billion pound railway, but by Zoom. We must not let ourselves slip into a false reality dominated by outdated thinking and outdated proposals.This warrants a wholesale review. We simply cannot sustain the extraordinary level of spending HS2 requires for such negligible gain. The cost has almost quadrupled from the original estimate of £55.7 billion.  Covid-related costs alone have added around £1.7 billion to the bill, with almost half of that associated with Phase One. The National Audit Office notes that 50 per cent of the costs for Phase One are still based on HS2 Ltd’s benchmark estimates rather than costs agreed with industry, so these could rise again. The latest revised cost estimates also assume HS2 Ltd will be able to find £2.8 billion in savings – yet it’s had to dip substantially into its contingency budget.In reality, HS2 will end up costing this country a great deal, without delivering for the Midlands or North as originally intended. The completion date for Phase One has already slipped by over four years to 2033. Any and all sections of Phase Two will have to wait even longer. We Conservatives need to Build Back Better now – not in 15 years time. Millions of people in the North want and deserve to have a much better regional transport system than what is currently on offer, but it must be delivered at least this side of 2030 and without sacrificing the livelihoods of the millions living in its path, who have had their homes and businesses gambled by the state at will.The sheer amount of destruction that this white elephant has wreaked on the lives of my constituents, and many more up and down the Phase One route of the line, is astonishing. Never have I seen such a concentrated level of misery among decent, hard-working people – none of whom asked for the daily disruption they are now facing.Whether it be the excessive noise and vibration levels that have shaken houses the plethora of roads falling apart beneath the low-loaders and dump trucks plying their way around otherwise peaceful villages or the enormous loss of endless hedgerows, ancient woodland and protected habitats that I and my constituents cherish so dearly. This is a dangerous assault on innocent communities, some of which will never look the same again, thanks to HS2. I cannot and will not stand by as the destruction continues, and I would not wish this misery on anyone else. Nor will I ever give up hope. The human cost alone is enough to warrant the project’s scrapping entirely. It is unviable, unaffordable and undeliverable. It is unfit for the new reality in which we all live, and the wrong path to take in improving our country\u0027s infrastructure. We must focus on regional and local projects, as the Integrated Rail Plan does, which can actually deliver real opportunities for people. My constituents, like the vast majority of Britons, are proud of the communities and regions in which they live and work. Let us therefore focus on delivering our levelling-up agenda in a meaningful way. More from NewsCovid latest news: Germany introduces tighter restrictions on unvaccinatedHuman helpers are no good if they talk like robots, too Nicola Sturgeon accused of ‘culture of cover-up’ over former official’s hospital deathJK Rowling and Churchill axed as house names by primary school to ‘boost ersity’Equal Pay Day is a cheap shot, which does nothing for womenMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"joe bidens spineless foreign policy emboldening xi jinping","story":"Arguably the most demanding part of Joe Biden’s three-and-a-half hour video summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping this week was that the meeting seemingly took place well beyond the American President’s normal bedtime. One of the worst kept secrets in Washington is how little time the US leader actually spends in the Oval Office carrying out his presidential duties, and how much time he spends resting from the labours of high office.On a good day, Mr Biden will find time in the morning to attend the daily briefing session at the White House before participating in an undemanding evening event, such as attending a reception for the winners of the national basketball championships. Apart from that, the leader of the free world appears to spend the rest of the day sequestered away from the public eye lest he make any public gaffes, such as forgetting the names of key allies like the Australian Prime Minister. So the fact that Mr Biden did not begin his video summit with Beijing until 7.45pm DC time meant that he was surely well outside his comfort zone, being required to conduct important affairs of state well beyond his normal working hours.Mr Biden’s semi-detached regime is not dissimilar to that of Ronald Reagan in the last years of his presidency. But at least by then Mr Reagan had set in train the events that, as Margaret Thatcher later remarked, ended the Cold War with the Soviet Union “without firing a shot”.By contrast, all Mr Biden has to show for his first year in office is America’s catastrophic defeat in Afghanistan, a self-inflicted wound the strategic implications of which are likely to be felt for years to come.The inherent weakness of the Biden administration, and the current incumbent’s apparent inability to fulfil the daily workload expected of him, has certainly not passed unnoticed by Washington’s rivals, as is evident from Russia’s recent conduct.Russian President Vladimir Putin spent three hours talking over numerous global issues with Mr Biden during their summit in Geneva in June, which subsequently resulted in the US leader’s utter capitulation to Moscow on long-standing arms control demands.Clearly, to judge by Mr Putin’s subsequent conduct, the Russian despot got the measure of Mr Biden, to the extent that he no longer feels constrained about intimidating Washington’s allies in Europe, whether massing troops close to the borders of Ukraine and Poland or threatening Europe’s energy supplies.Now, to judge from the read-out from Monday night’s video summit between the American and Chinese leaders, it is Mr Xi’s turn to take advantage of the Biden administration’s increasing irrelevance in world affairs.Mr Biden’s first mistake was to agree to Beijing’s request for the summit in the first place. Mr Xi is in the process of seeking a third term in office, and participating in global summits with Beijing’s superpower rival certainly helps to boost his domestic standing. Furthermore, in the build-up to the summit, Beijing has maintained its aggressive stance towards Washington, announcing an alarming increase in its nuclear arsenal and resisting appeals for improved cooperation on climate change issues.Yet, so disinclined is Mr Biden to see Beijing as an adversary, preferring the term “competitor”, that the White House pressed on with the summit regardless in the naive hope that, simply by engaging with the Chinese leader, the meeting would somehow result in an easing of tensions. Instead, Mr Xi will have ended the meeting confident in the knowledge that, so long as Mr Biden remains in office, Beijing has little to fear from its superpower rival.Mr Biden’s supine approach was evident from his failure even to mention the key issue that has defined Sino-US relations during the past two years: Beijing’s role in the global coronavirus pandemic that has so far claimed five million lives.During Donald Trump’s presidency, Beijing was under constant pressure to offer more information about the origins of the virus and to come clean about what really took place during the early stages of the pandemic. Under Mr Biden the issue did not even merit a mention. The US president adopted a similarly spineless approach on issues such as Beijing’s brutal repression of millions of Muslim Uyghurs, the suppression of democracy in Hong Kong and its aggression towards Taiwan.For his part, the pugnacious Mr Xi was hardly diplomatic, warning that Washington was “playing with fire” over its continued support for Taiwan’s independent status. As was the case following the Biden-Putin summit in June, Mr Xi will have ended Monday’s meeting confident in the belief that he has nothing to fear so long as the current US administration remains in power.After all, if Mr Biden is not willing to hold Beijing to account for a pandemic that has created havoc across the world, he is hardly likely to defend Taiwan from Beijing’s long-standing ambition to seize control of the territory by brute force.More from NewsCovid latest news: Germany introduces tighter restrictions on unvaccinatedHuman helpers are no good if they talk like robots, too Nicola Sturgeon accused of ‘culture of cover-up’ over former official’s hospital deathJK Rowling and Churchill axed as house names by primary school to ‘boost ersity’Equal Pay Day is a cheap shot, which does nothing for womenMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"local authorities given new powers impose face masks schools","story":"Face masks are set to return to schools as local public health directors have been given new powers to bypass Whitehall and introduce tougher restrictions on children.Changes to official guidance now mean that regional public health officials can impose masks on secondary school pupils without the move being sanctioned by Downing Street.Previously, local authorities needed the Government\u0027s sign off before introducing new Covid restrictions in schools.Ministers have been accused of “washing their hands” of the issue, with family groups warning that the move could create a “domino” effect where councils across the country mandate masks in schools.“This will lead to more and more councils going in the same direction and imposing face masks on children,” said Liz Cole, co-founder of the parent campaign group UsForThem.“This will embolden councils to act and it will become a race to the bottom. The councils will be like dominos and go one after the other.“If the Government is now distancing itself from what is happening on the ground, how is there going to be an exit strategy from these measures? The Government is washing its hands of it.”Since face masks are not being imposed for adults, this “widens the inequality” between adults and children.Previously, a local council had to be designated by Downing Street officials as an “enhanced response” area if it wanted to impose face masks on school children.This designation is now no longer required, meaning local public health directors can advise pupils at all the secondary schools in their area to wear face masks in communal areas such as corridors if there is a rise in cases.Local public health directors have also been given the power to tell children to wear face masks during lessons if there is an outbreak at a particular school. Permission would still need to be sought from ministers before imposing face masks on children during lessons in an entire region.The change in official guidance comes amid concern about a potential rise in Covid cases among children during the run up to Christmas.More than half of children of secondary school age are estimated to have been infected with Covid since the start of September.“In all cases any educational and wellbeing drawbacks in the recommended use of face coverings should be balanced with the benefits in managing transmission,” the guidance from the Department for Education (DfE) says.“Children of primary school age and early-years children should not be advised to wear face coverings.”The Government has attempted to ramp up a vaccination campaign in children in recent weeks. But fewer than four in 10 eligible children have so far had a jab, with just over one million of those aged between 12 and 15 in England having been vaccinated.Earlier this week, health chiefs said that children who have had Covid should wait three months to be vaccinated.The UK Health Security Agency said the new guidance for children aged 12 to 15 had been taken as a precautionary measure to reduce the risks of a rare type of heart inflammation.Until now, parents have only been advised to wait a month for children who suffer a Covid infection to be vaccinated.The new advice, following a review of evidence by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, affects millions of children.More from NewsCovid latest news: Germany introduces tighter restrictions on unvaccinatedHuman helpers are no good if they talk like robots, too Nicola Sturgeon accused of ‘culture of cover-up’ over former official’s hospital deathJK Rowling and Churchill axed as house names by primary school to ‘boost ersity’Equal Pay Day is a cheap shot, which does nothing for womenMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"christmas lockdown could plan b","story":"Will there be a Christmas lockdown and when could Plan B happen  All you need to knowBoris Johnson has refused to rule out the government’s Plan B starting in  - or even a Christmas lockdown as the R rate nudges . and deaths run to more than , a weekthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video boris-johnson-says-we-cannot-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:IiUlUoXX,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Prime Minister urged Brits to get their booster vaccine to avoid new restrictions, with all over-s and vulnerable people now able to get a third dose six months after their second one. Today he told his Cabinet that while boosters will be the main defence, “we are still not out of the woods and we cannot be complacent”. Yet despite an R rate of . to ., cases ‘running hot’ and deaths at more than , a week, he has not actually triggered England’s ‘Plan B’ - which stops well short of a lockdown. So what’s going on  Here are the main questions answered. Why is Boris Johnson worried  Boris Johnson says there is a new threat as cases are spiking in European countries including Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. Describing it as a “blizzard”, he said: “We don’t yet know the extent to which this new wave will sweep up on our shores but history shows that we cannot afford to be complacent.” Perhaps, though, the Prime Minister needs to be more concerned about the situation closer to home. UK cases have been at a high level for months and are rising again after a long fall, up .% week-on-week. There are more than , deaths a week within  days of a positive test. Scientists who spoke to the Mirror suggested domestic policy - which has pretty much no Covid restrictions in England - would be far more to blame for a rise than surges in the virus abroad. It could be that waning immunity and colder weather, forcing people to huddle indoors, are helping the virus spread.  Will there be a lockdown for Christmas   A few weeks ago Boris Johnson was asked this, and replied: “I see no evidence whatever to think that any kind of lockdown is on the cards.” But asked a similar question last night, he told a No press conference: “Clearly we cannot rule anything out. “And the most important thing people can do to prevent further NPIs from being taken is to - non-pharmaceutical interventions that is, further restrictions - get the boosters. So yes, there could be a Christmas lockdown, it’s possible. But at the same time, Mr Johnson hasn’t even triggered his Plan B, let alone full lockdown. It seems likely his warnings are at least partly designed to push people into getting their booster. What is England’s Covid ‘Plan B’  A -page plan spells out a ‘Plan B’ for Englandthe virus surges. It includes bringing back the legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings. Which settings would only be decided at the time but they’d likely include public transport, shops and supermarkets. Separately, schools have a “contingency framework” forthe virus surges locally. That includes compulsory masks in secondary classrooms. Plan B also involves forcing punters to show they’ve been fully-vaccinated using the NHS Covid pass - before entering all nightclubs, and other venues open after am with alcohol, music, and dancing. It’d also include indoor, crowded settings with  or more people outdoor, crowded settings with , or more people and any settings with , or more attendees, like Premier League football and stadium gigs. Lastly, Plan B would also see the government “consider asking people to work from homethey can, for a limited period”. And ministers will “communicate clearly and urgently to the public that the level of risk has increased, and with it the need to behave more cautiously” - which arguably is already happening.  How is Plan B dferent from a lockdown  Plan B stops far, far short of the lockdown rules that last afflicted England in early .Those included forcing people by law to stay at home apart from for a limited number of reasons, such as going out for exercise or medical appointments. Shielding resumed, pubs and restaurants shut, takeaway pints were banned, schools were shut for months, and meetings between people from dferent households or bubbles were outlawed.Millions of workers were put on furlough, with the government paying up to % of their wages at a cost of billions of pounds per week. All these measures remain so far in reserve that the government dare not even speak their name - they do not feature in the Plan B document. When could Plan B happen  We cannot say “when” Plan B would happen exactly, and many experts have called for it to be triggered already.But we can say what the criteria for triggering it are. Key questions for triggering Plan B include:Is the NHS in danger of being overwhelmed  This crucially isn’t just about cases - hospitalisations and deaths are more important. Key metrics include “hospital occupancy for COVID- and non-COVID- patients, intensive care unitcapacity, admissions in vaccinated iniduals, and the rate of growth of admissions. The link between hospitalisation and infections: The winter plan says the Government is monitoring the ratio of cases to hospitalisations and also the proportion of admissions due to infections among other factors. It also states ministers are keeping an eye on how many people over -years-old are catching Covid- or ending up in hospital. Vaccine efficacy and immunity: A major booster campaign for the over-s is under way but was not as quick as ministers hoped. Crucial will be whether immunity across the population is waning, or whether it’s being kept strong by the booster programme. The impact of new iants: In recent months the threat of a new, more deadly or more infectious iant appears to have faded. But that doesn’t mean it won’t emerge in future months, and the government now has a sequencing infrastructure that will attempt to spot them as they appear.Why hasn’t Boris Johnson triggered Plan B yet  The Prime Minister has effectively made a political choice that, because the rate of new cases isn’t soaring the NHS isn’t yet “overwhelmed”, , deaths a week are a price worth paying for a le without Plan B restrictions. He said this week: “We donapost see anything in the data at the moment to suggest that we need to go to Plan B. Weaposre sticking with Plan A.” Organisations including doctors’ and NHS groups have argued the health service is, in fact, close to breaking point due to the backlog of elective care. Critics argue the Prime Minister should have drawn the line in a dferent place and triggered Plan B at an earlier stage. What’s happening with booster vaccines  Booster jabs will be rolled out to people under . People aged  to -years-old are to be offered another dose of the vaccine to boost their immunity and limit transmission of the virus. Over-s and vulnerable groups could already get a booster, six months or more after their second dose. A booking can be got in the diary after a five month gap. While healthy under-s are not being offered a booster for now, the JCVI watchdog will make a decision on this when more data is available. The vaccine experts also announced new advice for  to -year-olds, who will now be told to get a second dose  weeks after their first. Will I have to get a booster for foreign travel  Quite possibly, yes. Holidaymakers can use the NHS Covid pass to prove they are fully vaccinated, allowing them to avoid quarantine rules in most countries. But the Government has been hinting that people will soon need to prove theyaposve had a booster - a third dose - to be considered fully jabbed. Boris Johnson said: I think that we will be making plans to add the booster to the NHS Covid travel pass. But again, I think what the general lesson is,anybody wants to travel, you can see that getting fully vaccinated with a booster is going to be something that will - on the whole - make your le easier in all kinds of ways including for foreign travel. So I would just say, you know,youaposre thinking about that, then this is yet another reason to get it done. The PM added: On boosters, itaposs very clear that getting three jabs - getting your booster - will become an important fact and it will make le easier for you in all sorts of ways, and we will have to adjust our concept of what constitutes a full vaccination to take account of that.

They say Jobcentre chiefs should impose inspections on , people who made new claims in the pandemic, but whose cases had ended by January this year. It could see officials trying to claw money back from some Brits who fell on hard times a year ago. Since January the Department for Work and Pensionshas been reviewing , cases it deemed “at particular risk of fraud or error”, after relaxing identity checks during the pandemic. Some of those reviews prompted a backlash, as families were told to hold up a copy of that day’s newspaper. About % of the , cases had errors. But the cross-party PAC today claims that exercise did not go far enough - and , extra people should be subjected to retrospective checks in the next nine months. They are people who made new claims during Covid but whose claims ended by January . The committee argued the DWP had “lost a grip” of fraud and error in Universal Credit and was “taken by surprise” by the extent of fraud in the pandemic.UC overpayments due to “fraud and error” - which includes mistakes made by the DWP - rose to £.bn in  , or .% of UC spending. The DWP aims to cut this to .% but is “unable to show how it expects to achieve the reduction and does not currently have the necessary plan or resources to achieve it,” PAC said. The MPs said billions in taxpayers’ money “is almost certainly lost” - while state pensioners were underpaid for years. PAC chair Meg Hillier added: “This is a real-le waking nightmare for the huge numbers of people affected, from the most vulnerable in our society to the full-time working families who still struggle daily to make ends meet.  “The Department appears unequipped either to properly administer our labyrinthine benefits system or detect and correct years of mistakes.” It came as new figures yesterday showed one in four children in Britain are living in households hit by the £-a-week Universal Credit cut. More than . million children and young people were living in households receiving UC before the £ uplt was removed in October. There were . million people on UC on October , down , from July .Dan Paskins of Save The Children said parents are constantly worried about food and bills while kids are missing school trips - despite a Budget change to make UC more generous for workers.He said: We welcomed the Governmentaposs adjustments to Universal Credit in the Budget. But allowing some people to keep more of their income is not a replacement for a strong social safety net that protects everyone in our society. Ministers must do more to protect children across the UK from cold and hunger this winter. A government spokesperson said: “It is disappointing that the Public Accounts Committee has failed to acknowledge that in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic, we prioritised supporting record numbers of genuine claimants. “Thanks to this decision, the Universal Credit system stood up to the challenge of the pandemic so people received vital financial support at their time of need. “We are now taking extensive action to ensure all claims made were genuine. “Fraud and error in the benefit system is rare, with % of benefits worth more than £bn paid correctly, and just .% of benefits being overpaid due to DWP error.” Comment MORE ON Save the ChildrenDepartment for Work and PensionsMeg HillierFitness\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

HS and Northern Powerhouse Rail have both been downgraded in a long-awaited Integrated Rail Plan. Keir Starmer said Boris Johnson had “ripped up” his own promises and fallen at the first ‘levelling up’ hurdle, adding: “The North of England has been betrayed.”An interviewer asked Boris Johnsonhe thought northerners were stupid after he tried to spin the announcement by saying: “This is a fantastic and a monumental achievement and a great day for rail in this country.” The PM claimed: “What we’re doing is not just the big aposYapos of HS but we’re also doing NPR that runs from Liverpool to Warrington to Manchester to Leeds to York.” Yet neither of those claims are the full truth at all, and it will be the mid-s by the time even the stripped-back projects are complete. Here are all the details of the schemes - which may go some way to explain why so many people are so angry. What has changed  Two massive, long-planned rail projects have been watered down, after fears they would cost up to £bn. Now they’ll cost £bn. More could be spent in future but tens of billions of pounds have still been cut from the projects. The first big change is to High Speed  . The second is Northern Powerhouse Rail .  What has happened to HS  HS was meant to be a brand new Y-shaped line, first from London to Birmingham, then branching west to Manchester and east to Leeds. The West leg is still on but East has been scrapped. The new East line will only run to East Midlands Parkway near Nottingham. From there, HS trains will then run on existing track to Nottingham in one direction and Derby, Chesterfield and Sheffield in the other. Officials claim this is an improvement for Derby and Nottingham, which will now get direct HS trains instead of having to get to a parkway station in Toton. But HS trains will not run to Leeds at all. There will be a £m study to look at whether they might in future.  What has happened to NPR  NPR was envisaged by many as a new, dedicated east-west line from Liverpool to Manchester and Leeds. Instead, there will be a new high-speed track only part of the way, from Warrington to Marsden in Yorkshire . Technically NPR trains will still run from Liverpool to York through Warrington, Manchester, Huddersfield and Leeds. But much of it will be on existing track, limiting journey times and capacity. The government claimed building a full Manchester-Leeds NPR line anew would have cost £bn more to save four minutes off the journey. But crucially, axing it means scrapping plans for a new through station in Bradford - England’s seventh-largest city.  What promises has Boris Johnson broken  The Prime Minister told Parliament in February: I can certainly confirm that we are going to develop the eastern leg as well as the whole of the HS. He also pledged in  to deliver a high-speed NPR line at least from Leeds to Manchester, adding: “I want to be the PM who does with Northern Powerhouse Rail what we did with Crossrail in London.” The  Tory manesto repeated that promise saying: We will build Northern Powerhouse Rail between Leeds and Manchester. Neither of those things are happening in full. What is the route map  Below is the core route map for HS and NPR by the s. HS trains will leave London Euston, stopping at Old Oak Common station in the capital, and run to Birmingham Interchangeand Birmingham city centre. North of Birmingham the line will branch, with a new high-speed track west to Crewe, Manchester Airport and Manchester. The eastern track will end at East Midlands Parkway, with trains continuing onexisting track to Nottingham, Derby, Chesterfield and Sheffield. Northern Powerhouse Rail will run from York to Liverpool through Leeds, Huddersfield, Manchester, Manchester Airport and Warrington. But only the Huddersfield-to-Warrington stretch will use a new high-speed track, with the rest running on existing track. Separately there will be upgrades to the East Coast, Midland and Transpennine lines.  Will HS still run to Sheffield and Leeds  HS trains from London will still run to Sheffield. A large portion of that journey will be on existing slower track, though the government insists the journey time from London to Sheffield will remain the same as planned at  minutes.. HS trains will not run to Leeds. There will be a project to see how bringing trains to Leeds could be achieved. Will NPR still run to Bradford  Yes, NPR will run from Leeds to Bradford on a branch line with a supposed journey time of  minutes. But there will not be a new line with a new station in Bradford, meaning those wanting to go to Manchester must either change in Leeds, or take the slow train via Halax. What will journey times be like  Faster than now - but slower than under the previous plans. Grant Shapps boasted journeys will fall from  to  minutes for Manchester to Birmingham  to  minutes for London to Derby  to  minutes for Brimingham to Nottingham  to  minutes for Leeds to Manchester and  minutes to  minutes from Liverpool to Manchester. But London to Leeds will take  minutes -  minutes longer thanthe city had got HS. And journeys from the capital to York, Darlington and Newcastle will all take longer than they would have done under HS. Birmingham to Newcastle will take  minutes -  minutes longer than previously planned. Journeys from London to Glasgow will still take three hours and  minutes  minutes faster than currently.  Scroll down for a full table of journey times. What will happen to capacity  Officials insist upgrades will improve capacity across several lines, but critics say this will not happen as much as it would have done with HS. HS and NPR trains will have to squeeze into existing lines with services that are already running with more stops. And Leeds is an obvious loser on capacity it would have had an extra London line in the form of HS, but instead it will have to rely on the existing network. How frequent will the trains be  The government claims train frequency will rise as follows by the mid-s.Birmingham-Manchester: From  to  trains per hour Birmingham-Nottingham: From  to  trains per hour Birmingham-Leeds: From  to  trains per hour Leeds-Manchester: From  to  trains per hour Liverpool-Manchester: From  to  trains per hour Liverpool-Leeds: From  to  trains per hourThere would also be “ to ” trains per hour running through the HS western leg via Crewe. But this will not be as dramatic as it would have been under full previous plans. Other lines will simply see “no reduction in frequency” When will it all be finished  Not for two decades or more. Sly Tory ministers claimed the upgrades would come into service quicker than HS and NPR would have done. They said HS would only have reached Leeds in  while full NPR from Manchester and Leeds would take until . Yet the small print shows many of the headline measures still won’t be finished until the “early to MID s”, despite being stripped back. The timetable for completions is now… By around :NPR services on the existing Transpennine route from Leeds and York to Manchester. Upgrades and electrications to the existing Midland Main Line, East Coast Main Line, Sheffield to Manchester line and Bradford to Leeds line. By around :HS from London to Birmingham, West Midlands and Crewe.By the ‘early to mid s’HS West from Crewe to Manchester. Surviving section of HS East to East Midlands Parkway. Surviving high speed NPR section east of Manchester.

Mr Raab told Sky News: “I think it’s right there’s practice around the world around this to look at least at the possibilities of international partnerships, for international processing of some of these claims.” AskedAlbania could be a site for the processing Mr Raab replied: “That’s one country. “But as Foreign Secretary we were willing to look with partners at whether it’s possible to do this international processing.” Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds hit back: “Instead of chasing headlines about unconscionable offshore processing, the Government should address its own failures.  There is no effective deal in place with the French Authorities, and, instead of providing properly managed safe and legal routes, the Government closed the Dubs Scheme that helped unaccompanied children. The Government’s incompetence is dangerous, with ever-increasing numbers of people risking their lives in the English Channel.” The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: Iaposve always been clear that we want to keep all options on the table. As illegal migration is an international issue, youaposd expect us to have discussions with both France and other international partners to help reduce illegal migration. He added the UK had been in talks with a number of countries but added: Iaposm simply saying Iaposm not going to get into speculation about ongoing discussions with inidually named countries. As youaposd expect given the international elements of this, it is right the Government speaks to a number of countries about these global challenges. Mr Raab went on: “The point is, as well as focusing on regional processing which is probably the best way, the optimum way of dealing with refugees, as close to source as possible, better for them - but also we want to look with international partners at how we reduce the pull factor.” He later told Times Radio: “Forgive me not commenting on the inidual countries. A lot of these discussions are at preliminary stage. It is much more than just one partner and weaposre not the only country that is facing this challenge.” Home Secretary Priti Patel has repeatedly been accused of hardline plans to deal with the thousands of desperate people who cross the Channel. But she has clashed with research with contradicts her claims that the majority of those crossing from France are not “genuine” asylum seekers. And a minister yesterday admitted only five migrants who crossed the Channel by boat to the UK have been ed to Europe so far this year. More than , people have arrived in the UK this year after crossing the Channel in small boats. This is almost three times the total of around , in . A Home Office spokesperson said: “Migrants making these dangerous crossings are putting their lives at risk and it is vital we do everything we can to prevent them and break the business model of the criminal gangs exploiting people. “People should claim asylum in the first safe country they arrive in, and as part of our response it is important we have a maritime deterrent in the channel and work with international partners to put an end to these dangerous journeys.”  Meanwhile, France has rejected a British claim that Priti Patel and her counterpart Gerald Darmanin agreed to work to prevent % of crossings of the English Channel. The Home Office issued a joint statement from the pair which said they had agreed measures to stop the dangerous crossings of the deadly route. But the French embassy in London said the % figure should not be presented as an agreed figure. Ms Patel and Mr Darmanin held talks on Monday night with the UK and France involved in a long-running row over how to address the problem of migrants seeking to cross the Channel. The joint statement issued afterwards said: Both the Home Secretary and interior minister agreed to strengthen operational cooperation further. More must be done to stop the dangerous crossings. They agreed to accelerate the delivery of the commitments made in the joint agreement of July  to deliver on their joint determination to prevent % of crossings and make this deadly route unviable.But the French embassy said on Twitter : For the record, the % figure was not agreed between the Home Secretary and French interior minister GDarmanin and should not be presented as an agreed commitment: it is not.And it is not part of the joint statement.

Ms Dorries, who has previously been highly critical of the BBC, took exception to an MP who told Ms Kuenssberg Boris Johnson “looked weak and sounded weak” at a meeting last night.The anonymous Tory MP claimed “authority is evaporating” during the gathering of the  Committee of back benchers. But Ms Dorries wrote: “Laura, I very much like and respect you, but we both know, that text is ridiculous.“Although nowhere near as ridiculous as the person - obviously totally desperate for your attention - who sent it”.  Askedshe sent the tweet publicly in error or why she deleted it, a source close to Ms Dorries declined to comment. Former London mayor candidate Siobhan Benita tweeted: “Nadine Dorries is not fit to be Culture Secretary.” Labour MP Karl Turner said: “Sec of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport publically [sic] tells off @bbclaurak for having the audacity to report Johnson’s terrible state today and then quickly deletes the tweet.”Twitter pundit James Felton added: “You know being Secretary of State for Culture, Media  Sport doesn’t mean you’re the boss of journalism right.”Ms Dorries later said she did not rebuke Laura Kuenssberg and never would. Shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens said: We have spent much of the past two weeks talking about standards in public office and on this side of the House we care deeply about the independence and the impartiality of the BBC. I know the Secretary of State also cares to the extent that she actually has the time to police the BBCaposs political editoraposs tweets and publicly rebuke her. Ms Dorries said: I did not rebuke Laura Kuenssberg, somebody who is maybe ... the best in the business actually, very professional, very polite tweet. The tweet was completely misinterpreted. I was not rebuking Laura Kuenssberg and never would.The Culture Secretary has a long history of eyebrow-raising tweets about the BBC and to journalists, among many other issues. In  she suggested ministers should withhold the licence fee payout at a round of negotiations, unless they did more to address discrimination.  In February  she wrote: “The BBC favour strident, very left wing, often hypocritical and frequently patronising views that turn people away.” In October  she wrote: “BBC needs to up its game in political presentation. Dull, boring, male and ageing wig wearing men losing the plot don’t cut it anymore.” On Nick Watt joining Newsnight, a role Andrew Neil hailed as “excellent”, she retorted: “Or in other words, the BBC recruits straight from , again.” On a Guido Fawkes story about a nurse interviewee worried about PPE being a left-wing activist, she replied: “Would the BBC ever put up a Conservatives activist  Don’t hold your breath…” She also threatened to nail a Sunday Mirror reporter’s testicles to the floor in  – for asking how her daughter could work as her secretary when she lived nearly  miles away.

Bailey Cassidy downed pints after pint at the Riverside Stadium before jumping over the barrier and running across the halfway line. He then removed his t-shirt and “waved it around his head”. The -year-old interrupted the European Championship warm-up game that saw the Three Lions take on Romania in June of this year. Cassidy has been a member of the England Supporters Association for  years, TeesideLive reports. He made a “fool of himself” during the -second hooliganism at the Middlesborough ground. Cassidy, from Suffolk, he was convicted at Teeside Magistrates’ Court for going into the playing area at a football match “without lawful authority or lawful excuse”.  He was brought back before the Middlesbrough court on Tuesday as police sought a football banning order. Prosecutor Rachel Butt stated the football banning order is “necessary to prevent violence and disorder”. The court was told how the offence was committed on June . Ms Butt told how a police officer who was deployed inside the ground at .pm for an incident during the first-half of the game.  Cassidy had climbed over the barriers and ran onto the pitch when the players were still playing. Cassidy ran away from police officers and was chased by a match steward. Ms Butt described how he then removed his t-shirt and waved it around his head as fans chanted in the background. When caught, Cassidy was taken to the North-west corner of the pitch where his eyes were glazed, he smelt of alcohol and his speech was slow.  Cassidy went on to give another man’s name when asked by police, and claimed he was from Manchester. He later confirmed his real name and was arrested. During interview, Cassidy admitted he had drank seven pints and admitted to his actions. When asked by officershis actions may have led to violence or disorder, he replied: Maybe more. Ms Butt applied for a minimum three year football banning order with a requirement that Cassidy does not enter the parish, city or town boundary eight hours before or after any England menaposs games.  Ross Tismond, mitigating, opposed the football banning order and stated there arenapost reasonable grounds for the ban. The court heard how Cassidy was on the pitch for  seconds and his actions were a one off event. Mr Tismond told how it was Cassidyaposs first opportunity to attend a football match with his father as he had been undergoing chemotherapy. However, Cassidy drank far too much. He was exceptionally drunk and made a fool of himself. Mr Tismond added that Cassidy was petried at the prospect of receiving a football banning order. District Judge Marie Mallon outlined that there are reasonable grounds to make the order as Cassidy went onto the playing area during play and crossed the halfway line. She added that the incident was severely exacerbated by the covid- pandemic as many players had formed bubbles and isolated in preparation for the game. The district judge made the football banning order for three years which will prevent Cassidy, of Roman Way, Heverhill, Suffolk, from causing disruption to England matches. On any day when the England senior menaposs national team are playing a fixture within England, Wales or Scotland the defendant must not enter the town, city or parish boundary wherein that fixture is being played, during the period eight hours before until eight hours after the scheduled kick off time.

The Kingaposs College epidemiology professor repeated comments made last week that Brits should be ready for Covid to remain in our lives for the next five Christmases, and not just this one.His comments came as new data suggests recent coronavirus rates in England are similar to infections seen just after the peak of the second wave in January this year.From mid-October to early November, the prevalence was . per cent - the same as January - compared with . per cent in September.  According to the data, prevalence increased between rounds  and  of Imperial College Londonaposs React- study across most age groups and regions. During round , which ran from October  to November , there was a fall in prevalence from a peak at around October  to . School-aged children had the highest rates of infection with a prevalence of . per cent in those aged five to  and . per cent in those aged  to .  The data suggests all of the cases were the Delta iant or sub-lineages. The most prevalent was AY., which the scientists say is more likely to result in asymptomatic infection. Christl Donnelly, professor of statistical epidemiology at Imperial College London, said: It is absolutely the case thatpeople are waiting for symptoms to do a test and to therefore identy that they are infected, and therefore cut back their contacts, being asymptomatic may facilitate transmission for example.  It is asymptomatic transmission that really can make the dference between whataposs relatively easily containable and what needs vaccination. The AY.. mutation which officials are monitoring as a iant under investigation represented . per cent of infections. Researchers say the observational nature of survey data and the relatively small proportion of unvaccinated adults calls into question the comparability of vaccinated and unvaccinated groups.  However, they found that third vaccine doses for eligible adults and the vaccination of children aged  and over are associated with lower infection risk. The researchers say they should therefore remain a high priority - with possible extension to children aged five to  - and this should help reduce Covid transmission over the winter. The study has been released as a pre-print that has not been through peer review and is not published in a journal.  The latest data from the ZOE study led by Prof Spector suggested there are currently on average , new daily symptomatic cases of the virus in the UK, based on both PCR and rapid lateral flow test data from up to five days ago. This is a fall of  per cent from , new daily cases last week, researchers said. Prof Spector said: According to the ZOE data, the steep drop in cases over the last two weeks has now slowed but remains at very high rates, affecting one in  people. In terms of what it means for Christmas, Iaposm cautiously optimistic for the remainder of the year. Itaposs becoming clear that children and the school holidays play a key role in the waves of infection. I think itaposs safe to say that we can expect to see another rise in the new year after the holidays.  Thereaposs a long road ahead and I think weaposll be dealing with Covid for the next five years, so itaposs important we have a strategy that looks much further ahead and not just to save Christmas. He stressed the importance of healthy behaviours such as working more from home when possible and self-isolation with all symptoms, as well as wearing face coverings in high-risk areas. But Prof Spector said the most important thing is to get fully vaccinated, a term he said must be redefined to having three doses to protect us all from Delta and the inevitable new iants of Covid yet to come. The ZOE study showed that, in those who have had at least two doses of a vaccine, cases have levelled off and it is estimated there are currently , new daily symptomatic cases in the UK, down  per cent from , new daily cases last week. The number of daily new cases among people aged up to  - which had been falling - is showing signs of an uptick, researchers said. Cases in age groups between  to  have levelled off, while those among the over-s are now declining, they added.

Care home boss, Nicola Richards, has founded the ‘ Support Social Care Heroes ’because she says “it’s time to look after these amazing workers.”They are hoping for donations from the nation so they can offer these “undervalued” and “exhausted” carers help including counselling, fitness, wellbeing coaching, menopause advice and nutrition programmes.Nicola, managing director of Palms Row Health Care and Chair of the Sheffield Care Association, said: “These carers need the same recognition as the NHS, the same discounts in stores, the same respect.Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter They are the lowest paid workforce with one of the hardest jobs. Without them the community would break down. “Everybody at some point will probably need care workers to look after somebody, so we have to look after them because they have done an incredible job. “They have done it for years but the pandemic has highlighted how essential they are. They have become extended family to our residents during lockdown.  “Carers often work long, anti-social hours and they don’t often get the recognition and rewards they deserve. The situation was desperate before the pandemic but the last two years has seen them struggle like never before. “ She says SSCH, which is in the process of achieving charitable status, aims to “preserve, protect and improve the health and wellbeing of those providing social care”. There are . million people working in social care in the UK and this is expected to increase to . million by .  It is hoped that SSCH will receive signicant support following research which found that the overwhelming majority of the public feel that social care staff are undervaluedand underpaid . Nicola added: “The care sector loses its best people every week. “While the sector continues to fight for fair wages and conditions for carers, Support Social Care Heroes aims to fill a gap by improving the wellbeing of these vital workers and show them that they are valued. It’s time to care for our social care heroes.”  Nurse Laura Hibbard, Care Manager at Westbourne Care home in Sheffield, added: “The last  months have been so tough for everyone in the care sector. “Care home residents across the country have shown unimaginable resilience throughout the pandemic but the people who care for them are mentally, emotionally and physically exhausted. “No one becomes a carer for the money, we do it to improve the lives of vulnerable people. It can be a hugely rewarding experience but it can also be extremely dficult at times. Carers often feel forgotten so I think it’s wonderful that SSCH is being established to acknowledge the crucial role they play in our society.”  Nadra Ahmed OBE, Executive Chair of the National Care Association, commented: “Valuing our workforce for the professionalism they have shown through the past  months, and for many years before, is essential. “We must do everything we can to show them how much we care about them as they support those in our services. The passion with which Support Social Care Heroes is being launched as an innovative, led by providers, organisation demonstrates how invaluable our workforce is to us. “Being able to do something tangible for them when they need it most feels positive. Caring about those who care for others is the right thing to do.”Anyone who wishes to donate to or support Support Social Care Heroes can do so by visiting: www.ssch.info.Comment MORE ON NHSCharitiesCare homesCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

This can be damaging to the protected areas, and wildle, and can affect the enjoyment of other visitors, and is therefore not compatible with the location. Of course, our deepest sympathies are with those of you who have lost loved ones, and we are very sorrythis causes any offence, we do assure you that none is intended. The Council does have official memorial locations based on the cemeteries and crematoria and we believe that this is a much more suitable, sustainable and appropriate way forward for these types of memorial gestures.

Lisa Riley SAYS her child Layla Fielding has been left without a proper education since year three when she was expelled. But the Bury council has refuted these claims, saying Layla has always had a school place but her mother has deemed it to be unsuitable.Layla, from Bury, has special educational needs, with Lisa telling the Manchester Evening News she has ADHD, sensory processing disorder and anxiety.In the past when she has felt overwhelmed, Layla has run out of the classroom - even managing to escape school premises altogether. It has been three years since Layla has had any regular classroom time, with Lisa giving up work to stay at home with her daughter - who has been struggling with loneliness.  I think Iaposve missed out on a lot by not going to school. Iaposve been missing out on learning, socialising and everything like that, Layla told the MEN. The lack of classroom time has had a devastating effect on her and her family, and Lisa has hit out at Bury Council for failing to find her a suitable spot. Weaposre at a stage where I feel like Iaposve got to shout out to get heard for my little girl, Lisa Riley said. Layla has told her mum: I feel like I havenapost got any friends now and I feel lonely sometimes. Layla did attend St.Joseph  St.Bedeaposs for a few weeks in the January after she was excluded from a school in Rochdale. But her mother says her flight or fight response was triggered - and she once again managed to escape the school grounds. Lisa added: It was the same scenario, Layla couldnapost cope.  Layla now sees an alternative education provider, but this is only for three two hours sessions a week, and Lisa said it is aposno substitute for the formal education her daughter deservesapos. She fears that Layla, who she says is bright and intelligent, is years behind in her learning - especially as she should be set to start secondary school in September. With the right support in place, and with staff made aware of Laylaaposs sensory issues, Lisa believes sheaposd be more than capable of having a formal education in a normal school. She said: Almost three years in, we need a suitable place for Layla to attend. And itaposs not just the academic le and learning, itaposs the social, the emotional, making friends, feeling part of a group and community that Layla is missing out on and has missed out on. And really I just find it staggering to think the council canapost accommodate or find one single place to suit Layla. My daughter deserves better than the council are delivering for her. Bury Council told the MEN Layla has had a school place for the past three years - although it had been deemed unsuitable by her mother. A spokesperson said: We always strive to ensure that all children, whatever their circumstances, are provided with the education that is most appropriate for them and in the right setting. “We have worked extensively with Ms Riley over many months to find the solution that is best for her and her daughter. At all times Layla has had a school place. “Following her exclusion, a place for Layla was provided at a primary school in Bury in . To support her successful reintegration into school a plan was agreed with a part-time in school and with specialist part-time provision off-site, however as this broke down the school moved to providing full-time offsite provision. “In January , the council agreed to fund full-time provision with an approved alternative provider to continue to work with Layla and reintegrate her back into her school environment. Her mainstream school found it challenging to meet Laylaaposs needs, but Ms Riley was of the view that a school had to be a mainstream school and special provision would not be considered. Unfortunately, this has delayed reaching an alternative arrangement for Layla. “Layla has a place at her primary school and is currently being provided with education offsite with an approved alternative provider as Layla has struggled to adapt to her school environment. “We are consulting with a range of primary mainstream schools and considering specialist provision alongside these options in order to identy the most suitable setting for Layla.” Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON EducationSchoolsSecondary schoolADHD\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Late-night emails, client WhatsApps, the news, a Twitter notication, FitBit… it didn’t matter what it was. What mattered is that I was immediately available or I’d miss something transformative, I was sure of it. I’d sit at dinner, discussing a friend’s hilariously bad date, missing cues to laugh as I was too busy urging myself not to glance down at my lit up screen. I’d sit at my desk, unable to focus, being pulled out of concentration by the incessant glow. I had reached such a heightened level of contact with the outside world that I didn’t even notice how badly I needed to disconnect. One day, after a long, hard think about this habit, I did something I never thought would actually stick: I turned every single notication off.You’d think I’d be the last person on earth to actually manage this, or I certainly did anyway. I had founded amarketing agencyin the year prior. I had clients, a small team, umpteen social media accounts to manage, inquiring journalists, potential business popping up and I really believed this demanded me to be non-negotiably on, all the time. Would you ever go cold turkey on your phone notications  Have your say in the comments below Fast forward six months, I now find it incredibly odd to imagine my phone holding that much power over me. I’ve turned off every single notication, I don’t open the email app out-of-hours, and I’ve turned off the banner and badge alerts for most apps too. Nothing, except urgent phone calls, has lit up my phone for over half a year. The first two weeks were uncomfortably dficult. When you get a notication, it triggers a dopamine rush, and my own brain was addicted to this “reward”, craving the habit-based behaviour. I felt anxious for a while, semi-desperately telling everyone about it, making sure they knew to call they needed me.After that  Peace. There’s been a million ways this has benefited me in every aspect of my le but perhaps most importantly, I am able to be present, no matter where I am. Whether it’s getting my head down to plan a brand launch strategy or at the dinner table discussing future travel plans. Either way, I am finally living in the moment. People rarely call, and this always surprises me. Both my colleagues and I have realised that we believe everything is urgent, until we’re forced to decideit’s worth interrupting someone... and it often turns out, it’s just not. Clients follow the same logic. I’m a big fan of that. I can’t think of one single moment or opportunity I have missed because of this. Everyone, both professionally and personally, has better boundaries with me now. Our clients rarely WhatsApp, butand when they do, I still won’t reply out of working hours, unless itaposs an emergency - which is almost never. My friends know I’ll reply when I can , but they also know when I’m with them, I’m now both physically and mentally present. As a society, we have a painful and damaging relationship with technology, and an ever-growing notion that with all this wonderful tech, we should be far more connected than ever before. It’s undeniable that we’re privileged to have this access. But at the same time, being instantly available to everyone and anything is simply not healthy.My current wellbeing is testament to that. I used to feel anxious and overwhelmed, and while this might not be the only change I made to lessen that, it’s certainly one of the biggest. It’s liberating. I’ve learnt that you don’t ever need to apologise for being unavailable. You don’t need to give anyone that instant access to you. You don’t need to be actively busy to not respond - you’re entitled to be actively not-busy and still unavailable. Those boundaries are healthy and should become society’s norm. And I truly believe,you challenge yourself to three weeks, this will become your norm too.

Searches have also been carried out at a property in Rutland Avenue that had been rented by Al Swealmeen since April, and that is the main focus of the police investigation. Earlier, Mr Jackson said: A complex picture is emerging over the purchases of the component parts of the device, we know that Al Swealmeen rented the property from April this year and we believe relevant purchases have been made at least since that time.  We have now traced a next of kin for Al Swealmeen who has informed us that he was born in Iraq. No evidence of terrorist ideology has yet been discovered, it is understood. Mr Jackson said the bomber had suffered from periods of mental illness that will form part of the investigation and will take some time to fully understand. Mr Jackson added: There is much comment in the media about Al Swealmeen and it is clear that he was known to many people. We continue to appeal for people who knew him, especially those who associated with him this year as we try and piece together the events leading up to this incident and the reasons for it. At this time we are not finding any link to others in the Merseyside area of concern but this remains a fast moving investigation and as more becomes known we cannot rule out action against others. Last night The Mirror reported the cabbie who survived the Liverpool bomb attack told rescuers: “Someone has blown me up.”Security guard Darren Knowles raced to help David Perry after terrorist Al Swealmeen set off his bomb. He said: “I just grabbed him and tried to get him to safety.” Brave security guard Darren desperately tried to find outthere was anyone  who could be saved as he helped David, the taxi driver whose cab exploded at a Liverpool hospital. Reliving the horror of the Remembrance Day bomb blast, Mr Knowles, , told how the driver stumbled from his taxi, blood pouring from his ear and neck, screaming, “I want my we”.

Graham Varley, from Leeds, had multiple strokes in  that severely affected his sight, and caused a rare condition called Charles Bonnet Syndrome. This means the -year-old will see things that aren’t there, as well as often not being able to recognise other people’s faces, LeedsLive reports. Graham said: What happened to me is so rare, and so strange and it really has been horrible to deal with. I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. But four years on – I feel like I’ve started to live again. He was a bakery manager at the time, and thought he was just having a normal headache in  as he worked. But he collapsed and was rushed to hospital where it had been revealed that the blood had been cut off from the main artery to his brain.  This left him with right-sided hemianopia, the loss of half your visual field. Graham said: “After my strokes I not only had to learn to do everything again like read and write, and even learn how to get dressed, but I also lost the majority of my vision – and on Christmas Day of all days. The only sight I have left is a bit in the top right of my eyes – I cannot focus and have no perception of D, so everything I can see looks like a cartoon. “One of the most disturbing things caused by my sight loss, is Charles Bonnet Syndrome, which causes me to see things that aren’t there. Sometimes it can be things looking a dferent colour than they are, such as grass being pink or a tree being purple, but other times it can cause me to have hallucinations that can be quite frightening – such as a car coming towards me, or quite often, huge spiderwebs.”  He also suffers from something called prosopagnosia, which is when he cannot recognise people’s faces. Because of this he still does not know what his two-year-old granddaughter looks like as his condition means she looks dferent to him each time. He added: “My doctor tells me I still have two blood clots on the brain that are dormant but they can move about and that causes my sight to change all the time, because signals aren’t going to the correct place. “So some days I look at Grfin, my guide dog, and with the partial vision I have, he looks like a cartoon dog.” After leaving hospital, Graham went a year waiting for support, relying on friends and carers. He was assigned to several specialists and in November last year partnered with a guide dog Grfin.  Funnily enough I wasn’t keen on a black Labrador, but then when Grfin came on to the scene, within  hours I was smitten! Graham said. “I have had dogs all my le, but I’ve never put my trust in one as I do now. We go out every day together – he’s opened up my le so much. The furthest I used to go was to the end of my driveway and back, but now we walk three or four miles a day.“With my Charles Bonnet Syndrome, Grfin helps me know what is real and what isn’t. If I see something ahead of me but Grfin keeps on walking, I know that it’s a hallucination. “Yesterday, with Grfin by my side, was the first time I’ve been in the supermarket by myself in four years. A few weeks ago, it was the first time since my stroke that I’ve been to the barbers. I feel like I’ve got my confidence back – I didn’t do any of the things that I do now, without Grfin. “I’ve even taken him to the pub and everyone’s got to know him - he goes to say hello to everyone and now he’s a local celebrity! I’ve never trusted anyone like I do Grfin - he is truly amazing and I’m so grateful to Guide Dogs and the team for their support.” Graham lives with we Mandy, and is also supported by a carer. He has four children and five grandchildren - he is teaching his -year-old granddaughter how to bake to follow in his footsteps.Comment MORE ON AnimalsGuide dogsStroke\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Duchess of Sussex was being interviewed by Ellen DeGeneres who joked that she should try “tequila” in the preview of their chat which will be aired in full on Thursday. It is the second major interview that Meghan has made since she and Harry moved to the US last year, with her being highly critical of the Royal Family during the chat with Oprah Winfrey. But in a brief clip of her interview with long-term friend Ellen the conversation centred around her new le and also how dficult it was for her starting out as an actress. She said she was looking for “anything to relieve” Lilibet’s teething pain and Ellen replied: “Tequila, anything.”  Meghan replied: “That’s Auntie Ellen for you” and the talk show host accepted: “That’s why I don’t have kids.” Talking about living at their Montecito mansion, Meghan admitted that the Sussexes were “just happy” with le. Since moving to the US, Harry and Meghan have taken aim at the Royal Family in several interviews for the le they lead and the way that Meghan was treated. In the Oprah interview, Meghan alleged racism against one of the royals who questioned what the colour would be of her first baby and that she had “suicidal thoughts” due to her unhappiness in England.  Harry also said that he realised he needed to break the cycle of le in the Royal Family and bring up his children in a dferent environment. But while Buckingham Palace may have been worried whether Meghan would make fresh allegations, instead the interview clip with Ellen centred on other topics. Meghan’s makeup artist Daniel Martin said the interview looked at her “funny side”. He said: We [he and hairstylist Jason Low] were backstage the entire time,apos he said. aposItaposs really fun and Ellen really pulled out Meghanaposs goofy, funny side, which everyone will be able to finally see. The clip that again hinted at Meghan’s alleged financial troubles when she started out her acting career, which may well be jumped on as she was still able to go through private school paid for by her dad Thomas Markle. Meghan has also posted on social media in the past about at dining regularly at expensive restaurants in Hollywood including Musso and Frank Grill. She told Ellen: “So I had this very old Ford Explore Sport and at a certain point the key stopped working on the driveraposs side, so you couldnapost get yourself in through the door so after auditions I would park at the back of the parking lot and I would open the trunk and climb in, pull the door shut behind me and crawl all over my seats to get out. Thataposs how I would come to and fro.” Meghan added: I would park on gate three and I would scoot on over and the security guards here would always say aposbreak a leg, I hope you get itapos. So driving today was very dferent.

The Prince, visiting the Al Alzar mosque in Cairo, told students the most important thing is to focus on the shared beliefs across faiths. We share so much, he said. The Prince and Duchess of Cornwall visited the Al Azhar Mosque shortly after landing in Cairo this morning, viewing the spectacular architecture and posing for a photograph in the central courtyard. They met the Grand Imam Sheikh Ahmed El-Tayeb, accompanied by the Archbishop of the Anglican Province of Alexandria, Dr Samy Fawzy.  After the Duchess departed to begin her own programme in Cairo, the Prince attended an interfaith reception in closed Abassa room of the mosque. There, he was said to be in “deep conversation” with the Grand Imam, surrounded by their entourages. The leaders were later joined by six Al-Azhar scholars, who told the Prince about their studies in English, religion and climate change.  The British Council has been running an Al-Azhar UK Academic Scholarship scheme since . It aims to promote mutual understanding among a new generation of Muslim and non-Muslim scholars, and allows students to study for degrees in Islamic studies at British universities before ing to Al-Azhar University to work as faculty members. As patron of the scheme, the Prince hosted six students from the programme at Clarence House in March , with two of them - Mariam Shehata and Muhammed Al-Marakby - joining him again today.  He asked them about their studies, and whether they had noticed a “growing awareness” from people about the importance of talking about climate change. The Prince went on to meet groups of students learning English at the mosque, with young men and women arranged in small groups to speak to him. The most important thing is to emphasise what we have in common not what ides us,” the Prince told one group of women. “Do remember that. We share so much.  He asked them of their studies: Have you managed through the worst of the pandemic  Did you do it all online  Stopping to talk to a second group, he wondered: “Are you actually able to sit down with representatives from other faiths for conversation  Learning a bit from each other  There must be a lot of people your age who want to do this sort of course with the British Council.  Of learning languages, he added: Its practising isnapost it  Thats whataposs so dficult. My Arabic needs practice. Founded in AD , the mosque is one of Cairo’s earliest and considered an architectural wonder. Its university is the second-oldest educational institution in the world, and is a centre of Islamic learning.  The royal couple last visited Al-Azhar in , when the Prince of Wales received an honorary doctorate from Al-Azhar University, which is considered the foremost Islamic institution in the Sunni Muslim world. Diana, Princess of Wales, made a visit to the mosque in  as part of a tour to Egypt.Comment MORE ON Princess DianaCamilla, Duchess of CornwallPrince Charles, Prince of WalesAl Azhar UniversityEducationRoyal FamilyClimate change\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

About  Christmas puddings paid for by The Queenare distributed to staff throughout the Palaces, staff in the Court Post Office and Palace police. Each pudding is accompanied by a greeting card. Historically, Palace staff have received a luxury pud from brands such as Harrods or royal grocer Fortnum  Mason.  But Hello magazine reports the Queen now opts for a £ Tesco version instead - which saves a lot of cash. Last year, the Queen was forced to axe her annual Christmas gt-giving ceremony for staff for the first time in her reign. The Monarch traditionally purchases a small gt for every member of the royal staff, which she personally presents alongside the Christmas pud, to thank the workers. In the past, employees have been treated to photo frames and champagne flutes. The Queen will be spending her first Christmas without her husband Prince Philipaposs following his death earlier this year in April this year, aged .She has faced a number of health concerns in recent weeks, after being hospitalised for a night in October and then having to cancel her appearance at the Remembrance Day service in Westminster after spraining her back.

A British pilot dramatically ejected from the F-B Lightning on a routine exercise that is believed to have smashed up on impact in the sea but pieces of the destroyed aircraft would still contain highly sensitive features. The pilot was part of the UK’s HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier strike force, which was practising for war. Technology on the aircraft includes top secret radar and sensors that allows the F-B to fly at supersonic speeds without being seen. It is unknown whether an F-B has crashed before in international waters but at the same time it is probable that China is aware of the secret technology through spying.  It is the RAFaposs most advanced plane capable of landing vertically and is the first that the UK has lost. British Armed Forces were last night scrambling to recover pieces of the destroyed warplane in case it falls into enemy hands, such as the Russian navy.The wreckage of the plane was found on Wednesday afternoon and is being protected by an Anglo-US e team until the aircraft is able to be removed by the Navy, reported the Daily Mail. It is believed the pilot is recovering and back on the ship following the crash which happened at am on Wednesday. He was rescued after an emergency operation was launched. An MoD spokesperson said: “A British F pilot from HMS Queen Elizabeth ejected during routine flying operations in the Mediterranean this morning.  “The pilot has been safely ed to the ship and an investigation has begun, so it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.” The Mirror understands no other vessels were involved in the incident and the MoD has ordered a probe into what went wrong. There are approximately  F-B jets on the Queen Elizabeth, a £. billion aircraft carrier which is the UK’s biggest-ever warship. The carrier’s F-Bs are equally ided on the ship between the UK’s Royal Air Force and the US Marine Corps. The Queen Elizabeth has a sister carrier called HMS Prince of Wales which is undergoing sea trials.  Sources told the Daily Mirror he was rescued by “assets launching from HMS Queen Elizabeth” which means he was likely plucked from the sea by a Merlin helicopter. It is believed he has had a medical checkup but is not in the ship’s hospital. The Mirror understands the plane was destroyed after it piled at speed into the water shortly after the flyer ejected. At the time of the crash HMS Queen Elizabeth was in the Eastern Mediterranean, on the way back to the UK from the China Sea. It is not known how far the plane was from its mother ship when it ran into trouble. This is the first major mission for the carrier, which is accompanied by a number of other Royal Navy warships. There were eight UK F-Bs on board HMS Elizabeth before the crash and ten US Marine Corps F-Bs. Sources said it was “early days” in the investigation and the devastating smash remains a mystery. One told the Mirror: “It could have been a seagull strike, at the moment we don’t know. “But the most important thing is that the pilot has survived. “It is not yet knownthere was a fault in the plane.” Another source told the Mirror other FB flights in the UK from RAF Marham are not being suspended.

A touching toy tribute  It can be dficult to find a fitting way to honour a lost pet - but one Calornian artist has been offering her painting skills to create beautul tributes to dogs that have crossed the rainbow bridge.The portrait artist, named Megan,creates touching tributes to lost petsby taking a deceased dog’s favourite toy and transforming it into a piece of artwork that their owner can keep forever. In a TikTok video, she explained how, even though she doesn’t have pets, she enjoys the rewarding job that pet owners have entrusted her with.The artist said: “It breaks my heart every time I sit down to do one of these just looking at all the bite marks and the teeth marks and how much love they put into this toy. “This is the most rewarding work that I do. Just to be a part of the grieving process is really special.” One viewer said they were ‘crying in under seven seconds’ after Megan showed a photo of a German shepherd holding the toy she’d just painted his portrait onto. ‘How do I use this ’  Susie had never lived in a house before she arrived at her foster home in Canada - and so everything was a completely new experience for her.While most dogs would jump at the opportunity to curl up on a cosy sofa pillow, a TikTok video saw a confusedSusie unable to work out how to use a cushion- as she’d never seen one before.In the clip, captioned: “Foster pups often don’t know how to ‘dog’ when they arrive. Simple tasks like stairs, or even getting comfortable can be firsts.” Susie sits on the grass next to the furnishing, and rests her little chin on top. The little crossbreed had only been in her foster home for just under a week, exploring a number of ‘firsts’, from cushions to walkies. The Tiktoker, from Canada, said it took the pup half an hour to walk  metres because she was so unsure of the world.

But it would make me very happy to know that some younger doggies would have fun with them. Love from Jarvis.” The sweet gesture was thought up by Jarvis the cocker spaniel’s owner, Lian Wymer.She said: “Jarvis is nearly  now and he’s got very severe arthritis, so he’s no longer fit for ball games. But he used to be a very active boy who liked carrying a ball in his mouth wherever we went.“My husband was cleaning out the back of the car where all the balls were kept, and he was just going to throw them away, but I said no. “It was such a big part of Jarvisapos daily le. He would always have his ball. I said Iaposd rather give them to somebody . So I put them in a box, wrote a little note on it and left it in the park.” Last ice cream for Marley Viewers were left sobbing after eight-year-old boxer cross Marley took hislast ever trip to the ice cream van.After discovering the dog had a fast-growing cancerous tumour in his mouth, his owner Katie Dixon wanted to hear him sing to the tune of his favourite ice cream van one last time.

In an emotional video, Marley hears the tune to the van and puts his paws on his garden gate to give out a melodic howl.

Applicants will need to explain their reasons for needing the loan - and wonapost get the payment automatically. They will also need to be able to prove that they can pay back the cash, and agree a rate at which the loan will be repaid.

But while this treat might feel like heaven, believe me, itaposs Hell working there. Whether it’s the medley of teenage lads shouting “Here comes Fatty” to me as they scoff a p cheeseburger, or the experience of witnessing a grown man rip off a Covid- protection window due to a lack of milkshakes, my six years at McDonalds have been nothing short of a flurry. After applying fresh out of high school , McDonald’s flexible hours and healthy rate of pay was extremely attractive to a skint first-year college student. And while most worry the lack of experience would be the issue with younger staff members, it’s the drama you’ve got to watch out for.  Once you’re past the three-month probation - during which most existing staff members refuse to acknowledge your existence - every fresh cohort brings a brand-new tier to Macciesapos ever growing political chain. However, the real initiation isn’t complete without the obligatory mid-sht breakdown. I can’t tell you how many people I’ve caught crying in the freezer, the stock room, even behind the bins. It’s a rite of passage for new staff members. Keeping a brave face is at least  percent of the job. From the Friday stampede of orders , to shovelling the remnants of half-chewed chicken nuggets from abandoned trays into the bin, and even having abuse hurledfor receiving cold food “after waiting for half an hour” always half an hour.It’s all just a part of the job.  That’s not to say every customer is rude, though. But there are the ones who test patience in a busy Drive-Thru. Firstly, nothing is LESS funny than when people try and order a Wicked Zinger Box Meal. Secondly, on behalf of every McDonald’s worker, we don’t serve mayonnaise. I don’t know why we don’t serve mayonnaise I don’t know IF we will ever serve mayonnaise and “speaking to the manager” about the lack of mayonnaise certainly isn’t going to solve anything. Thirdly, we can hear and see everything you do while you’re waiting to give your order by the Drive-Thru speakers. I can’t tell you how many solo renditions of cringe ‘s pop hits I’ve heard over the years. Alas, the serenade of freshly driving teens and those who queue for half an hour for the sake of a bottle of waterblocks out the eight hours of incessant beeping machines. *The writeraposs name has been changed.

Lisa confessed that despite being annoyed, she did laugh when she received the strange looking doll. She has since made contact with the seller to complain about the inaccuracy. Lisa said had already been issued a refund prior to baby Grinch arriving, because shipping had taken so long she believed it was lost in the post. I wish it had been lost in the post, she said.

Yvonne said the propertyaposs issue has been causing problems for her health, as she explained: The water is all coming in from the gutter, it’s never been cleared. There are big cracks right down the building.  The roof tile came off six years ago above the back bedroom. I was told I couldn’t get a replacement because the neighbours wouldn’t pay for it. The walls are wet and it’s not good for my health, my breathing is affected. The ceiling came right down and landed on my bed. Yvonne phoned Renfrewshire Council on October  when the ceiling caved in. She claimed she was told an inspector would visit the property on November .  The resident explained: They said that’s the first appointment they’ve got. If theyaposd replaced the missing tile six years ago this wouldn’t have happened. I’ve just had enough of this. They have to give me a new roof or a new house. A Renfrewshire Council spokesperson said: We have responded to all roof repairs reported by this tenant and completed works to repair them. We received a report of water ingress in  and emergency repairs were carried out at that time.There were no further reports of any issues until  when works to repair leaking gutters were carried out. In relation to the incident on  October , our housing repairs team responded immediately when the incident was reported to us and an emergency roof repair was carried out on  November.The tenant has been advised a repairs officer is attending on  November to inspect the ceiling damage and arrange for the internal repairs and can also consider the guttering issue raised by the tenant, who can contact our customer service centre for further advice and assistance.

The -year-old woman was reportedly inside her car when the truck failed to stop behind her yesterday. The truck slammed into the Nissan and pushed it into another truck, which caused it to fold in two and the -wheeler to crash over the top of it. Washington State Trooper Rocky Oliphant tweeted saying: “In my  year career, I have never seen anything like it. Thereaposs really not a word to describe this collision.” The horric pictures show the sheer extent of the damage to the vehicle that somehow the driver survived, mostly unscathed.  The huge truck sits squat on top of the red car which has been crushed in the crash in Washington, US. Such was the impact and size of the truck that they had to use a tow truck to lt its front end up and allow the woman could escape. Once it was lted up, she crawled out herself.When speaking to Fox  Oliphant described how the impact on the small car was so big that it ‘folded the back end of the car over onto the rear compartment.” He said: When troopers arrived, we could still hear a person inside the car. That person was able to get out of the car and walk out by themselves. It is beyond words to describe how somebody was able to walk away from that car. When they were trying to free the woman front he car, the traffic was causing the bridge to move, making the tow truck unstable. Both lanes had to be closed until the woman was freed.  Speaking to Seattle Times, he described the woman surviving the crash as a “perfect storm”.He described how because the back end of the woman’s car folded up and over, facing the front, it kept some of the truck’s weight off the passenger compartment and created a ramp for the truck to drive up and over. He said: “Lucky is not the right word because that was not a lucky collision. But she may be the luckiest unlucky person.” Comment MORE ON Mount VernonCar crashes\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

His landlord sued him, alleging he damaged the propertyThe flat in Hudson Street, New York City, was transformed into a night club, court papers sayByChiara Fiorillo:,  Nov A landlord is suing his former tenant for over £, after he allegedly turned his flat into a night club during the pandemic, hosting rowdy house parties. Kurt David, , lived in the two-storey property in Tribeca, New York City, but moved out in June, according to reports. His landlord, identied as Eisdorfer  LLC in a lawsuit, alleged the tenant held parties at the house, inviting hundreds of people who had to pay for entry. The property, which cost ,a month, was turned into a night club where party-goers drank alcohol and smoke marijuana, court papers say. The parties, held during the coronavirus pandemic, were in breach of restrictions and the host was arrested twice for them, according to US media. On March , officers broke up a party with more than  people who were not wearing face masks, Gothamist reports.A -year-old, who was apparently drunk, had to be taken to a local hospital after falling from the stairs, Sherf Joseph Fucito said. The teenager later told investigators he had bought alcohol at the party. David was arrested and charged with selling alcohol to minors, unlawfully dealing with children, and violating emergency orders. He was fined ,for failure to protect health and safety, according to reports.  The previous month, the tenant had been charged with misdemeanours after officers broke up another party. Court documents say: The scene Defendants have created appears to be that of a nightclub, causing the severe disturbance to last into the early hours of the morning. These parties attract such a high-volume crowd that the Defendants have hired security guards bouncers to operate the door when letting guests into the Premises. Now, the landlord is suing David and his mother Jean Elbaum-David, who also signed the lease, for four months of unpaid rent, late fees, violations charges from the Department of Buildings and Sanitation, legal fees and for the cost of fixing the house.  The lawsuit alleges the company had to pay ,to fix the property, including replacing broken appliances, window shades, balcony and roof pavers, faucets, the sound system, the security and camera system, the intercom, window panes, drywall, hardwood floors and a bathroom vanity unit, the New York Post reports.The company also said they had to paint the property, fix the electrical system and employ heavy-duty cleaners to make the flat livable again. David told the New York Post he was a legal resident of the building and that he had paid rent. He said: Rent has been paid on time over the duration of the full-year lease and due to Covid-, I filed the Covid- hardship declaration and the landlord holds ,for two months security and one-week free rent.

She shared a screenshot of the original post captioned: Absolutely disgusting behaviour from a so-called business. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Asyoung mothers donapost have it hard enough without your sad attempt to publicly shame them not only online but in your tearoom. Didnapost seem to have a problem until after they had paid and tipped you. Personally, I think by the fact you deleted your post you are admitting perhaps getting a dustpan and brush isnapost such a hard task. But donapost worry, even though you told my sister and her -month-old baby they were never allowed in your tearoom again, I doubt theyaposd want to after such a disgusting display of unprofessional behaviour. Her rant has since sparked a debate, with commenters weighing in on both sides. One person said: Would have taken  seconds for the mum to pick that up. Hardly rude of the staff is it. Another pointed out: That is a mess. Would you leave a friendaposs place like that  Highly doubt it. Others came to the motheraposs defence saying: That mess genuinely isnapost bad for a young child eating  Iaposm astounded theyaposd publicly shame like this. It must be annoying but itaposs part of catering for young children. Donapost get me wrong, some people take the **** and absolutely trash the place. But do they expect every single person without a child to fully clean their area before leaving too  If so, maybe the post should say all people need to clean up before they leave. But the idea that messy customers would have to clean up after themselves was not welcomed by all. One person said: I worked in a cafe years ago. Always had mess like this but what  do they expect  Next they will be moaning people didnapost wash up their plate. Seriously, what a joke. Paul Crush, the owner of Corbyaposs Tea Room in Ramsgate, has since apologised for offending people and particularly young parents. But, he defended himself, saying the post had twisted what had happened, accusing them of posting outlandish comments and untruths. Mr Crush said: The ladies – and let’s be clear, I would have posted a similar message regardless of who left such a mess and contrary to what is being said, this was not aimed at just young mums – did not even attempt a simple, ‘sorry for the mess’. Nor did they, as they claim, tip but were happy to just walk out and leave it. We firmly believe hospitality is there to serve all customers and yes, we understand we have to clean up after them, but a simple recognition would be nice. Also, for the record, I did not name or shame anyone specically ­– my photos did not identy anyone, but were there to demonstrate the mess left by two adults. He decided to delete the post after people with opposing views started name-calling and refused to stop. Mr Crush said: We are an old-fashioned, friendly tearoom – check out all the real reviews on ious s – and we welcome everyone.I would like to emphasise that since taking over Corby’s three years ago we have actively introduced more child-friendly menus and facilities, including a baby-changing station. “In what continues to be a very challenging time to own and run a small independent business, this unnecessary and unfair distraction doesnapost help. The screenshot remains on the site however, which Mr Crush says violates the Facebook pageaposs rules as businesses should no be named. He has since informed the pageaposs admin. Mr Crush said: We are sorrythis has offended or alienated some groups, young parents in particular, but come and visit for yourselves and you will see just how welcoming we are.

We put up with it pretty well. In hindsight we probably wouldnapost have held him the first four months of his le.Ken always wanted a bigger dog, so we bought Larry as a puppy and we thought we needed to hold him all the time because he was going to get so big that we wouldnapost be able to. That kind of blew up in our faces because now he needs to be held all of the time. He got used to the affection when he was younger. It was a mistake - now heaposs st.This recliner is our fourth in three years. Weaposve had recliners pretty much fall apart because of Larry adding his body weight on top of whoeveraposs sitting there. The chairs just canapost hold that.On one, the back broke so it wouldnapost sit up straight anymore, the foot stool on one got all mangled so it couldnapost go up and down, and the first one we had a long time before Larry but he buckled the arm out.We spent £, on the last one because they said it would last, but weaposll see. We told them we needed something with a good warranty and they laughed at us.It annoyed us at the time, but we blame ourselves.

Once inside, the cow was said to have climbed the stairs of a waterslide and slowly slid down into the pool. While it had originally managed to evade death by getting off the ranch, the animal risked collapsing the structure supporting the slide as it awkwardly trotted down on its knees.The slide, designed to hold just  pounds, held firm under the cow’s roughly  pound weight, according to the . The animal appears to be soaking up the sun after its bizarre escape, and at one point takes a moment to stare at the cameraman in the empty water park. The animal’s attempted escape had a happy ending, some  miles west of Rio de Jainero, where the ranch owner adopted it. The cow’s new owner named it Tobogã - which stands for slide, in Portuguese. According toIHeartRadio reports , the cow was now to become a family pet.Brazil is the largest exporter of beef in the world, which dramatically increases its emission levels and deforestation.  It’s not the first time cows have made a dash in an attempt to avoid a slaughterhouse. In June of this year, at least four people were injured in Bolivia when the animals ran wild following an escape from a crashed van bound for an abattoir.

Anna McCarthy, , and her siblings Thomas, , and Rachel, , bought the bus for €,in September  and renovated it, spending just €,on the project. The trio, who are all farmers from Cork, Ireland, said they were inspired by a friend who completed a similar project with a single-storey bus. Thomas said the three siblings left the bus untouched for a couple of months and by December last year, they began the renovation. He explained: We gutted the whole bus as a start and planned out our site. We started with insulating and putting down new floorings and planning what rooms go where.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Stud walls went up and we wanted to keep all windows so we had a lot of sealing to do on the exterior windows. Plumbing and electrical soon came into it and then before we knew it we were planning our kitchen units and picking out tiles and wooden floorings. We kept the interior very colourful and playful throughout and we got the outside graffitied and choose a farm theme. For the outside area, Annaaposs partner Aiden created a tiled patio and installed a bar made of pallets. He also installed a hot tub and covered the area using sails from a boat. Thomas said: We love improvising and trying to use second-hand materials as much as possible and come up with quirky ideas. While the team was renovating the bus, they also had another project on their hands – a renovation of their fatheraposs -year-old farmhouse after he passed away. Thomas said: You can imagine, we had productive days and days where we wanted to kill each other but we wouldnapost have changed a thing. Originally, they planned to spend €,but went over budget and had to dip into their savings. In the end, the renovation took six months and cost around €, for the bus, site preparation, electrics and work inside. Thomas said: We got a lot of sponsorship from companies infor exposure on our social media so that helped reduce cost! Upstairs probably costs us about €, . The biggest cost was the kitchen the outside area and electricity.  Plumbing was about €, . It’s a big investment but it will pay off so we’re delighted! We also had loads of help from family and friends and did a lot of the work ourselves which helped massively to reduce cost. The bus has a spacious master bedroom complete with a double bed on the top deck and a room with four single beds, two of which can be pulled out.The room also has a full panoramic view of the farm and courtyard.  On the first deck are a living room with a U-shaped seating area for socialising, a kitchen and a toilet. The bus has been completed with a state-of-the-art ventilation system that circulates fresh air around the entire bus. Thomas said: I think we were in a state of shock that it was finished, we couldnapost believe how amazing it turned out. It was better than we ever expected. At the end of June , they set their listing on Airbnb live, costing €per couple, with the bus holding six guests at any one time. Thomas said that the bus had been completely booked up since.When it comes to advice for hesitant renovators, Thomas added: Just do it, be patient and definitely look into inspirational pages on Instagram or Pinterest.There are fantastic informative pages out there now that will show you step by step what you can do.

The BBC \"national news\" is dominated by domestic reports on health, education and transport which only apply south of the Border. These bulletins are followed by the \"UK Weather\" which iniably concentrates on the populous south and generally refers to Scotland en passant as ldquothe far north or, where I live, ldquothe extreme north. No wonder all fair-minded Scots are exasperated.The BBC Scotland channel has been a small but welcome development, but it is run on a shoestring and ultimate editorial control still resides where. Scotland is poorly served by the BBC and ITV, who understandably will always look to serve their majority English audience.There is an obvious need to wrest control of broadcasting to Scotland, but I suspect that will not happen until Scotland decides to take full responsibility for its governance in a second referendum.Until then, ing to Ms Laxrsquos theme, we could be getting agitated about topics such as Tory sleaze, Westminster corruption and the failure of our MPto remember his two other jobs and timeously declare his earnings.Iain Gunn, Elgin.UNREST IN THE BORDERSA HEALTHY ing democracy depends on voters having access to information and news from more than one source. Television is one,not the major, provider of such information and especially of news.Sadly, those of us who live in the south of Scotland are very limited in the TV news we can access about our own country, having only a choice between Border TVand BBC Scotland .I have little interest in news from Carlisle or Cumbria in general, yet my so-called ldquolocal news is dominated by items from these areas. I am much more interested in what happens in the rest of Scotland ndash where I was born, where I live and where most of my family and friends reside.I know some lucky people can view STVvia the internet or satellite, but surely it is time this channel ndash again, Scottish TV ndash was available on terrestrial signals for the whole of Scotland.Fiona Lessels, Beattock.PARLIAMENT IS A FULL-TIME JOBADAM Tomkins speaks for himself when he states in his column that being an MP or MSP is a part-time job . Having been elected to serve in the Scottish Parliament for one term, courtesy of the Tory Party list, Professor Tomkins managed to find the time to do another job and collect another salary in academia. He obviously did not consider himself to be first and foremost a representative of the people and I wonder how he would have faredhe had stood for election in a constituency instead of depending on a party ticket.I think I can speak with more parliamentary experience than Prof Tomkins. When I announced my retirement in , I was the longest-serving parliamentarian in the Scottish Parliament, having served at Westminster for more than a quarter of a century, followed by eight years at Holyrood. At the first election to the Scottish Parliament, I was the only Independent member to be elected. I had the biggest majority of any constituency in Scotland on both occasions when I stood for the Scottish Parliament.I do not think that my constituents would have ed me time after timeI had been a part-timer. It is a great privilege to serve as a parliamentarian and the fact that some MPs and MSPs, mainly from Prof Tomkins party, have abused their position should not detract from the fact that the majority of MPS and MSPs are full-time public servants who work hard for the people they represent.Dennis Canavan, Bannockburn.SHAME ON SCOTS TORY MPsIT came as no surprise when I learned that five of the six Scottish Conservative MPs voted in the House of Commons on Monday night to break their manesto commitment to retain the triple lock on state pensions [David Mundell did not vote]. This action will deny pensioners around pound per annum, an amount that could pay idends to their wellbeing during winter by allowing the heating to be switched on, by eating the right kind of nourishing food in cold winter days. Yet those MPs here in Scotland prioritised following the party line over pensioners in their constituencies.Catriona C Clark, Falkirk.ENERGY PLANS WILL MAKE US POORERNICOLA Sturgeon has carried out the first part of her energy strategy by declaring her opposition to the Cambo oil field . However, what the First Minister has still to outline is her future strategy on obtaining the fossil fuel needed to power the gas turbine plant at Peterhead which will replace Hunterston B or to supply the gas gridthe policy issued by Patrick Harvie to rip out every boiler has not been dropped into the bin, as neither the public purse nor the taxpayer can afford the pound billion debt .The plan now being adopted by the First Minister involves a % hydrogen mix into the grid, meaning a requirement for % of domestic gas still remains ndash hence the need for the Cambo output to keep the lights on in Scotland when the wind does not blow and to keep central heating systems operational over the winter.The problem for Alasdair Galloway in his claim that \"fighting climate change does not have to make us poorer\"is that it is incorrect. It is an expensive technology that is required to split hydrogen from water and then transport the gas to the point of use or provide stand-by plant when wind turbines sit idle in rural Scotland. All those costs have to be met by the energy consumer, thus escalating bills to more than pound, a year. Going green means a poorer standard of living for the majority of Scots.Ian Moir, Castle Douglas.* REGARDING the cost of greener heating:a scheme were introduced whereby the cost of carbon-neutralising onersquos home would be recovered with an inheritance tax credit, those who could afford it could be incentivised to spend the money at no immediate cost to the Government.Alexander Caldwell, East Kilbride.* AN increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide has an important effect on the Earths climate but it is a wilful abuse of the language to describe it as pollution. The main constituents of the atmosphere are nitrogen, oxygen, argon, water vapour and carbon dioxide and the increase of any of them would not be pollution, regardless of any possible consequences.PM Dryburgh, Edinburgh.DO HOUSEHOLDS NEED TWO CARS I AM recovering from the \"shock and horror\" forecast by Willie Macleanin his defence of a Tory government. However, at the risk of causing yet more shock and horror, I must express my gratitude to Westminster governments for building miles of motorways all across England while doing Scotland the favour of keeping us virtually motorway-free for years we now know that was all for the best, as motorways only encouraged people to drive on them.My bus pass gets me around Scotland, and I am pleased that from the end of January the Scottish Government is introducing free bus travel for residents in Scotland aged under . We need to wean people from cars back on to buses and trains.One Sunday afternoon recently I visited a huge new housing estate a few miles from Edinburgh which has a regular bus service to the city, and was struck by the fact that almost every driveway held at least two cars they cant all have belonged to visitors. I suspect that housing estate is not unique, but even halving the number of cars in their driveways would help make a signicant contribution to the environment.Ruth Marr, Stirling.Read more: There are more important things to get agitated about than not being able to see Scotland games"},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh-named-climate-change-leader-international-list-following-cop26","story":"Edinburgh is the only city in Scotland to be named on CDPrsquos  Cities A List.CDP ndash an international charity which runs the worldrsquos largest environmental disclosure system for companies and cities - has recognised that Edinburgh has publicly disclosed a city-wide emissions inventory, set an emissions reduction target of net zero emissions by , published a climate action plan, completed, and is in the process of updating a climate risk and vulnerability assessment and has shown how it plans to tackle the unavoidable impacts of climate change following the important climate conference.Edinburgh City Council leader Adam McVey said: ldquoThis international recognition is a fantastic accomplishment for Edinburgh.

Unfortunately, despite these measures Test and Protect contact tracers identied a number of close contacts and this posed a considerable and unprecedented strain on the system  As soon as staff were contacted they sought PCR tests # but had to self-isolate at home whilst they awaited the results.#At present the team are unable to operate outside of the office. Efforts have been ongoing over a number of months now to update IT systems within Orkney Ferries, to allow for more dynamic and flexible working practices in the future # including an online booking system # but this has been hampered by global IT shortages and supplier issues beyond the ability of the team to control or influence.#A service was restored at the first opportunity, albeit on a limited scale # and we are back to normal from today .#Whilst we appreciate the situation is far from ideal, we would ask for recognition that for the duration of this pandemic, our staff and crews have put considerable time and effort into supporting all our island communities # reacting at often short notice to regulatory changes to ensure the continuation of this important service.  We appreciate the frustration felt by our customers over the weekend but the abuse that has been received across social media and on the telephone is unacceptable and unfair.##That cannot continue. If the current contractors are unable to deliver what is needed, Orkney Ferries needs to replace them with someone who can. Given the leline nature of these services, the public and staff deserve a booking system fit for the job.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This means  pupils remain at home for ious reasons – some COVID-related, others sickness, and  families have opted to keep their children off school due to concerns over the virus.Staffing plans are in place with the aim of a full reopening of Papdale Nursery from and including Wednesday, November  from .am-pm. For the remainder of this week, the nursery will open from .am-pm.Nursery manager, Caroline Easton, explained: “We are delighted to be in a position staffing wise at the moment to reopen in full from Wednesday onwards. However, we must be mindful that this is a very fluid situation and changes can occur very quickly. We are aware of this and in a bid to protect the core hours at the nursery given our reduced staffing element, we will be opening from .am-pm for the remainder of this week. We apologise to parents this will affect, but the aim is to ensure we have enough staff in place to provide those core hours at this time.“I am communicating with all parents as soon as any changes occur and I remain so grateful for the support that we at the nursery have received in these dficult circumstances.

More than  people and organisations contributed to the Toolkit, whose development was supported by the Scottish Government.And Stromness will be among the communities highlighted as a prime example of success as the toolkit is discussed at the Scotland’s Towns Conference on Friday, November .The toolkit highlights how more than a decade of investment has helped revitalise the area, including the new £m Copland’s dock, the Orkney Research and Innovation Campus, and the creation of a new arts centre.Explaining the reasons for the community’s success, town planner Nick Wright, who developed the toolkit for STP and will highlight Stromness at the conference, said: “Everyone pulls together, making the most of every opportunity.“This is an ambitious community where people aren’t afraid to muck in and make things happen — with strong political will and a clear plan of modernising Stromness while maintaining its historical elegance.”That work includes the  year multi-million pound investments secured from the Lottery and Historic Environment Scotland to restore and modernise the town centre. Working with local landowners and organisations, these schemes restored  vacant or dilapidated historic buildings, improved shops, created new business spaces, and revitalised the town’s streets and spaces.Nick Wright added: “This toolkit is about sharing that wealth of experience from across the country — showing that you can do it because it’s been done before. It’s about how to make things happen — a one-stop-shop on how to make towns the best they can be.”While inspiring communities and groups, it is also hoped that the toolkit will prove useful for local authority officials working in planning, community development, leisure, transport and the economy when considering developments in their region, as well as for politicians at every level.For more information, go to www.towntoolkit.scot.

It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4193378.jpg--.jpg?1635492771000\n","title":"frightful fun for all at hallowena 2021","story":"THE People’s Park, Ballymena will host one of the scariest nights of the year on Friday, October , from pm to .pm.The free event, organised by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, will thrill and chill with a packed programme of spooktacular activities for your little monsters to enjoy, with a huge walking dragon, fire juggling display, a fancy dress competition, a kiddies funfair, live music from The VIPs and a spooky illumination trail.You can sink your fangs into some sweet treats or tasty hot food to beat those Halloween hunger pangs, while the fun and festivities will finish with a fangtastic fireworks finale at .pm.Why not have your own #MEAdventure in the park  Outdoor areas including the brand new play equipment will be accessible during the event and there will be a free kiddies fun fair to entertain your little terrors.Wandering ghouls and spine tingling figures will be ready to spook you at every turn with a few hair-raising special additions.Follow the extended spooky illumination trail throughout the park and bump into some familiar characters along the way!Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, encouraged everyone to join in the Hallowena fun: “It is a great delight for us to be able to safely welcome our community to events this year and the Hallowena celebrations are always among the most popular on Council’s entertainment programme.“There is literally something for ghosts and goblins of all ages to enjoy on Friday  October in the stunning People’s Park in Ballymena, and I am really excited about the evening.“I am privileged to welcome everyone in our community to the park for some spooktacular fun, and I encourage those attending to observe the necessary public health guidelines so that we can protect ourselves and those around us.”There are over  off-street car park spaces within a -minute walk of People’s Park so make an evening of it with a visit to any of the fantastic shops or restaurants in the town.Parking for blue badge holders is available from pm at the People’s Park council car park off the Ballymoney Road.To help with a safe set-up of the site People’s Park will be closed to all members of the public on Friday  October until the event starts at pm.For everyone’s safety dogs, alcohol or fireworks are not permitted in the park and under s must have a responsible adult with them.Admission is free and no tickets are required.Visitors to the Hallowena event are asked to use the hand sanitisers provided and observe social distancing.

The Executive today backed proposals to introduce vaccine passports. Its believed they will be needed to enter nightclubs, hospitality venues which serve food and drink cinemas, theatres, concert halls and conference centres indoor events with  or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated outdoor events with , or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated and events where more than , people will be present regardless of whether they are seated. All of the Executive parties, with the exception of the DUP, backed the proposals. Welcoming the Executive’s decision to introduce Covid certication for hospitality settings, the Minister said: “Certication must be seen as one piece in a jigsaw of required measures. Other measures include signicantly increased use of face coverings, more people working from home and more social distancing. We need to limit our contacts and always be mindful of the importance of fresh air and good ventilation in dispersing Covid- particles. “We also need to continue the acceleration of our vaccine booster roll-out, and keep encouraging more people to come forward for their first and second doses. “The case for Covid certication in hospitality is not complicated. It can reduce the number of infected people in high risk settings. Vaccinated people are less likely to become infected and ill than unvaccinated people. And the virus is only transmitted by infected people. “Our Covid numbers are too high and we need to forcibly push them down. Our health and social care system is under severe stress. We have to act. “Let me also emphasise that I do not want to see further Covid restrictions on our economy or our daily lives. Such a decision is far from inevitable. “We can all play our part in altering the direction of this pandemic. It is in all our hands. “By following public health advice we can help keep each other safe and support our health workers. “We all want this pandemic to be over, but simply wishing it away is never going to be enough. A united effort across society is what is needed to get us through this winter.” Covid certication requires proof of full vaccination status, or a negative Lateral Flow Test in the previous  hours, or proof of recovery from a positive PCR test in the previous  –  days."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1637251036284.jpg--covid_19___thu_18th_november_figures.jpg?1637251037000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211118newscovid 19 thu 18th november figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows six further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

Such a decision is far from inevitable.“We can all play our part in altering the direction of this pandemic. It is in all our hands.”What has been the reaction to the Executive’s decision The response from the hospitality sector has been mixed, however, Colin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, has expressed disappointment at the vaccine passport decision.The decision to impose mandatory Covid passports on the entire hospitality industry, without any mention of support, sends a clear signal that we are of no value or concern, he said. Today is another day we have been singled out. The majority of our sector have voiced opposition.There is real concern from our industry that businesses owners, who are already struggling to recover and now facing the most critical period of the year, will be the ones who must be the enforcers of the scheme, and it is our staff that will face the abuse.Evidence shows that this will negatively impact footfall and increase costs in the most important part of the year.As the worst-impacted industry, and the one singled out repeatedly for restrictions, we are facing an unknown future. Our industry will have to fight to retain staff and save businesses.Politically, the DUP is the only party which has opposed the move while others including Alliance and the SDLP have been vocal in supporting the policy.Its Stormont First Minister, Paul Givan described the introduction of Covid certication, as “isive”, saying: “We should be using every tool in our box to try and address the transmission rates and the pressures on our hospitals, it is vital that this executive does the right things.Whenever we asked the questions around how effective would this policy be it was marginal. There has been no assessment on the effectiveness, we look at the Republic of Ireland that has had this scheme in, their rates of transmission has been much higher than NI, their hospital pressures are higher than NI.”He claimed that no economic impact assessment, equality impact assessment or assessment in terms of human rights legislation has been carried out.“Other executive ministers felt that they could support a policy that had flaws within that paper even on the scientic evidence,” he said.“They used the Alpha iant to say that this scheme could help in terms of reducing transmission based upon a iant which no longer exists in Northern Ireland because it’s the Delta iant.“So the scientic basis for it was flawed and yet other ministers they have voted this through and now as a result businesses could be facing fines on their first offence.”Read MoreCovid passports will lead to job losses Hospitality Ulster chief warns, as Executive considers December  introductionRelated topicsDepartment of HealthRobin SwannNorthern Ireland AssemblyMore On Department of HealthCovid booster jabs: Health Minister Robin Swann unveils plan to increase uptakeNI Covid certicate: What do businesses have to do, how will it be enforced and can it be forged Nearly , children on waiting list seeking mental health help PremiumNI hospitality trade split over Covid vaccine passport decision PremiumTaxpayer billed £k for every Covid case in Northern Ireland’s quarantine hotelMost ReadDonna Traynor taking ‘age bias case’ against BBC, corporation insider claimsDonna Traynor BBC departure: The contenders to replace Newsline anchorFormer SF mayor behind offensive email resigningCovid passport certication NI: all you need to know about contentious policyPictured: Inside south Armagh underground drugs factory raided by policeTop VideosPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolatePlayWatch: Derry Girls stars spotted filming latest series at Barry’s PlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenLatest CoronavirusCoronavirus NI: Six deaths and , new cases reportedMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageNI Covid certicate: What do businesses have to do, how will it be enforced and can it be forged Stormont’s Health Minister targeted in sinister graffitiLisa SmythOpinionOur health service was crumbling long before it was struck by CovidLatestOklahoma governor commutes death sentenceTowie star Lauren Goodger splits from boyfriend Charles DruryViolence against women at epidemic levels, Stormont committee hearsGraham Potter spends night sleeping rough to highlight plight of homelessDeclarations show another £, for Sir Geoffrey Cox and Heathrow suite for PM,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Currently, people here are not required to prove their vaccination status to enter indoor hospitality or entertainment venues.Stormont recently published a contingency plan which referred to the “potential” deployment of Covid- status certication in “higher risk settings”.Vaccine passports are in force for designated hospitality venues in Scotland and Wales, but England scrapped similar plans.Support here is particularly strong amongst the older age group, with % of over- respondents saying they believe passports should be mandatory. That falls to just over halffor those aged -.The hospitality industry is largely against any such scheme, believing the sector should not be singled out for special treatment, having already been hit hardest by Covid restrictions.Femalesare more in favour of passports than males , according to the survey.There’s a dramatic split in support for Covid passports based on political voting preferences, with only % of the DUP voters questioned believing passports should be brought in as a mandatory requirement.Over half of the DUP voters polled were opposed to any passport scheme , but support was strong from Alliance Partyand Sinn Fein supporters .The polling also suggested strong support for compulsory Covid vaccinations for healthcare workers.Over two thirdsagreed health staff vaccination should be compulsory, with only a quarteragainst. An overwhelming majority of over ssaid the vaccinations should be compulsory, though that figure drops to % of those aged -.DUP voters were split on the issue with % in favour of making vaccinations compulsory and % against, but Allianceand Sinn Fein voterswere strongly in favour.A public consultation on compulsory Covid- and flu vaccination for new healthcare workers was announced last week. But Health Minister Robin Swann said any requirement for existing staff could be “counterproductive” and could further destabilise a workforce that is already severely depleted.Related topicsDepartment of HealthAlliance PartySinn FéinRobin SwannMore On Department of HealthCovid booster jabs: Health Minister Robin Swann unveils plan to increase uptakeNI Covid certicate: What do businesses have to do, how will it be enforced and can it be forged Nearly , children on waiting list seeking mental health helpCovid passport certication NI: all you need to know about contentious policy PremiumNI hospitality trade split over Covid vaccine passport decisionMost ReadDonna Traynor taking ‘age bias case’ against BBC, corporation insider claimsDonna Traynor BBC departure: The contenders to replace Newsline anchorFormer SF mayor behind offensive email resigningCovid passport certication NI: all you need to know about contentious policyPictured: Inside south Armagh underground drugs factory raided by policeTop VideosPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolatePlayWatch: Derry Girls stars spotted filming latest series at Barry’s PlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenLatest CoronavirusCoronavirus NI: Six deaths and , new cases reportedMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageNI Covid certicate: What do businesses have to do, how will it be enforced and can it be forged Stormont’s Health Minister targeted in sinister graffitiLisa SmythOpinionOur health service was crumbling long before it was struck by CovidLatestTowie star Lauren Goodger splits from boyfriend Charles DruryViolence against women at epidemic levels, Stormont committee hearsGraham Potter spends night sleeping rough to highlight plight of homelessDeclarations show another £, for Sir Geoffrey Cox and Heathrow suite for PMAzeem Rafiq sorry for anti-Semitic messages – timeline of cricket racism crisis,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He branded the exercise a “waste of money, time and effort from council officers”.“I want to highlight again the fact another street survey has come back with no responses,” Mr Cuthbertson said. “This is another waste of money, time and effort from council officers.

Somebody has scraped, peeled or otherwise removed the English name, leaving only the Irish.”The councillor said he “purposely let this sit to see how long it would remain”, and that there had not been “a single objection from one other elected representative”.“Had this been the Irish removed, we could have been ensured a chorus of objections from a selection of Sinn Fein MLAs and councillors,” he added.“The fact is that the sign has been damaged in the reverse [and] nobody seems to care.“The Dolly’s Brae site is signicant to the Orange Order because it was the spot of a major confrontation between the Ribbonmen and ing lodges who had been in Tollymore for their annual celebrations and religious service on July , .“I suspect those damaging this sign recognised the historic signicance of their actions.“It again demonstrates how isive these signs are. They can be used by either side of the community to make a political statement, focus anger or ide communities.“Although not a supporter of the bilingual signs, I have asked that this one be repaired and due consideration be given to erecting a historic plaque to commemorate the battle that took place at this location.”Most ReadDonna Traynor taking ‘age bias case’ against BBC, corporation insider claimsDonna Traynor BBC departure: The contenders to replace Newsline anchorFormer SF mayor behind offensive email resigningCovid passport certication NI: all you need to know about contentious policyPictured: Inside south Armagh underground drugs factory raided by policeTop VideosPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolatePlayWatch: Derry Girls stars spotted filming latest series at Barry’s PlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenLatest Northern IrelandViolence against women at epidemic levels, Stormont committee hearsPlans to accelerate vaccine booster rates in NI unveiledLoyalists haven’t got a clue about the Protocol, Bertie Ahern saysAllison MorrisOpinionLatest online abuse directed at Naomi Long driven by misogynyQueries over using a lidar plane to find Disappeared victimsLatestTowie star Lauren Goodger splits from boyfriend Charles DruryViolence against women at epidemic levels, Stormont committee hearsGraham Potter spends night sleeping rough to highlight plight of homelessDeclarations show another £, for Sir Geoffrey Cox and Heathrow suite for PMAzeem Rafiq sorry for anti-Semitic messages – timeline of cricket racism crisis,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Peter ByrneNovember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailEven prior to the pandemic, it wasn’t unusual for trusts to struggle to find space for patients in their hospitals.As far back as , the Royal College of Nursingwas warning about the dangers of squeezing hospital beds into areas without oxygen points and call bells, while overstretched staff complained they didn’t have enough time to take toilet breaks or administer medication to their patients.The situation deteriorated to the point where thousands of healthcare staff took industrial action at the end of , but there was barely any time between the end of the strike and the arrival of Covid- for NHS workers to catch their breath.So, it’s little wonder that almost two years of a global pandemic have had such a profound effect on the health service.As of Wednesday, there were  Covid occupied beds across the hospital system here, which is  beds not available for the patients who need treatment for non-Covid conditions, some of whom are acute medical emergencies, while others have been suffering without treatment for years.And while they languish on ever-stretching hospital waiting lists, their conditions worsen and they turn more frequently to their GP to manage their symptoms.However, there aren’t enough family doctors in Northern Ireland to cope with demand, resulting in more people going to AE for help.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up At the same time, an increasing number of people waiting for a hospital appointment are becoming emergency cases, requiring admission to hospital.Meanwhile, staff are exhausted, an unknown number are living with the effects of long Covid, others are trying to process the trauma of working through the pandemic, while the workforce is depleted further due to the requirements of isolation.Add to that the shortage of resources in the community, which makes it so dficult to discharge patients from hospital, and it has created the perfect storm in which we now find ourselves.It is true that the vaccines have put us in a better position than this time last year — but only to a certain degree.Despite the rush when they first became available, health officials have struggled to reach their target uptake.Public confidence in the vaccinations has been damaged by the messages coming from some politicians, as well as the disappointment that they aren’t the silver bullet many people mistakenly believed they would be.The fact that they reduce the likelihood of catching the virus, experiencing serious illness and even decrease the chance of dying from Covid- doesn’t seem enough to convince the sceptics that they are an efficient tool in getting us through the pandemic.Sadly, some have taken an all or nothing approach — either the vaccine works % of the time or it isn’t worth getting, even more so now they have realised the vaccines don’t protect for le.Then there are others who can’t see the bigger picture and the reality that by being vaccinated, they are reducing the risk to those most vulnerable from the virus.Waning immunity is also likely to be a factor in Northern Ireland’s depressing case rate. That’s why the booster programme is so important — but even that doesn’t appear to be rolling out as quickly as hoped. All of this is set against a backdrop of an Executive that has pressed ahead with lting restrictions despite the most ardent warnings from health professionals over the state of the health service.Over the summer, officials were once again caught off guard by the might of Covid-, as case numbers spiked a number of weeks sooner than expected.At the time, they blamed the less than impressive vaccine uptake for the surge in positive cases.As a result of the premature peak, operations were cancelled as staff were erted from their normal roles to help care for the influx of seriously ill patients.Even as the health service faltered and pupils ed to class, the Executive approved further relaxations — at the same time there was a contact tracing disaster in our schools.By the time politicians gave the green light to the reopening of nightclubs, health workers were well and truly exasperated by the path we were on.It was abundantly clear that it wasn’t the best move to allow hundreds of people, many unvaccinated, to cram together in loud and unventilated venues, without social distancing or face coverings, while also adding alcohol into the mix.Even more incredibly, the relaxation was timed to coincide with the Hallowe’en holiday. The warnings from staff on the frontline became more frantic. Unusually senior officials even joined the chorus, with Seamus O’Reilly from the Northern Trust explaining that emergency departments may have to shut in response to the mounting pressure.Then as last weekend approached, rumours began to swirl that the AEs at Antrim and Craigavon were close to collapse, emergency plans were put into place to bolster staff numbers and free up beds. Antrim Area Hospital struggled through, but the measures weren’t enough to stabilise the situation at Craigavon.An ambulance ert was implemented twice in the space of -hours, putting further pressure on the hospitals that stepped in to assist.Dr Tom Black from the British Medical Association gave an ominous warning.“This is only the start of it,” he said, as the crisis appeared to finally shake the Executive into action. Eventhere was an acceptable Covid- death rate, the impact of coronavirus goes much further than those who lose their lives as a result of this wicked respiratory virus.The elderly pensioner waiting eight hours on the floor before an ambulance arrives, the families caring for frail loved ones due to a lack of care in the community, the parents sending themselves into debt to fund their child’s much-needed operation, the nurses, porters and paramedics who consistently work hours past their finish time to give the best possible care to their patients despite the system falling down around them.They’re all casualties of this mess we’re in.It wasn’t dficult to predict, as we failed to meet keep coronavirus under control, vaccination rates stuttered, the temperatures started to drop and winter viruses began to circulate, that even a small number of Covid- cases would be enough to tip the NHS over the edge.Related topicsAntrim Area HospitalCraigavon Area HospitalThe Executive OfficeMore On Antrim Area Hospital PremiumCovid passports on the cards to relieve stress on health service Premium died after catching virus as patients in Northern Trust hospitals PremiumAftermath of funfair ride accident looked like scene of a bomb, says shaken councillor‘Behaviour’ of teenagers and ‘misuse’ of equipment blamed for Carrickfergus ride mal‘It was terrying’: Eyewitnesses share their shock at Carrickfergus ride malMost ReadDonna Traynor taking ‘age bias case’ against BBC, corporation insider claimsDonna Traynor BBC departure: The contenders to replace Newsline anchorFormer SF mayor behind offensive email resigningCovid passport certication NI: all you need to know about contentious policyPictured: Inside south Armagh underground drugs factory raided by policeTop VideosPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolatePlayWatch: Derry Girls stars spotted filming latest series at Barry’s PlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenLatest Northern IrelandViolence against women at epidemic levels, Stormont committee hearsPlans to accelerate vaccine booster rates in NI unveiledLoyalists haven’t got a clue about the Protocol, Bertie Ahern saysAllison MorrisOpinionLatest online abuse directed at Naomi Long driven by misogynyQueries over using a lidar plane to find Disappeared victimsLatestLowry painting set to fetch more than £.m at auctionGovernment dismisses appeal over controversial Westferry developmentDave Prowse Star Wars haul goes under hammer to aid fight against Alzheimer’sMan sentenced to  years for ‘unprovoked’ murder of teenage boyOklahoma governor commutes death sentence,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Just % of the party’s supporters said they didn’t know or had no opinion on the matter.In April of this year loyalists rioted across Northern Ireland, with disturbances in Antrim and the Shankill Road area of Belfast. The decision not to prosecute any member of Sinn Fein in relation to the Bobby Storey funeral was cited as sparking the violence. The then DUP leader Arlene Foster called for the Chief Constable to resign as a result of unionist anger at police handling of the funeral.Across the political spectrum, some % of those asked the question indicated support for the PSNI by replying ‘yes’ with % answering ‘no’ and % either not sure or not having any opinion on the subject.Of the two main nationalist parties, SDLP voters indicated most support for the PSNI, with % answering ‘yes’ to the policing question.

That appears to be reflected in the Lucid Talk results, with just % of SF voters polled saying that they would consider a career in policing or support a relative who wanted to join.Republicanism’s dficult relationship with the police, despite the Patten reforms, was demonstrated by nearly halfsaying they would not consider a career in policing or support a relative in joining the PSNI.

This development within the Park-based group prompted Caroline to take action and so she got in touch with the Alzheimers Society straight away. Within weeks, the group had organised a dementia awareness workshop which saw almost  people turn up. Caroline said: “When we saw the turnout at these events we thought to ourselves theres something happening here, we have high numbers of people in the community looking for information on Alzheimer’s. “We were overwhelmed with the interest and numbers attending and this led to two further workshops being organised with one specically for businesses –  businesses attended. “The large attendance at the workshops subsequently led to the formation of a support group and a volunteer led signposting centre facilitated by Marie Gormley.” Having noticed the demand within the rural community for more support, Caroline helped set up a partnership between the Learmount group, Alzheimer’s Society and Claudy Health Centre to register to become a Dementia Friendly Community . The group also managed to secure funding through the Rural Development Programme, Housing Executive and Derry City and Strabane District Council. The funding was used to make dementia-friendly adjustments to the community groups building. This included signage, colour coding, training facilities and utensils that those with dementia could use. After seeing an advert in a paper for the Old Library Trusts Memory Cafe, Caroline set off for Derry to try and find out how she could set up a similar one in Park. This meeting started a conversation with the Old Library Trust who expressed an interest in including the Learmount group in their DEEDSproject. Shortly after the Old Library Trust secured funding through the National Lottery Community Fund for the project, Learmounts Dementia Social Club was born. Held every Monday morning, the social club have members from Feeny, Claudy, Park, Dungiven and Donemana attend. “We see ourselves as a Dementia Hub for the community and these mornings work so well for us – they are just the loveliest mornings and everyone benefits from them,” continued Caroline. “The carers come along as well and they get so much out of it too because they are meeting other carers who are dealing with the same concerns as them. “We have such great volunteers here in Learmount who have so much enthusiasm and dedication turning up weekly to help the group.” In , Learmount Community Development Group were nominated by the Alzheimers Society for their Dementia Friendly Awards, which they ended up winning. The north Derry groups services are also listed in the Alzheimers Societys literature which is distributed as far away as Scotland. “The social mornings happened so naturally and it just goes to show youthere is an identied need, opportunities will arise from it,” said Caroline. Although Covid- halted the social mornings run by the centre, they have since reconvened and members are delighted to be back. Just a few weeks back, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council Graham Warke paid a visit to the Dementia Social Club to congratulate them on being awarded runner up in the Well Being Category of the IPB Pride of Place Awards. The group was nominated for the award by the council and were delighted to receive recognition for the work of their dementia volunteers, families, the Learmount Group and their DEEDS partners at the Old Library Trust. “Having this service is great because in rural areas it helps to remove the stigma and families are more willing to come forward and receive the support thats there on their doorstep,” continued Caroline. “We have guest speakers who come along to the social mornings and it’s just great to have that support around the table. “We would like to thank DEEDS, Claudy Health Centre and the Alzheimers Society for bringing their knowledge and support. They have been so supportive of the work that we are trying to do.” Although they are at full numbers for the social mornings at present, Caroline hopes going forward they will be able to get more families on-board. “Dementia sufferers get huge benefits from the social mornings, members look forward to coming here because it is a safe environment and they feel included in the community.” The McGrellis family recently visited the Dementia Social Club to present Patrick Conway, chairperson of the Learmount Group, with a cheque for pound, the proceeds from their Dan McGrellis, Memorial Charity Golf Day held on August . In total the McGrellis family raised pound, which was ided between Learmount Dementia Group and Marie Curie. Patrick Conway thanked the McGrellis family for the overwhelming amount raised at the charity event. Patrick continued that the generous donation would be used specically to retain dementia services in the local area and would have a huge impact on the support we can offer families. “Over the past six months, Learmount dementia services have received numerous donations from families living in the area – Shaun Mulhern and Ciaran Hutton, Annie-Teresa OKane and family and the McGrellis family - which we are so grateful for and it means that we wont lose our servicesfunding is stopped.” Patrick encouraged anyone who has a family member who has entered the early stages of dementia and would like support to get in touch by contacting the Learmount Group on .

For Eimhear, it was a moment she had been waiting on since  when she got her first taste of dancing at the prestigious competition which attracts Irish dancers from all over the world. “The first year Eimhear danced at the Worlds she came sixth. In  she came fth, in  she came third and in  she came second,” said Eimhears mum Bernie. With the Covid- pandemic hitting in early , Eimhears dreams of becoming a World Champion were put on hold once more. “She was so close the last year she performed at the Worlds and she just had it in her head that she was for doing this year – she was determined,” Bernie continued. Mum Bernie made the trip to Killarney with Eimhear, who has been dancing with the McNicholl School of Irish Dancing for approximately  years. She watched on proudly as her daughter took to the stage on November  to show her best moves to the judging . It was a tense wait at the adjudicators made their decision and when Eimhears number was called out Bernie said they both couldnt believe it. “We are just so delighted, there are no words for how we are feeling,” said Bernie “We are all just over the moon. Eimhear puts in a lot of work. She goes to classes three times a week and her daddy Anthony got her her own wee studio out the back so she can practice at home. Shed be out there for an hour or more every night.” Paying tribute to McNicholl School of Irish Dancing, Bernie said: “Sineacutead, Seamus and Niall have been really, really supportive of her. They also put in so much work behind the scenes and should be commended.” Bernie said following her success, Eimhear, who attends St Patricks College, Maghera, was welcomed home last week by her proud family and friends. “Eimhear just couldnt wait to get back to see everybody to celebrate her success. All the family were there with a big banner to welcome her home. Fr OReilly even congratulated her from the altar at the weekend masses.” Speaking about her success, Eimhear, who also plays camogie for Banagher GAC, said she really enjoyed the experience. “It is indescribable how Im feeling and I just want to thank Sinead, Seamus and Niall so much,” said the teenager. “I enjoyed dancing on that stage so much and I just couldnt wait to get on there because I didnt have a single nerve in my body. When my number was called out I just burst out into tears, I was just so happy. “My friends couldnt believe it. They were texting me and messaging me when I was crowned World Champion as they were watching it live on Facebook. “Im now planning to compete at the Worlds in April  so Ill be back at the dancing again this week,” she added. Teacher Sineacutead Burke also paid tribute to the north Derry dancer. She said: “Eimhear is a really good example of hard work pays off and not giving up. She deserves this title so much as she was simply outstanding . Her self belief and the hard work she put in are what earned her that success.”             ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Adam Harris and his we Emma have organised a charity football match in memory of their baby boyDerry NewsDerry father organises charity football match to raise funds in memory of his baby boy overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Geoffrey McGonagle in his Derry days.

The families are hoping to raise as much money as they can for Foyle Hospice and HURT, an addiction services charity in the city. After the popularity of last year’s lights, which were put up in a bid to cheer everyone up during lockdown, the neighbours decided to go bigger and better this year. People across Derry are heading down to feast their eyes on the amazing winter wonderland display. Laura Meehan, a resident of Racecourse Drive, said she and all the neighbours love the buzz on the street. “There’s always been a couple of houses on the street that have been heavily decorated. Then more and more neighbours asked for theirs to be done. “So, this year, back in January, we all said we would do a big fundraising event this year. There is a donation box in the centre of the street and all the money is counted and split evenly at the end of the night. “You don’t have to pay to see the street, but you can donate in the wee box. We just ask that cars drive slowly because there are kids running around the street. “From five o’clock onwards, the street does not empty but the atmosphere is brilliant. All the neighbours and kids are running around the street. A woman at the top of the street was even making hot chocolates the other night. So many people came down to see the street last year and this year has been really busy already. I think it’s only going to get bigger each year. “This street is the beststreet to live on, everyone is so friendly and looks after each other. It is so lovely and we are so proud.” Residents are askingany companies could please donate selection boxes for when Santa visits throughout December.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Adam Harris and his we Emma have organised a charity football match in memory of their baby boyDerry NewsDerry father organises charity football match to raise funds in memory of his baby boy overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Geoffrey McGonagle in his Derry days.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Adam Harris and his we Emma have organised a charity football match in memory of their baby boyDerry NewsDerry father organises charity football match to raise funds in memory of his baby boy overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Geoffrey McGonagle in his Derry days.

If The Starjets sound familiar to those of a certain age, then they should as they were part of the Norths punk-scene in the late s with the band being contemporaries of Stf Little Fingers and Derrys own The Undertones. The Belfast quartet scored a hit in  with “War Stories” – a song covered by multi-million selling US rock band, Green Day last year which propelled The Starjets back amongst the big time. Their song about Lyra, who was killed in  when covering a riot in the Creggan area of Derry, is the fourth song in a tribute to women who were killed while still young – the other three being about journalist Veronica Guerin, Princess Diana and Palestinian rights activist Rachel Corrie. While singer and guitarist, Paul Bowen, hopes to get the song out to a wider audience, there is one person he hopes the song will reach – Sara Canning who was the late Lyras partner. Paul said: “I wrote this song of May , a month after Lyra was killed.  The Starjets perform a live version of Legendary Girl, a song about journalist Lyra McKee who was killed in Derry two years ago “Its part of a four-song cycle about women who were murdered or died in a tragic accident – two of them being about Irish journalists. “Lyra being one and Veronica Guerin being the other. The other two women were Princess Diana and Rachel Corrie. “The song about Lyra has received a huge amount of radio interest all over the world in places like Australia, Germany, Holland, Calornia and the UK itself. Its sitting high in two of the UKs independent charts. “The song about Lyra is up against some strong competition in the Heritage Chart. “Were up against Rod Stewart, Diana Ross and Billy Idol – we are minnows compared to them. “Were a small band from Belfast – a blip on the horizon – from the old punk era. “There was an exceptional turn of events during lockdown last year when Green Day recorded one of our songs, War Stories, which we had a minor hit with back in .  The Starjets on BBC show, Top Of The Pops, in  performing War Stories which was covered by Green Day last year “A tsunami of goodwill came our way after that. We didnt think anybody knew who we were but theres emails coming in and posts being put up on social media. “The former Radio  DJ, Mike Read – who had championed us back in the day – phoned me up and askedI had any songs as he had started the Heritage Chart for older artists who do not get played on commercial daytime radio as much. “I said I had a song about George Best, called Geordie Best and I sent it to Mike and it reached number one in that chart back in January. “Im grateful for that and Im also very grateful for all the interest the song about Lyra McKee has generated. “One of my main goals was to get the song to Lyras partner, Sara Canning because I think she would appreciate it – I hope she would. “I didnt know Lyra personally but I knew of her. I knew she signed a deal with a Faber  Faber and that she was high-profile. “Apart from the film that has just been shown at the Belfast Film Festival, theres very little footage of her. Her le was so short.”  Paul Bowen and Terry Sharpe, right, still rocking with The Starjets having first burst onto the scene in the late sADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Adam Harris and his we Emma have organised a charity football match in memory of their baby boyDerry NewsDerry father organises charity football match to raise funds in memory of his baby boy overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Geoffrey McGonagle in his Derry days.

More than  years ago, a commitment was made to take action to promote and protect the Irish language in the Good Friday Agreement. This was reaffirmed in the  St Andrews Agreement, Language legislation was also promised in the New Decade New Approach deal in January  but the fact an Irish Language Act has still not been implemented gives grounds, according to Mr Delargy, for the Secretary of State to intervene.

The court heard how police had been called to Secrets night club, Magherafelt, at around .pm on the night of December  , where the security manager told them he had ejected a female. The manager told police she had bottled another female over the head while inside, knocking her unconscious in the process. The injured party had then been taken to AE, where she was forced to remain overnight and had surgical glue applied to a wound. When being arrested, the defendant became irate and police reports from the night in question revealed she shouted “F**k you, f**k your ma and f**k your da” at police and members of the public. She also yelled repeatedly that she did not hit anybody. Later, on viewing CCTV footage of the incident, a guilty plea was entered by the defendant. Judge Mullan noted that the contents of a pre-sentence report completed on McKenna did not endear her to the court. While discussing the injuries to the other female, the report noted the defendant as saying: “She got hair extensions a few days later.” Defence for McKenna said the incident had arisen due to a school-type hostility between the women. Although noting the defendant had no previous record, they conceded that due to the amount of alcohol taken, the defendant had made her debut in a most spectacular way. Counsel also noted that at the time of the offence, McKenna had been just  years old, and had been initially charged in a youth court but turned  in the meantime. They said the incident should be viewed in the context that the defendant was a youth who was intoxicated on licensed premises and that the behaviour was consistent with that context. McKenna had indicated she was unable to complete community service or probation, and Judge Mullan told the court this had limited the options available to her. She sentenced the defendant to four months imprisonment, suspended for a period of  months, and issued a three-year restraining order prohibiting her from contacting the injured party.

Judge Mullan began by telling the court the defendants pre-sentence report had made for unbelievable reading, and that she had no regard for road traffic laws. She said Johnston had already received suspended sentences, probation and disqualication, but that she continued to get into a car in the knowledge that she could well go to prison. Addressing the defendant, the judge asked why this was the case. “A lot of it has to do with my head, but Ive been working with the mental health team to get it in order,” she replied. Judge Mullan told the defendant the court had been patient with her, and noted she had even gone out, bought a vehicle while disqualied and then subsequently drove the vehicle. Defence for Johnston said she had engaged with probation and that they hoped she had begun a process of rehabilitation as a result. The court was told the defendant now understood she could not just get in a car and drive anymore. Judge Mullan ordered Johnston to complete  hours of community service, fined her pound and disqualied her from driving for a further period of  months. A pound offenders levy was also imposed, and the defendant was advised by the judge not to buy any more vehicles while disqualied from driving.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.     However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.     Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.     More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound. Manus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins. Two versions of the film have been compiled and the BBC will broadcast the -minute ‘short version’ by Perfect Cousin Productions Ltd, in association with the BBC, Arts Council and Irish Film Board.

Also included are Manus and Majella Martin. uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ue u uc p ue r n ucp ueThe youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O ursquoNeill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from  ulsquoTeenage Kicks ursquo to  ulsquoMy Perfect Cousin ursquo to  ulsquoIt ursquos Going To Happen ursquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O ursquoNeill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThe way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage, urdquo he said.  uldquoWe really have no bad feelings towards him. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. uc p ue r n ucp ueCaroline O ursquoNeill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoHe ursquos going to kill me for saying this, urdquo she said.  uldquoBut he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ue ucstrong ueNot so good-natured abuse uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ueThe laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThere were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street, urdquo admits Damien O ursquoNeill. uc p ue r n ucp ueAnd Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home:  uldquoIt was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn ursquot buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. uc p ue r n ucp uePaul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal ursquos shoes described the documentary as  uldquobrilliant, really enjoyable urdquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueJohn O ursquoNeill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets:  uldquoI think it ursquos great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big. urdquo u uc p ue r n ucp ueThe screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over  upound. uc p ue r n ucp ueManus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins. u uc p ue r n ucp ueTwo versions of the film have been compiled and the BBC will broadcast the -minute  ulsquoshort version ursquo by Perfect Cousin Productions Ltd, in association with the BBC, Arts Council and Irish Film Board. uc p ue r n ucp ue ucspan style ud \"color: #ff \" ue ucstrong ueClick the Next ugt tab to go through the gallery uc strong ue uc span ue uc p ue r n ucp ue[articlepreview id ud \" \" link ud \"https:www.derrynow video multimedia  watch-the-story-of-the-undertones-.html \"] uc p ue r n uc  ue r n uc  ue r n uc class ud \"vc_story_telling \" data-position ud \" \" data-story ud \" \" ue r n ucp class ud \"vc_story_telling_title \" ue u uc p ue r n uc class ud \"vc_story_telling_text \" ue r n ucp ue ucspan style ud \"color: #ff \" ue ucstrong ueThe Undertones Premier. . .

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment.

Miami Vice: Saturday, TCM @ pm Michael Manns stylish and action packed update of the famous s TV show about cops taking on drug dealers. Bristling with testosterone, its a moody grown up thriller full of suspense, action and neo-nazis getting shot in the face. Whats not to like about that  Colin Farrell  Jamie Foxx are solid as the leads but Naomie Harris steals the film with one small scene in a mobile home. The soundtrack is wicked too. Portrait Of A Lady On Fire: Saturday, BBC @ pm In Brittany at the end of the th century a painter called Marianne is commissioned to paint a portrait of a woman calledHeacuteloiumlse who is due to be married off to an Italian nobleman. A marriage she wants no part of. Do you fancy a romance that will both uplt you and leave you in absolute shreds  Well here you go. Magnicent turns from Noeacutemie Merlant and Adegravele Haenel carry a sublime story. Rain Man: Saturday, TG @ .pm Charlies father has died and left his fortune to an autistic brother he never realised he had. To get the money him and his brother tear off on a road trip where he finds out about both his sibling and himself. Aspects of Rain Man have dated these days but its still a lovely story of discovery and reunion buoyed by a couple of memorable performances from Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise. Pawn Sacrice: Sunday, BBC One @ .am  Bobby Fischer vs Boris Spassky. . The chess game to end all chess games. Two grandmasters. West vs East. Some said it was only a game but in a time of cold war its also something far more important than that. Tobey Maguire does fine work as the tragic lead of a well crafted film riddled with paranoia and suspense while Liev Schrieber uses his trademark brooding to intense effect. Walk Like A Panther: Sunday, Channel  @ .am  Their local pub is closing and the only way to make money is toto the lycra and capes. But these folks arent superheroes, nope, they are s wrestlers and aching hips and shoulders arent going to stop them. An entertaining slice of fluff and whimsy from  that will make you feel nostalgic for Saturday morning television. Stephen Graham, Sue Johnston, Robbie Gee and Julian Sands are among the familiar faces having fun. Ladyhawke: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm Nare and Isabeau are in love but they have a wee problem. There was a curse placed on them making him a wolf during the night and her a hawk during the day ensuring they can never be together. The only person who can help is a thief called Gaston. Richard Donners  fairytale is a likable, well made, glorious looking romantic escapade. Michelle Pfefer and Rutger Hauer play the lost lovers and Matthew Broderick has a good time as their only hope. St Vincent: Sunday, Film @ .pm After an incident with his next door neighbour a grumpy old Vietnam vet begins to babysit her bullied son and soon they begin to see the best in each other. A funny, bittersweet comedy that will make you laugh and upset you in equal measures. Bill Murray in the lead is better than hes been in years and Melissa McCarthy as his neighbour does well in a role thats a lot more dramatic than her usual parts. Bridge to Terabithia: Monday, Great! Films @ .pm Jesse and Leslie become fast friends when she moves in next door to him. Soon their childhood imaginations are running riot and the kingdom of Terabithia is created. Real le is sadly never far away though. A little beaut of a movie, one full of lessons about le, both the lovely and tragic sides of it. Anna Sophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson are both amiable leads. Be warned, this could might will make you cry. Doubt: Monday, TG @ .pm A well liked priest is accused of child abuse. But did he do it  Thats the crux of the tale in an excellent adaption of the famous Broadway play. Philip Seymour Hoffmanis the priest in question and Meryl Streep is the nun investigating him. We get immense performances from both. The subject matter might be hard to take but its compelling and gripping stuff that will stay in your head for days after. Dog Soldiers: Monday, Film @ . A group of soldiers on routine training in the Scottish highlands find themselves under siege from a pack of beasts that should not exist. Neil Marshalls debut film is awesome. Hilarious, horric, quotable, disgusting and damn scary. A rare horror comedy that gets its blend just right. All this and we get a wicked cast too with Sean Pertwee, Kevin McKidd, Liam Cunningham and Darren Morfitt whos just deadly as Spoon. All The Kings Men: Tuesday, Great! Movies Action @ .am Wille Stark. A real salt of the earth fellow. Liked by all. Well...... Hes a politician, a self taught kind of guy. Hes a decent man, at least he was once, back when he hadnt sold his soul. A deserved Best Picture winner back in , this portrait of the rise and fall of a famous face mixes politics and noir to brilliant effect.Broderick Crawfordand Merceded McCambridge both put in first rate performances. Journeys End: Wednesday, BBC Two @ .pm France. . The trenches of Aisne. A young soldier called Raleigh once who once believed in the importance of war sits surrounded by his comrades in a filthy, rat infested trench as the German army only metres away get ready to attack their front lines. A powerful watch that shows us bullets make no distinctions when it comes to class and social status. Asa Butterfield, Paul Bettany and Sam Clafin do strong work. Nebraska: Thursday, Film @ .am A father and son called Woody and David are taking a trip from Montana to Nebraska to claim a prize. Woody is slowly losing his memory to dementia and David is dragged into the mess. Alexander Paynes comedy drama is a beautully written and crafted look at the complexities of family relationships. Plus it has a couple of wicked belly laughs hidden away. Bruce Dern, Will Forte and especially June Squibb are all on fire. Paths Of Glory: Thursday, BBC @ .pm The men of B-company refuse to make a suicidal run at a German hill during World War . Their general is embarrassed by his perceived failure and sets out to make someone pay. Stanley Kubricks masterful anti war film is an enraging watch, one that shows the toll military le can have on humanity even when the fighting is over. Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax has never been better while George Macready as General Mireau will make you despair. Sam Whiskey: Friday, TG @ .pm Her husband is dead and Laura has a problem. The gold he stole is sitting in a boat at the bottom of the Colorado river and she needs someone to find it andit to its rightful place. Unfortunately she hires the rogue Sam Whiskey for the job. A charming. amiable western is just what you need for a Friday evening and this one led by Burt Reynolds and Angie Dickinson is just the ticket. Youll instantly guess how its going to end but it will keep you smiling throughout. American Mary: Friday, The Horror Channel @ .pm A broke medical student discovers an unusual way to make extra money and finds herself in some very very dark places as a result. This  dark drama horror film starring Katherine Isabelle is a highly effective piece of work. Be warned though, it should probably only be watched by those with a strong constitution butyou can go with it you discover a unique little story that will open your eyes to a whole other world. The Belly Of The Whale: Friday, RTEacute One @ .pm Joe and Ronald. Two loners in a miserable, run down seaside town in Donegal. One has come home after a long time and the other is already there scratching out a miserable existence. They come together with a plan but theres someone venal in their way. A dark dark dark Irish comedy from  that went under the radar at the time but its still worth your time. Michael Smiley, Peter Coonan and Pat Shortt do nice work as three men youd cross four fields to avoid.

If the proposed Mid Down College gets the green light, then it will close and become part of the new school.Cllr Walker said he understood the constraints Blackwater was operating under and that there was no room to expand at its Old Belfast Road site, suggesting that it should also relocate to Down Highrsquos current site when it becomes available.The Rowallane politician has again insisted that he supports integrated education and was behind the proposal to create Drumlins Integrated Primary School in Ballynahinch and Killyleagh Primary Schoolrsquos decision several years ago to embrace integrated status.He said he was ldquoin no way attempting to turn the proposed Mid Down College proposal into a political football, branding such a suggestion as ldquoludicrous.Cllr Walker also rejected claims from Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown that the DUP narrative in the post-primary school proposal was ldquoshort-sighted and  in parts and that the steering group behind the new Mid Down College had no intention of taking students away from other schools.Accusing the Alliance man of being ldquodisingenuous, Cllr Walker said his party is not anti-integrated education.In addition, he rejected Cllr Brownrsquos assertion that Newry, Mourne and Down Council did not want to meet with the Mid Down steering group to discuss its proposal.ldquoIt was agreed that steering group members, along with representatives from the other post-primary schools in the area who have concern about the new college proposal, would be asked to meet with a working group comprising elected representatives to outline their respective views, he said.Cllr Walker said that whatever happened moving forward, childrenrsquos education must always come first as they are the future of the district.He continued: ldquoThe bottom line for me is thatthe proposed Mid Down College impacts on existing schools, I will continue to point that out. We need to consider the needs of all our pupils and their respective futures.Cllr Walker added: ldquoI have met with those for and opposed to the new integrated college proposal and am pleased to have done so as it is the right thing to do.

Once again, I would thank those from other unionist parties for their words of encouragement in upholding my Christian faith in the political arena and their offers to have a conversation on my political direction.Cllr McKee confirmed that when he left the UUP, he notied the local councilrsquos chief executiveof his intention to become an Independent councillor for the immediate period to allow some time before deciding where his political future lay.He continued: ldquoWhile I had no intention of making a move to any party anytime soon, I was drawn on the basis of many of my messages and phone calls towards Traditional Unionist Voice.ldquoThis led me to read the TUV policies and manestos which, having read, I believe I am very much in agreement. One of the newspaper articles referred to me as a traditional Unionist and to be honest thatrsquos who I am.Cllr McKee said that following discussions with the TUV leader, Jim Allister, during which he set out the importance of his Christian values as a politician, he has taken up the offer of another party much earlier than he had intended.ldquoLike many people across Northern Ireland, I appreciate the strong and principled leadership Jim has offered, particularly in recent days when it has come to the Northern Ireland Protocol which is undermining our position in the UK, he continued.ldquoI feel that the ethos of TUV and the ever-growing number of members joining the party, particularly in the South Down constituency, provides me with an opportunity to represent the best interests of the people of the Mournes.Welcoming Cllr McKee to the party, Mr Allister said he was delighted that he had decided to join the TUV.ldquoHarold is a conviction politician and as such is a good fit with TUV following his principled resignation from the UUP.

The races also had dfering start times with the longer distances starting earlier in the day.Doing laps often keeps the runners compact in terms of marshalling and spectating but it can mean that those doing the longer distances are tested mentally when they see others finishing.It is sometimes hard to carry on for the next loop when you can see others reaching the end of their efforts. It also means where there is a hill or a tricky part of the race, you will see it more than onceyou are doing the marathon or the ultra. The k route was slightly separate but also included a few steep sections so it was not an easy option by any means.Marguerite Robinson had been training hard to regain fitness after a layoff with injury and had hoped to be ready to use her half marathon slot, which was a deferred entry from last yearrsquos event, that was called off due to Covid- restrictions.However, as race day approached, she realised that on this occasion that she might be taking on more than she could chew and certainly more than she would enjoy so she wisely switched to the K.She was easy with her decision once the race got underway and even more so during the last mile when she was running the drag uphill from the gate to the finish. She completed in . and was th female .Declan Teague has been in fine marathon form recently, packing in three such races in short succession from September into October, but this one was notable as it got him to number  in his tally.Unfortunately since his last race, he has had to reduce his training miles due to niggles and he arrived at the start line knowing that he was going to have to dig deep to get round.He was therefore delighted to hook up with Phillip Vint as the race got underway and said that the camaraderie took their mind off the big climbs and got them through the first hour with ease.Phillip was on his way to his th marathon and in his usual understated fashion he was just there to get on with it.The commitment and consistency of these guys has to be admired.As much as Declan was enjoying the company, he urged Phillip to press on to pursue his own pace. Phillip very gradually eased away over the miles ahead and finished a superb th overall in three hours and  minutes.This would be a commendable time on tarmac let alone on an off road event. Declan stuck to his own rhythm and was happy with his time of . which placed him nd out of the  who completed.Clare Carson was also in for the marathon distance and taking it in her stride she dipped in just under the five hours to add another one to the long list that she is accumulating.They all commented that they found the downhills as tough as the ups and the quad muscles had definitely taken a battering, but despite the testing route, it is one they will likely repeat.Stephen Heasley, who was in Tollymore to take part in the ultra distance, reported back that he was a lsquoDNFrsquo. For those of you who are unsure what DNF means, it is short for lsquodid not finishrsquo.Most would assume that this would be a major disappointment.In Stephenrsquos case though, perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he had a change of plan rather than a failure.Although he was finding it tough going, he waited until the end of lap two to call it a day so in fact he completed a marathon while considering his options.For many of us managing to finish a marathon on a good day would be a challenge. To do so on a ldquobad day seems almost a triumph.It was certainly the right decision for Stephen on the day and hopefully he will now take time for recovery before his next escapade.Jonny Holmes had taken part in the NIMAA XC Championships a month ago as a way of trying his hand at cross country running.That event also stood as selection for the NI team for the North South Challenge. Based on the results that day, the Masters Association drew up teams of six plus one reserve for each age group -, -, - and so on.Jonny was duly notied that he was picked to run as reserve in the - category and so he turned up at Queens Playing Fields last Saturday, slightly concerned as to how he would cope given the standard of the runners.He had no need to worry as he paced it well and did himself and the club proud.He was rd in the end and completed the five lap muddy circuit in  odd minutes. He expressed his awe of the standard at the front of the race and felt that it was great to have the experience of being part of such a competitive event.This weekend sees the cross country season continue with a large EDAC squad heading to Comber for the Comber Cup and some juniors travelling to Santry in Dublin for the All-Ireland Even Age Group Championships as part of the Co Down team.

Bobby Dalzell Cup with a comprehensive victory over local rivals Killough at a windswept Ballyhornan on Friday night.Two goals in each half, including a brace from Celtic striker Jay Gibney, was enough to ensure it would be the Hoops who would be contending for this yearrsquos title on December .To both teams credit, the number of supporters that flooded through the gates to watch this spectacle was more than commendable, with hundreds of people in attendance to witness what is historically a feisty encounter between the sides mdash this occasion being no dferent.Killough, donning their new kit, kicked off, but in a matter of moments found themselves defending a free-kick in a dangerous area, although Celtic centre back Gary Carberry saw his effort well saved by lsquokeeper Christopher Mallon.The opening minutes played out to a rapid pace of football, with the wind unsure of which direction to blow resulting in both teams attempting to play on the ground.Killoughrsquos first big opportunity came courtesy of a Connor Kelly free-kick after team-mate Cillian Burns was pulled down by defender Blaine Connolly unfairly.However, Kellyrsquos effort just whisked over the crossbar in what would prove to be a seldom chance for the village side in the opening  minutes.What Celtic seemed to have in their arsenal which Killough lacked was showing clinical precision and accuracy from their set pieces.With seven minutes on the clock, the Hoops would have their first of  corners throughout the match, with the Killough defence failing to clear the danger with any conviction, allowing the ball to float back across the box and into the path of Celtic marksman Jay Gibney.The striker made no mistake with the finish and the deadlock was broken.Referee James McCreesh certainly had his work cut out, as he consistently gave verbal warnings to both teams and their management as he did a commendable job controlling the pace of the contest.However, his patience was tested one too many times and after a quarter of an hour, Killoughrsquos Kevin Groves received the first yellow card of the game for a tackle on Gerard Collins.Celticrsquos Peter Casey struck the resultant free and was unlucky to see his effort kiss the top of the crossbar.The Hoops continued their pressure and were rewarded with a corner. Barry Treacy, whose set piece efforts were fantastic throughout the  minutes, stepped up to strike a low cross into the box for captain Mikey Rice to tap in and double his sidersquos lead.Rice was instrumental for Celtic and deservedly was awarded man of the match for his efforts.A manic couple of minutes ensued after another corner caused Killough problems, the ball this time falling to Casey who saw his left-footed effort crash off the underside of the crossbar and somehow away to safety.Celtic kept their relentless efforts in attack and a moment later they thought they had their third, but their strike was ruled out for offside. Killough then failed to properly dispatch the ball up the pitch, allowing Hoopsrsquo striker Jordan McCoubrey to attack their goal.However, McCoubrey was left frustrated when his appeal for a penalty was waved off by McCreesh.Killoughrsquos Declan Burns received a booking for a hearty tackle on the opposition before team-mate and lsquokeeper Mallon managed to ert the ball away from the net in a dramatic goal line scramble.In what was an admittedly underwhelming performance by Killough, custodian Mallon made a number of inspiring saves throughout the match and kept the final score at a much more respectable tally.Celticrsquos Casey must have thought he had been the subject of a curse, after his third long ranged effort in the space of  minutes struck the woodwork, this time a spectacular  yard effort thumping against the upper left.Killough managed to weather the storm and their best chance of the half came from captain Gareth Georgersquos free-kick which sailed wide of the post before Celticrsquos Connolly picked up a yellow card for a combination of fouls.That signalled the last signicant action of the opening  as Celtic led by two at the half-time interval.Upon the restart, Shaun Megahey managed to sneak past the Killough backline to force a point blank range save from Mallon as changes were made to both sides, including the introduction of Stephen Galbraith for the Hoops.Carberry was the latest entry into the book after dragging down Killoughrsquos Kelly before the village side suffered an injury blow in the form of midfielder Matt McKiernan on the hour mark.The game had settled down at this point, with Killough still deciding whether to stick or twist as they knew they needed a goal, but one wrong move and the game would be put beyond their reach.Mallon continued to impress in goals, with an eye-catching one handed save off a Carberry header, although at the th minute the result was put beyond doubt.A calamity of errors in the Killough defence allowed Gibney to square the ball to substitute Galbraith, who tapped into the open net to completely crush their opponentsrsquo fighting spirit.Killough are known for their resilience and kept fighting to the conclusion, but it was clear that it wouldnrsquot be their day as the clock wound down.Megahey picked up a yellow for the Hoops before his opponents saw a penalty appeal for a hand ball shut down.Tempers continued to flair as Killoughrsquos Ruairi Sharvin added his name to the list of yellow card recipients just before his sidersquos misery compounded when Gibney added Celticrsquos fourth of the match with a neatly struck finish.Killough resorted to shooting from distance but werenrsquot having much luck, with Jack McLoughlinrsquos effort the only to really cause Celtic custodian Nathan Curran to spring into action with a confident one handed save.Groves did manage to loop a headed effort past Curran. However, as per the theme of the match, Celticrsquos defence managed to clear the ball before it could cross the line.McCreesh blew his whistle for the final time to send the Celtic fans into raptures as the players audibly voiced their pleasure at making yet another final.Man of the match and Hoopsrsquo skipper Mikey Rice gave his thoughts on the performance after the contest.ldquoEveryone knows what theyrsquore getting with Celtic Bhoys and Killough, big hits, hard tackles and a great spectacle for the neutral, he said.ldquoYou see the amount of people who came down here, especially for the Newcastle league teams, itrsquos brilliant. It was always going to be a great game and I respect Killough a lot, he continued.ldquoI think there was a few people here watching the match who will be featuring in next weekrsquos semi-final between Dundrum and Ardglass, so hopefully we gave them a wee bit of fear to face us.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran S Megahey, B Connolly, G Carberry M Rice , G Collins, B Treacy, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, N Williams-McCabe.Subs: C Kerr, S Galbraith, S McMahon, C McCartan.Killough: C Mallon, S Og Burns, G George , E Gargan, R Sharvin, M McKiernan, D Burns, K Groves, C Burns, C Kelly, J McLoughlin.Subs: D Looney, T McIlhone, L Murphy, R Burns, D Taggart.Yellow cards: K Groves, D Burns, R Sharvin.Corners: Celtic Bhoys , Killough .Offsides: Celtic Bhoys , Killough ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/17November2021_castlewellan.jpg","title":"Lease signing paves way for ambitious investment at Castlewellan Forest Park  ","story":"LOCAL politicians have formally approved an agreement which paves the way for a major multi-million pound investment in Castlewellan Forest Park.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Forest Service have signed a draft lease which legally formalises the local authorityrsquos phased takeover of the stunning forest park which attracts tens of thousands of visitors yearly.A pound.m revitalisation project at the park is being backed by the National Lottery Heritage Fund and the local council, with the latter spearheading the ambitious project to signicantly enhance facilities at the sprawling park, with the lottery funding earmarked to restore a number of key features to help maximise its tourism potential.Construction work has already commenced at the Bothy Yard thanks to funding from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the EU.Work on the main restoration project is scheduled to complete by December , with the local authority agreeing a lease for the core areas within the park from the Forest Service until .Proposed work includes new landscape and drainage within The Grange courtyard, a new pedestrian path from the entrance gates to the main car park, a new vehicular road off Castle Avenue to the existing car park.

Mallon eventually pointed in the th minute only for Alana McCrickard to take a pass from Dearbhla Magee and fire over a minute later.Mallon responded with a huge score from play and then a th minute point to level the tie at - eachHowever, Dearbhla Magee gave her side the lead once more with a free after a clever move between Aimee McAleenan and Karen McMullan.But Mallon eventually levelled the tie again with a huge free from  metres in the nd minute and then five minutes from time stepped over a free in the left corner where the m line meets the side-line.It was the toughest angle she had faced, but she scored the point and Portaferry held on for a famous first title.Mallon was the player of the match. Portaferry would not have won without her contribution, having scored all eight points, but they also would not have won without the defensive wall they put in front of Fiona McGarry.Mary Jo Mageean, Dearbhla Coleman and Saoirse Sands smothered everything that the Fontenoys threw at them. But on a day like this, everyone put their shoulder to the wheel and it was enough to break the dam.ldquoIt is very hard to win the first. We have tried very hard over the past few years to win this title and it feels so good to actually get there, said Portaferry team mentor Martin Mallon, who was feeling the relief after the final whistle.ldquoI wonrsquot tell you a lie. We were very anxious coming into this final, all of us. You could see it in our play.Girls were tense and nervous out there and Liatroim took advantage.ldquoThey were always going to give us a real battle and you canrsquot give the likes of Dearbhla Magee an inch. I just donrsquot understand how she didnrsquot get an All-star nomination. She is one of the best players in Ireland, he continued.ldquoI felt thatwe got in front, we wouldnrsquot concede.

You can talk all you want about Niamhand the forwards, but the defence was absolutely brilliant.ldquoWe are young and we are hungry and we are going to improve more on the back of what we achieved today.Portaferry: F McGarry, C Coleman, A Mallon, MJ Mageean, C Finnegan, D Coleman, C McKenna, S Sands, N Savage, M Fitzsimons, F Toner, C Coleman, C McConnell, E McGrattan, N Mallon .Subs: G McGrattan for C McConnell , E Gallagher for N Savage , M McNally for M Fitzsimons .Liatroim: N OrsquoToole, Aacute OrsquoToole, K McAleenan, D McCabe, O Brown, K McMullan, A Brown, SL Clarke, D Magee , A McCrickard , A McAleenan , E McAleenan, C Davidson, D Brown, N McKibben.Sub: O Blaney for C Davidson .Referee: Paddy Brannigan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/17November2021_poppy.jpg","title":"Remembrance Sunday in Downpatrick  ","story":"THE future of the Remembrance Sunday commemoration in Downpatrick looks to be secure.Thatrsquos the message from the organisers after an encouraging attendance at Sundayrsquos parade and wreath laying ceremony.The future of the commemoration was in doubt owing to a decline in attendances in recent years.A few weeks ago, Mr Andy Campbell, chairman of the townrsquos Royal British Legion branch, issued an appeal for support and warned that this year parade might be the last in the county town.However, Mr Campbell said he was delighted at the level of support on Sunday, both in the number of people who took part in the parade and also by the attendance at the wreath laying ceremony at the cenotaph.Addressing the gathering from the steps of the cenotaph, he said: ldquoI would like to thank everyone who has come here today to remember those who gave their lives to safeguard our freedom.Afterwards he said: ldquoWe had approximately  people taking part in the parade and another  or so at the cenotaph.

Certainly higher prices feed into the sense of wealth that homeowners can have, and so can encourage spending. It also brings cheer to people who bought over-priced homes  or more years ago, and have never seen their initial outlay recovered.It can further be a sign of a healthy economy.But this surge in prices, whatever it is, is not an indicator of the latter. Its exact origins are unclear, and might include the pandemic having caused people to rethink priorities, and to conclude that it is important to invest in a good house, after the challenges of being confined to home in a lockdown.Prices are rising in much of the western world, so it is not an NI-specic phenomenon. But the financial climate in which these home value increases are occurring is an abnormal one. Governments have flooded their societies with money to stave off economic disaster from Covid, and interest rates are exceptionally low.This is causing problematic side effects such as society and businesses taking on too much debt and high inflation — the perils of which Dr Esmond Birnie describes opposite.Excessive house price inflation can be as harmful as general inflation.Among other problems, it shuts young people out of home ownership, and that is good for neither them nor society at large, which has to deal with their understandable sense of exclusion and resentment. ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Quite a surprise, then, that the Irish government has now discovered an alternative in the case of solid fuel, where imports from the north will be allowed in over the land border without let or hindrance and will only be checked at sites further into the territory of the Republic, well away from the actual customs border .But beyond that particular case, a former Irish diplomat, Rory Montgomery, has revealed that after the  Brexit referendum the Irish government was actively considering similar alternative arrangements for checking and controlling all of the trickle of goods crossing the border, until the EU insisted that despite the very special circumstances EU law must be rigidly applied as per normal.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

So there’ll be subsidised tests available, but I think we have to go further than that.“We need very clear communications for people on how to use them because they do have a role to play.“They’ve an important role to play. There’s no silver bullet, be it boosters or antigen testing or anything.”He said the final details on subsidising the antigen tests will be worked out soon.“It’s not going to be cheap to do,” he said. “The initial figures I have are that it could be several hundred million euro.“The advice I have is that they shouldn’t be free. They had them free in the UK and the government came under huge criticism from Parliament for that because essentially there were no controls on how they were being used at all.“They’re very, very expensive. So every time you subsidise an antigen test, it’s money you’re not spending on a nurse, you’re not spending on a doctor.”The Government on Tuesday agreed that pubs, nightclubs and restaurants in Ireland will have a midnight closing time from Thursday. Residents of hotels will be exempt.People will also be urged to work from home from Friday,they can.Mr Donnelly said there are no plans to extend any of the financial measures, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment .He also said further restrictions cannot be ruled out.AskedIreland is heading for another lockdown, Mr Donnelly said no-one could answer that question.The Fianna Fail minister said the impact of the new restrictions is expected to take effect in three weeks.Stephen DonnellyGovernment  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularTunnels could be opened under Northern Ireland town‘There was Irish state collusion with IRA in my dad’s murder - now I want truth and justice,’ says Northern Ireland manCall to have SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly removed from Policing BoardLoyalists who are opposed to the Northern Ireland Protocol “haven’t got a clue” about how it works, former Irish premier Bertie Ahern has saidMandatory vaccine passports to be introduced to Northern IrelandMost PopularNI High Street Voucher: How long can it take to get spend local card and what to doyou havent received itAir Ambulance called out after  incident involving childSupport from political figures for Stormont minister Naomi Long after vaccine passport Twitter abuseUnionists back ex-RUC officers over Kelly’s ‘sectarian’ label Muslim leader is quite entitled to pray for a united Ireland but unionists will never join him                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The best thing I did was talk about it.MORE NEWS:The animated film explains what its like to live with the condition and reveals the wide iety of hallucinations Mr Foy experiences every day,including seeing his daughterrsquos plaits as wiggling fish out of water when she moves, or seeing a dragon when he opens a hot oven.Mr Foy has a guide dog called Mason, who he says keeps him safe and grounded.In , the retina in his left eye detached and, while he experienced some hallucinations as a teenager, they then increased dramatically and his brain would conjure all sorts of visions to fill the darkness..removeMr Foy said: ldquoI hope that this film will raise awareness of Charles Bonnet Syndrome and also encourage others with the condition to reach out to Guide Dogs for support.Ian Morris, national head of adult services at Guide Dogs, said: ldquoDespite so many people with sight loss experiencing Charles Bonnet Syndrome, there is very little awareness or understanding.ldquoIt is thought that the hallucinations are the brainrsquos response to the gradual loss of information it received from the eyes and so is trying to fill in the gaps, therefore drawing comparisons with lsquophantom limb syndromersquo in amputees.ldquoAt Guide Dogs, our mission is to increase the independence of people with sight loss. We hope that by sharing Nathanrsquos experience in the form of this animation, we can raise awareness of the condition and reduce stigma, and let people know of the support available from Guide Dogs.If you require more information or help from Guide Dogs, you can contact them on the Guide Line telephone service on    or visit https:www.guidedogs.org.uk getting-support Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityHere we break down how Cardf and Vale University Health Board has performed in October .Ambulance response timesCardf and Vale had the highest emergency response rates in October according to the latest Welsh Government NHS Wales Performance data.For the health board,  lsquoredrsquo calls ndash calls which are for immediately le-threatening incidents ndash were received in October, with an emergency response sent out in  of these cases.Of these,  were at the scene to treat the patient within the Welsh Governmentrsquos eight-minute target. This was . per cent of those lsquoredrsquo calls being attended to in the response time - making Cardf and Vale the only health board in Wales to meet the  per cent target.The health board also received, amber - less urgent but still serious - calls and , green calls - cases where a non-emergency response is more appropriate..This October saw the highest number of calls for an ambulance than any other October since the May  period when the data was first made available. It was also the firth month in a row where the daily lsquoredrsquo call average was above  ndash with an average of  lsquoredrsquo calls last month.The Wales-wide statistics report that just  per cent of lsquoredrsquo calls received a response time within eight minutes ndash the lowest since the data was first made available in May . It is down . per cent on September.Darren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, said: ldquoThe pressures the NHS are currently facing, particularly in urgent and emergency care, are worrying for all. Recent figures show the impact that the enormous pressures on the NHS are having on ambulance waits outside of Emergency Departments and how this effects the experience of patients..removeldquoItrsquos important to understand that this is a whole-system issue. There are many factors affecting NHS capacity from staff absences because of Covid or suspected Covid, to more people on wards and in intensive care units needing treatment for Covid and higher demand for other conditions. The social care system is also under unprecedented pressure, meaning the NHS is unable to discharge patients from hospital and therefore has much lower capacity to treat incoming patients.ldquoThe NHS in Wales is working relentlessly to cope with current levels of demand and staff are doing all they can to ensure everyone waiting for care is seen as soon as possible. We thank them and the public for doing all they can to support the NHS.A spokesperson for the Welsh Government said: ldquoThe latest data shows the pressure on our health and care system continues to grow. But our hardworking health and social care staff continue to deliver high quality care when people need it.On the ambulance waits, the spokesperson said: ldquoThe ambulance service in Wales, like the rest of the UK, continues to be under great strain. The number of red calls, which are classed as le-threatening, in October were the highest ever on record. The number of calls in October were also  per cent higher than October last year.ldquoEarlier this year we provided an additional pound million to go towards supporting the transformation of urgent and emergency care services to deliver the right care in the right place, first time.ldquoThe ambulance service has also received funding for the recruitment of the equivalent of  staff.ldquoWe encourage people to consider the best options for care, and not necessarily head to their local emergency department. To get the right care first time, people can also use the online  service and their local pharmacist where appropriate.Emergency Department dataThe figures show , people attended the emergency department at University Hospital of Wales Cardf in October. Of these , - or . per cent - were seen within the four hour target. This puts the health board in the middle of the Welsh statistics.The latest data shows that there were,attendances to all NHS Wales emergency departments in October . This was: . per centlower than the previous month , . per centhigher than in the same month last yearbut . per centlowerthan October .MORE NEWS:The average number of emergency department attendances per day in October  was ,. This was:  fewer attendances per day on average than in the previous month,  more than in the same month in  but  fewer than in October .According to Welsh Government targets,  per cent of patients should spend less than four hours at an emergency department.The latest monthrsquos data shows that . per centof patients in all NHS emergency departments spent less than fourhours in the department from arrival until admission, transfer or discharge. This was: . per cent lower than the previous month, . per cent lower than the same month in , and . per cent lower than the same month in . The  per centtarget continues to be missed.Cancer treatment timesThe Cardf and Vale University Health Board is the third lowest health board in Wales for patients newly diagnosed with cancer starting their first definitive treatment within the first  days after diagnosis.In total  patients in the health board started their first treatment in the month of September, with  within the first  days of being suspected of having cancer. The total percentage is . per cent of patients starting their first treatment within  days. However this, and all of the health boards in Wales, falls below the target of  per cent.Prior to the Covid- pandemic, on average there were just under , patients starting their first definitive treatment per month. This number fell at the start of the pandemic to a low point of  in May  but has generally been on an upward trend since and in recent months has been in-line with or exceeded activity levels for the corresponding months in .In September , , patients newly diagnosed with cancer started their first definitive treatment in the month.This is an increase of . per centfrom August  and an increase of . per centfrom September .The Welsh Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is encouraging the number of patients newly diagnosed with cancer starting their first definitive treatment and the number of patients informed they did not have cancer have both increased on the previous month.ldquoIn a boost to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, the health minister today announced more than pound million is to be invested in replacing ageing diagnostic imaging equipment across NHS Wales.ldquoThis will signicantly improve image quality, often resulting in earlier and more accurate diagnosis.ldquoWe have invested an extra pound million this year to transform the delivery of services and tackle waiting times, but because of the ongoing pressures and effects of the pandemic we donrsquot expect to see real progress before the spring. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

A motion to ban MPs from holding second jobs outside parliament as paid lobbyists or political consultants has failed. MPs voted by a majority of  votes to reject the motion which had been put forward by the Labour Party following the recent Tory sleaze row and the government’s handling of the Owen Paterson case. Boris Johnson had instructed his MPs to vote against the Labour motion, with a following Conservative amendment passing through a majority of  votes. Labour leader Keir Starmer announced that the party would be tabling a motion to call for a ban on MPs being able to hold “any paid work to provide services as a parliamentary strategist, adviser or consultant”. It came after huge backlash over the Owen Paterson row and the accusation that the Conservative government had ed to a policy of “sleaze”. Johnson had previously instructed Tory MPs to vote against the immediate suspension of former MP Owen Paterson, who had been found by the parliamentary standards committee to have broken lobbying rules while working as a consultant and earning £, per year. The committee had recommended that Paterson serve a -day suspension, however his suspension was initially blocked after a vote in the House of Commons, where a reform of the parliamentary standards committee was also voted through. The government was forced to do a hard u-turn on blocking Paterson’s suspension following intense backlash from opposition parties and the public, with critics claiming that the incident had heralded ato “Tory sleaze”. As a result of the incident, Labour took the opportunity to table a motion which banned the paid employment of MPs in positions consultancy and advisory role outside of parliament. At a vote in the House of Commons on  November, the motion was rejected by  votes to . Despite rejecting the motion with a majority of  votes, the vote showed that Boris Johnson’s majority on the issue had decreased. Many Tory MPs abstained from voting against the controversial motion, while four Conservative MPs - Peter Bone, Philip Hollobone, Nigel Mills and Dan Poulter - rebelled against the party and voted in favour of the ban on certain kinds of second jobs. Upon the announcement that a Labour backed motion calling for a ban on paid lobbying and consultancy role for MP would be tabled, Johnson tabled an amendment. The amendment described the ban as “the basis of a viable approach” and called on the Standards Committee to update the MPs’ Code of Conduct. Labour called the motion a “watered down” version of the original amendment. Despite the original motion being rejected, the amendment passed with  votes to zero, with Labour MPs abstaining from the second vote. A Government spokesperson said: “The House of Commons has tonight voted to update the Code of Conduct for MPs.“This means that MPs will be banned from acting as paid political consultants or lobbyists and that MPs are always prioritising their constituents.“This will strengthen our parliamentary system and we will work on a cross-party basis to achieve this.”Following the vote and rejection of the Labour motion, Starmer said: “We put forward a plan of action to clean up politics and strengthen standards in politics.“Andyou can believe it, after two weeks of Tory sleaze and corruption, the Prime Minister whipped his MPs against that plan of action, and, frankly, he just doesn’t get.”“We are not going to back down from these proposals, we’re not prepared to have them watered down, so we will press on with them.“But it is unbelievable.”"},{"url":null,"title":"junior reporter needed to interview the fureys ","story":"Jake Bailey-Sloan: Tributes to young Portadown businessman ‘one of the kindest souls you could ever meet’   Appeal after assault on traffic wardenNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoHomes and GardensLestyleCarsHomes and GardensPublic NoticesAdvertise My BusinessFree Happy AdsNewsPeopleJunior reporter needed to interview The FureysWe’re on the lookout for a junior reporter interested in the unique assignment of interviewing members of top Irish folk band, The Fureys.By Valerie MartinMonday, th November , : am  \"       \"  The Fureys, will be performing at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast on Saturday, January  and in advance of this showpiece event, we are giving one young person a unique opportunity to interview Eddie and George Furey from the band.The interview will take place at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast on Monday, December .

The Executive today backed proposals to introduce vaccine passports. Its believed they will be needed to enter nightclubs, hospitality venues which serve food and drink cinemas, theatres, concert halls and conference centres indoor events with  or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated outdoor events with , or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated and events where more than , people will be present regardless of whether they are seated. All of the Executive parties, with the exception of the DUP, backed the proposals. Welcoming the Executive’s decision to introduce Covid certication for hospitality settings, the Minister said: “Certication must be seen as one piece in a jigsaw of required measures. Other measures include signicantly increased use of face coverings, more people working from home and more social distancing. We need to limit our contacts and always be mindful of the importance of fresh air and good ventilation in dispersing Covid- particles. “We also need to continue the acceleration of our vaccine booster roll-out, and keep encouraging more people to come forward for their first and second doses. “The case for Covid certication in hospitality is not complicated. It can reduce the number of infected people in high risk settings. Vaccinated people are less likely to become infected and ill than unvaccinated people. And the virus is only transmitted by infected people. “Our Covid numbers are too high and we need to forcibly push them down. Our health and social care system is under severe stress. We have to act. “Let me also emphasise that I do not want to see further Covid restrictions on our economy or our daily lives. Such a decision is far from inevitable. “We can all play our part in altering the direction of this pandemic. It is in all our hands. “By following public health advice we can help keep each other safe and support our health workers. “We all want this pandemic to be over, but simply wishing it away is never going to be enough. A united effort across society is what is needed to get us through this winter.” Covid certication requires proof of full vaccination status, or a negative Lateral Flow Test in the previous  hours, or proof of recovery from a positive PCR test in the previous  –  days.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ccdcfadedc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_efabcdbbacd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1637251036284.jpg--covid_19___thu_18th_november_figures.jpg?163725103700","title":"covid  thu th november figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows six further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.
