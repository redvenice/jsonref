Encouraging ourselves to go out into the word encourages the prefrontal cortex to work more effectively, which is good for creativity and attention encourages better function.What we are going through now is part of our human experience and we only have the capacity to experience joy because we experience pain. This is the shadow side of so many gorgeous things and anyone who has gone through grief or sexual trauma or health problems will know that sometimes what you are going through is hard and can be long. There is something about being as kind to ourselves as possible and not looking for the quick fix and easy solution, looking for hope – where it is there – and contact. Yes, at the moment it feels unstable and at those moments, some people will adopt conspiracy theories and so forth, but lots of others will be asking big questions about how to live life and what is important.

These include sleeping difficulties, increases in irritability or moodiness, and overeating or abusing drugs or alcohol. If you notice these warning signs then it’s important to try various forms of stress management. These include reaching out to friends and family and developing a healthy lifestyle – for example, regular sleep, healthy diet and physical exercise. You can also deploy various forms of relaxation exercises such as meditation and yoga. If the forms of self-help aren’t sufficient, then you should consult your family doctor. There are also some very good internet self-help programmes and phone apps available, which can be useful.At the age of 30, I moved to a remote cottage with no services in the hills of mid-Wales and lived there alone with no vehicle and no phone … I began to find this life suited me and I remained there for five years.You might say that I was uniquely suited for the unexpected arrival of lockdown, even though I am a single parent living in a council flat in town, and unable to head out to the wilder parts of the country as I am used to.I have, however, made a point of going out walking every day, and resetting my expectations of what I am likely to experience. I have refocused my attention on to the smaller things – wildflowers and butterflies and fungi, learning as I go. I think that a lot of people have found that a locked-down life has given them a much greater appreciation of the natural world, and I hope that many people will find that this new interest endures. I find myself, and trying to find the positives in any given situation, concentrating less on what I have lost than on what still remains to me and thinking about what I can do today rather than what I can’t.I wrote my first book in my head. I used my imagination to write stories and kept my mind going. The other thing to do is to learn to live for the moment – you cannot think too far ahead. It is easy to become depressed and when you are isolated and faced with yourself there is a tendency to become very introspective – and anyone who is introspective will find they look inside with two sides of their personality, the light and dark. If you dwell too much on the negative side you can fall into a deep depression. The answer to that is to recognise we are all the same, we all have two sides of our character and work for a degree of inner harmony.My life changed greatly after I came out of captivity and I thought time in captivity was a waste of time, but it was not. I was discovering creative abilities I had that I did not know I had. This current situation may seem a waste of time but is not if you can draw on it at a later stage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4930aeb2e247862ef2634f40f241803c6c278612/0_559_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=ac336fd0592c098ed1785562349992c9","title":"fox news lou dobbs tonight canceled","story":"Dobbs, who hosted Fox Business Network’s highest-rated show, was a key driver of baseless election fraud claimsFox Business Network has canceled the show of Lou Dobbs, the ardent Donald Trump supporter with a history of espousing misinformation who promoted baseless conspiracy theories of voting fraud after the election.Friday evening marked the final airing of Lou Dobbs Tonight, Dobbs’ regular weeknight program. The Fox host was a major contributor to the false narrative that the election was stolen and continued espousing those views on his program even after admitting that they lacked actual proof.“Eight weeks from the election and we still don’t have verifiable, tangible support for the crimes that everyone knows were committed,” he said on air in January.Dobbs, 75, has hosted the program since 2011. Trump considered it must-see TV and even reportedly patched the host through during key policy meetings.Dobbs is still considered the highest-rated host on the Fox Business Network, and he has remained under contract even though he is not expected to reappear on a new show. His show’s slot, which airs twice on weeknights, will now be filled with a show called Fox Business Tonight, which will feature Jackie DeAngelis and David Asman as hosts.News of the cancellation came one day after Dobbs, 75, was named as a defendant in a defamation lawsuit filed by Smartmatic, an election technology company and voting machine maker, which accuses Dobbs and other Fox News anchors of promoting unfounded claims that Smartmatic was involved in a scheme to hand the presidency to Joe Biden.Citing the fabricated reporting, Smartmatic sued to the tune of $2.7bn. The 285-page lawsuit, filed in New York state supreme court, claims the network launched a “disinformation campaign” against the company, whose voting machines were only used in Los Angeles county. Trump’s former lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell who appeared as guests on the network, were also named in the defamation suit.Fox said the move to end Dobbs’ show had been in the works before the lawsuit.“As we said in October, Fox News Media regularly considers programming changes and plans have been in place to launch new formats as appropriate post-election, including on Fox Business,” a Fox News spokesperson said. “This is part of those planned changes.”On the Smartmatic lawsuit, Fox said on Thursday the network was “proud of our 2020 election coverage and will vigorously defend this meritless lawsuit in court”.Dobbs said he had no comment on Friday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7c375ec4adf31e1155ac0cd6ed14792f758c800/0_171_5150_3092/master/5150.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=7c4c4d3f933b4fe5ad3a7f36c8034391","title":"wall street versus the redditors the gamestop goldrush podcast","story":"When a group of amateur investors on a Reddit messageboard began buying up stock in a video games retailer it forced huge losses on major Wall Street hedge funds that had bet against it. But following a trading frenzy the stock began to fall, almost as quickly as it had risenAt the beginning of the year, not many people were paying attention to GameStop. Its business of selling video games in retail stores looked increasingly shaky as the market shifted ever more online in the grip of the Covid-19 pandemic. GameStop’s seemingly grim prospects led Wall Street hedge funds to take out big bets on the company’s share price falling further (known as short selling) but they had not reckoned with a force that was about to blow them away. Users of the Reddit messageboard WallStreetBets began grouping together to buy huge quantities of GameStop’s stock, driving the share price higher and higher and inflicting huge losses on the hedge fund titans.  Desmund Delaney tells Rachel Humphreys that as part of the Reddit community he was tipping shares in GameStop back in 2019 and took his own advice investing in the company, despite the derision of other users. But he gave up on the company last year while its share price was below $10 and cashed out. If he’d sold last week he would be sitting on half a million dollars.  Economist Dan Davies explains that while the phenomenon of an online community-driven stock market bubble feels new and exciting, it’s a story as old as the markets themselves. A group of investors egg each other on to speculatively jack up the price of shares they are holding – only for the whole thing to come crashing down. In the case of GameStop, it may have burned some incautious hedge fund managers, but the steep decline in the share price this week has proved to be a sharp lesson for amateur investors who didn’t sell up before the crash began. Are online forums a new force on Wall Street? Or are the odds still stacked too steeply against them?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d53fd69948aed9df4c103f847e9b7c059213400b/0_87_640_384/master/640.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=8adf030127b2c74a668261d226a84132","title":"tell us do you work in the uk farming and agriculture sector","story":"We would like to hear from those working in the UK farming and agriculture sector about the issues facing the industry post-BrexitWe’d like to find out more about how the UK farming and agriculture sector will fare post-Brexit.Farmers across the UK could face substantial cuts to their income as a result of Brexit, others may benefit if the government introduces payments for common goods in place of the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy. are interested in hearing from those who work across the UK farming and agriculture industry about how livelihoods will be affected post-Brexit.

A state comprehensive in the mid-2000s had neither the time or resources to encourage or teach cricket, and the sport became a symbol of privilege and inequality for years before I got a love for it. Accessibility to cricket, and the connotations of what that means, has always fascinated me. It may sound trite and meaningless, but it genuinely means a huge amount for cricket to make a conscious effort to try and attract fans away from its traditional base through this channel 4 deal. Hopefully Mambo No.5 won’t just be an anthem of nostalgia, but a call to increased participation and appreciation across the country. Maybe I’ll even manage to teach my family the rules (we managed to get halfway through the concept the ‘over’ during the recent Windies Test series before interest started to flag).” 119th over: England 355-3 (Root 156, Stokes 63) Sundar bowls an uneventful over to complete a brilliant morning for England, who scored 92 runs from 29.3 overs. They rode their luck a little - Stokes was dropped twice and Root survived a run-out chance - but generally played very well, with Stokes bullying the inexperienced pair of Shahbaz Nadeem and Washington Sundar. See you in 30 minutes for the afternoon session.118th over: England 354-3 (Root 155, Stokes 63) Four more to Stokes, timed through midwicket off Bumrah. This is starting to look slightly ominous for India. If Stokes is still batting at tea, they can forget about winning the game.117th over: England 348-3 (Root 154, Stokes 59) Stokes is really going after the change spinners. He slog-sweeps Sundar for two boundaries in three balls, which takes him to 59 from only 91 balls. At one stage he had 18 from 38.“On the other side of India, I sit in a cafe as the sun lashes the golden Kovalam beach and masala chai with a hearty omelette goes down a treat,” says Guy Perry. “I dream of Root whacking a big six from Chennai for me to reach out and catch. Go, Joe!!!”116th over: England 340-3 (Root 154, Stokes 51) Bumrah replaces Ashwin with just under 15 minutes remaining before lunch. Root works a single off the pads he has happily played second fiddle this morning, hitting only a couple of boundaries to Stokes’s eight. Stokes gets a single later in the over, and then Root digs out another blistering inswinging yorker from Bumrah. Well played.115th over: England 338-3 (Root 153, Stokes 50) The offspinner Washington Sundar replaces Nadeem. His fourth ball kicks nastily at Root, who smiles partly because he’s having the time of his life generally and partly at the thought of what this pitch might do on days four and five.113th over: England 336-3 (Root 151, Stokes 50) Stokes races to fifty with consecutive reverse-sweeps for four off Nadeem. It’s been an increasingly aggressive innings, mainly because of that rough outside his off stump: 73 balls, six fours, two sixes. England are in a fine position now, and should be safe from defeat if they can add another 400.112th over: England 328-3 (Root 151, Stokes 42) Oof, Root survives a big run-out chance after Stokes takes a dodgy single into the leg side. Washington Sundar’s throw was really poor, on the half volley to Pant’s right. Had it been straight into his gloves, never mind a direct hit, Root would have gone.“Reading you on the western edge of Vancouver Island, the western edge of a continent,” says David Dowling. “A link in the thin red leather line.”111th over: England 326-3 (Root 150, Stokes 41) Stokes misses a sweep at Nadeem and is hit on the pad outside the line of off stump. As Mark Butcher observers onAn eventful over continues with Root pushing a single to reach his third 150+ score in as many Tests. Given his form between 2018-2020, that’s a pretty astounding and thoroughly heartwarming development. The over still isn’t done: Stokes clouts a slog-sweep for six off the final ball. Blimey.110th over: England 316-3 (Root 149, Stokes 32) Now Stokes is dropped by Ashwin, a sharp return chance to his right. I think it hit him on the wrist in the end, but that’s more encouragement for India. Things are starting to happen. Things. 109th over: England 314-3 (Root 148, Stokes 31) Nadeem gets one to spit viciously out of the rough at Stokes, who is slightly startled but managed to glove the ball to safety on the leg side. The next ball also spits at Stokes, hitting him near the groin. That was a really encouraging over from India.“Watching this from NZ,” says Conrad LaPointe. “It’s great to at last have a series that fits with a sane time schedule: 5pm start here, very civilized. Also get to watch the Super Bowl on Monday from midday, that is also a public holiday here (Waitangi Day). Good times.” It’s our year!ROOT IS NOT OUT! It was bouncing over the stumps, so India have lost two reviews in five balls. I think that one was fair enough, though.Root pushed outside the line of an arm ball from Nadeem and was hit on the front pad. It might be umpire’s call, but I reckon Root is in trouble.INDIA REVIEW FOR LBW AGAINST ROOT! This one looks close. 108th over: England 313-3 (Root 147, Stokes 31) Just before that review, Root pushed a single to bring up an assured fifty partnership with Stokes. The standard of cricket from both teams this morning has been extremely high.STOKES IS NOT OUT Yep, it hit him on the glove. Not out.REVIEW FOR LBW AGAINST STOKES! This is an odd one. He tried to reverse-sweep Ashwin, missed and gloved the ball up in the air on the off side. Ashwin must have thought it hit his arm because he was keen to review for LBW.107th over: England 312-3 (Root 146, Stokes 31) Root, beaten in the flight by Nadeem, drives uppishly for a single. That was a crafty bit of bowling, and a reminder that England can’t get lazy against India’s weaker (sic) spinners. If you’re playing Test cricket for India in 2021, you are on the good side of competent.“This is turning to be a good news day here in Macau,” says David Melhuish. “First day of our CNY hols with sun and azure blue skies 55 and 66 looking fine fettle 1.2 mil vaccines arriving by road from HK (pop here is approx 600,000). LOOKING UP.”2021: it’s our year!106th over: England 310-3 (Root 145, Stokes 30) Ashwin switches ends to replace Ishant. At the moment batting looks very comfortable for England, though history tells us you should never get too comfortable in India. I still think they need at least 500 in this innings.105th over: England 308-3 (Root 144, Stokes 29) Stokes gets down on on knee to paddle Nadeem over his shoulder for a couple. He looks so comfortable at No5, a position in which he averages 51. “Hey Rob,” says Daniel Bernstein. “I’ve got the St Peters (Brighton) U13 cricket team coming on for a team zoom cricket watch at 9am. Assuming he is still in (!) I was going to give them a ‘watch how Root sweeps the spinners’ masterclass. Why isn’t he doing what he did in Sri Lanka? What’s different about the Indian spinners?”I didn’t see enough of yesterday’s play to be sure, but it looks like it’s only Ashwin that he is slightly reticent to sweep. This Cricviz piece is worth a read. 104th over: England 303-3 (Root 142, Stokes 26) Ishant goes around the wicket to Stokes, who puts him away for consecutive boundaries. The first was a beautiful, wristy stroke, flicked between mid-on and midwicket, and the second a confident square drive. Stokes, who is batting with serene authority, has 26 from 44 balls. Time for drinks.“Hello from Winnipeg,” says John Corp. “Where it’s -24C and with the wind feels like -38C, so I’m keeping warm with a large brandy.”I think I caught mild hypothermia just from reading that email.103rd over: England 295-3 (Root 142, Stokes 18) The left-armer spinner Shahbaz Nadeem replaces Ashwin. Stokes plays a reverse-sweep first ball, a statement of... something. The commentators think Stokes is conscious of the rough outside his off stump and is trying to get on top of Nadeem from the start. A single brings Root on strike, and he sweeps crisply behind square for four. “If he can stay in and get there, I can’t WAIT to see Stokes take on the support spinners,” says William Juba. “Could be in for fireworks. I appear to getting ahead of myself! I’ll try to stay in the moment. And then Butler the same when we’ve already scored 500 and Pope has his first subcontinental hundred...” My suggested first-innings score of 20,000 is starting to look conservative.102nd over: England 290-3 (Root 137, Stokes 17) Ishant has another LBW shout against Root, but again it was sliding past leg stump. Ishant is bowling beautifully here, particularly to Root, and that’s another maiden. England have scored 27 from 12.3 overs this morning more than anything, that’s a reflection of some high-class bowling.“Rio sounds nice,” sniffs Matt Bannerman. “Here in dark and chilly Oxford, the Beast from the East we are forecast for tomorrow holds out the prospect of that rare pleasure: watching cricket whilst the snow falls.”You’d have had mixed emotions in 1975.101st over: England 290-3 (Root 138, Stokes 17) Stokes brings out the sweep for the first time today, pinging Ashwin over square leg for four.“Hi Rob,” says Abhi Saxena. “This match is going to be fun. The result I expect will be decided on who plays this day and the next one better. I would imagine it to be spinning a lot on this dusty pitch by days four and five. Want Root to get 150 as he is such a likeable person but not too many, as otherwise the match will get very hard for the Indians. Will be interesting to see how England bowl. I think that will be quite crucial.”I can’t believe I’m typing this, but England might win this match. They need a huge first-innings score - 500 minimum, ideally 20,000 - and then for the pitch to deteriorate. But it’s not beyond the realms.100th over: England 284-3 (Root 137, Stokes 12) Root inside-edges an inducker from Sharma for a single. There is a little bit of reverse swing, so England need to be careful against Ishant. India’s main three bowlers (Bumrah, Ishant, Ashwin) have bowled really well, going at just over two an over between them. The newer bowlers, Shahbaz Nadeem and Washington Sundar, went at almost four an over yesterday.“Morning Rob,” writes Becky C. “Having made the decision yesterday to get up at 3.30 mainly because of the sheer amount of work I needed to get through that would be improved by having the cricket for company, with the ultimately futile thought that I’d ‘be able to finish work early’, I’m feeling surprisingly calm this morning. Maybe it’s the early morning hour inducing a sleep deprived calm but I was able to watch both Stokes’s six and Ashwin’s excellent next delivery with equal amounts of calm, a feeling that it was simply going to be alright. Have I reached a higher state of cricket consciousness?” Higher State of Cricket Consciousness would be a great Josh Wink remix: all those insistent do doo doos supplemented by random bits of commentary from Henry Blofeld and Rob Key.99th over: England 282-3 (Root 136, Stokes 11) “I’m here!” says Ian Jefferson. “Keeping an eye on your OBO from San Francisco. What else is there to do? Haven’t been more than a mile from my house all week. Cricket is keeping me sane.”You and gazillions of others.“I’m here!” says Ian Jefferson. “Keeping an eye on your OBO from San Francisco. What else is there to do? Haven’t been more than a mile from my house all week. Cricket is keeping me sane.” You and gazillions of others.98th over: England 280-3 (Root 135, Stokes 10) Ishant Sharma replaces Bumrah. He bowled excellently yesterday, particularly in that spell to Root just after lunch, and his third ball of the morning brings a biggish LBW appeal against Root. The umpire isn’t interested and Virat Kohli decides not to review. It was missing leg stump. That’s another maiden, the third in a row. India are making England work really hard for their runs: we’ve had 17 in 8.3 overs this morning, and that includes a six from Stokes.97th over: England 280-3 (Root 135, Stokes 10) Ashwin is starting to get some turn to Stokes, who shapes to go after one outside off stump and then aborts the stroke. Another maiden.“Feeling a little lost in Rio de Janeiro right now,” says Louis Sturgess, “but feeling better for live cricket on the  app! Root for 200?”He’s playing well enough, though that doesn’t always count for much against an attack of this quality. 96th over: England 280-3 (Root 135, Stokes 10) Bumrah bowls a series of fullish induckers to Root, who defends immaculately. A maiden. He is batting obscenely well at the moment, perhaps as well as he has ever played.95th over: England 280-3 (Root 135, Stokes 10) Ashwin tosses one up to Stokes, who accepts the invitation and drives nonchalantly over long-off for six. Crikey. Ashwin responds with an excellent delivery that turns past the outside edge. This is already a cracking battle.94th over: England 274-3 (Root 135, Stokes 4) Bumrah is getting a bit of movement it might be reverse swing, even after only 14 overs. Root defends a couple of induckers and then steers a short ball between slip and gully for four. He looks in the mood for another paternal hundred.93rd over: England 270-3 (Root 131, Stokes 4) A quiet over from Ashwin, one from it.92nd over: England 269-3 (Root 130, Stokes 4) Root clips Bumrah off the pads for a single. He has already scored more Test runs in 2021 than he did last year, 555 to 464. Stokes hasn’t scored a run this year, and it almost stays that way for another 48 hours when Bumrah sends down a sizzling yorker from round the wicket. Stokes just gets his bat down in time to squeeze it wide of leg stump. That was a stunning delivery. Stokes gets off the mark next ball, guiding a boundary to third man.91st over: England 264-3 (Root 129, Stokes 0) It’s R Ashwin from the other end. He has a slip and leg gully for Root, who pushes a single into the covers to get off the mark today. Ashwin can be deadly against left-handers so it’s no surprise to see him in the attack so early with Stokes at the crease. Ashwin has dismissed Stokes seven times in Tests, more than any other bowler. Stokes continues his watchful start by defending the last four balls of the over.90th over: England 263-3 (Root 128, Stokes 0) The new batsman is Ben Stokes, who solidly defends his first delivery and ignores the next two outside off stump. Jasprit Bumrah will open the bowling. He has three deliveries remaining in his 19th over, having dismissed Dom Sibley with what turned out to be the last ball of the day.Morning. When Chris Silverwood took over as England coach in 2019, he gave the Test team a simple challenge: to start making big first-innings scores again. Everyone in the media got very excited by England’s change of direction, as if Silverwood had invented penicillin rather than stated an eternal truth of Test cricket. The important bit was not the message but whether Silverwood could get it across to a batting line-up that had become used to playing limited-overs Test cricket. He did, with almost immediate results. England are once again a grown-up batting team, and they gave another demonstration of their maturity on the first day in Chennai.They reached 263 for three at the close, with Dom Sibley making 87 and the revitalised Joe Root an unbeaten 128. Both played superbly, and as a result England look in good shape to make 400 in the first innings for the seventh time in 15 Tests under Silverwood. That’s an impressive ratio – but there is one problem. In India, 400 isn’t always worth a damn. We’ve all been told the scare story of Chennai 2016. England finished the first day on 284 for four, went on to post a big score of 477 – and were thrashed by an innings. A week earlier, they scored exactly 400 in the first innings at Mumbai – and you know the rest. That’s why Root, in his interview last night, spoke of trying to get 600 or even 700. Then, and only then, will they be able to relax in the knowledge that they are immune from defeat.The first day, good as it was for England, didn’t really tell us anything about where this match is heading. By tonight we should have a much better idea.

If it can be done online, it can be done from virtually anywhere with an internet connection. At the same time, however, the move to remote work has revealed the value of the workplace, as many employees hanker to return to the office.In light of these two opposing trends, what might the office of the future actually look like?Elvira Muñoz Beraza, director of the master’s in strategic design of spaces at IE School of Architecture and Design, in Madrid, says that this year’s disruptions will transform offices for the better. “The pandemic has accelerated trends that were already there and has forced companies and experts to have difficult yet necessary conversations,” she says. “The office is the place for collaboration, social interaction and a sense of belonging. This implies less ‘me’ spaces and more ‘we’ spaces: the long open areas filled with inidual workstations or filled with cubicles are gone.”With inidual workstations effectively relocated to people’s kitchens and living rooms, offices are being reconfigured as places that primarily exist for teamwork and collaborative activity – albeit with strict social distancing measures in place and partitions separating different teams and departments.Architects and office planners are already busy with a raft of changes, including larger desks and layouts that make more use of stairwells to reduce the use of enclosed lifts. And, of course, there’s the ongoing drive to minimise the use of frequently touched surfaces, such as taps, door handles and buttons.Beraza is focused on how offices can evolve to meet the changing needs of a company and its employees. “I believe the design of the workplace will need to focus on a hybrid combination of physical and virtual, of inidual and collective, of internal and external actions, tasks and collaboration.”She notes the importance of supporting a hybrid form of office and remote work. “Remote working should stay, combined with physical encounters. Remote work is sustainable because it provides more choice and is more inclusive and erse. The nine-to-five office culture is gone for good.”Lewis Barker, ServiceNow’s senior manager of workplace services, EMEA, believes that, post-Covid, the distinction between “working from home” and “work” will cease to exist. “For many employees, the traditional office and desktop workspace is over. For them, work is wherever they want or need it to be, on whatever screen and digital device they prefer,” he says. “This agile, more distributed ‘anywhere, anytime’ workplace of the future will transform how companies operate.”Barker believes this flexibility will become an increasingly important factor for attracting and retaining staff. “If businesses don’t look to change, whether that’s with a hybrid model or all the way to completely remote, they will struggle to bring in the talent needed,” he says.Within the office, new technologies are being adopted to enable more rigorous safety protocols. Companies are shifting to touch-free sensor technology for handles, buttons and taps, signalling a reverse from the preponderance of pre-Covid touchscreens. Some planners are even looking at technology that will allow staff to control lifts and vending machines using their personal smartphones.“In terms of the conversations we’ve been having about safety precautions in the future,” says Barker, “it’s about trying to reduce the number of touchpoints employees have, whether that’s automatic doors, coffee machines, access card readers and things like that, to reduce any contamination generally.”Other design changes will need to take place, too. Daaf Serné, ServiceNow’s director of global real estate and workplace, suggests this will include allowing more square metres per person, as well as improving the amount of space in high traffic areas, and re-thinking how we can meet and collaborate in our offices. “One thing that will be key, is how technology will influence the physical environment. When thinking about the role that AI will play in the future workplace, it will help us predict when people are coming in and how we can optimisebetter utilise our spaces to support our employees better. When we talk about our ServiceNow products and how we would use this, reserving your seat or desk in the office will be ‘normal’,” he says.However work works right now, you can do it confidently with the ServiceNow Safe Workplace suite.

Here’s how to navigate the dos and don’tsWorkplace etiquette was a minor minefield before the pandemic. Now, in the wake of Covid-19, navigating an ever changing “new normal” of office interactions has become a major conundrum. Can you stop for a conversation in a one-way space? Should you get a colleague a cup of coffee? What can you do to make remote workers feel like fully integrated team members?There’s no pre-written rulebook for pandemic work etiquette, so let’s look at a few tips for navigating the new manners landscape.1. Keep your distanceIt’s amazing how quickly we’ve moved from an intimate, close-quarters society to one where people hug the sides of corridors upon passing another human. But good manners here are what they’ve always been. That is, you want other people to feel comfortable and at ease, so you should assume relatively strict distancing even if you are personally quite relaxed. If this seems a pain, there are some real upsides here. No more bone-crushing handshakes and no more awkward or clumsy collisions when a colleague or contact leans in for a peck on the cheek. You just waggle your elbows stupidly at each from a metre away from each other and make a joke about how weird it all is.2. Video conferencing v face-to-faceIf you are working on a hybrid or semi-remote team, there are unwritten rules of engagement. Those who are in the office can pick up on nuance and body language in a way that those who are on a video call just can’t. So it falls upon on-site employees to speak as if everyone is on a video call, taking turns and talking clearly. Resist the urge to make asides or get into rapid fire discussions with your in-person colleagues as this excludes those who are working remotely. It’s hard for remote employees to fully participate when it sounds as if they’ve called into the middle of a rugby scrum.4. If people are breaking the rules …A good rule of thumb here is to treat everyone as if they’re innocent at first. Rather than being aggressive or sarcastic you might say: “Mike, I think you forgot we’re meant to be socially distancing here.” Chances are a reminder is all it will take. However, if the person says it’s no big deal or refuses, you might say: “It makes me uncomfortable or anxious,” or “We all have to obey the rules, even if they’re a pain.” In the first case, you’re making it about their effect on you, not their behaviour and in the second, you’re making it about rules that aren’t set by either of you. Both or are non-confrontational and hard to argue with, especially the former.5. Companies can helpLewis Baker, senior workplace services manager at ServiceNow says that it really helps if companies codify the rules and explain them to staff. “We put together a Return to Workplace playbook, which explains the new workplace experience and behaviour we expect of ServiceNow employees upon return. By the time they came back in, they knew what the guidelines were.” He adds that ServiceNow also supplies some of the basics: “We provide masks. We also offer online mindfulness sessions, you know, cooking classes, nutrition advice, and ergonomic advice. We’ll help you to get set up from home and put support mechanisms in place.” Straightforward rules help people understand what is expected and reduces the risk of disagreement and conflict. Companies should also keep staff up to date as government guidelines and scientific advice changes.It truly is a weird new world of work out there. But by staying respectful and keeping it clean, we can all make it through together – apart.The ServiceNow Safe Workplace Suite offers tools for organisations to deliver the right digital experience for each phase of reopening.

He visits a mosque to pray, but is told that he hasn’t washed enough. (“Dirt in your toe is dirt in your heart,” a fellow attender tells him.) He goes to an engagement party where his friends tell him he’s going to die alone, and his chances of meeting a Muslim girl in New Jersey are essentially nil. He tries to prove them wrong, and finds a girl from a similar background, but the resultant date doesn’t exactly go to plan.A fresh – if at times dark and challenging comedy – Youssef’s series centres on family dynamics, girl problems and the struggle to be something resembling a good person. Despite much buzz in the US – including Emmy and Golden Globes wins – the series has, until now, only been available on the Amazon add-on StarzPlay in the UK, meaning that it wasn’t exactly being talked about on this side of the Atlantic. That may be about to change this week, though, as it begins on Channel 4.From the toe-washing to working out what a halal stag do might look like (strip club, yes – but alcohol, no?), it’s a series that skips the small talk and goes straight to existential questions. When I interviewed Youssef last year, he told me the series was “about struggle … about that struggle to be your higher self. To be your best self.”Ramy follows a similar structure to shows such as I May Destroy You, I Hate Suzie, Insecure and Dave, which are built around millennials who represent either alter egos or caricatures of the actors who play them. The result is that these programmes feel intimate and human, and, in their best moments, force the audience to reflect on themselves. One of the most successful things Ramy does is play with viewers’ feelings of proximity and prejudice. Do you come to the show as a young Muslim feeling close to the characters because their lives look and sound familiar? Or do you have preconceived ideas of who they are because they don’t? Wherever you sit at the beginning of the show, you might not be in the same place after a few episodes.On the surface, the main characters fit the stereotypical profile of an immigrant family and their children on TV. We have the industrious father, the overbearing mother (Succession’s Hiam Abbass), the frustrated sister and a chauvinistic, bigoted uncle to boot. But throughout each episode, Youssef carefully peels back the two-dimensional characters to reveal complex humans riddled with contradictions. Ramy’s best friend, Steve – played by Steve Way, who has muscular dystrophy – is also a rare disabled character on television who is not patronised or “othered”, but afforded his own narrative.“Whether it be with writers who are in our room or with people who are in my life, I try to imagine: what are they hiding?” Youssef told me, “I try to have some conversations about the things that are bothering them and the things that they’re fighting for. And then I try to put that in these characters, and make sure that everyone is dealing with something that feels real to what that character should be dealing with.”In season one, Ramy oversteps a sacred line that is almost universally frowned upon: sleeping with a married woman. He is messy and self-absorbed, continually making mistakes that are about more than just Muslim morality, and seems at times to lose sight of the bigger picture, while going through the motions – something people from all backgrounds can probably relate to.In season two, he goes in search of guidance in the shape of Mahershala Ali, who plays a sheikh who represents the pious, calm ideal that Ramy wants to embody. The sheikh’s peaceful demeanour is necessary to counterbalance the hypocrisies we see elsewhere, especially when we meet the former porn actor Mia Khalifa in a rich Emirati’s home, or watch Ramy and his friends enjoy a debauched weekend in Atlantic City for the aforementioned stag do. Holiness represents a glimmer of hope – and a sign that Ramy could do better.For a generation that has grown up in a polarised era of binaries (leftright, rightwrong, goodbad), Ramy draws the gaze closer to home, addressing the grey areas of our lives where we are perhaps most uncomfortable. At a time when everyone is locked indoors with themselves, asking big questions, such shows can help to give an audience perspective and understanding of other people and their motivations, desires and weaknesses. Though some scenes are liable to make you cringe, essentially it’s a show about what makes us human.Ramy begins on Channel 4 and All 4 at 11.05pm on Friday 5 Feb"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/980454c95abcaea9f5cc64f0024f7fceb2abb78f/0_227_3915_2349/master/3915.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=00a83e3654ee9b90647dfc522960f286","title":"us haiti deportation flights suspended ice immigration","story":"Halt came after activists and staffers called homeland security secretary’s office but it is unclear how long it will lastThe US has suspended deportation flights to Haiti, in the latest sign the Biden administration is attempting to assert control over the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, Ice, according to community activists and congressional sources.The reported halt to Haitian flights came after a night of frantic calls from community activists and congressional staffers to the office of the newly confirmed secretary of homeland security, Alejandro Mayorkas. It is unclear how long the suspension will last, and Ice did not reply to a request for comment on Friday morning.On taking office, Joe Biden ordered a 100-day moratorium on deportation while the system and procedures for removal of migrants and asylum seekers were subject to review. But on 26 January, a Trump-appointed Texas judge issued a stay on the moratorium being implemented, and Ice resumed – and in some cases stepped up – deportations to Africa, Haiti and Central America.The deportations defied guidelines laid down by the Biden team, stipulating that removals should be focused on suspected terrorists and convicted felons who were a danger to the public. Since being confirmed by the Senate, Mayorkas and his team have been seeking to rein in Ice, according to congressional sources.A flight due to leave for Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo was halted from taking off at the last minute on Thursday, so that the would-be deportees could be witnesses in an investigation into allegations of physical abuse by Ice agents. The cancellation and investigation mark a significant change in policy.Ice had also stepped up flights deporting Haitians detained at the southern border. On Thursday, there were two flights. Most of the removals were deemed expulsions under a 1944 public health statute, called Title 42, which had rarely been used before the Trump administration.Human rights activists have argued that the upsurge in political violence and lawlessness in Haiti meant that any deportations there would be unsafe.The calls to Mayorkas’s team on Thursday night and the early hours of Friday are believed to have involved Guerline Jozef, the co-founder of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, an immigrant support group Patrice Lawrence,co-director of the UndocuBlack Network and staff from the Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen’s office.Jozef would not confirm the details of the discussions but said: “I haven’t slept for 96 hours. This is such a big win.“They were running two flights in a day in their hurry to deport as many people as possible,” she said. “We had babies as young as four or five months old. We were so disturbed that we were determined that for now, those people will be protected.”“Unfortunately, when it comes down to black immigrants, we’re the low-hanging fruit,” said Lawrence. Changing that, she added is “about political will and understanding that sometimes you have to take risks”.In recent days, US authorities have also been returning Haitians who arrived through Mexico, from El Paso, Texas, back to the border city of Ciudad Juárez on foot, in apparent violation of a Trump administration agreement with the Mexican government. When the US invoked Title 42 as the coronavirus spread, Mexico agreed to accept Guatemalans, Hondurans and Salvadorans who had travelled through its territory but not Haitians."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51955527cfaf9aed4c85f8f70f50152bda995378/118_0_1777_1066/master/1777.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99098da11775381d24f3b09da26a69f4","title":"lost on the frontline covid nurse coronavirus","story":"Yolanda Coar was 40 when she died of Covid-19 in August 2020 in Augusta, Georgia.

Other island nations such as Tonga, in the South Pacific Ocean, have reported no infections.“To be an island in 2020 or 2021 is probably the greatest geographical gift you could have,” said Prof Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh.So, as British cases start to fall and discussions about easing lockdown restrictions resume, are there strategies it could borrow to return it to normality?From the UK’s shores, New Zealand’s current situation looks idyllic: “After the lockdown(s), which were only required because border closure came too late, day-to-day life for most New Zealanders appears to be completely normal, and there are very few restrictions” said Matt Boyd at Adapt Research Ltd in Reefton, New Zealand, who has modelled the impacts of border closures for island nations.Even his own pre-Covid predictions about a major loss of tourism revenues if New Zealand ever closed its borders, have not entirely come to pass. Tourist operators continue to call for emergency funding, but the economic impact has been blunted by New Zealanders holidaying domestically, Boyd said: “Socially there have been family separations, people unable to return home for funerals, or see dying loved ones. But the social, economic and political consequences in New Zealand seem less than in countries dealing with ongoing community transmission.”This begs the question: would the UK now be in a similar position, had it acted earlier? The UK confirmed its first Covid-19 case on 31 January – three weeks before the virus arrived in New Zealand. “Logistically it would have meant making a decision very early on,” said Boyd.Yet speed is of the essence, and other countries managed it: “Taiwan and Hong Kong imposed the first measures as early as 31 December. South Korea, Thailand and Japan also responded quickly,” said Kelley Lee, professor of global health governance at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada, whose team recently reviewed 29 studies modelling the impact of travel restrictions on Covid-19 transmission. “We found that if cross-border measures are going to work, they need to be applied early on.”The British home secretary, Priti Patel, recently said she had advocated shutting the UK’s borders in March. But although a series of travel measures were introduced in 2020 – including issuing non-mandatory guidance to self-isolate for 14 days to travellers coming from designated high-risk countries – this was withdrawn on 13 March, with no further border measures in place until 8 June.Genetic analysis revealed that Sars-CoV-2 was inidually introduced well over a thousand times during early 2020 – mostly from Spain, France, and Italy. “Late February to mid March were critical,” said Prof Oliver Pybus at the University of Oxford, who led this research. “During this period, high numbers of incoming travellers from Europe coincided with large and growing epidemics in many European countries.”The result was multiple chains of transmission being initiated in parallel at different locations. This rapidly overwhelmed the UK’s existing capacity for inidual-level contact tracing. It also prevented the virus from being contained in a particular part of the country through a cordon sanitaire like in Wuhan, China. “It’s likely that the importations resulted in the early phase of epidemic growth accelerating faster than was expected,” said Pybus. “Importations mean the virus can reach less well-connected or more remote parts of the country more quickly.”The UK’s connectedness may also have put it at a disadvantage. “Like France and Germany, we’re kind of in that position of connecting Asia and the Americas and Africa as a pretty central point in the world, so we have a lot of people connecting through but also coming here,” said Andrew Tatem, professor of spatial demography and epidemiology at the University of Southampton. “That is something that governments always have to balance up, because a lot of our service industries are based on that connectivity.”Even though rapid action can buy a country time, it does not completely prevent virus from being imported – as further small outbreaks in New Zealand have shown. “Governments need to use that time to put in place and fortify domestic public health measures – notably testing and quarantine,” said Lee. “It is what governments do domestically in addition to cross-border measures that has contributed to how they’ve fared over the past year.”It may not be too late. Many British scientists would like to see the UK further tighten its borders and pursue a “zero-Covid” strategy in the coming months. “People talk about living with the virus. But what is that?” said Martin McKee, a professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine.Either we try to eliminate the virus, meaning minimising travel and maintaining lockdown restrictions until there are so few cases they can be managed through contact tracing – as New Zealand has done – or ease restrictions earlier, in the hope that the vaccine will provide a solution, McKee said. It will still be many months before everyone is vaccinated, and new variants may be imported from abroad. The UK government is not convinced about the need for blanket border restrictions. It is also scrambling to book tens of thousands of hotel rooms to quarantine arrivals from 33 high-risk countries on the UK travel ban list, which are due to open on 15 February.Speaking at the Commons transport select committee on Wednesday, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said: “We are an island nation unlike … Australia or something which is an entire continent – and that means that we need to get medicines in, we need to get food in, we need to get our raw materials in, sometimes we have to move people around, scientists and others.However, it is a misnomer to use the term “border closure” to describe what other island nations have done. “Few countries, if any, have completely closed their borders during this pandemic,” said Lee. “Australia and New Zealand continue to have travellers and trade flowing into their countries. But they have reduced these to essential traffic, and they have then also introduced screening, testing and quarantine measures that ensure that anyone and anything entering their countries are virus-free.“The task, therefore, is to decide what is essential versus non-essential traffic. It is essential that food supplies, medicines and key workers, for example, continue to flow across borders. However non-essential travel should be discouraged.”The UK now faces a similar dilemma: “We have a choice here between opening up in the UK or being able to travel abroad,” said Sridhar. “Would you like to be able to socialise, have children at school, go to bars, watch live sports events, attend music events and get back to daily life, but at the expense of not being able to travel? Or would you like to go abroad and cross borders but live with tighter restrictions for the foreseeable future?.”Ask a New Zealander which they would choose."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60cf75b5bcc46c7391321eb90f7951a741518720/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e86dd177f50737aef07d7dee2da63738","title":"no 10 distances itself cabinet office covid vaccine schedule","story":"Hancock confirms Covid jabs schedule after it was initially denied when revealed in election planMatt Hancock has confirmed a government timetable of early May for all UK adults aged 50 and older to be offered a first coronavirus vaccination, while arguing it is “still too early” to start talking about an imminent wider reopening from lockdown.The May deadline was one Downing Street had previously declined to specify, and which emerged on Friday seemingly by accident when it was mentioned as part of a government plan for elections in England that month.No 10 had previously said only that the target for offering initial vaccinations to the first nine groups of people, phase 1 of the programme, was spring. But a Cabinet Office document published on Friday, setting out plans to hold elections on 6 May, said these could safely happen in part because the first phase of vaccinations would be finished by then.Downing Street initially dismissed the schedule, saying the Cabinet Office report was “issued in error” and had been withdrawn, before saying it was correct after all.Hancock, the health secretary, told Sky News: “My plan is that we should be able to offer the vaccine to everybody in categories 1 to 9 – that’s all the over-50s – by May,” adding that “lots of things have got to go right to hit that goal”, especially continued supply of vaccines.Confirmation of the timetable prompted immediate demands from some Conservative MPs for an accelerated schedule to end England’s lockdown.Mark Harper, the former chief whip who chairs the Covid Recovery Group, which groups together about 70 Tory backbenchers, said if the first vaccination phase was completed by May, it would be “almost impossible to justify having any restrictions in place at all by that point”.“Once the top four risk groups have been vaccinated by 15 February, and protected by 8 March, the government must start easing the restrictions,” Harper said, adding that ministers should also look at fully reopening schools before March.But Hancock urged caution, pointing to the fact that more than 30,000 people were still in UK hospitals with Covid, and calling that “far, far too many”.Asked about a rapid easing of lockdown, he said: “It’s still too early to say,” adding: “I know there’s good news out there, but we still have very serious problems that we’ve got to get through.”While the expected timetable for people to be offered vaccinations is of intense interest to the public, Downing Street had been wary of committing to schedules beyond the target of offering first vaccinations to all older care home residents and staff by the end of January – which was largely met – and to have done the same for the first four most vulnerable groups, as far as those aged 70-plus and clinically extremely vulnerable people, by mid-February.One reason for caution was the sense inside No 10 that Boris Johnson has previously overpromised in terms of timetables for a return to more normal life.Another caveat is that while the current speed of vaccinations is sufficiently fast to meet the May deadline – more than 2.5m doses have been delivered in both of the last two weeks – this is dependent on a continued supply of vaccines.The ambiguity created some confusion, with Downing Street repeatedly declining over recent days to specify a deadline. The inclusion of May in the elections plan appeared to catch No 10 off guard. Johnson’s deputy spokesperson initially said of the document: “This was issued in error, and I believe the Cabinet Office have now withdrawn this.”Several minutes later, he corrected himself, saying: “It isn’t actually being withdrawn.” He then conceded: “The Cabinet Office document is correct – what it says is correct – and the prime minister will set out more details on 15 February.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66a3d20665244ca007f86de150b3b90c3d7e9f8a/0_100_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=fd11e9a6241ae4aea46b1d887638c1bd","title":"new zealands waitangi day 2021 celebrations in pictures","story":"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern helps cook breakfast on the national holiday, which celebrates the signing of the treaty of Waitangi on 6 February 1840 by Māori chiefs and the British Crown"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4dbe23ab146b98273f5d7ed3930741cbb7dcfa6/0_114_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40b804fde428d528bb8df0877f171a5d","title":"coronavirus live news greece astrazeneca vaccine under 65s melbourne lebanon covid 19 uk europe","story":"Greece becomes latest EU nation to limit vaccine Israel, Lebanon ease lockdowns all contacts of Melbourne hotel quarantine worker, who contracted UK strain and put Australian Open at risk, test negative. Follow liveThe Trump administration’s unprecedented string of 13 executions in Indiana may have spread Covid-19 at significant levels, AP reports. Records obtained by The Associated Press show employees at the Indiana prison complex where the 13 executions were carried out over six months had contact with inmates and other people infected with the coronavirus, but were able to refuse testing and declined to participate in contact tracing efforts and were still permitted to return to their work assignments.Other staff members, including those brought in to help with executions, also spread tips to their colleagues about how they could avoid quarantines and skirt public health guidance from the federal government and Indiana health officials.The executions at the end of Donald Trump’s presidency, completed in a short window over a few weeks, likely acted as a superspreader event, according to the records reviewed by AP. It was something health experts warned could happen when the Justice Department insisted on resuming executions during a pandemic.It’s impossible to know precisely who introduced the infections and how they started to spread, in part because prisons officials didn’t consistently do contact tracing and haven’t been fully transparent about the number of cases. But medical experts say it’s likely the executioners and support staff, many of whom traveled from prisons in other states with their own virus outbreaks, triggered or contributed both in the Terre Haute penitentiary and beyond the prison walls.New York State is expanding eligibility criteria for its vaccination program beyond healthcare workers and aged care residents. It will now begin allowing people with some chronic health conditions that put them at greater risk of severe illness to be vaccinated, the New York Times reports. The United States is currently vaccinating 1.3m people per day. In Mexico, Reuters reports on a remarkable team of public health workers, going door-to-door in one of the capital’s poorest districts to offer hope for families. The virus is currently tearing through Mexico. The nation has recorded 1.9m cases and 164,000 deaths. Now, a team of 30 travelling public health workers is engaged in one of the country’s only outreach efforts in Iztapalapa, home to some of the city’s most densely-packed suburbs. They travel door to door in Mexico City, identifying the sick and organising testing. The local public health program, one of the only such outreach efforts in the city, also lends dozens of oxygen concentrators plus still more refillable metal tanks to those receiving treatment at home.The outreach comes at a time when the rate of vaccinations in Mexico has slowed to a trickle as the country copes with delays from vaccine makers, and the government’s official death tally adds more than 1,000 fatalities daily, likely a significant undercount.Cases to date total over 1.9 million, with 164,290 deaths.Enrique Ruiz, the doctor in charge of the program, stresses that the goal is to quickly identify sick residents via mobile testing sites that can begin to bring the outbreak under control.“If we detect any symptoms, we invite them to come get tested right away.” In Australia, recent debate has been focused on the plight of thousands of citizens stranded overseas. The problem has been exacerbated by a lack of quarantine places.The government has signalled it will increase capacity at the quarantine facility at Howard Springs in the Northern Territory. But experts on Saturday called for a national quarantine plan, and the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, spoke to the media today, urging the government to do more:This is quite clearly in the constitution, the commonwealth responsibility, and they should be working constructively with the states on real solutions, working with premier Palaszczuk and other state premiers to make sure that we keep Queenslanders, and indeed all Australians, safe. His shadow cities minister, Andrew Giles, made similar comments, telling the ABC:Instead of blaming people for not coming home back in March, the Morison government should take responsibility for getting people home. It was in September that the prime minister promised that everyone would be home by Christmas, we’ve still got 40,000 people trapped overseas, many of whom are in really desperate and vulnerable circumstances and the government that’s still not doing enough to get people home. I guess when it comes to quarantine, I’m deeply frustrated and indeed deeply angry that we’ve got a national government that’s not upholding its constitutional responsibility. Just today in the Age we’ve got a number of prominent epidemiologists calling for a national quarantine plan to address precisely these issues. This should have happened a long time ago. And the government’s got to get on with it rather than continuing to hide behind the states.On Friday, the federal, state and territory governments agreed to increase the cap on international passenger arrivals from mid-February. But people will still need to go through hotel quarantine, even with a vaccine. In the United States, the supreme court has told California it cannot enforce a ban on church services due to Covid-19. Thanks to Graham Readfearn for taking us through the latest developments. Let’s go to South Korea, momentarily, where the government has announced an easing of curfews on more than 500,000 restaurants and other businesses outside Seoul. The easing of restrictions allows the venues to stay open an hour later, Reuters reports.The South Korean government has faced a backlash over its tough social distancing rules. It had previously relied on aggressive testing and tracing to tackle earlier waves, without the need for widespread lockdowns. The restrictions had pushed businesses to the brink.Hundreds of restaurant and cafe owners across the country have complained about the impact of the bans on their businesses.The new announcement means they can stay open until 10pm, vice health minister Kang Do-tae told a briefing.He said anyone who flouted the new rules would be ordered to close for two weeks. South Korea is about to mark the Lunar New Year holiday, when tens of millions of Koreans travel to be with families. But the government is pleading with them to stay home, citing the risk of another surge in cases. Authorities are maintinaing a ban on private gatherings of more than four people. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency reported 393 daily new COVID-19 cases on Friday. That brings total infections reported in South Korea to 80,524, with a death toll of 1,464.I’m going to handover now to my very excellent colleague Christopher Knaus who will guide you through the next few hours of live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic.Wash your hands and don’t touch your face. And wear a mask.My colleague Helen Livingstone has sent this update on a new community case of coronavirus reported from New Zealand earlier today.New Zealand’s director of public health, Dr Caroline McElnay, has told reporters the person had been staying at Auckland’s Pullman Hotel on the same floor as other confirmed cases. But she said it’s not yet clear how the person caught the virus.All of the hotel’s recent guests have been asked to self-isolate at home for five days after leaving and McElnay said Saturday’s case was picked up on the fifth day of the person’s self-isolation.The two close contacts with whom they were living have tested negative and McElnay said the positive case had told the Ministry of Health they had been isolating separately in their home in Hamilton, in the North Island, and had worn a mask in communal areas.The person is the fourth to have tested positive after leaving the hotel since last month, while a fifth person caught it from one of the returnees.Here’s our full report on the new case.WA’s health minister, Roger Cook, has been giving details about the vaccination roll-out in the state, which will focus first on people exposed to the “greatest potential threat” - overseas arrivals.He has told reporters the state expects the first batch of about 10,000 Pfizer vaccines to arrive around 22 February. Cook listed those who would be first in line would include hotel quarantine workers - including hotel staff, police and security - and airport staff and others who had face-to-face contact with travellers.People involved with transporting overseas travellers, some sea port staff, and emergency and ward staff at Fiona Stanley and Royal Perth hospitals would also be among the first in line.The Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan is speaking to reporters and has just confirmed there have been no new cases overnight in WA.So that’s a full donut day for Australia.Western Australia’s snap five-day lockdown centred on Perth was lifted at 6pm on Friday.The lockdown started last Sunday after a security guard at a quarantine hotel tested positive for the UK variant.We’re still waiting for WA to report their figures for today, but people are out and about. The Perth and Peel regions have a “post-lockdown phase” with some restrictions, including mandatory mask wearing when in public.Is Australia about to confirm a donut day, where we get a big fat 0 for cases of coronavirus detected in the community?So far today Queensland, South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria have all reported their latest 24-hour figures, and have all returned donuts.We wouldn’t expect any positive community cases from Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory.Can Western Australia bring it home?China has recorded its lowest number of daily cases on the mainland since 17 December 2020, according to the national health authority.Reuters is reporting that China recorded 12 new cases on 5 February, down from 20 the previous day:The National Health Commission, in a statement, said four of the new cases were locally transmitted, including three in the north-eastern border province of Heilongjiang and one in neighbouring Jilin.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China now stands at 89,681, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,636. We appear to be in a very slight lull (it’s all relative) so it’s a good chance to summarise what’s happened in the last few hours.On we go. Do you know the difference between the South African variant of the coronavirus and the Brazilian strain?’s science correspondent Nicola Davis has this detailed explainer on variants, what they are, how they behave and what it could mean for vaccines.The Kent variant described here – B117 – is known in Australia as the UK variant, and is the same strain that prompted a snap three-day lockdown in Brisbane (where I live) in early January.While we’re thinking about vaccines, there are some late-stage trial results emerging for another Chinese-developed effort, CoronaVac.Trial results suggest it’s good at keeping people out of hospital, but not as effective at preventing infection.Reuters reports that trials in Brazil and Turkey with 12,396 people show the vaccine, from Sinovac Biotech, stopped all users from being hospitalised and dying:In Mexico, the government has announced the Chinese manufacturer of the CanSino coronavirus vaccine has submitted paperwork to have the single-shot vaccine approved.AP reports that Mexico is running out of vaccines. CanSino has carried out trials with more than 14,00 volunteers enrolled, but the results haven’t been revealed yet:Foreign relations secretary Marcelo Ebrard wrote that the vaccine had been “applied successfully” in the trials, but did not release specific data.Mexico has been promised 8m doses of the CanSino vaccine by March, and is particularly upbeat about the Chinese shot because it is relatively easy to handle, and will be finished and bottled at a plant in Mexico.Mexico registered 13,757 confirmed infections on Thursday, to reach 1.89 million so far. There were 1,682 deaths confirmed on Thursday, for a total of almost 163,000.Drawing your eyes to an investigation into attempts by social media companies to reduce the damage being caused by the spread of coronavirus misinformation.The journalistic investigation found hundreds of pages with more than 40 million collective followers were spreading misinformation while utilising Facebook’s fundraising tools.Not-for-profit First Draft has this useful summary of The Bureau of Investigative Journalism’s project that examined how Facebook and Twitter were doing. Last year, social media companies made significant strides in ridding their platforms of Covid-19 misinformation. Both Facebook and Twitter committed to the principle that “no user or company should directly profit from Covid-19 vaccine misdisinformation.” But a recent investigation by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism has found otherwise. At least 430 misinformation-generating Facebook pages – including more than 20 verified with Facebook’s “blue tick” with a collective 45 million followers – were found to directly use Facebook’s fundraising tools, either through contributions from followers or sales of merchandise. “The Bureau’s findings suggest Facebook has failed to adequately implement this agreement and appropriately enforce its own policies,” authors Jasper Jackson and Alexandra Heal noted. Although Facebook has since taken action to remove the misleading content, many Pages remain live.In that Victorian press conference we reported on earlier, some changes to hotel quarantine were announced after two hotel workers tested positive to Covid-19 in recent weeks. AAP reports:Victoria will review airflow within quarantine hotels and change mask policies for staff as it seeks to avoid a repeat of two suspected Covid-19 leaks.Emergency services minister Lisa Neville, overseeing the revamped program, announced a ventilation review of all hotels within the system was under way.“We don’t think at this stage this is about ventilation, but again we’re not leaving any stone unturned,” she told reporters on Saturday.From Thursday night, hotel quarantine staff are also required to wear a face shield and surgical mask. Neville said the change was based on updated advice from infection prevention control experts, with hotel quarantine workers previously wearing just N-95 masks.They will still don the more protective N-95 mask along with a face shield for encounters with infectious guests and when entering rooms for medical emergencies. In addition, hotel quarantine organisers have put “buffers” between family groups and other guests from Wednesday, resulting in 140 rooms being taken out of the system. Food delivery times are also being staggered, reducing the risk of people opening doors at the same time. The moves follow a case of suspected Covid-19 transmission among two separate groups of guests at Melbourne’s Park Royal Hotel, and a worker at the Grand Hyatt testing positive to the virus."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Ireland, North and South, would benefit by copying best British policiesYoung people seeking to unblock barriers to participation and engagement on climatePush for environmental regulations has alienated voters in the American Midwest"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4477453.1612558834!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"explainer why is the rollout of covid 19 vaccines so complicated","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A member of the Cold Chain warehouse operations team dispensing thawed vials of the PfizerBioNtech Covid-19 vaccine from their boxes.  Photograph: Alan Betson The decision to favour the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines for the over-70s over the AstraZeneca jab makes the rollout of the vaccination programme to this next priority group in the vaccine queue more complicated. This is because the Pfizer and Moderna jabs require more complex handling.Why are there difficulties around the rollout of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines?These are the vaccines preferred by the State for the over-70s because of the proven data around their effectiveness in older people. The Pfizer vaccine is more complicated to handle but the State is getting roughly four times more of those than the Moderna jabs over the coming weeks.What’s so complicated about it?The Pfizer vaccine is highly effective at preventing people getting seriously ill if they contract Covid-19, but managing, transporting, storing and administering the doses is more complicated and labour intensive.The problem is that it must be stored at ultra-cold temperatures at between -80 and -60 degrees. It must then be transferred to vaccination sites within 12 hours and once it arrives and is defrosted, it has a limited shelf life of five days when stored in a fridge. Any hours used up transporting the vaccine at fridge temperature count against the five-day storage limit.Thawing to room temperature takes 30 minutes and once at room temperature, the vials only last another two hours. Once removed from a fridge, it must be gently inverted 10 times. It must then be diluted with 1.8ml of saline and then have 1.8ml of air removed from the vial before gently inverting the diluted vaccine 10 times again. You are not supposed to shake it.After dilution, each vial contains up to seven doses of 0.3ml of the vaccine. The diluted vaccine can be stored at room temperature but must be used within six hours. They cannot be refrozen.While being stored for those six hours, they should have minimal exposure to room light and no exposure to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light. The Pfizer vaccine gives people 95 per cent protection over two doses, 28 days apart.How is the AstraZeneca vaccine easier to manage?It can be injected by a GP or a pharmacist into a person’s arm straight out of a fridge. The first AstraZeneca vaccines, about 21,000 doses, are expected to arrive into the country this weekend, with hundreds of thousands more expected in the following weeks. The AstraZeneca vaccines, once they arrive, are expected to be used on remaining frontline healthcare workers, who are younger, so more Pfizer and Moderna vaccines would be available to the over-70s.Is the handling of the Moderna vaccine as complicated as the Pfizer vaccine?No, but the State is getting fewer Moderna vaccines.It can be stored frozen at temperatures of between -25 and -15 degrees until expiry and in a fridge for 30 days or at room temperature for 12 hours.Once the vaccine vial has been punctured, it must be used within six hours. A single dose of the vaccine is 0.5ml. Any unused or partially unused vials must be discarded. Two doses of the vaccine, 28 days apart, gives a person 94 per cent protection from serious Covid-19 illness.How are these technical requirements affecting the rollout?The Government and State health officials decided this week that Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, rather than the more easily stored AstraZeneca jab, should be given to people aged over 70 where possible. As a result the rollout plan has had to be reworked because a large part of the Government’s original plan and timetable involved older people getting the AstraZeneca vaccine.This now means GPs managing smaller numbers of people will have to go to larger practices because of the challenges of transporting the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. People will also be vaccinated at primary care centres and dedicated centres from February 15th when the over-70s start getting their jabs.The Government is considering ways of getting older people such as the over-85s to vaccination locations and whether transport needs to be provided.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has said that he is confident that 70 per cent of GPs will be able to provide the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to patients in their own surgeries.What are the difficulties in vaccinating at smaller sites?In Israel, which has the best vaccine rollout rate in the world, it was found that there were not enough people in the top priority groups to be vaccinated at some smaller localities because Pfizer’s initial specifications said that once the vials were removed from ultra-low-temperature freezers they had to be transported only in large trays containing 195 vials, or about 1,300 doses. Vaccinating at smaller sites would require repackaging vaccines in very low-temperature fridges for distribution in smaller numbers at more remote sites, which is what happened in Israel. In other words, the more people at a vaccination location, the easier it is to administer the Pfizer vaccines.So how many vaccines are needed for this next group to be vaccinated?There are about 480,000 people over the age of 70 who need to be vaccinated requiring 960,000 doses.Supplies vary and the HSE has said that more doses could become available but under rough estimates the State expects 1.2 million vaccine doses by the end of March, including 800,000 Pfizer and Moderna jabs. That means there is expected to be a shortfall of at least 160,000 doses for the over-70s if the target completion date for that group at the end of March is to be met.In other words, vaccinating the population’s next group, the over-70s, will take longer than expected. All this will make getting more people vaccinated more quickly all the more difficult.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4477391.1612553931!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"amazon offered taoiseach help with ireland s vaccination rollout","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAlmost two months after Amazon  contacted Mr Martin, the Government has not said whether it will be seeking its help.

The letter was shared with the HSE, and an acknowledgement was issued by the task force in December.Asked whether its offer was to provide support free of charge or not, an Amazon spokesman said: “From the very start of this crisis Amazon and AWS have offered to help the Irish Government, and governments around the world, wherever we can.

There is no doubt that the past 12 months have been replete with strategic mistakes and gaffes, and the EU would be foolish not to take account of that. Photograph:  Olivier HosletEPAThe braying of the Tory press in Britain has become deafening the malicious chortling of the Brexit-supporting newspapers and politician growing to a crescendo as the European Union’s bungling drowned out the news of 100,000 British deaths.Humiliation, boomed the Daily Mail. Disaster, screeched the Daily . Total disaster, insisted the .Even Irish officials, comrades in arms of the Brussels bureaucrats and co-residents in the Brexit trenches with the Brussels bureaucrats shrug and admit it: the EU is having a dreadful pandemic.That perception was heightened by the disastrous attempt by the European Commission to use emergency provisions to block vaccines from entering Northern Ireland last week. Though quickly abandoned, the commission’s move has inflamed unionist opinion and put the EU on the defensive politically in a way not seen throughout the whole Brexit process.Even supporters of the EU – and strong support for the EU is the default position among most of the Irish political and governing class – acknowledge that the past year has been something of an annus horribilis for the bloc.But sometimes a snappy judgment that fits into a tabloid headline is not the whole story the truth is rather more complex.While the EU’s management of its vaccine supply has been slow and cumbersome compared to both the United States and the United Kingdom, and its attempt to institute a common travel framework has ended in shreds, the EU has also effectively underwritten the vast deficit spending that has sustained governments and societies for much of the past year. The EU’s handling of the pandemic has had plenty of low points but critics tend to ignore the things it got right.The crisis arrivesItaly was the canary in the coal mine: the first clusters were detected in late February of last year, followed quickly by the first deaths, and then the first lockdowns. At the same time, travellers from other parts of Europe were still departing for ski vacations in the Italian Alps.The gravity of the situation became brutally clear on March 6th, when Italy’s professional association of anaesthesiologists issued guidance to health workers on how to pick which patients to save when there was not enough equipment or doctors to go around.Within days, Austria had closed its border with Italy, followed by a cascade of similar measures by the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Denmark, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, and Spain.The unravelling of freedom of movement, which left EU citizens stranded as they attempted to commute cross-border to work or return home from abroad, gave the commission its first challenge. But the power of the commission to intervene was severely constrained. Health and borders are purely national powers, meaning that up until that point it was unclear how the EU could collectively respond to the pandemic. Keeping truck routes from snarling up and cross-border lives from being disrupted was the first issue on which EU national governments looked up from firefighting the burgeoning pandemic emergency at home, and began to co-operate.But soon member states were pitted against each other in a mad scramble for PPE. The competition was rancorous: Germany slapped export controls on equipment including ventilators, causing uproar in Italy. On both travel and medical equipment, agreement was reached to lift curbs within the EU at the price of enforcing them on the rest of the world. It was a shaky start, but enough to avert disaster.MoneyThe next steps were financial, and more assured. The commission suspended the usual budget rules to give member states a free rein to borrow and spend. The European Central Bank launched a massive emergency bond-buying programme to keep debt cheap. And the commission opened its cheque book, offering cheap loans to member states to pay for unemployment support programmes, while pushing out money in funding for medical research, health systems, and cheap business loans.This was a precursor to the truly ground-breaking moves of the summer. First, a pledging initiative that raised €15.9 billion “to help develop and ensure equitable access to coronavirus vaccines, tests and treatments”. Then, a move previously considered unthinkable: joint borrowing, to the tune of €750 billion, to be pushed out to member states in a mix of grants and loans to counteract the economic impact of the pandemic.The fact that Italian borrowing costs have remained steady, averting the prospect of the feared repeat of the euro zone debt crisis, is widely seen as proof of the success of these measures.But the pandemic also drew the commission into taking on new roles in unfamiliar areas, and in these its record has been less positive.In April 2020, commission president Ursula von der Leyen announced “it is time to look ahead and to focus on protecting livelihoods”, launching a plan aimed to co-ordinate EU-wide lifting of coronavirus containment measures. Health commissioner Stella Kyriakides announced that the “only way” was “to learn to live with this virus”.The following month, the commission launched a plan to “reboot tourism” and “to allow people to take holidays and catch up with their friends and families”. Both were driven by economic concerns, particularly a clamour from airlines, the hospitality industry and tourism-dependent member states.The short-sightedness is now apparent. A strain of Covid-19 that first emerged among Spanish farm workers in June accounted for 60 per cent of all cases in Ireland and 80 per cent of those in the UK by October, an international team of scientists found, indicating that holiday travel had fuelled the second wave that swept the continent, forcing renewed school closures and lockdowns in autumn.Healthcare is a “national competence”, and member states have never successfully co-ordinated on their health policy responses to the pandemic. They listened to the commission, but when cases started to rise, they turned inward. They have different expert advice, different national circumstances, and a different balance of power between vying interests. In some member states health policy is not even nationally coherent, as it is under the control of regional powers. In France, quarantine lasts seven days: in most places, it is 10 or 14. Travel measures still vary across the continent. The EU’s attempt to institute a common “traffic-light” framework in the summer never succeeded in achieving its aim of a common EU-wide travel policy.VaccinesThe global race for vaccines began almost as soon as the pandemic. Back in March, then-US president Donald Trump was offering cash to German biotech company CureVac to relocate to the US and exclusively produce its Covid-19 vaccine candidate there.By April, Germany and France were working together on acquiring vaccines, a club soon joined by the Netherlands and Italy. Alarmed, smaller EU countries demanded the commission step in. A deal was done: the 27 would negotiate as a bloc, but the original four would each have a member on the seven-strong joint vaccine negotiating team, along with Portugal, Spain, and Poland. They set out to pick the most promising candidates out of roughly 150 candidate vaccines, based on promising early data and ability to manufacture at scale, and sign deals to lock down early supplies.A key sticking point in the talks was liability. Pharmaceutical companies are used to being shielded from legal liability in the US if there are problems with a product made in an emergency. The joint EU team stuck out for the drugmakers to accept liability. The haggling prolonged negotiations.The first contract was signed with AstraZeneca, in August, for up to 400 million doses of the vaccine developed with Oxford University in exchange for €336 million to pay for vaccine development and advance production, according to commission officials. This vaccine was cheap, produced at cost, and easy to roll out, not requiring deep-freeze storage. Deals with Sanofi for 300 million doses, and Johnson \u0026amp Johnson for 400 million doses soon followed.But the next candidate, BioNTech-Pfizer, was a harder sell with member states: more expensive and tricky to roll out, requiring deep freeze storage. It was also based on a less familiar technology.Impatient, Germany began doing its own deals on the side with BioNTech and CureVac, both homegrown companies, in September. The commission closed three deals for the pricier mRNA vaccines in November, with CureVac (405 million doses), Moderna (160 million doses), and BioNTech-Pfizer (300 million doses, later doubled).It is hard to find an Irish politician or official who believes the country would have been better off negotiating independently with the pharmaceutical companies. “The alternative would have been catastrophic, a bidding war between member states,” said Ciarán Cuffe, the Green MEP. This may be true, but the slow pace of the vaccine programme attests to one of the EU’s most basic difficulties: agreeing anything between 27 parties takes time. And in a vaccination programme, speed is of the essence.Meanwhile, Israel, the UK and the US speeded up the rollout of their vaccination programmes as their national regulators granted emergency approval for their use. Technically, any EU member state could have done the same, though governments would have been on the hook for liability if anything went wrong.Instead, the EU took the normal route of regulatory approval for the entire bloc at once through the European Medicines Agency, a more rigorous process that requires more evidence of safety and efficacy. Given high rates of vaccine scepticism on the continent, this was also widely seen as the wisest way forward.There are plenty of questions however about the choice of which vaccines to purchase, when and in what quantities. The delay in finalising a deal with BioNTech-Pfizer is viewed poorly.“In defence of the commission, the members states had to agree to every step of the procurement,” Andrews said. “We are Europeanising failure and nationalising success at every point.”War with AstraZenecaThe subsequent delay in rolling out shots to citizens – at least in comparison with the UK and US – has coincided with a bad patch of the pandemic, particularly in Ireland. Faced with rising frustration from member states that were demanding more doses faster, and public opinion souring, the commission made a bid to seize control in the past fortnight. It has made an astonishing mess of it.AstraZeneca’s announcement in January that it could deliver only 31 million doses to the EU by April was a shock to the commission, which had initially expected north of 100 million, and later 80 million. In response, the commission went on the offensive, suggesting that doses made in the EU had been unjustly shipped elsewhere and declaring it would publish its contract with the pharmaceutical company to show that it was in breach.While AstraZeneca presented doses from British factories as being intended for Britain, and vice versa for the EU, the commission said four factories including two in the UK were named in its contract as sources of supply. The initial doses rolled out in the UK had also been made in the Netherlands and Germany.In a power play, last week the commission announced it would require all pharmaceutical companies to declare what vaccines they were exporting from the EU and where. At the strong demand of France and Germany, this proposal was hardened into an export control regulation. Not only would pharmaceutical companies have to declare their exports, but they would have to receive permission from national governments to go ahead with them. If the doses were deemed to be contractually owed to the EU, they could refuse permission to export.At some point, Northern Ireland’s special post-Brexit arrangements were identified as a potential loophole to the controls in theory, the North could be a backdoor for vaccine exports to Britain. Article 16 was introduced into the text to allow member states to refuse permission for vaccine exports if they were deemed to be moving through Northern Ireland en route to Britain. When the proposed regulation was published, it kicked off a political storm that continues to rage through Belfast, London and Dublin. It was, Irish officials – generally the EU’s staunchest allies – said, the biggest mistake they could remember the commission making. It has deeply undermined von der Leyen. “The EU has been damaged,” says one Irish official. “A lot of this will come to rest on VDL. She’s not in danger. But she is damaged.”LessonsThis is a particularly bad point for the EU in the pandemic. But by the summer, more than 400 million doses of EU-sourced vaccines are expected to have been administered to citizens, and life will have returned, if not to normal, then to a more congenial post-lockdown state.But there is no doubt that the past 12 months have been replete with strategic mistakes and gaffes, and the EU would be foolish not to take account of that.What messages can the EU learn? One is that it must constantly push for quicker decision-making. Humility is another lesson it should learn from British successes on the vaccine. Though it no longer matters what the British newspapers think let them gloat. The fact is on the most important measures – deaths from the virus – the UK has been one of the worst performers in the world. The performance of EU countries varies widely. That’s why much of the UK bombast is overblown: the EU is not responsible for the management of the pandemic in inidual countries.Perhaps most importantly, the pandemic is a lesson to the EU to stick to the things it’s good at. The pandemic has confirmed that while the EU is an economic superpower, it is very much not a superpower of practical government.The current bout of flagellation will pass. Brussels will get over it. “There’s no doubt that the EU is pretty chastened,” says one Irish diplomat. “But it won’t remain so for ever.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4477527.1612573007!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"large scale covid vaccination clinics to be set up in dublin cork galway for over 70s","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDetails of the new plan have been worked out following talks between the HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation. Photograph: Sebastian Gollnowdpa via APA number of large-scale vaccination clinics are to be established in Dublin, Cork and Galway under new plans for administering the Covid-19 vaccine to those over the age of 70.Under the new plans the first of these clinics will be set up at Dublin City University (DCU) where patients attached to 121 practices across the capital will receive the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine.Details of the new plan have been worked out following talks between the HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO).However most patients over the age of 70 will still receive the Covid vaccine from their own family doctor practice.In a bulletin to its members on Friday night, seen by The , the IMO said some 72,000 people over 85 will be first to be vaccinated, the first of 490,000 over 70s around the State. The over 85s are to be vaccinated in three week-long slots, starting on February 15th “during which time the objective is to vaccinate patients over 85 and then continue on with the age schedule”.‘Buddying up’ systemPatients will all receive two doses of either Pfizer or Moderna. The vast majority of patients will be vaccinated in their own GP practice – some 70 per cent of GP practices will see their patients vaccinated on site – with deliveries through the HSE’s cold chain to all practices with more that 200 over 70s.Those practices will need to have a registration area, a refrigeration area – which will double as an area for vaccines to be reconstituted – and a vaccination area and an observation area. These will be managed by GPs, admin staff and nurses.However, for practices with fewer than 200 over 70s – some 400 practices – vaccinations will take place on two pathways. The first will be through GP vaccination clinics, and the second pathway is through a “buddying up” system.The vaccination clinics in urban centres will be at agreed locations – among the first of these will be in DCU, where 121 practices will come together to run clinics. Booking, registration and payment will happen through GPs own practices – with doctors told “the only change is the venue at which the patient will receive the vaccine”.The clinics will operate “in the agreed age phases until all these patients are vaccinated and at the 28 day intervals”. They will run at the weekend.The “buddying up system”, outside urban centres, will also involve practices with fewer than 200 patients over 70, who will be paired with a larger practice in their area. Patients from smaller practices will attend the larger practice, but will be dealt with by their GP and his or her staff.Indemnity arrangementsIn order to facilitate planning, GPs will be asked to identify and register the patients over 70, in each age cohort, and invite them for vaccination at the relevant venue – either their own practice, a vaccine clinic, or a “buddied up” practice.Once that process is complete, the order of vaccines can be placed and syringes, needles and vaccine cards will be delivered. GPs will have a delivery every two weeks.According to the IMO, indemnity arrangements will cover GPs and practice nurses. Members were told the hope is that all GPs and practice nurses will be vaccinated prior to the programme beginning – those not vaccinated will be facilitated through acute hospitals.They will be given the AstraZeneca vaccine – except where they have been given a different vaccine first, in which case the same will be given in a second dose.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4477366.1612551135!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no one in government has appetite to push back against holohan","story":"The decision to recommend only a certain type of Covid-19 vaccine for people over the age of 70 has thrown the State’s carefully-calibrated inoculation plan up in the air and revealed once again the dominant role of chief medical officer Tony Holohan.Just over a week ago, on January 29th, the European Commission granted conditional marketing authorisation for the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for over-18s, based on a recommendation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA).The EMA scientific experts said the vaccine could be used in older adults, despite most participants in AstraZeneca’s studies being aged between 18 and 55. Protection could be expected, they believed, “given that an immune response had been seen in this age group and based on experience with other vaccines”.On the same day, Dr Holohan asked the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) to look at the European advice and specifically address the issue of using the vaccine in older adults.The group immediately held a wide-ranging discussion. In their deliberations, they looked at the risks of disease and the benefits afforded by the vaccines. They discussed vaccine safety, efficacy, age-specific vaccine data and the likely length of time between injection and protection from Covid-19.The NIAC team also talked about the potential impact on confidence and trust in the vaccination programme, something which has occupied minds in Government Buildings since the national campaign kicked off.Wasting no time in their deliberations, the NIAC provided their advice to Dr Holohan on Monday. The next day, the chief medical officer sent this to the Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly along with his own recommendations.Political sources have conceded that what NIAC recommended was different to what Dr Holohan would himself recommend.The advisory group said “any currently authorised Covid-19 vaccine can be given to adults of all ages, including those aged 70 and older”. Crucially, they said the vaccination of those aged 70 and older “should not be delayed”.“Where practicable and timely, those aged 70 and older should be given an mRNA vaccine.” PfizerBioNTech and Moderna are mRNA vaccines.This is in contrast to Dr Holohan’s advice that “due to superior efficacy demonstrated by mRNA vaccines, including in older persons (albeit the data is limited) and in recognition of their particular vulnerability in terms of their increased risk of death and serious disease if they contract SARS- CoV-2, it is recommended that mRNA vaccines be administered to all those over 70 years in order to provide the highest level of protection available to this population”.There was another element to his recommendations that would prove to be important. He told the Minister that “assurance should be provided by the HSE that vaccine supplies will be sufficient to progress this important objective in a timely fashion”.For some in the Department of Health, the plan seemed quite simple by Wednesday: both the Minister and Dr Holohan would endorse the recommendations from NIAC.But that evening, alarm bells were sounding in the Department of the Taoiseach. A number of sources who spoke to The  said the issues were as follows: there were “more questions than answers”, there was not enough detail on what the HSE response would be, and there was that matter of how Dr Holohan “went further” than the advisory group.The idea of delaying vaccinations for the over-70s at a time when the NIAC said this should not happen also rankled.Programme recastGiven the importance of maintaining trust in the vaccination programme, officials in the Taoiseach’s department believed there was little to no choice but to recast the vaccination programme so that only the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, known as mRNA vaccines, would be given to those over 70.Those close to Mr Donnelly say he was in close alignment with the chief medical officer on the issue. Those helping to co-ordinate the pandemic response 500 metres away in Merrion Street were aware this was a sizeable bump in the road and would result in much scrambling, both in the HSE and for the high-level vaccine task force.Despite this, there was no public questioning of the chief medical officer despite the ramifications. There was instead a widespread feeling that after the events of Christmas, pretty much no one in Government had the appetite to push back against Dr Holohan.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4477451.1612557364!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"una ring the contents of the letter were terrifying","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Una Ring has waived her right to anonymity to encourage others in similar situations to come forward. Photograph: Daragh Mc SweeneyCork Courts LimitedAfter months of harassment and threats from a former colleague, Una Ring went to bed on a miserable Co Cork night last July fully dressed, suspecting her stalker might try to take advantage of the rotten weather.The conditions, she recalled, were “so bad I remember saying to a friend of mine that it might the type of night that would draw him out because he wouldn’t think anyone else would be out in such weather, so I went to bed fully dressed that night.“I woke about 2am and I couldn’t get back to sleep, so I was actually awake and heard muffled voices and I heard metal hitting concrete because he had thrown away the crowbar. I got up and went into the bedroom next door and we watched from there, so we saw the whole thing unfold.”James Steele (52), who threatened to break into Ms Ring’s house in Youghal and rape her and her daughter if she did not agree to sleep with him, was jailed on Thursday for five years.He was caught by gardaí with a crowbar, a rope, duct tape and a sex toy outside Ms Ring’s home in the early hours of July 27th. Ms Ring, a mother of two, waived her right to anonymity to encourage others in similar situations to come forward as she spoke about her experience following his jailing.Speaking to The  on Friday, she said she had been terrified a fortnight before Steele was caught when she discovered a letter on her car windscreen containing two condoms and sexually suggestive comments, which concluded “I am watching you”.“I found that letter terrifying ,” she said. “He had painted my car tyres and painted my window with noughts and crosses but that was sort of childish so part of me thought it might be some bored teenager in the estate, but the letter was very frightening.CCTV installation“It was at that point that the gardaí advised me to put in CCTV and luckily a friend of my brother was able to install it that night, so that was in place when he came back a week later on the night of July 23rd and left another letter on the windscreen of my car.“The contents of the letter were again terrifying but the fact that he was captured on CCTV and we were able to confirm that it was him was kind of a relief.”She said gardaí began patrolling the estate from the time she received the first letter. After the second letter was found, gardaí put a surveillance operation in place and were there four nights later when her stalker arrived.Ms Ring said she felt as if “a huge weight had been lifted” when Steele was arrested.“You had been living on your nerves for so long and then the adrenalin kicks in. I wouldn’t say I was as high as a kite, but I was definitely ecstatic and there was this huge sense of relief,” she said, adding that she “went cold” when she realised Steele had a crowbar and other items and was “intent on acting out what he had threatened”.Return to normalityNow trying to return to some sort of normality after the stress of the court case and a round of media interviews, Ms Ring has found time to reflect on what Steele’s family must now be going through.“This isn’t about him. He has a wife and family who did nothing wrong. As a mother myself, I would hate for my kids to go through something like this,” she said. “What we went through is completely separate but to be honest I think what they are going to be going through is nearly worse.”Ms Ring said the victims in these situations get support and sympathy whereas “the perpetrator’s family are kind of tarnished”.“ I’m not over this yet but my side of it is done whereas their side is only starting in one sense, so I just want people to be kind to them because they are probably going through worse than I am now.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4477514.1612562375!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord seanad byelection talk puts covid in the ha penny place","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIan Marshall, the former president of the Ulster Farmers’ Union and Leo Varadkar’s nominee to the Upper House in 2016, has thrown his hat in the ring for the Agriculture panel.  Photograph: Patrick BolgerBloombergThe big question this week in the virtual corridors of power was: why aren’t we hearing more about Covid-19 on radio and television and why are the newspapers ignoring it?Why is nobody talking about vaccines? What about the latest figures?Is there not a doctor or a professor anywhere who might be persuaded to say something? Why the silence on overseas travel and mandatory quarantine? Where are the experts to tell us about our mental health? Why oh why can’t someone be found to tell us how to cookmind the dogstay sober during the pandemic?All we hear, 247, is people banging on about the Seanad byelections. Don’t mind telling you that I’ve got to the stage now where I’m ing at the radio to turn it off the minute I hear someone say they’re going to discuss the prospects for the Industrial and Commercial panel with a leading pundit from the University of Life.But what can you do?As everyone knows, there are two vacancies arising from the resignations in September and October of Fine Gael’s Michael D’Arcy from the Agriculture panel and Sinn Féin’s Elisha McCallion from the aforementioned widely talked-about Industrial and Commercial panel.The election process is horrendously complicated, even though the electorate only comprises the membership of the Dáil and Seanad. The race is under way now that two Senators (Independent Victor Boyhan in Darcy’s case and Sinn Féin’s Niall Ó Donnghaile in McCallion’s) have moved motions calling for the clerk of the Upper House to notify the Minister to get his skates on and name the election date.Darragh O’Brien is the Minister in question. He’s a fast mover, is the Minister for Local Government. We asked his spokesperson on Friday when the election will take place.“No date set yet” and they “don’t know yet when one will be set”.There is a gentlemen’s agreement between the two main Government parties to vy up the seats. If all Government TDs and Senators vote as instructed, their candidates will win. But it’s a private vote.Fianna Fáil has dibs on the Industrial and Commercial seat, with 13 candidates hoping to win the nomination. Ballot papers went out this weekend and a resultcandidate is expected on Tuesday night.Fine Gael has dibs on the Agriculture panel and the well-regarded former senator Maria Byrne, from Limerick, is the party’s candidate. On the numbers, she should win. But as the shock result in last year’s vote for Leas-Cheann Comhairle showed, Government candidate Fergus O’Dowd lost to Catherine Connolly when an estimated 15 Government TDs defied instructions in the secret vote.The problem for Maria Byrne is that Ian Marshall, the former president of the Ulster Farmers’ Union and Leo Varadkar’s nominee to the Upper House in 2016, has thrown his hat in the ring.Marshall, who is from a unionist background, wrote this week to all Oireachtas members seeking their support. Sinn Féin has already pledged its support for him.The Armagh man was disappointed when Micheál Martin’s new Government didn’t appoint anyone from north of the Border to the Seanad. “Any talk of a shared island is just a farce,” he said at the time. “How can you have a shared island if you only talk to yourself?”He is fighting the byelection on his record in agriculture and farming, his Seanad record and as an independent unionist voice.“This seat has become even more important now with the fallout from Brexit, the IrelandNI protocol, trade issues north, south, east and west and the ongoing impact of the global pandemic across the island.”Among his supporters is Senator Gerard Craughwell, who has accused FF and FG of a “carve-up” of the two seats. “Old habits die hard, especially when we look into the Irish political establishment.”He says the Government is not interested in putting forward candidates with expert knowledge in their vocational panels and accuses Fine Gael of nominating someone “with absolutely no interest or knowledge in agriculture to the agricultural panel”.He alleges Maria Byrne only spoke twice on farming issues during her five years in the Seanad. “Surely now more than ever we need impartial, unbiased, expert opinion in the Upper House,” argues Craughwell.“Having busted through the cronyism myself in 2014, I hope we can do it again.”Meanwhile, the Green Party has yet to decide whether to enter the field. “We haven’t decided anything. Internal discussion is only taking place on it now,” said a spokesman. Lord Mayor of Dublin Hazel Chu has been mentioned as a possible runner.If the Healy-Rae cap fits...A very serious situation developed on Wednesday morning when a Sinn Féin TD was accused of grand larceny involving the possible mugging of a fellow deputy outside the auditorium where the ridiculously distanced Health and Safety Dáil now sits.After he had spoken on his party’s motion calling for an extension of the €28 fuel allowance to all recipients of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, Mark Ward was approached by TDs from a number of parties (including his own) and accused of stealing Michael Healy-Rae’s cap.The deputy for Dublin Mid-West vociferously denied the allegations. He was, however, wearing a black flat cap on his head at the time which looked suspiciously like the one usually cemented onto the Kerry parliamentarian’s bonce.Healy-Rae, it was darkly noted, was nowhere to be seen.Furthermore, Ward delivered his televised speech while brazenly modelling said item of headgear. He cleverly tried to disguise its provenance by the addition of a small enamel Easter lily badge and a pin depicting the Clondalkin Round Tower.What was going on? Nobody, apart from MHR, has ever worn a black flat cap in the Dáil chamber before this week. He had to fight Leinster House authorities to be allowed wear it. A gentleman sporting a hat in the chamber was always viewed as a most serious contravention of the dress code. He won that permission in February 2017.A battle which has gone down in the Leinster House annals of millinery history.Exactly three years later and Mark Ward surfaces in the Convention Centre wearing the famous cap. Obviously, questions were asked.We are happy to report that the first-time TD from Clondalkin is entirely innocent of all charges.“My 14-year-old daughter Muireann cut my hair at home – it was my socially distanced Covid haircut. I wore the cap because my head was cold,” Mark tells us, having cleared his name with his colleagues. He bought it last winter and Wednesday was the first time he wore it in the Dáil chamber.He didn’t ask permission to wear it and would never have thought of doing so.“Anyway, the Healy-Raes don’t own the rights to the wearing of caps,” he added. “And also, Michael Healy-Rae is always crying that we don’t do anything past the Red Cow roundabout. I’d like him to know that the Red Cow roundabout is in my constituency and I work way beyond it.”Two Healy-Rae hats in the Dáil now?Dear God, let it not be the start of a new fashion.Humphreys outed by Leo as first-time grannyHeather Humphreys didn’t want to make a big fuss about her recent good news, so she was surprised when her phone suddenly began to hop with good wishes from her Dáil and Seanad colleagues.What she didn’t realise (having temporarily tuned out of the Zoom call) was that Leo Varadkar had just announced the glad tidings to the weekly parliamentary party meeting.“Next minute, all I could see was ‘Congratulations Granny!’ coming up on my screen.”The Minister for Social Protection and Rural and Community Development has been on cloud nine since her daughter Eva and son-in-law Seán welcomed young Arthur into the world.“He’s a lovely wee fella altogether,” says first-time grandmother Heather. “He’ll be two weeks old on Monday.”Arthur H Egan, to be precise. The “H” stands for Humphreys. “I think it was lovely to get the mother’s family name in too,” says Humphreys (nee Stewart). The Kennedys had the same idea when christening JFK.She’s not so keen on the “granny” moniker, though. “I’ve told them all, ‘You can say it twice but after three grannies, you’re dead’. I don’t want to hear it. I’m allowing them a couple of chances and then that’s it.”Due to Covid restrictions the christening will have to wait.“The way things are going I’d say he’ll be walking up to the font by the time we get over all of this. He’ll be able to jump into it himself.”And drive everyone to the church in Monaghan for the ceremony.TDs can’t keep their distanceThe strict rule on numbers allowed into the Convention Centre auditorium means parties must keep a close eye on how many TDs are inside any one time.It’s easy for people to lose concentration in the Health and Safety Dáil where, unbelievably, a mere 45 TDs out of 159 can commune briefly together in a temporary chamber which doubles as a 2,000-seat, three-storey auditorium. Those who get a golden ticket to come and talk into the void must feel very special indeed.But for all the wide open space cocooning the precious politicians, nothing can account for human behaviour. They may be rattling around like peas in a drum, but it doesn’t stop them forgetting about their masks, or conferring closely or steaming up to the Ceann Comhairle or Leas-Cheann Comhairle to vent their annoyance when they feel overlooked in the speaking list.Catherine Connolly was forced to address those storming the citadel on Wednesday. “I want to say something in relation to the Order of Business and TDs approaching me. There’s a pandemic and the closeness of the contact is unacceptable.”So a maximum of 45 TDs are strung around an enormous hall – chosen because it is so much bigger than the Dáil chamber and expensively fitted-out to accommodate all members when necessary – and they still can’t get it right.Most deputies think the Convention Centre set-up is over the top. But when they question it, they say, they are immediately silenced with those three magic words: “health and safety”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4477066.1612531674!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the needle and the good work done","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBy the early 20th century the syringe was in higher demand and eventually became a key tool of vaccine deliveryNeedles make me squeamish. I don’t think I’m alone. This is only one of the many reasons that I did not become a doctor. But needles are very useful tools for delivering medicine and, of chief concern this moment, for delivering vaccines.Before the arrival of the hypodermic syringe pretty much everything a doctor wanted to put into your body had to arrive by mouth. (Or via anal suppositories, but let’s leave those aside for now).The exceptions were, for example, smallpox vaccines that were delivered by making a small cut in the skin. But while this worked to deliver enough vaccine lymph, it has to be said it wasn’t a very efficient way of delivering a medicine.There are competing claims to being the first inventor of the hypodermic syringe. Some experiments had occurred in the 17th century that involved “needles” that were not at all narrow. Anyone for a sharpened quill stuck into your vein? No? I thought not.An interest in local pain relief led doctors to explore ways of getting a drug under the skin in the mid 19th century. The syringe, or plunger part, had long existed as a technology. The innovation was coupling a tiny hollow needle with the syringe.In 1844, an Irish doctor called Francis Rynd described treating neuralgia by injecting morphine under the skin. He has been suggested by some as the inventor of the hypodermic syringe but he didn’t use a syringe at all.Instead, his needle sort of punched a little hole in the skin and then the medicine dripped in by gravity. A “proper” hypodermic syringe forces liquid through a needle and under the skin by the application of pressure.Pain relief Most historians now ascribe the invention to Alexander Wood of Edinburgh. Wood, like Rynd, was looking to relieve the pain of neuralgia in a patient. He was motivated to try hypodermic injection because his patient vomited when given morphine by mouth. His syringe was made of glass but the needle was metal and hollow with one end made into a point.Wood was pleased with the outcome of his experiment and later wrote about it for a local Edinburgh medical journal. He presented it to the British Medical Association’s meeting in Edinburgh in 1858.In describing his results he hinted at an even greater benefit of hypodermic injection, one that Rynd does not seem to have considered. The drug, morphine in this case, would be carried around the body by the blood stream. Injection would therefore provide more than local pain relief or indeed local delivery of a medicine.Something similar to Wood’s innovation may have been used in Paris around the same time but it took quite a while to catch on more generally. The English doctor Charles Hunter seems to have been the first to grasp the importance of a local injection providing more general relief. Instead of injecting the sites of neuralgia in his patients, he injected them elsewhere and they experienced the same relief from pain.You can probably already guess the downside to this story. Before the addictive nature of morphine was fully understood, doctors had invented a more efficient way of delivering it.Injecting morphine seemed to be better tolerated than swallowing it. Some doctors became quite enthusiastic for treating their own neuralgia, over and over again. In other words, they became addicted to morphine.The focus on using the syringe for pain relief is understandable. Morphine produced a noticeable effect in an era where such treatments were few and far between.But use soon expanded with the discovery of new vaccines. In 1885, Louis Pasteur used a hypodermic syringe to administer his first rabies vaccine in Paris.By the early 20th century the syringe was in higher demand and eventually became a key tool of vaccine delivery. Many of our hopes for a better future are now pinned on them.Juliana Adelman is an associate professor of history in Dublin City University – @AdelmanJuliana"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4477041.1612533875!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"you have no authority here chaotic uk council zoom meeting storms internet","story":"A Handforth council meeting in Cheshire, England that descended into chaos – with councillors trading insults and ultimately getting booted off the Zoom call – has become an internet sensation. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA screengrab dated December 10th, 2020, shows parish clerk Jackie Weaver during a Zoom meeting of Handforth Parish Council. Image: Handforth Parish CouncilPA WireA parish council meeting that descended into chaos – with councillors trading insults and ultimately getting booted off the Zoom call – has become an internet sensation.A video of the Handforth council meeting in Cheshire showed it starting badly when one unseen councillor apparently muttered swear words under his breath as the clerk tried to bring the session to order.Things did not improve. The meeting quickly degenerated into rancour with councillors in the village near Wilmslow trading insults and ultimately being booted off the Zoom call by the clerk.Footage of the extraordinary exchanges has been shared thousands of times on Twitter. The name of the heroically stoic clerk, Jackie Weaver, who was apparently parachuted in to run the meeting amid accusations of poor behaviour by councillors, became a Twitter trend on Thursday evening and spawned several memes.During the meeting, which took place on December 10th, chairman Brian Tolver was removed after the councillor refused to recognise the legitimacy of the meeting.In the recording, he told Ms Weaver, from the Cheshire Association of Local Councils, to stop talking, adding: “You have no authority here”. In response, Ms Weaver removed Mr Tolver from the Zoom call and placed him in a virtual waiting room.After Mr Tolver’s eviction, vice-chair Aled Brewerton, joined by another man, proceeded to shout at Weaver to “read the standing orders”.When fellow councillor Susan Moore called for civility, the meeting erupted into semi-hysterical laughter and a two further councillors, Mr Brewerton and Barry Burkill, were removed.The absurd scenes continued with confusion over Mr Tolver’s Zoom username, in which he had labelled himself the “Handforth PC clerk”.Ms Weaver said: “The chairman simply declared himself ‘clerk’ and notified everybody of the case. There is no way of stopping him from calling himself clerk. Please refer to me as Britney Spears from now on.”Those remaining voted to not allow the three men back into the meeting, with councillor Cynthia Samson likening one to a “laughing hyena”.The clips of the meeting were a hit with Twitter users, with more than 5,000 retweets and 32,000 likes. TV presenter Richard Osman tweeted: “Am busily writing Jackie Weaver into the next Thursday Murder Club novel.”Interviewed on BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour, Ms Weaver seemed to be enjoying her newfound fame, after her name was emblazoned on T-shirts saying “YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY HERE JACKIE WEAVER”.She said she had been amused by some of the coverage of the meeting. “Clearly there’s amusement in the way somebody has just lost it,” she said. “It’s harsh to take some pleasure from that, but I’m afraid when you are being bullied, if you can see that the other person has lost it then there is the sense of ‘I did OK there because I managed to hold it together.’“There is an element of bullying and bad behaviour in local councils, and a lot of us are working very hard, and that includes central government, to try and do something about that.”She said at least 99.99 per cent of parish council meetings were not that exciting. “They are often less exciting than we might hope,” she said.But Mr Tolver was unrepentant, saying he had a “reason to be angry”. He told PA news agency that Ms Weaver “had no status to speak other than when invited”.He added: “I cannot think of any other council meeting anywhere, that was taken over by an unqualified member of the public like this.“Removing half the councillors from the meeting denied half of the voters of the village from being represented – it was an appalling attack on their democratic rights.”Normally sedate and well-mannered bodies, parish councils are the lowest tier of local government in England. They have few powers but can play an important role in providing representation and consultation with district and county councils in matters such as planning, environment and recreation.The extraordinary outbursts followed a series of complaints about the conduct of some councillors in the village and allegations of unlawful decisions that have resulted in expenditure of public funds, according to a notice posted on the council’s website by David Brown, director of governance and compliance at Cheshire district council.At the end of the meeting, the councillors debated whether a recording of their discussions should be released. One councillor presciently replied: “I think if this goes viral – it’s going to start a war of words.” – Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4385961!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"world view who is alexei navalny","story":"The \u0027 unrivalled foreign affairs coverage, now brought to you in weekly podcast form.

France condemned the move while Germany, Poland and Sweden said they could retaliate. “I take the floor to just congratulate Russia for this success, it’s good news for the whole mankind because it means we are going to have more tools to face the pandemic,” Mr Borrell said earlier in Moscow.“It will be good news because as you know we are facing a shortage of vaccines and if there is another course of supply, that is welcome,” he told reporters after Mr Navalny was  jailed for two years and eight months on fraud charges on Tuesday.Meanwhile, Mr Navalny was back in court on separate charges of defaming a Second World War veteran, which could see him jailed for an additional two years.The EU’s foreign affairs chief, who pressed ahead with the meeting despite misgivings from some EU member states was under pressure to at least meet Mr Navalny.There are international moves to impose sanctions on Russia for the jailing of Mr Navalny, which took place after he narrowly survived an August poisoning attempt at the hands of Russian officials. He was arrested on his return home from Germany after recovering.US President Joe Biden on Thursday said America will no longer be rolling over in the face of Russia\u0027s aggressive actions and his officials said they would take action over Mr Navalny.A former senior US national security official for Barack Obama, with links to Mr Biden\u0027s state department, told The Daily : The optics are not good to have the EU\u0027s high representative in Moscow as Navalny is in a glass cage.Bob Seely, Tory vice-chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on Russia, said: I don\u0027t know if this is a quid quo pro, but I do think it\u0027s surprisingly uncomfortable for a very senior EU leader to be going to Moscow the week of one of its most high profile show trials in the past 15 years.It is bizarre, but it is also not right. Yes the EU has messed up its vaccine policy but to eject your value system straight out of the window so quickly? It\u0027s pretty shocking.MEP Sandra Kalniete, a former Latvian foreign minister and EU commissioner, said Mr Borrell had “whitewashed Putin’s regime”.The EU already has sanctions in place against Moscow for the chemical weapons attack on Mr Navalny and the illegal annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.The Spanish diplomat’s embarrassment was compounded when Mr Lavrov accused the EU of being an “unreliable partner” for considering further sanctions.He suggested German Chancellor Angela Merkel was lying when she accused Vladimir Putin of being behind the assassination attempt.An EU diplomat told The , “It was a bad day for the EU. Unfortunately, it was not a good performance by Mr Borrell. He was unprepared.  Mr Lavrov played by his own rules and got everything he wanted.”Mr Borrell said he had told Mr Lavrov to release Mr Navalny and investigate his poisoning in August. Over the last years our relationship has been marked by fundamental differences and lack of trust, he said on the first visit to Russia by a senior envoy since 2017.Mr Lavrov criticised the EU for alleged human rights abuses in Latvia and said that Brussels and Moscow were united in their criticism of the US blockade of Cuba after Mr Borrell admitted the bloc was against the blockade.Mrs Merkel said Germany was prepared to continue sanctions and suggested Berlin would retaliate for the expulsion of its diplomat.She said it was a diplomatic duty to keep open channels of communication with Moscow in a press conference with Emmanuel Macron, who has also called for continued dialogue. With regards to the Navalny affair, I condemn with the greatest firmness from start to finish what has happened” Mr Macron said on Friday. Poland summoned Russia\u0027s ambassador and said it would take “appropriate action”. Sweden warned that it reserved the right to an appropriate response.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"government has left britain mercy beijing time running","story":"In the end, it wasn’t the airing of forced confessions, or its manifest propaganda on Hong Kong that did for CGTN, the Chinese state broadcaster. It was the little matter of its licence ownership.Ofcom stripped CGTN of that license this week on the basis that the media outlet is a mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), making it illegal for it to use a UK broadcast license. CGTN is still free to publish online, like anyone else, and it never had a vast UK television audience, but the significance of this move goes beyond that. For one thing, it shows one way in which our norms and rules are simply incompatible with many aspects of the Chinese system. More importantly, it illustrates yet again the need for a government-led strategy to defend our society from CCP interference, rather than continuing with the chaotic and dangerous approach of leaving our institutions and citizens to navigate this quagmire on their own.For now, it looks like we’re on our own. With clockwork predictability, Beijing has denounced Ofcom’s decision and threatened retaliation against the BBC. It’s not surprising if Xi Jinping finds the BBC’s recent China coverage inconvenient. The corporation’s reports in the past month alone include a damning investigation into forced labour in China’s cotton industry and new testimony by survivors of Beijing’s “re-education” camp system in the province of Xinjiang describing systematic rape and torture.What is bizarre about this diplomatic spat, however, is that it has been brought on not by a strategic government decision or even a ministerial gaffe, but simply by a regulator implementing the law. Even Ofcom was itself forced to act by an impeccably researched complaint, put in by a campaign group called Safeguard Defenders, which marshalled all the evidence showing CGTN’s true chain of command. Given the incredible persistence of delusions about Beijing in our civil service and No 10, I’m sure the whole thing is giving them night sweats.If they aren’t sweating, they should be. Again and again, ministers have to be cajoled into accepting the reality that the Sino-British “golden era” instigated by George Osborne is not just over – it never really existed. The Government’s reluctance to accept this truth is the direct cause of the rebellion it suffered recently in Parliament, in which a substantial chunk of its own backbenchers backed a move to link British trade policy to human rights. The wrangling over amendments is still ongoing.This isn’t a normal Tory approach to trade, but it underlines how widespread is the anxiety that, if his MPs allowed it, Boris Johnson would happily let Britain drift into an irreversible and catastrophic embrace with China. Describing the attitude setting in among MPs, one organiser puts it like this: “Until the UK changes its approach, every bill is a China bill.”Piecemeal policy won’t work, either. Take the example of the recent measures on Xinjiang announced with great fanfare by the Foreign Office. Dominic Raab stood up in Parliament and declared that British companies will now have to conduct “appropriate due diligence” on their supply chains to make sure they aren’t using forced labour. If it weren’t so disturbing it would be funny. The World Health Organisation can’t even get unfettered access to a seafood market. What chance does a British clothes retailer have of trundling into Xinjiang and asking its suppliers if they use slaves?What’s more, this is just the end of a very long string. Once you start tugging, anything could happen. Take, a recent report by a company called Horizon Advisory, which took a good, hard look at the Chinese supply chain for polysilicon, an essential material for making solar panels. It found that there is evidence of forced labour use by companies accounting for up to a third of the world’s supply. Maybe we can send in Extinction Rebellion to “due diligence” that one.The same sorts of problems are popping up all over the shop, whether it’s UK academics taking cash from Chinese defence conglomerates, local councils making planning decisions on Chinese nuclear plants or banks like HSBC freezing the assets of Hong Kong dissidents. No 10’s failure to devise a strategy that addresses these issues is fast turning from an embarrassment into a genuine threat to our security.There may be help on the way. This week, the US think tank Atlantic Council published a brilliant essay by an anonymous former government official laying out a detailed framework for how the US should approach China. While Donald Trump woke up Washington to the threat, he was incapable of the hard graft required to devise a strategy, forge bipartisan support and recruit allies. What’s needed, the essay argues, is something equivalent to the 1946 “Long Telegram” that laid out a long-term US strategy for dealing with the Soviet Union. If the US were to lead the way, our Government would surely follow.The key point the essay makes is that the West must develop an infinitely more sophisticated understanding of its own and China’s strengths and weaknesses and of Beijing’s complex internal politics. Following that, we need to agree on red lines and be prepared to defend them, as well as identifying major interests, areas ripe for competition or co-operation and plans for how to implement all of this. If we actually did this hard work, we would probably soon realise that our interests are obvious and easily agreed, and many of the remedies may become clear too.For example, it is broadly a good thing that thousands of Chinese students study at UK universities. It is also clearly a threat to our values if those students are segregated and subject to intense surveillance by Chinese government associations and if the fee income they generate is used to blackmail our universities into suppressing debate on Hong Kong. If the Government devised some policies on this, enforced them and educated universities on the dangers, rather than leaving vice-chancellors to stand or fall alone, Beijing would soon learn we are a society with rules, capable of defending itself.Ultimately, No 10 can choose to be dragged kicking and screaming into a chaotic new era, leaving Britain at the mercy of hostile forces, or it can admit we face a new challenge and get to grips with it. Mr Johnson might not like it, but the world has changed since he rode a Boris bike around Beijing to wild applause in 2012.

READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!”When councillor Susan Moore called for civility there were howls of laughter before Mr Brewerton was also removed.There were objections to them being allowed back in as Mr Brewerton’s companion was compared to a laughing hyena.The clip also showed discussion over Mr Tolver’s Zoom username in which he described himself as the “clerk”. Ms Weaver pointed out: “There is no way of stopping him from calling himself clerk. Please refer to me as Britney Spears from now on.In a round of television and radio interviews on Friday, Ms Weaver said that if she had known she would be propelled to overnight fame then “I would have gone and got my hair done”.The 62-year-old pointed out that “99 percent of council meetings are not like that” but warned there is “bullying and bad behaviour in local councils”.If nothing else, what\u0027s happened over the last 24 hours has really shown that parish councils are there. It hasn\u0027t shown them in their best light, I get that, but we have got elections in May,” she told ITV.The Government seems absolutely committed to holding those elections. Get involved. If you don\u0027t think what you saw was right, get in there and change it. That\u0027s what I would like to see.There has long been disquiet at the council, and it is understood that the dispute stems from a councillor being expelled for non-attendance.Cllrs Tolver and Brewerton and a third member who was also chucked out of the meeting by Ms Weaver, Cllr Barry Birkhill, were all opposed to that expulsion, it is understood.A letter from the Cheshire East Council\u0027s monitoring officer on the council’s website, which is not dated, details multiple complaints about councillors behaviour”, allegations of unlawful conduct and misconceived and wholly inappropriate” claims that elections should not be held.  Cllr Tolver was on Friday night steadfast in his anger. In a statement, he said Ms Weaver\u0027s illegal behaviour caused the tensions to rise and said he had never seen a meeting “taken over by an unqualified member of the public like this”.He had been kicked out of an earlier meeting by Ms Weaver and claims her actions were an appalling attack on democratic rights.When Cllr Brewerton was contacted by The  a person understood to be a family member said that the police had been informed and “the truth will out”, but refused to elaborate.The minutes of the meeting and the declared interest of Cllr Brewerton were among the pages which had apparently been removed from the parish council website on Friday.But the anger from some at their new-found fame has not dampened their popularity. One of the councillors is understood to have agreed to sell his story to a tabloid newspaper.The video has now spawned tribute songs, “best of” compilations and even a mock-up documentary.Author and presenter Richard Osman said that he was “busily writing Jackie Weaver into the next Thursday Murder Club novel”.Mugs, t-shirts and hoodies emblazoned with quotes from the meeting and Ms Weavers face were selling online. Bookies were offering odds on her appearing on Strictly Come Dancing or I\u0027m A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here.A parody twitter account joked that Rosemary Shrager would play her in a biopic of her life whilst Dame Julie Walters and Paula Wilcox would play the other female councillors on the call.  Ms Shrager, the chef and TV presenter, responded: “Sign me up”.  It has also put Handforth on the map when the town’s “previous claim to fame was a big M\u0026ampS” neighbouring MP Lucy Powell joked.  But as the world eagerly awaits the adaptation one thing is for sure, the next meeting of Handforth Parish Council will be a sell out, with members of the public around the world already looking up ways they can join.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tories can provide conservative response devolution without","story":"The prime minister is not a man who is careful with his words. If he thinks before he speaks, there is remarkably little evidence of it. Last November, a story emerged that he had described devolution as “a disaster north of the border”, calling it Tony Blair’s “biggest mistake”. It did nothing to soothe a Scottish electorate who currently support independence from the United Kingdom at something like the Devil’s ratio of 5248.It matters hardly at all whether Boris Johnson was right. The fact is that devolution has been part of the UK’s constitutional landscape for 20 years, and, for all but the crustiest of old-school Tories, it is here to stay. There is as little sense in regretting it as in a sea captain regretting the weather.If the Conservative Party continues to be a grudging participant in the devolved assemblies, and if it mentally writes off the London mayoralty as well, it will create a self-fulfilling prophecy of defeat and marginalisation. It will become the party of the English towns and shires, with only a distant cousin or two on the Celtic fringes. But it doesn’t have to be this way.Johnson and his party must declare a Pol Pot-style Year Zero on decentralisation. They must embrace the possibilities of devolution wholeheartedly, and must go further. If they are clever, and joined-up, they will anchor a new love for local autonomy to their professed desire for “levelling-up”, and present themselves as the party of opportunity, competition and ersity, in all its forms.The Covid-19 crisis has shone a spotlight on some of the elected mayors in the English regions. Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester and Sir Peter Soulsby in Leicester showed that, in an emergency, there was far more influence to be had by a locally grounded leader with a mandate from the community he or she serves but they came head-to-head with a lack of power to effect change. That must stop, and the needle must move in the opposite direction.The UK is a remarkably unbalanced polity. There is London, and there is everywhere else. This will never be reversed, but the balance can be shifted by the creation of powerful city and region bosses who have control over the economic levers of their domains, and by the acceptance of loss of direct control by Whitehall. Our great cities—Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Cardiff, Belfast—should be dynamic economic centres where wealth creation can be channelled into the most fertile areas: financial services in Edinburgh, the creative industries in Manchester, manufacturing in Birmingham.The mayors of these venerable cities and their surrounding areas should be capable, well-known, activist politicians (or even non-politicians): the Tories should shout much more loudly about Andy Street in the West Midlands and Ben Houchen on Teesside. Here you see people dedicated to the communities and focused on growth and prosperity.There will be one unpopular factor in Whitehall and at Conservative HQ: as things stand, many of these mayors will not be Tories. But if Boris Johnson wants a vision for a different, levelled-up UK, he must accept this short-term abdication of power. If the Conservatives have the right ideas and the right people, the electorate will come to them, as they have in the Red Wall seats.Perhaps the prime minister can grasp the thorniest constitutional nettle of all, reform of the House of Lords. The days of the upper House as a Tory redoubt are gone the government is in a minority in the Lords, and the Liberal Democrats, with 87 peers, are disproportionately influential. Be bold. Seize the initiative. But do not outline options. The PM and his brainiest advisers should devise a model of a second chamber that suits the system and (to an extent) suits them, and they should propose it. Let it be yes or no, and put proponents of other models in the trenches with the diehards who want the status quo. We had stage one of House of Lords reform in 1999. We have been waiting rather too long for stage two.Reforming the constitutional arrangements of the UK is never sexy. It always seems less important than a public health crisis or a stalling economy or our relations with our nearest neighbours. It is important, but not urgent. But if Johnson wants a legacy, imagine the one he could have: a UK in which power was devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, with strong Conservative representation in the first two. Great cities on a European scale, run by businessmen and entrepreneurs as well as party hacks. Les grands prôjets. Think how we could look in 2030, with Covid and Brexit behind us.

It is an area Russian submarines are known to patrol, along with other Russian navy vessels supporting military action in Syria.As such it could be an ideal testing ground for British submarines fitted with new kit to hunt other submarines. The non-acoustic sensors can pick up tiny radiation signatures from the power plant of enemy submarines as well as small changes in water pressure caused by the passage of a submerged vessel.Richard Scott, naval consultant editor at Jane\u0027s, said: “The navy has had non-acoustic sensors - on trials and in service - for about three decades in different forms. Russian submarines in the Cold War were observed with a host of probes coming out of them and they were regarded as having a lead in non-acoustic technology.Soviet submarines tested many types of Wake Object Detection Systems (or ‘System Obnarujenia Kilvaternovo Sleda’ in Russian, and known as SOKS by Nato) from the late 1960s onward. Submarines are most easily located using sound, either coming from inside a hidden boat or ‘bounced’ off the metal hull from a vessel in pursuit. Omnidirectional receivers pick up these SOund Navigation And Ranging (sonar) emissions which are then analysed by highly trained operators.However, advances in submarine technology have made modern boats much quieter and operators have to contend with other underwater sounds such as marine life and even the movement of the water itself making passive systems less reliable. These competing noises are more pronounced in shallow water, such as the Meditteranean Sea and the coast around Britain.Active sonar, whereby a submarine emits noise in the form of a ‘ping’ which is then returned from the hull of a tracked vessel, will give away the presence and likely position of the hunter.   Pete Sandeman, a naval specialist, says experimentation with various non-acoustic methods for detecting submarines has been ongoing since the Cold War. These include sensors that can find tiny chemical or radiation signatures from anti-corrosive coatings flaking off the hull or byproducts from oxygen generation systems.“Wake-detection, that can sense tiny bubbles left behind in the water column by a submarine, appears the most promising line of development,” he told the .“The reason more non-acoustic systems are appearing on submarines now is likely to do with advances in computing and the need to find a new generation of very quiet submarines that are very hard to detect using passive sonar. “The data from the non-acoustic sensor may become much more valuable when processed using powerful artificial intelligence and possibly integrated with the conventional sonar picture,” he said.Control of noise is critical to a submarine’s ability to hide underwaterAll machinery is mounted on rubber and every effort is taken to prevent noise being transmitted to the hull. The main machinery - hundreds of tonnes of equipment - is mounted on a raft and isolated from the hull to keep it quiet. Submariners talk of ‘layers’ in the water, depending on temperature, salinity and distance from land. Sonar can often not penetrate these layers, meaning skilled commanders can use them better to hide their boats. It is thought wake detection systems can help build a picture of where the layers in the water are. A former submariner told the : “There are layers in the water, mainly temperature, although strong salinity layering does happen in places like the Amazon where it comes into the Atlantic. “There’s a real boundary where you move from salt water into fresh, but the main thing is temperature. If there’s a five degree drop across a very narrow piece of water, when sound propagates against that boundary it tends to bounce within that layer.“So if you’re in a layer and somebody has detected you, and you can move to a different layer so the sound is not being propagated, you can lose the detector. “Sound propagates massively in water and if you can get into those boundaries and use them you reduce your detectability.“It’s all about knowing what’s out there and using that to your advantage.”The latest Russian and Chinese submarines are understood to be causing concern in Nato circles, leading to a greater focus on sub-sea activity.The Russian Navy had SOKS fitted on their Sierra and Akula boats but the technology is very complex and it is difficult to achieve consistent results.Now however, with the proliferation of new Russian submarines, the need for something more than passive sonar has become urgent, which is one reason such systems are being looked at again.In 2019 US Navy Rear Admiral William Houston said the Ohio-class submarine USS Florida had deployed to the Meditteranean Sea “to counterbalance the Russian buildup in Syria,” according to The Drive.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"inside uks biggest food charity","story":"AdvertorialInside the UKs biggest food charity - which is keeping families fed across BritainBarclays has pledged support to the food redistribution charity FareShare as part of its £m COVID- Community Aid PackagemirrorShareByJemma PattonWilliam Ramsey:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB AdvertorialFareShare is the UK’s largest food redistribution charity One in five children in the UK are currently growing up in a household where food is scarce, and one in four parents skip meals due to lack of money.These stats are no surprise to Kylie Brackstone, Playground Manager at Somerstown Adventure Playground in Portsmouth, which is part of Portsmouth City Council’s Play Youth and Community Service . Before the Coronavirus lockdowns the playground had been feeding children and parents daily. “We’d always have the slow cooker going, especially in the winter, always a stew or a soup, remembers Kylie.Our approach is always very informal, easy access, the children and their parents would know they could help themselves whenever they liked. People then felt secure enough to kind of say ‘I’m struggling this month’ and we could put a little box together for them.”  Although PYC’s kitchens have had to close during lockdowns, they’ve been providing food parcels to families across Portsmouth.Holly Easlick, Health Development Officer for the council, tells us how FareShare – the UK’s largest food redistribution charity – helped: “During the first lockdown FareShare were able to deliver us more food than ever so we were able to get it out to the families who needed it. Kylie stresses how vital this contact with vulnerable families is: “With Covid-, the food was a big thing to help us continue our interaction with the families. Families that struggle with food provision, there are people truly in need.” She adds: “Itaposs also about that weekly interaction. A lot of our families struggle with mental health, so that idea that they knew they could come down every week and get a food package, and also see us, talk to us was one of the most important things.Even though it was just kind of over the gate, we were able to have a conversation and it was a way in to seethere were other ways they were struggling and we could support them.”  FareShare is a network of  independent organisations with more than  warehouses right across the UK. The charity takes food that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors, short shelf le or over production, and redistribute it through a network of , frontline organisations.The food FareShare redistributes is nourishing and fresh – the same as the food you’d eat at home. Homeless hostels, school breakfast clubs, domestic violence refuges, older people’s lunch clubs, food banks and hospices all depend on FareShare’s help. Ninety per cent of these charities have seen demand reach crisis levels since the pandemic started, and they’re preparing for even more people to find themselves in need this winter. Over the coming months, FareShare will also be delivering food to night shelters and school holiday projects to reach even more people who are struggling. This winter Barclays is working with FareShare to help raise vital funds. With approximately .m people in the UK currently living in food poverty, the amount of food that’s currently wasted is shocking. It’s estimated that a third of all food produced is wasted, at a cost of £b.  FareShare is committed to ensuring that food that would otherwise be wasted gets redistributed with frontline charities and community groups. Barclaysapos £m Covid- Community Aid Package was established to help charities continue to carry out the vital work they do. It’s pledging support to organisations that are helping people affected by the crisis. To support this peak in winter demand, Barclays is pledging to donate £ for every £ you donate to FareShare through the link or text number below, up to £m, until  February. FareShare is able to provide up to four meals with every £ donated – with Barclays your £ means up to  meals for those in need.So to help feed someone this winter, contribute via Barclays by going to fareshare.org.uk barclays or texting GIVE , GIVE  or GIVE  to .

Passengers coming into the UK will take both tests during their -day isolation period amid new quarantine measures starting February , reports the . It is also understood the extra rule will be imposed on arrivals from all countries and not just virus hotspots, according to the newspaper. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is expected to announce the plans next week. The measure is aimed predominantly at ing Brits, with arrivals either having PCR kits posted to do at home or given details of their nearest testing centre.When you arrive into the UK you will have to take two tests during your ten-day isolation, a Government source told the Daily Mail. It will be a further level of protection. From the same date, hotel quarantine for travellers from  countries on the ‘red list’ will also be introduced.Theyaposre expected to be met at ports of entry and transported directly in special taxis or minibuses to their accommodation which they will have to pay for. People from red list countries, or anyone who has visited one in the last ten days, are already banned from entering the UK.  The scheme will be for UK residents and nationals “who cannot be refused entry.” Countries which introduced similar schemes have seen far fewer Covid cases. However, the delay in bringing in the measure in the UK is in part down to the Government identying buildings which fit specic requirements, including sufficient ventilation, sources told the Mail.  On January  the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencieswarned that reactive, geographically targeted travel bans would not be enough to stop the arrival of new Covid iants. This was because there is a lag between the emergence and detection of new iants so they could be present in countries not on the list. Sage said the only way to “get close” to preventing new strains was to introduce quarantine measures for all travellers entering Britain.

Has the illegal meeting started yet  Matt Handcockaposs iPad: Iaposm in an illegal meeting, can I call you back  Yes, itaposs a typo, I need to change it in the settings, speak later. Johnson: Dearly Brexited, we are gathered here to consider the complete s***show of the past year and whoaposs to blame. Let me quote the standing orders. When in trouble, the Prime Minister may apportion blame to the Opposition. If that fails, blame the NHS. If that fails, blame the citizens of the UK.

In a speech last February you said coronavirus would trigger a panic beyond what is medically rational to the point of doing real and unnecessary economic damage. As per standing order  of a sane and reasonable democracy, will you accept that you have taken more than a year to start being medically rational, and thereby have done real and unnecessary economic damage we could have bloody well avoided Johnson: MRS WEAVER PLEASE. You have no authority here, no authority at all! You are a mere female! Cromweaver: It is high time for me to put an end to your sitting in this place, which you have dishonored by your contempt of all virtue, and defiled by your practice of every vice ye are a factious crew, and enemies to all good government ye are a pack of mercenary wretches...

Boris Johnson pledged to set out a roadmap on how Englandaposs national lockdown will be lted in the week of February , with officials expressing quiet confidence that the PMaposs mid-February target for vaccinating the  million most vulnerable people will be met. The Government revealed that it aims to vaccinate all the over s by early May, as it announced that local elections would go ahead on May . Mr Johnson has pointed to Easter as a point when lockdown restrictions would be substantially lted, saying it could be a very, very dferent world by then. But ministers are being cautious not to raise the hopes of the lockdown-weary public by setting dates, but some scientists have started predicting the path to freedom from restrictions. Health Secretary Matt Hancock previously set four tests for lting lockdown measures. They are:Another major, new iant is not causing dficulties The vaccination rollout is working Hospitalisation numbers are reducing  The number of deaths are coming downThe Prime Minister is pinning his hopes on the continued success of the vaccine programme, but he warned on Wednesday that hospitalisations remain forbiddingly high. However he is under pressure from Tory MPs to lt restrictions as soon as possible - a clamour that is likely to grow in the coming days. Hereaposs what we know so far on how and when the restrictions could be lted. Plans are still being worked out, so we may not find out the full details until the Prime Minister sets out his roadmap later this month. Schools will be the first thing to open  The Prime Minister has repeatedly said that getting pupils back in the classroom is the first priority. March  has been pencilled in for the partial reopening of schools in England, with primary schools likely to be the first to . Pupils in exam years - year  and  - could also go back earlier, even though GCSEs and A-Levels have been scrapped this year. Parents and schools have been promised two weeks notice on when face-to-face teaching can resume.  The idea behind the March  date is it would allow a three-week window from the mid-February deadline for the top priority groups to get the jabs. This would give enough time for immunity to kick in for he most vulnerable. But Mr Johnson is facing pressure from his own MPs and teachers to open schools sooner, with growing calls for teachers to be vaccinated in the second phase of the rollout. Outdoor activities could follow  The next area where rules could be relaxed is outdoor exercise and socialising. People are currently barred from any outdoor meet-ups, except for exercise within their household or bubble, or with one other person. The PM is said to be considering letting team and inidual sports go ahead in the open air, where transmission of the virus is lower. Limited social gatherings outside could also be on the cards, the Times reported.  There could be ato limits on numbers of people who can meet up, similar to the rule of six last year, which allowed you to meet up to five others. Dr Mike Tildesley, an expert on the Govermentaposs modelling group, said the idea of ato outdoor activity was slightly concerning and urged caution. Pressed on whether outdoor socialising next month seemed reasonable, he said a little bit more mixing outdoors might be reasonable but would need very clear messaging from the Government. It is not clear when gyms and exercise classes would be able to resume. Non-essential shops may also start to open  Only essential shops, such as supermarkets, pharmacies and garden centres, have been allowed to stay open during the national lockdown. But it is likely that they will be among the next things to reopen when national restrictions begin to lt. Under the tiers system, non-essential shops were allowed to keep their doors open, with Covid safety measures, except in the toughest Tier  areas. It may depend whether the UK s to a tiered system or the whole country comes out of lockdown at the same time. Open air markets are likely to open before indoor shops. A Whitehall source recently told the : “We have to avoid the situation last time where theof schools meant far greater household mixing across the board. “So that means weaposd be likely to wait at least another month for non-essential retail, and a month beyond that at least for pubs and restaurants. This could mean that shops start to open again in early April, possibly after Easter Sunday on April . But pubs and restaurants are likely to stay closed for longer  Hospitality venues were among the last places to reopen after the first lockdown due to the risks of transmission of the virus. SAGE experts have pointed to May as a possible time for pubs and restaurants to reopen - which could coincide with the bank holiday weekend. If the Government meets its target to vaccinate the over s by early May, this could make it safer to open up hospitality. Even then, pubs and restaurants faced a number of restrictions on how they could operate. Allowing takeaway pints and food could be the first stage of easing restrictions, or allowing al fresco dining. The rules on household mingling will also be a factor, depending on whether you can socialise with friends or people you donapost live with indoors. Mr Johnson is believed to be keen to simply the rules, including scrapping the widely ridiculed requirement for people to have a substantial meal with their pints, which applied in some tiers.

Vulnerable children are harder to identy due to the pandemic – with a % drop in referrals to children’s services in November. And with schools closed, bored and lonely children are “increasingly at risk in parks and takeaways, with predators waiting to pounce”, she said.  The majority of councils are failing to get a grip on the problem, with more than seven in councils failing to quanty youth violence in their area, the report found. Only  in  local authorities tracked risk factors linked with exploitation – such as school exclusion, going missing, drug and alcohol abuse or living with a family member convicted of an office.  The vast majority of councilsran drug awareness courses, but only halfreported having a public health drug policy for children and young people.  Ms Longfield said: “Predators who seek to exploit children for financial gain will use sophisticated methods to target, groom and coerce children.   “They are ruthless in their efforts to keep children in their thrall, subjecting them to unspeakable abuse, threats and intimidation. “If intervention comes when children are already entangled in these dangerous enterprises, it is dficult to reach them.” She added: “Tragically, until there is this joined up public health response to gangs that identies and helps all those children at risk as early as possible, teenagers will keep dying on our streets.”"},{"url":null,"title":"vaccine visas could allow brits","story":"NewsVaccine visas could allow lockdown weary Brits to travel abroad this summerMinisters and government officials have spent weeks denying plans are being drawn up for documents showing who has been inoculated and allowing them to travel abroadmirrorShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video tories-vaccine-passports-other-countires-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Ministers and government officials have spent weeks denying plans are being drawn up for documents showing who has been inoculated and allowing them to travel abroad. But today it was reported a certication system is being worked on. Tourism chiefs in Greece said UK holidaymakers could be welcomed to its hotspots later this year. Greek Hoteliersapos Federation President Grigoris Tasios told the Times: Greece has long been a favourite holiday destination for the British. “But with the rate of inoculations in the UK largely outpacing all others across Europe and beyond, British travellers will be among the safest to travel here by as early as May. What is your view  Have your say in the comments section Foreign Office Minister James Cleverly said it would be up to countries where holidaymakers were arriving to decide on travel passports. It is often the case that the entry requirements for countries are for vaccines or inoculations, and that is not an uncommon practice,” he told the BBC. We will work with international partners to help facilitate their border arrangements and their immigration arrangements.He added: “The decisions that inidual countries make about their own incoming arrangements is obviously up to them. We are incredibly proud of the speed and the breadth of our vaccination rollout and of course, I think the whole world hopes, that the vaccination programme will be a way of getting back to normality. Travel industry chiefs welcomed the possibility of vaccine visas allowing tourists to head for foreign beaches. An Association of British Travel Agents spokeswoman said: “It is sensible to have the option of some sort of proof of vaccination, because that evidence, alongside testing, is likely to be part of the way to re-opening travel. “Waiting for the full rollout of the vaccination programme to be completed in the UK before people start to travel overseas would mean another summer season lost to the pandemic.“We need a reopening strategy that keeps up with the developing medical situation and with medical understanding, as well as recognising other countries may have dfering policies on how and when they accept vaccinated travellers.” A TUI spokeswoman said: “We welcome any effort to simply the process of travel and enable more people to travel again safely.” Shadow Transport Secretary Jim McMahon said Labour “will look at proposals around helping to allow people to travel safely, but this must be led by the science”. A No  spokesman confirmed the issue of vaccine passports was being kept under review.  He added: There are still no current plans to roll out vaccine passports. “Going on holiday is currently illegal. We have always been clear that we will keep the situation under review.” An EasyJet spokeswoman said: “We want to work with Government to put in place a roadmap of how to progressively and safely unwind restrictions.We know that people want to travel this summer, when it is safe to do so, and so while some restrictions remain in place, vaccine passports could play a part in enabling more people to travel again to countries requiring proof of vaccination. It is critical that this is implemented in a simple way to ensure it is easy for passengers.” Oxford jab is equally good on UK iant The Oxford vaccine is as effective at fighting the more contagious UK iant as the original virus. Findings by the Oxford Vaccines Group offer hope that vaccinations will rapidly reduce cases. The vaccine, estimated to be “high % or %” effective, also prevented severe disease.  Data from  trial participants who tested positive from October to January  was analysed. Although those with the Kent iant had fewer antibodies, Dr June Raine, chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said: “The findings are very reassuring.” Meanwhile the Government has announced a deal with the firm CureVac to reformulate vaccines against emerging iants. It comes as public health officials try to stop new mutations getting out of control in northern England.

Researchers at Warwick University used simulations to model what could happenBritain is unshackled in the coming months, before presenting their findings to SAGE. The paper, published on Friday, said despite nearly  million people across the UK having so far been inoculated, the unprecedented roll-out is insufficient to allow for ato normal before the end of the year. The scientists warn such a move could be catastrophic and leading to thousands more hospitalisations and deaths. Have you been affected by Covid  Let us know in the comments This is because there will still be a substantial amount of people who refuse or cannot have the vaccine, meaning transmissions could quickly soar. While none of the jabs give complete coverage against the virus. The paper saysthe R rate were to remain at . and three million doses were being given each week and  per cent of those invited for a jab accepted, another wave could still hit before winter this year.If the Rule of Six, social distancing and face masks in shops and public transport, as well as a curfew were in place, from September, another wave could be avoided, it adds. Downing Streetaposs Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies was presented with the findings on January . The document said: With the new aggressive Covid strain, likely transmission efficacies prove insufficient to prevent further infection outbreaks across the population. This means that the proportion of iniduals that do not accept the vaccine together with the proportion for whom it is ineffective in protecting, may still account for signicant further severe disease even after the program is completed. We see that even with the highest possible uptake and fastest vaccination program, full relaxation by the time schoolsin September would still result in signicant further disease.

It would mean the world to leave something for my daughter as I have fought for my entire le to rise above that mediocrity of renting and getting to that stage of mortgage, which in todayaposs day and age is a nightmare, especially with the current climate of Covid etc, he said.  It would be amazing to leave Naomi with something for the future to build on, especially with it being her first home. The generosity of people has been amazing, I canapost thank people enough, every little bit helps towards the cause, I never thought it would reach such a figure as it has, he added. Sadly, Chris and Heather lost their mum Gillian Naomi Irvine less than three years ago to cancer at the age of . She was first diagnosed in  with cervical cancer after missing a smear test - with the news coming just three months after the death of Heather and brother Samuelaposs dad following a coronary attack. Chris had been feeling run down when his sister chased him down to the GP on his birthday on May ,  after he started vomiting constantly. After an ultrasound that July, it was revealed he had a large mass on his liver before further tests showed it was the rare fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. It had spread to his lymph nodes which ruled out surgery but he started chemotherapy and was  rounds in when Covid struck last March. The oncologist said donapost be alarmed but we donapost usually see people with your type of cancer, as in they are gone before they even realise they have it, said Heather. Given that it is so rare they donapost have that much research or trails or anything to go with. Chris was admitted to hospital numerous times for infections which stopped the chemotherapy. He started to experience a lot of discomfort and a scan in November  showed the disease had spread to bones in his spine and he had a large fracture causing the pain. Then eight days after his daughteraposs birthday in December he had another scan, this time indicating more spread to the lower and upper part of the spine.

A bizarre clip of a Handforth Parish Council meeting has been viewed nearly three million times after being posted on social media. The footage, taken from a planning and environment meeting last year, showed councillors trading insults - and ultimately getting booted off the call. Jackie Weaver assumed the role of clerk in the meeting and is the person tasked with controlling the increasingly angry situation. She is accused of having no authority by chair Brian Tolver before she removes him - and later kicks out two others for their behaviour.What do you think about the parish council meeting  Let us know in the comments below.Speaking to BBC Radio aposs Womanaposs Hour this morning, Ms Weaver said she was surprised by the sudden fame and appreciates the support she had received. She said: The surprise comes in large part because, actually . per cent - thataposs an actual fact Iaposm sure - of council meetings are just not like that. Iaposve had nothing but really lovely, positive support from people who, of course, condemn the behaviour. Nobody could not condemn that. For me it’s about being focused on what you’re trying to achieve. I was there to support the three councillors that wanted to get on with the often dull business a parish council has in looking to do stuff for its community. Ms Weaver, from the Cheshire Association of Local Councils, also revealed her top tip for appearing on Zoom calls during the pandemic. She said: It’s so tempting to just put on a face and think that’s all you see [on Zoom] so it’s okayI’m wearing my slippers and pyjama bottoms. But for me it has a change in your own personal attitudeyou know that you’re together irrespective of whether they can see your pyjama bottoms or not.  The footage, taken from a meeting on December , contains insults, shouting and swear words. The meeting marked the second time chair Brian Tolver had been removed, having previously been evicted from an earlier Zoom call. Mr Tolver said today that he did not regret how he had acted in the meeting - as another councillor said a probe has been launched over the incident. He said Ms Weaver - who hosted the Zoom call and removed him from it - was just present as a member of the public and had no status to speak other than when invited. He said: If you look at the first meeting you will see I have reason to be angry. Mr Tolver is seen claiming the agenda was concealed in the first meeting and, following a series of interjections and claims the meeting was not legitimate, he was eventually removed. The .pm extraordinary meeting began with an unseen councillor mumbling f*** off under their breath. Mr Tolver refused to recognise the legitimacy of both meetings. He told meeting clerk Ms Weaver, from the Cheshire Association of Local Councils, to stop talking, and added: You have no authority here. In response, Ms Weaver removed Mr Tolver from the Zoom call and placed him in a virtual waiting room. Mr Tolver said: I cannot think of any other council meeting anywhere, that was taken over by an unqualied member of the public like this. Removing half the councillors from the meeting, denied half of the voters of the village from being represented - it was an appalling attack on their democratic rights. This made tensions rise, and that is why voices were raised in the second meeting. In the second meeting, I was trying to explain the correct procedure to this lady and say that her actions were way out of order, but she seems to have believed that she could do whatever she chose. Following Mr Tolveraposs eviction, vice-chair Aled Brewerton, joined by an older unnamed gentleman, proceeded to yell at Ms Weaver to read the standing orders.  When fellow councillor Susan Moore called for civility, the meeting erupted into semi-hysterical laughter and two further councillors, Mr Brewerton and Barry Burkill were removed. There was then confusion over Mr Tolveraposs Zoom username, in which he had labelled himself the clerk. Ms Weaver said: The chairman simply declared himself aposclerkapos and notied everybody of the case. There is no way of stopping him from calling himself aposclerkapos. Please refer to me as aposBritney Spearsapos from now on. Those remaining voted to not allow the three men back into the meeting, with councillor Cynthia Samson likening one to a laughing hyena. Mr Tolver, who previously labelled the clips shared on YouTube as corrupt copies, said they were hooky videos and added: Whether they are completely genuine or not, I donapost know. Ms Moore said that the call is subject to an investigation and could not expand further on what happened when asked by the Mirror. She said: Iaposm so sorry, I really canapost talk about it. It has been an ongoing investigation for some months now. We hope it will come to a conclusion fairly soon.

Lucci Smith, , who could have spared her son pain and suffering but not saved his le, was handed a two-year community order for cruelty to a child. She was out on the school run when her boyfriend lost his temper with the infant and attacked him, Cambridge Crown Court heard, reports CambridgeshireLive. Mitchell was also handed a -year concurrent sentence for cruelty or allowing serious physical harm to a child - with  days taken off his sentence for time served.  Teddie was just  weeks old when he was assaulted by Kane Mitchell on November , , in St Neots. Mitchell was not the baby boyaposs biological father but had been living with his mother, Lucci Smith, and her other children in the family home. While Smith was out on the school run, Mitchell had a sudden temper and frustration with Teddie causing the baby boyaposs fatal injuries.During the pairaposs sentencing at  Cambridge Crown Court  today, February , Mr Justice Knowles acknowledged that while Mitchell did not intend to kill Teddie, there was nonetheless an intention to cause really serious harm. Teddie, who was born August   died in hospital  days after sustaining the fatal injuries. Mr Knowles summarised the injuries in his sentencing, explaining that there had been a previous assault by Mitchell. He said: Teddie on that occasion received a fracture to his right clavicle and fractures to two left ribs.  On November , by then  weeks old, Teddie received  rib fractures, a fracture to his left clavicle, fatal skull fractures, brain, spinal, and eye injuries. The rib and clavicle fractures were caused by Mr Mitchell grabbing Teddie and squeezing him with so much force that the ribs and clavicle went beyond their natural pliability to the point of fracturing. The fatal injuries to the head involved the violent striking by Mr Mitchell of Teddieaposs head against a hard or unyielding surface. The fatal assault took place while Smith was out, taking her other children to school. After she ed it became clear to her throughout the course of the morning and early afternoon that something was wrong with her baby.  However,  was not called until pm that day. Mr Knowles outlined how by .pm Smith was expressing the opinion to her mother that aposTeddieaposs really illapos. She then called the GP at around .pm, where it was made clear to her that she needed to call  urgently. However, Mr Knowles explained: Even then she delayed doing that until she had been to the school and collected her other children. On theirto the flat at  oaposclock, Teddie had stopped breathing.  was then called. Mr Knowles went on to say: Teddieaposs injuries and suffering were as a direct result of the actions of Mr Mitchell about which, in the light of the juryaposs verdict, Miss Smith was unaware and had no foresight of. Her failure to obtain earlier medical help could not have saved Teddie. It could have spared him some pain and suffering. Evidence from the trial showed that Smith did care about her childrenaposs wellbeing and loved them explained Mr Knowles, and she was capable of being highly competent when it came to their physical care. But, he continued, there were nonetheless times, and this offence is one of the results, where she did not stand up for the children because of what she wanted from her relationship with Mr Mitchell. In its own way, that failure accounts for her delaying on November  and allowing Mr Mitchell to deflect her actions and any attempt on her part to focus on Teddieaposs needs. At the same time, the situation on November  was serious. It was obvious to her that something was seriously wrong, and like no other occasion it required the action and focus she was capable of giving.

David, who has made a habit of exercising in the woodland since gyms closed and was out running this morning, said: “It’s quite unnerving to think I might have been walking past [human bones] this whole time. “I hope the police find out what happened.” The cordon was set up after police were called on Tuesday afternoon by a member of the public who had said they had discovered the remains.

The pavements outside Victoria station and Westminster Cathedral were hotspots for homeless people just  months ago - due to the constant stream of pedestrians. But for the likes of Rorey Ennis, who canapost be trusted in hostels, it means loneliness and little chance of food or spare change. The -year-old, originally from Birmingham, said he survives day-to-day, reports MyLondon. Sat in front of a Pret a Manger beside Victoria’s main entrance on what in normal times would have been a busy Wednesday afternoon , Rorey explains this part of London is now eerily sparse. Are you homeless and sleeping rough  Contact us at webnews@mirror   It is more lonely than it used to be, he says. You spend days waiting to speak to someone. Originally from Birmingham, Mr Ennis has been sleeping rough since I was  years old, and has been in London for four years. I mostly hang around Victoria and Westminster and stayed here through all the lockdowns, he explains.  I usually sleep in my mate’s tent by the cathedral. There are hostels, but I don’t go to them, I can’t be trusted in a property. I’m surviving by just doing it day by day. Sometimes people will pop into Pret to get you something. At .pm over in Piccadilly Circus, a rough sleeper who asks not to be named says he arrived in London from Cardf two weeks ago. “I don’t get any benefits, says the -year-old. I rely on getting my food and money from donations. Today I’ve had a panini and a sausage roll and two coffees. I go to public toilets when I can, but they close at night. Like Mr Ennis, he says there are not many rough sleepers around Piccadilly Circus – an area where heavy footfall once made it an attractive location to pick up donations from passers by.  He continues: There have been outreach people and that’s it… They tell you where to go for housing or where to get food and a tent or clothes. I keep myself to myself and I sometimes see more rough sleepers around Charing Cross station. At night time I’m mostly outside. Since I’ve been in London I’ve been able to sleep in a hostel twice. They’re often full. Asked whether he’s felt scared of catching Covid-, he simply replies: F*** the pandemic.  At about .pm, Boyd Seagal is waiting in The Strand with a dozen other homeless people, including his partner, for a group of volunteers to arrive who will set up tables and lay out free food. The -year-old says: My partner and I have been homeless together in London for about a year. I have moved around a lot but I have been homeless at dferent stages since I was six years old. I left London and carried on to Mansfield and Nottingham and then Chesterfield, Derbyshire and Scotland. Mr Seagal suggests an answer as to why the capital’s historic centre appears to have fewer rough sleepers than might have been expected. Recently my partner and I have been coming to Charing Cross every day, he said. We walk from Wandsworth and all the way back. We have been put in separate rooms in a hostel in Wandsworth for  days. We started there two weeks ago. You get showers and bits and pieces and a chance to do your washing. A study by the charity St Mungo’s and the Greater London Authority shows that the number of people sleeping rough in the borough of Westminster fell markedly between July to September and October to December. The number of rough sleepers counted by outreach workers during the last quarter of the year was , which was  fewer than the previous quarter. This figure was also lower than when the same study was carried out in October to December  - when  rough sleepers were spotted. Petra Salva, from St Mungo’s, said: Since March, our teams in Westminster – in partnership with the local council - have been working round the clock to make sure as many people as possible are provided with accommodation so they are protected from Covid- as well as the other risks associated with being street homeless. And we know from [the data] that a signicant reduction in the number of people sleeping rough in Westminster has been achieved. However, this is not a static issue and there are people still coming to the streets who need and deserve immediate protection and long-term support. Westminster Council currently has more than  supported accommodation beds in use for homeless people, and a further  beds in two assessment centres. The council says it has helped  people into accommodation since March . Councillor Heather Acton, cabinet member for communities, said: Our outreach teams continued to work day and night over the Christmas period and will do so over cold winter spells. They will provide essential support tailored to each inidual finding themselves living on the streets in Westminster. Not only will this help them to access safe accommodation, but also essential mental health, drug and alcohol addiction services, work skills training and ultimately employment. Thus breaking the cycle of rough sleeping, offering long-term solutions rather than quick fixes.

Describing her husband’shome from work she writes: “’Hello dear,’ he said to me. ‘I’ve just got to ring up my friend on the telephone’.What do you think about the schoolgirlaposs predictions  Let us know in the comments“’Well you’d better tidy yourself up a bit,’ I said. “In  the telephone was a square box thing with a resiver [sic] on top of it. “But now it is still a resiver [sic], but you can see the people you are talking to, for there is a screen where you can see the people. It is a bit like a television.” Upholsterer Peter found the note stuffed down the back of a sofa which was sent to him for restoration after being bought second-hand.  Rosa, , from Peterborough, Cambs., decided to make the it public in case the author, who would now be aged around , is still alive. She said: “When my husband showed it to me I couldn’t believe it. I thought oh my god, look at this. “It was just so interesting, because looking at it today she’s got a lot of her predictions kind of right - but in her childish innocent way she thought it would all happen in ten years.  “I just wanted to share it in the hopes that maybe the author might see it and recognise it. “My husband has found all sorts of rubbish down the side of sofas and furniture before - but never anything as interesting as this.” The letter is unnamed but comes complete with a teacher’s corrections and comments in red pen - including the verdict ‘Good’.  It begins: “The year is , the time is half-past moon dust. Here I am twenty-one years of age, sitting in a cushion of air. “I remember when I was  years old and I was at school, things have changed since then. “For instance, the television has changed. “In  it was a square box with knobs in front of it. Now it is a big screen with knobs on your chair arm to switch it on and off.” The schoolgirl imagines that she is a married bank worker. She says in times past she would have “prepared tea” ready for her husband to come home. But she adds: “All we have is a piece of chewing gum to eat. You may think that we have not enough to eat but you are wrong, because this piece of chewing gum is food.

Themba Cabeka experienced temperatures of -C and fell partially unconscious due to lack of oxygen during the harrowing , mile trip from Johannesburg, South Africa. The -year-old stowaway was almost killed himself after being thrown on the London airportaposs runaway on landing - resulting in his leg having to be amputated. He was then placed in a coma for six months, reports MyLondon. You can donate to help Themba at his GoFundMe page here. Themba fled crime-ridden Johannesburg in June  along with friend Carlito Vale, dreaming of a better le after sleeping rough for five years. Neither could afford to pay for a flight of visa to the UK and after reading up on aeroplane design, Themba decided the best place to hide would be the space around the wheels. The pair jumped over a fence at the airport and climbed into the wheel compartment of a plane being prepped for flight.Once inside they were left clinging onto two metal bars inside the cavity.  I was not afraid of falling, because I had faith, said Themba. During the flight, the metal bars became so searingly hot he was left with permanent burns. But in the other extreme, as temperatures plummeted, he only had two pairs of jeans and three jackets to keep him warm. Once the wheel compartments had closed, both stowaways found themselves in pitch black darkness for hours, with the deafening noise of engines to listen to, but Themba said he remained relaxed.  I fell asleep because of the lack of oxygen, that’s why I didn’t see my friend when he fell out, he said.Carlitoaposs body was found on a roof below the Heathrow flight path. Recalling their last conversation, Themba said: Carlito said ‘we made it’. I said ‘Of course we made it, man.apos Those were the last words I heard from him, because I passed out. He admitted he thinks about their last conversation daily, and that he struggles to look in the mirror as a result.  Unfortunately, he’s not here, so I’m by myself now. They still haunt me but I have to keep on going. Every time I face the mirror it feels like I’m missing something. Everything is dferent, this isn’t the way it was supposed to go, I think about him so much. Themba only woke up when his body bounced off the tarmac, having fallen out just before the plane reached the runway. I fell out onto the runway and my leg snapped, he said. Lying on the floor, broken and barely conscious, Themba was then apprehended. He said: “I woke up and all I saw was two people shouting ‘He jumped out of the plane!’. They came and arrested me, and took me to the hospital. And from there, because of the lack of oxygen and cold from the flight, I passed out in a coma for six months. A short while after waking up from the coma, he was detained at the immigration detention centre for another six months.  And despite his perilous journey, he was denied asylum but was granted right to remain. He spent a night sleeping rough on the capital’s streets, before staying at a homeless shelter in Elephant and Castle. He was then moved to Liverpool, but claims there were drink and drug paraphernalia everywhere and so he fled and roamed the streets again.Gabriel Frood, , from Crystal Palace, who was studying in Liverpool at the time, saw him sitting in the cold, and stopped for a conversation. He took Themba in and set up a GoFundMe, which has already raised £, of a £, target. Themba insists that despite the trauma, his journey was worth it, but he wouldn’t repeat his trip.

Jessica Roseaposs thread on Twitter has had hundreds of comments, likes and more than a thousand retweets. Her observations covered language, food, British politeness - and even the queueing system.British people have rising intonation when they say “bye” on the phone so it’s a bouncy “byYEEE” and why do you people do that, she asked. She also wondered: Please why beans on toast there are so many other lazy foods that are actually good why is this a thing  Jess was also perplexed by fishfinger sandwiches, Brits rushing to rocky beaches and the pronunciation of certain words.  I have been living in the UK for  years this year. Please have a short thread of things that are still weird as hell to me, she wrote on Twitter. People here put fish fingersin sandwiches which is just...why. Britishes pronounce “patronise” pat-row-nize but pronounce “patron” in the expected way and this ergence distresses me. Britishes call their fanciest private schools public schools which is weird and confusing, likely by design.  The thread prompted a lot of engagement, with one follower saying: JESS NO I AM SORRY NO I can get on with the rest of this thread but I cannot believe you are coming for the fish finger butty which is a thing of joy. Jess replied: It makes roughly as much sense as making chicken nugget sandwiches. Iaposm not saying itaposs a bad idea but it is a weird idea.

Despite feeling a strange sensation in his chest, the -year-old got on with his day, completely unaware as to the severity of the situation. It was only when he roped in his we Heather and son Owen to try and track down his missing Apple AirPod headphone and they joked it must be in his throat after hearing a change in his voice that something clicked. He decided it was best to head to the hospital and double check, where staff assumed the food he had eaten to celebrate Heatheraposs birthday must be the cause - but an X-ray told a dferent story. It turned out that Brad had unknowingly swallowed the wireless headphone in his sleep and it remained lodged in his oesophagus - which had caused his throat to fill up with water when he had attempted to swallow the liquid.The results of the X-ray showing the AirPod in his chest left medics equally baffled, as Brad, from Massachusetts, explained: It was pretty funny, when she left the room I could hear a bit of chatter outside - aposNo it couldnapost be apos She came back in, looks at me and says aposIaposll be damned, you swallowed itapos. They were all jaws a slack, looking at this X-ray on the screen where you could see it in such clear definition. Brad had gone to sleep with his headphones in as to not wake up his six month old daughter Avianna with what he was listening to and had somehow swallowed it without waking up during the night.  During his unexplained symptoms, he never suspected the headphone would be the cause until his we made a joke. He said: My we mentioned it when I came in and we laughed about it, but something just clicked and I got a weird sinking feeling that Iaposd swallowed it in my sleep. At that point, I putzed around for another  minutes thinking about it but we all determined itaposd be better safer than sorry to go to hospital. Thankfully, it was able to be removed and caused no serious damage, as Brad admits he was lucky that he can laugh about it now. He added: Had I inhaled it or it had gotten lodged or constricted my airway that could have certainly been a signicantly more serious matter."},{"url":null,"title":"cobbler shares how you can","story":"NewsCobbler shares how you can fix broken zip at home in under  secondsA man has been praised on social media after sharing a simple way to fix a broken zipper at home, a trick which is bound to save a lot of people a lot of moneymirrorShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video cobbler-shares-how-fix-broken-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The man, who posts on the account @originalcobblers, shared the trick in a video which has since amassed more than , views. In the clip he shows people what to do when your zip stops closing and you only need two things to mend it - a pair of plyers and a small hammer. He explains how he often gets customers askingthey can have a new zip because theirs is no longer closing, but actually you donapost need to pay for this. Now a lot of the time you can fix this kind of thing at home with a few very basic tools and Iaposm going to show you quickly how to do it, he says.What we do,you put the zip itself on something hard, give it a hard background. The zip runner itself runs on two plates, top and bottom, they run parallel and after the zip wears a little while, they open up so instead of the teeth interlocking, one sits on top of the other and they donapost close. Our aim today is to tap the back of the zip back into its original position using a pair of plyers on the very back of the zip, so right on the very back either side, a small hammer, we give it a little tap right on the back of the zip runner, not too hard because we donapost want to break it even though itaposs broken, becauseit needs replacing we can. But we always like to try this first... look at that. As he talks he demonstrates how itaposs done on a boot and as he finishes, he pulls the zip closed as heaposs easily managed to fix it without having to replace it.

The photograph shows what initially appears to be an unremarkable outdoor swimming pool with nobody inside the water. Except a circled area of the poolreveals that a child is in fact beneath the water but practically invisible to the naked eye. The child was captured wearing pale blue shorts swimming near the bottom of the swimming pool but because of the colour he would prove dficult to see by anyone observing.Australian Facebook group CPR Kids, run by expert paediatric nurses, shared the image in a bid to warn parents to make sure their children wear visible and brightly coloured clothing while in the water.  On Facebook the group said: Yes, there is a child there, itaposs hard to believe we know. Following on from out post recently on the importance of fluoroand bright coloured swimwear for kids, one of the CPR Kids Educators was at a pool party with friends and noticed how cloudy the water had become after being used all day. She asked one of the children who was wearing a pale blue swimsuit, to swim to the bottom. The result shocked her, as it did everyone in the CPR Kids team. The original Facebook post has attracted hundreds of comments from those who were shocked by the stark image, and it has since been widely shared since it was put online.  ridiculously beautul photos from the Travel Photographer of the Year awards"},{"url":null,"title":"model told cover up plane","story":"NewsModel told to cover up on plane slams trolls trying to shame her over her jobEXCLUSIVE: Instagram and OnlyFans model Isabelle Eleanore, , was told her crop top was inappropriate for flying and was given a hi-vis vest to wear over it during a Jetstar flight from Gold Coast to MelbournemirrorShareCommentsByChris KitchingSenior News Reporter:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video model-humiliated-after-flight-attendant-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The -year-old, from Gold Coast, Australia, was so embarrassed she has vowed to never fly with the airline again. After sharing her story online, Isabelle was bombarded with abuse from haters who claimed she was not entitled to be humiliated because she poses in lingerie and has an OnlyFans account.The abuse became so much that she turned off comments on her Instagram page and told her , followers: There is a massive dference between public humiliation over being fully clothed and being comfortable enough in my own skin to post photos of myself in a bikini lingerie and running a successful business on OnlyFans.Have you had a similar experience recently  Email your story to webnews@mirror. Self-confidence does not mean I am immune to embarrassment, especially at the hands of someone . Isabelle told the Mirror that the she was unfairly attacked on social media. She said: They were saying I’m not allowed to be humiliated because I put my body all over social media and I run an OnlyFans, so how can I be embarrassed when I post my body on the internet, which is so wrong. I was being publicly humiliated at the hands of someone but just because I am confident in myself to show my body on the internet doesn’t mean I’m immune from embarrassment.I am within my rights to wear whatever I want to wear and that really shouldn’t be questioned in . Isabelle said she was given a boost by positive message from people saying they hope their daughters grow up to be as strong as I am and to stand up for themselves in situations like this. Isabelle was boarding a Jetstar flight from Gold Coast to Melbourne on Monday night when she was stopped by a flight attendant and asked to wear a jumper over her crop top. The flight attendant told her You canapost wear a bikini and called over other crew members as they looked for something Isabelle could wear.The flight attendant then ed with a hi-vis vest for the model to wear until she disembarked in Melbourne two hours later. Isabelle, who was travelling with her husband Jeremy Szwarcbord, felt embarrassed and degraded as she wore the vest while walking down the aisle in front of other passengers. She said her crop top wasnapost inappropriate or revealing, and believes she would have been treated dferentlyshe had smaller breasts or was a man. Isabelle said she spoke to eight other Jetstar staff members before boarding and none of them mentioned anything about her clothing being inappropriate. Low-cost airline Jetstar later apologised and said there was a misunderstanding of its policy on the part of the flight attendant. The airline does not have a policy regarding crop tops. Jetstaraposs website states there are minimum dress requirements for its flights and offensive clothing is banned. Isabelle said she appreciates Jetstaraposs underwhelming apology but has no plans to fly with them again. The companyaposs front office told her the flight attendant was acting on non-current policies. She said: I want them to make sure that this kind of situation doesn’t happen again. I don’t want anyone to go through that."},{"url":null,"title":"teenage stowaway miraculously survives 250","story":"NewsTeenage stowaway miraculously survives -mile flight from London to NetherlandsThe boy, , thought to be Kenyan, was found next to a plane which touched down at Maastricht Airport - and could have come all the way from Nairobi via IstanbulmirrorShareCommentsByAnna HighfieldJonathan Coles:,  FEB NewsThe flight departed London Stansted and landed at Maastricht Airport \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Our free email newsletter sends you the biggest headlines from news, sport and showbizWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities.

Some do exist, however, and while not attempting to be a comprehensive history, there is a nicely illustrated booklet about the hospital and its past entitled #Up The Brae#, produced a few years ago by Brenda Bratt, Jess Grant and my former colleague Dr Grace Fergusson .These photographs are a reminder of the loss of a signicant social and economic element in the fabric of Mid Argyll, where for generations it would have been dficult to find a family without some connection to #the AB#. For those who worked there, myself included, any sadness however is much more about the loss of a self-sufficient and widely respected mental health service.I was a late participant in the story of the AB, being appointed physician superintendent in , a post I held in addition to that of clinical director for mental health services for Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire until , and I feel a duty to the many splendid colleagues with whom I worked to comment on the loss of the service in which the AB served as the nucleus.During the course of   the hospital was awarded the accolade #Best Mental Illness Hospital in Britain# as the result of a national competition launched by the King’s Fund and sponsored by the Sunday Times. This was a recognition of the multi-disciplinary spirit and enthusiasm for innovation that characterised the service, and the ethos of best clinical practice being led by academic excellence. The service went on to be recognised as a centre of excellence by many visiting accreditation bodies.My reason for making these points has nothing to do with nostalgia.The past has no utility in the present or the future except as a source for learning how best to proceed.The ingredients for a good mental health service are the same today as they were in  and they have little to do with buildings or even location. Staff have to feel they #belong# to something there must be a collegiate spirit binding together the ious disciplines shared professional development and peer support and clear lines of accountability. It is frankly hard to see any such features in the current delivery of mental health care.Someone once said #psychiatry isn’t sexy#, meaning that in any competition for resources with other clinical specialities, psychiatry will always lose, and so to get the best out of the NHS for folk with psychiatric disorder, exceptional effort is required. The achievements and values of the past can act as a springboard for such effort, but here they seem to have been squandered by a distant and disinterested health board.It is all too easy to avoid investing in a service by reorganising it into invisibility, but the people who pay the cost are those who deserve the best of specialist professional help.So I am certainly sad at the disappearance of the old AB, because it is symbolic of something having been lost that is much more important than stones and mortar.Professor Angus Mackay OBE FRCPsych, ArdrishaigSir,Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns over whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But though customers# usage of data more than doubled, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m also proud of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.We#ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland Director, Alexander Graham Bell House, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 8 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is ridiculous. I have attended  years of meetings on the A and all we get is fobbed off with pathetic excuses.We need a government which will deliver results, not spend all its time plotting to get independence while ignoring the real issues like a closed A which blight people#s lives.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,As we move into  and parents, teachers and pupils once again find themselves facing additional challenges to deliver and attain a full and rounded education, it is worthwhile remembering the role that music can and should play in improving our lives.Firstly, music will help to support and sustain our young people through the coming months. For children and adults alike, the creative arts play a vital role in promoting wellbeing and positive mental health, providing both a means of expression during the isolation of #lockdown# and a practical as well as enjoyable pastime.Secondly # and just as importantly # playing an instrument is complementary to academic subjects and has been shown emphatically to improve wider educational success. As we consider the often daunting challenge of theto home schooling, those parents whose children can mix domestic timetables with musical lessons will understand the release and stimulation playing an instrument can deliver.Across society music is integral to our identities and is made to be shared. We now have the means to do that successfully and safely with online tools whose use has been well-honed by recent experience.So whether you#re at the start of a musical journey, or are well advanced in music-making let#s keep singing, keep dancing and keep music lessons flowing, particularly while the restrictions necessitated by the pandemic keep us apart in our own homes.Dr Kenneth Taylor, head teacher, St Mary’s Music School, EdinburghSir,As Scotland faces a second national lockdown, the country#s national walking charity, Paths for All, is encouraging the public to explore local walking routes in a bid to help combat social isolation, anxiety and loneliness while maintaining physical health.The call follows the launch of the charity#s Walk Once a Day this Winter campaign, which asks people to make the pledge of walking every day throughout January.The campaign includes an online hub which outlines the importance of walking and regular physical activity during the winter months. A iety of activities and ideas, designed to motivate iniduals of all ages, are available on the hub with podcast recommendations, creative walking advice and prize incentives.In what is traditionally the time of year which sees a surge of gym memberships and fitness plans we suggest taking up walking instead as part of our new year resolutions.With walking being one of the few essential reasons for leaving your home, it is the perfect exercise and now is the time to get into a walking exercise routine which is consistent with the current government guidelines. Walking can help with our social health as the guidelines allow us to meet with one person from one other household outside.Last year we saw an increase in Scots taking up walking during the first lockdown and the outcome has highlighted just how many benefits are attributed to walking and how outdoor exercise as many times a day as we can has become an important way to look after physical and mental wellbeing.Follow the campaign over on Paths for All social media channels #WalkOnceADay.For more information on the Walk Once a Day this Winter campaign, visit the Paths for All website.Ian Findlay CBE, chief officer, Paths for AllSir,The New Year is usually a time for a fresh start – making resolutions, getting fit, setting new challenges and goals.

The revised guidance recognises that travel is severely restricted by law and owners may only travel to their boatit is kept in the same local authority area they live in.RYA Scotland, Sail Scotland and British Marine Scotland have joined together to encourage boat owners to use the services of staff where their boat is stored,at all possible, in an effort to avoid making a journey, to respect that storage providers may not be able to open and to advise owners to contact providers before travelling to confirm access.The information is tailored towards RYA affiliated clubs and recognised training centres as well as inidual members and the wider boating community across Scotland.James Allan, chief executive officer at RYA Scotland, said: #Lockdown will be disappointing for everyone, but it is still possible to go boating as a form of exercise and spending some time afloat or near the water is great for our wellbeing. It is important to remember we are in the grip of a pandemic that has become signicantly worse in recent weeks. The overriding message for Scotland’s boating community is to stay at home wherever possible as we must all help stop the spread of the virus.#Importantly in this lockdown, owners may travel within their local authority to undertake essential maintenance on their boat but may not stay longer than theof time required to undertake essential maintenance.To check what level of measures apply in your area or venue where you intend to participate in activity, please check the postcode on the Scottish Government webpage.In the meantime, RYA Scotland has decided to postpone its directly organised, non-virtual events and training in response to these measures to protect participants, volunteers and others and to reduce the risk of placing an additional burden on the emergency services at what is a hugely testing time.The RYA will be providing a range of online events and #SailFromHome activities. RYA Scotland will continue to host online sessions for clubs and training centres and deliver its regular podcast #Off the Water# to keep the boating community informed.PIC:Owners may only travel to their boatit is kept in the same local authority area they live in. _aTarbertHarbour"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 15 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In the end he agreed a deal that the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation described as #desperately poor# and #the worst of both worlds#.Fishermen are restricted to catch fewer fish in most key species. Lorries carrying stocks that have been caught were left to sit at Larkhall – unable to penetrate the new fog of bureaucracy. Scottish fishermen are forced to land the fish they can catch in Denmark, which is grim news for Scottish fish processors.Instead of trying to fix the problem, Tory Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg says the fish are happier to be British. Of course they are # the fishermen aren’t catching them.The Tories must sort out this mess they have created. Our fishermen and fish processing workers deserve better than silly remarks about happy fish.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,In order to avoid fishermen being adversely impacted by export delays, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross has called on the UK Government to bring forward compensation to the affected fishermen and deliver it immediately.The SNP government must also accept responsibility and deal with ongoing issues involving their agency, Food Standards Scotland, which are holding up exports within Scotland.Both of Scotland’s governments must work together to deliver for Scottish fishermen.We in the Scottish Conservatives will back Scotland’s fishing communities all the way.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,The Scottish SPCA is appealing to animal lovers in Scotland to donate much-needed food to its National Wildle Rescue Centre in Fishcross, Alloa.Scotland#s animal welfare charity had its busiest ever year in  with over , wildle casualties admitted.The pandemic caused quite a signicant drop in the number of animals arriving at the wildle hospital. Over , wild animals were brought to the centre in .As we are entering fox cub season, we are appealing for Pedigree puppy food and puppy milk.Last year, we cared for  foxes, of which  were cubs. It can be a struggle to keep up with so many hungry mouths to feed.We expect to be even busier with admissions this year so we need help from members of the public.If anyone can help with food for these young mammals, we would appreciate anything that people can spare.Puppy meat can be purchased from the wildle centre#s Amazon wishlist http:amzn.to xkUe.Steven Gray Scottish SPCA National Wildle Rescue Centre managerSir,New Year resolutions can be a good starting point for making longer term health and lestyle improvements, but most people do not stick to them. Reasons for quitting include a lack of time, a lack of support from other people and feeling daunted by unrealistic targets.Often, goals are unachievable because they are too dficult, or they do not allow enough time for you to make gradual changes.There is nothing wrong with aiming high and being ambitious, but it is important that your goal is not too dficult or time-consuming as this could leave you feeling daunted.Ask yourself the following questions: Is the goal too ambitious  Is the timeframe realistic  What specic changes do I need to make  Can I fit my new healthy behaviour around my other commitments Breaking large goals down into smaller goals can make them feel more achievable and less daunting.For example,you are aiming to lose weight, the NHS recommends that you aim to lose around  to lbsa week. You should be able to achieve this by cutting down your calorie intake by about  to  calories each day. It might take longer than planned to lose the weight, but you are more likely to stick to it and not give up.Plan how you will achieve your goal and what changes you will make to ensure you stick to it. There are online resources available to help you plan your healthy activities, such as the NHS couch to km programme or the NHS programmes for stopping smoking, cutting down alcohol and losing weight.Try to be patient and don’t expect the results from just one or two weeks of dieting to show on the weighing scales, as it may take longer.A good way to motivate you is to involve other people. If you know someone who has a similar goal to yours, try to involve them as a #buddy# to provide mutual support.They may even be able to push you a little bit harder, helping you to achieve your goals sooner. Look for groups on social media who share your goal.If you miss a fitness session or have an alcoholic drink, cigarette or bar of chocolate, try not to feel guilty. Think about what might have triggered the deviation from your goal and try to avoid it in future. Forgive yourself and aim to get back to achieving your goal as soon as possible.On average, it takes between  and  days for something to become a long-term habit. Make goals that you want to be able to stick to long term, such as improving your overall fitness, stopping smoking or maintaining your weight.If you can make it through these first few weeks, you will notice that things will become much easier.Dr Helen Flaherty, head of health promotion and education, Heart Research UK"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 22 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We can set up a chat within  hours and the service can be used as many times as needed.James Adams, director, Royal National Institute of Blind People Scotland, EdinburghDear Alister,In the weeks since the UK left the European Union, I have been contacted by numerous Argyll and Bute residents and businesses who share my very deep concerns about the future sustainability and, indeed, the survival of our vital shellfish and fishing sector.The seafood sector is a vital component of our already-fragile regional economy and is now hit by the inability, virtually overnight, for producers and processors to get their time-sensitive products to market or to customers.If allowed to go unresolved, this sector is likely to disappear, badly affecting Argyll and Bute’s overall recovery and future growth.Fish and shellfish from Argyll and Bute are high quality products of international renown.The industry has been a mainstay and a major employer in the area for many decades, sustaining not only the local economy but making a signicant contribution to the Scottish and UK economies.I am now hearing from long-standing fishing families, newer start-up businesses and companies employing hundreds of people that,urgent action is not taken, they will have to close their doors for good.This would be devastating for Argyll and Bute, where the sector comprises many single-family operated vessels, smaller fleets and artisan producers as well as some medium to larger enterprises.As a council we are doing all that we can to support these businesses and prevent this imminent disaster.Our officers are working behind the scenes to assist and are in constant discussions with the Scottish Government to reiterate the critical need for the commercial hubs to operate smoothly, ensuring that the right processes are in place to help businesses get their goods to their customers.We are also speaking to Argyll and Bute producers to help them navigate these new processes and to issue all the necessary paperwork where appropriate, so that these valuable products reach buyers.Delays on both sides of the border have already seen valuable products being lost, together with valued customers who are seeking their produce where.Very urgent action and assistance is needed now from your government in order to prevent this traditional Scottish industry sector from disappearing altogether.Most urgently of all, getting products to market must be streamlined, simplied and speeded up.These products need to be prioritised over products with longer shelf lives –the situation is allowed to persist then very many companies will have no choice but to give up, costing jobs and much-needed revenue to the treasury.In addition to improving processes and the speed of delivery here in the UK, these businesses, so vital to Argyll and Bute and Scotland’s economic recovery and future success, need your government to negotiate urgently with its counterparts in Europe to identy and resolve the delays in allowing fresh goods to arrive in and then to progress on to customers.I cannot state strongly enough that these actions are needed now. More is required, though, in the medium and longer terms, to help this beleaguered industry to get afloat again and regain some buoyancy.Producers and customers need reassurance that future supplies will be prioritised and to regain confidence in the industry through dedicated marketing and investment where possible through the £m fisheries fund your government announced following the publication of the agreement.Our seafood sector desperately needs Government to take action to secure its survival. Please do what you can, urgently, to avoid its demise.Robin Currie, Argyll and Bute Council leader"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 29 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Since the first lockdown measures were introduced, the average monthly number of referrals from the NSPCC’s helpline to agencies in Scotland, such as the police or children’s services, have been more than  per cent higher than the first three months of . And the effects are far from over.Even with social distancing, there are still many ways you can fundraise for us. From hosting a virtual quiz or coffee morning to selling handmade crafts, cakes or old clothes, we’ve got lots of great virtual fundraising ideas you can try while following the Scottish Government’s advice on social distancing.By volunteering just a couple of hours each month, fundraising in your local area, you can help make  a better year for children.So please think about using your new year passion and enthusiasm to come up with some ideas to fundraise and help us be there when children need us most.To find out more or to request your fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk support-us events-fundraising new-year-challenge or email jen.lindsay@nspcc.org,ukJen Lindsay, community fundraising manager for NSPCC Scotland.A new survey by the Stroke Association shows that  per cent of people in Scotland don’t know that high blood pressure is the biggest risk factor for stroke, one of the leading causes of death and disability in Scotland.This is really worrying because . per cent of people in Scotland have high blood pressure.Smoking, drinking alcohol, being physically inactive and sitting for long periods, can contribute to high blood pressure, diabetes, and being an unhealthy weight, all of which increase your risk of stroke.You can start to reduce your risk of stroke by making small changes to your lestyle.To launch the first ever national Stroke Prevention Day on January , we’ve worked with our partners at the Rotary Club, LoSalt and OMRON Healthcare to help you make #OneSmallChange to reduce your risk of stroke.It’s often easiest to start off small and pick something that’s achievable for you.This may be swapping your after-work alcoholic drink for a soft one, getting up and moving regularly during the day, cutting down on salt or sugar, or joining an online exercise group.Just go to our website www.stroke.org.uk PreventionDay and receive tailored advice plus monthly emails with hints and tips.We would like you to pledge to make the change for three months, then let us know how you get on and how you found ways of sticking to your pledge.The things you tell us will help others across the UK to reduce their risk of stroke and lead a healthier lestyle in .Juliet Bouverie, chief executive, The Stroke Association. "},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week january 15 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

My initial thought a few years ago was that the best solution to the problem of landslides on the Rest was building avalanche tunnels like there are on the A at Lochcarron but there is practically zero ground to build on on the downhill side of the A.The big catch-pits along the uphill side of the road do seem to work but, in the long-term, removing the unstable soil and planting lots of trees and shrubs on the rest of the hillside to hold it in place, might be the best solution.Rather than replace the road through the Rest and Be Thankful with a new route through another glen or to continue trying to stop an unstable hillside from obeying the laws of gravity, how much would it cost to remove all the soil in these watercourses which regularly slide Maybe cost-wise removing the unstable soil from the Rest would be cheaper # and quicker  # than building a whole new road If there is a landslide in a watercourse, it weakens the soil directly above it so that will slide next, followed by the soil above it, etc. The bedrock at the Rest is only a couple of feet below the surface so removing the soil in gullies liable to slide after rain might be a lot cheaper than building a new road through another glen.For a permanent solution, perhaps close off the road from Ardgartan to the Lochgoilhead junction for six months in the winter, pipe water from Loch Restil to the top of the gullies prone to sliding # at the base of the first exposed bedrock high up the gullies # let the water run for three or four months, and hydraulically remove all the loose soil, then in the spring shovel all the accumulated debris of the other side of the road It would mean short-term inconvenience for a lot of people but it might save a lot of money, time, and perhaps lives, in the long-term.Harry Hood, New Hampshire, USA. As children and young peopleto being home-schooled due to the new lockdown, there is no doubt that this will have a continued detrimental impact on mental health and wellbeing.As a coalition, we applaud the Scottish Government’s greater investment in mental health services. However, a view we share with other organisations, is that this investment is simply not sufficient.Mental health services were already under immense strain prior to Covid-, with children waiting considerable s of time for support. Recent statistics from December, for example, point to the fact that more than , children have been waiting over a year for treatment.This pandemic will only serve to make matters even worse as services deal with a backlog of those already suffering from mental health problems, added to which will be those who have developed problems over the course of lockdown.What is needed is a national crusade, delivering signicant investment in the public, private and third sectors to deliver adequate mental health support, both during and as we recover from Covid-. We must also use this as an opportunity to radically transform our mental health services, both for now and for the future, refocusing on prevention and early intervention.In the meantime, we would urge those children and their families who feel they need help not to hold back and look to get the support they need.The Scottish Children’s Services Coalition: Kenny Graham, Falkland House School Lynn Bell, LOVE Learning Stephen McGhee, Spark of Genius Niall Kelly, Young Foundations.The serious neurological condition Myalgic Encephalomylitiswill sadly be all too familiar to some of your readers at least , children and adults in Scotland live with ME, also diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome .Many face barriers in accessing health and social care services that meet their needs, and some professionals still don’t understand the impact of ME and its symptoms.UK charity Action for ME is trying to change this by offering people with ME across Scotland one-to-one advocacy, via phone and email, to help them be heard, understand their rights and access support.We want to expand this much-needed service, and are seeking enthusiastic volunteers in Scotland who can make the most of our online advocate training programme to develop their skills, gain valuable experience, and help improve the lives of vulnerable people with ME, all from home.Anyone who is interested in finding out more can call , emailor visit our website– we would love to hear from good listeners who can spare two hours a week.Alice Cranston, advocacy coordinator, Action for ME."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I’m anticipating an end to the pandemic – coming out of the gloom. And there have been many episodes in le in which I’ve lived in the hope of emerging through the other side of the dark night. I thank God for the hope he gives me. But, how do we know when the darkness of night has ended In a rabbinic school, a very old rabbi posed a clever question to his young students: #When can it be said that night truly ends and the day begins  When is that moment when from darkness there comes light, when it can really be said the gloom has passed and brightness is here #The first student, still a bit immature, replied: #Well, it’s when it says so on the internet.#The rabbi smiled and told him: #That’s not what I mean.#The next student said: #It’s when you can distinguish sheep from goats, because in the dark they look very similar, but when light appears they can be told apart.#The rabbi told him it was a wiser answer, but not the one.The third student said: #When you can tell the fig tree and palm tree apart.#This interested the rabbi, but, no, this wasn’t it. The rabbi askedthere were any other ideas, but there weren’t. So he told them the answer: #It is when you look at another person and do not see a stranger but a brother or sister this is when know the night has ended and the day begins.#Father Tony Wood, Saint Kieran#s Catholic Church, Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish charities urge government to invest in walking","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

After nearly a year of people taking exercise and essential journeys on foot during Covid- lockdowns, plans to keep the nation walking are more important than ever.#The increases in people walking, has highlighted the lack of good infrastructure to support safe and enjoyable travel by foot. Communities that lack local facilities within walking distance have had challenges.

During lockdown, we have seen a rise in the number of people walking as many used it as a way to cope with the pressures of everyday le, to reach essential shops and services in their  area, and to connect with others and nature in a safe way.#But we need to do more to make regular walking an enjoyable and accessible choice for everyone in Scotland, from all walks of le.

It will be aired on March  at pm.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOPressure piled on for quick Irish ferry decisionPressure was growing earlier this week on the Scottish Secretary to give Caledonian MacBrayne the go-ahead to operate the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Ballycastle in Northern Ireland.Scottish Office officials are said to oppose state-owned CalMac’s participation in the project.But earlier this week it was revealed they had asked CalMac to submit a business plan for the route. The news was welcomed by the prospective Conservative candidate for Argyll and Bute, Mr Ralph Leishman.He told the Courier: ‘This is a definite step forward and knocks on the head suggestions that the Scottish Office is totally opposed to CalMac as the operator on this route.’Scottish Office reservations are believed to centre on proposals to use the MV Claymore on the route. This would mean £, would have to be spent upgrading another vessel for relief work for its west coast services.They are also said to be concerned that no private firm appeared to be interested in running the service all year-round.CalMac’s participation in the project has been backed by politicians on both sides of the Irish Sea.Both Scottish Secretary Mr Michael Forsyth and Prime Minister Mr John Major were believed this week to have been lobbied at Westminster by CalMac’s supporters.Northern Ireland secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew is said to be among those who have contacted Mr Forsyth to support CalMac’s involvement.The project supporters have been asking the Scottish Office to consider the economic benefits the ferry could bring to Ballycastle and Campbeltown, which are both areas of high unemployment. The project is expected to create around  jobs,  of them in Argyll.The only other company which has expressed an interest in running the service, Seacat, only wants to operate it over a four-month summer season.FIFTY YEARS AGOMr Noble ill # so Provost steps in to open new airport terminalThe new passenger terminal at Machrihanish Airport will be opened on Friday at pm by Provost Dan McKinven, in the absence of Mr Michael Noble MP Minister of Trade, through illness.The new building, which has been provided by the Department of Trade and Industry in conjunction with the Ministry of Defence, is a small one situated within a self-contained enclave and is designed to improve the facilities of BEA passengers using Machrihanish.Before the terminal was built, all BEA passengers had to be taken by bus between the aircraft and the old terminal building near the main entrance of the airport, and, latterly, to a dispersal point on the south side.Under the new improvements, BEA aircraft will now taxi directly to the new terminal area, and passengers will be able to walk the short distance from the aircraft to the terminal.A new road traffic control system has also been provided because aircraft taxiing from the runway to the terminal have to cross a public road.The new arrangements have the additional advantage of reducing the distance, and, consequently, the journey time between the airport and Campbeltown.A complete shake-up of BEA Highland services is on the way. It could mean higher fares and smaller planes and the end of the name British European Airways on some routes.Last year the Highlands and Islands routes cost the company more than £,.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and FlashesThe annual meeting in connection with the Campbeltown Cottage Hospital will be held on Tuesday first at . in the Council Room.Local footballers had again an idle Saturday last week on account of bad weather.

His solution is even more batty.Driven by resentment and sepia-tinted post-Empire English nationalism, cloaked in talk of Britain and the UK, the Tories have jemmied the UK out of the world’s largest and most successful single market.Having placed the UK as a #third country# outside the EU, alongside Somalia and Kazakhstan, it is not the EU to blame for the barriers to free trade, Mr Abendroth, but the UK government and those who parroted the cruel myths of Brexiteer #sunny uplands#.Mr Abendroth suggests that the fishing industry merely sells into the domestic market as a replacement to EU trade, without thought to the timescales required to repurpose supply lines and create a viable home market # evenit could be done fishing businesses would already be bankrupt.Scotland’s economy and the living standards and opportunities of Scots have been thrown under the wheels of England’s red Brexit bus. Never have the consequences of permitting Westminster to rule our country been more stark.But the time is coming when Scotland will have the historic opportunity to regain the huge benefits of EU membership and become a normal, thriving, independent state at the heart of Europe. There is an empty seat at the top table in Europe # and it won’t be empty for long.Ron Wilson, secretary, Kintyre SNP.Remember the closing stages of the Brexit negotiations  Boris Johnson pretended he was holding out to get the best deal for fishermen. In the end he agreed a deal that the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation described as #desperately poor# and #the worst of both worlds#.Fishermen are restricted to catch fewer fish in most key species. Lorries carrying stocks that have been caught were left to sit at Larkhall – unable to penetrate the new fog of bureaucracy. Scottish fishermen are forced to land the fish they can catch in Denmark – grim news for Scottish fish processors.Instead of trying to fix the problem, Tory Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg says the fish are happier to be British. Of course they are – the fishermen aren’t catching them.The Tories must sort out this mess they have created. Our fishermen and fish processing workers deserve better than silly remarks about happy fish.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal ward.Keith Abendroth is spot on with his call for the fishing industry in Campbeltown to supply the home market.During my three-and-a-half years in the town it was possible to buy directly from the boat on occasion but it was nigh on impossible to buy fresh live lobster in the town#s fish shop.When I was new to the town , I experienced some shocking service at the some of the small retailers who I always endeavour to support. It is easier to get a full range of seafood and fish in Peebles, about  miles from the sea, which has an excellent fish shop supplied from Eyemouth on the East Coast.Much Welsh shellfish is sent by air to Europe. I often wondered why lorries trundled from Campbeltown across the Rest and Be Thankful and all the way to the English Channel crossings.Much of the st century supply chain is a mystery to me. For instance, much Pacic wild salmon is processed in China before being exported to the UK.  It is an excellent alternative to the farmed version at roughly the same price.Surely a town with an airport could develop a sea product freight service or is it simply down to volume, weight and cost Mark Davey, Peebles.Two weeks ago, at Campbeltown Free Church, we received a letter of thanks from Blythswood Care for filling shoeboxes to support the  Shoe Box Appeal.However, we are aware that many who contributed do not belong to Campbeltown Free Church.So, through the pages of the Courier, can I thank them for their kindness towards people they have never met but whose lives have been enriched by their generosity Dr Rodger M Crooks, Campbeltown Free Church minister.Like many, many other residents in Argyll and Bute I have received through the post a bizarre leaflet from the Liberal Democrats. Bizarre, because it promotes a candidate standing in a completely dferent seat # Caithness, Sutherland and Ross.Meanwhile, the good folk of Caithness, Sutherland and Ross have been equally mystied as to why the hapless Lib Dems have sent them leaflets promoting a candidate in Argyll and Bute!The Lib Dems have certainly lost their way when it comes to their policy on the EU # but it seems that they#ve lost their way in Scotland too.Les Wilson, Islay.Earlier this month the Prime Minister announced a third national lockdown. Although necessary, these measures mean many of our veterans will be facing the next several weeks – or months – completely alone.And while the vaccine rollout out across the country provides some hope, social isolation and loneliness poses a real threat to our elderly this winter, among them many former RAF personnel and their partners supported by the fund.To help combat this, last year the RAF Benevolent Fund introduced a weekly Check and Chat service to support members of the RAF Family experiencing loneliness. I speak to one such gentleman every Tuesday. He lives alone and spent much of  totally isolated and, for him, this service truly is a leline. We chat about what he’s been up to, what he’s cooking for tea, to his time in the RAF and often I’m the only person he will speak to for days.The fund also organises weekly telephone friendship groups, provides access to a listening and counselling service, relationship counselling support, and an online wellbeing portal to help support emotional wellbeing amongst the veteran community.Throughout the pandemic, many of us have learnt more about our neighbours and local community. That’s why we are calling on the people of Scotland to consider whether they know any RAF veterans, or their spouses or widows, who may be experiencing loneliness.To refer someone to the RAF Benevolent Fund, please visit rafbf.org or call   .Air Vice-Marshal Chris Elliot, chief executive, RAF Benevolent Fund."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 29 2021","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I cannot help but think that it bodes well for the future of that great nation to have a man of faith leading it.Returning to the words, some of the finest and most moving that day came from a young woman called Amanda Gorman.She spoke of lting the gaze of the nation not to what stands between its people, but to what stands before them, of closing ides because they know that, to put their future first, they must first put dferences aside.#The new dawn,# she said, #blooms as we free it. For there is always light,only we’re brave enough to see itonly we’re brave enough to BE it.#In the first chapter of his Gospel, John says: #The light continues to shine in the darkness and the darkness has never put it out.#We are called, all of us, to be part of that light and to be bearers of it into a dark and troubled world. May we rise to that call, as the new president rises to his."},{"url":null,"title":"walk raises more than 2000 for children 1st","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The industry has been a mainstay and a major employer in the area for many decades, sustaining not only the local economy but making a signicant contribution to the Scottish and UK economies.#Now, though, I am hearing from fishing families of long standing, newer start-up businesses and companies employing hundreds of people in total, thaturgent action is not taken, they will have to close their doors for good.#This would be devastating for Argyll and Bute, where the sector comprises many single, family-operated vessels, smaller fleets, artisan producers as well as some medium to larger enterprises.#As a council, we are doing all that we can to support these businesses and prevent this imminent disaster.#Our officers are working behind the scenes to assist and are in constant discussions with the Scottish Government to reiterate the critical need for the commercial hubs to operate smoothly, ensuring that the right processes are in place to help businesses get their goods to their customers.#We are also speaking with local producers to help them navigate these new processes and to issue all the necessary paperwork where appropriate, so that some of these valuable products reach buyers.#He added: #Most urgently of all, getting products to market must be streamlined, simplied and sped up. These products need to be prioritised over less time sensitive products with longer shelf lives –the situation is allowed to persist then very many companies will have no choice but to give up, costing jobs and much-needed revenue to the treasury.#In addition to improving processes and the speed of delivery here in the UK, these businesses, so vital to Argyll and Bute and Scotland’s economic recovery and future success, need your government to negotiate urgently with its counterparts in Europe to identy and resolve the delays in allowing fresh goods to arrive in and then to progress on to customers.#I cannot state strongly enough that these actions are needed now. More is required, though, in the medium and longer terms, to help this beleaguered industry to get afloat again and regain some buoyancy.#"},{"url":null,"title":"district news february 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

A new-build, fit-for-purpose hub will be used as a meeting place, a thriving place for all ages, groups and clubs to come together in a stunning environment.SID believes that a community hub will play a pivotal role in the area#s long-term recovery from the pandemic, joining the dots between people that require support – connecting them to a range of services to promote inidual and community wellbeing.SID already has £, secured in match funding from Glenmorangie, the owners of the nearby Ardbeg Distillery. This existing commitment demonstrates the strong private sector partnerships in place and their support for the island#s communities.Hamish Torrie, CSR director from the Glenmorangie Company, said: ‘We, the Glenmorangie Company, have been working for many years on the development of this project with SID and the South Islay community.#We are delighted that SID has secured the funding which will, at last, enable the playing fields project to move to the next stage of its development. The community hub will be vital in sustaining the fabric of south Islay for the future.#SID now needs to secure a further £, in match funding to reach its target to deliver the full project. Part of this will be secured through the launch of a community shares initiative within the coming weeks.This project has been in development for a number of years and is anxiously awaited by the community which has shaped it over the years.Local development officer Alyson MacGillivray said: #SID and the community of South Islay have been on a long journey to get to this point. We are so excited to share this very exciting news with our community, particularly after the challenging  months we have all endured – some positive news is just what the community needs at this time.#SID’s chairman, John Findlay, said: #This is a fantastic project that will benefit not only South Islay but the whole of the island. It will give the community a real boost particularly during these challenging times.#I would like to take this opportunity to thank the SID staff: Alyson MacGillivray, local development officer Bonnie Wood, project manager and Fiona Aitchison, finance and admin officer, for all their hard work on this project and in securing substantial government funding.#My thanks also go to the SID board of directors who, through their voluntary roles, have supported the staff every step of the way.#Robin Currie, leader of Argyll and Bute Council and councillor for the Kintyre and the Islands ward, said: #This is tremendous news for Port Ellen and indeed Islay as a whole. This will be a wonderful and much-needed facility for the island and my thanks to SID for all its hard work thus far.#Fellow Kintyre and the Islands councillor Anne Horn added: #It is fantastic news that SID has been successful in securing a grant from the Scottish Government Regeneration Capital Fund to enable the long-awaited development of the pavilion into a community hub.#This will be a fantastic asset for Port Ellen and for the whole island of Islay. Very well done to everyone for their hard work seeing this plan come to fruition.#South Islay Developmenthas been involved in the development of Port Ellen and its surrounding area since .The organisation was originally established to help address some of the long-term employment and poverty issues in the area and has seen signicant success during its time in operation.A range of capital and revenue projects has been undertaken including development of the only filling station in the area, new motorhome pitches and the harbour pontoons and office in conjunction with partners.Fèis Ìle, a week-long celebration of Scotland’s most distillery-packed island with whisky, music, dancing and more, has had to be cancelled for the second year running due to the Covid- pandemic.Organisers had their fingers crossed that it would be possible to hold the  event between May  and June , but that has proved impossible.In a statement, they said: #With deep regret we announce that this year’s festival is cancelled.#Keeping everyone safe is our top priority. Eventravel to Islay is allowed, the ceilidhs, tastings and large events that make the fèis what it is, will not be able to take place.#We also need to allow for the fact that people need to be able to make their plans to travel and stay.#The dates for the  festival are from Friday May  to Saturday June  and, regarding those who already hold tickets, fèis organisers confirmed they will #be in touch soon about refunds, or transferring to #.The statement concluded: #Islay and its businesses would love to welcome you back when restrictions allow.

Seaman, HMS Skye. Five children at home, much older than he appears, likes children, very friendly. Headed for Jamaica. Was a fisherman, now a shoe salesman.#Scored out below the address is another # #No  Roading Place# # which may have been a previous address, as it appears that Douglas visited the Caseys# house twice # once in May  and again in September .#We’d love to find his family,# Gloria told the Courier. #He was married with five children so we’re hopeful there will still be family in the area.‘In , he was headed to Jamaica, where the UK had a Fleet Air Arm base, so that in itself is a signicant part of his history – not everyone went there.#When you read about these men, snippets about their lives and little bits about their personalities, it makes it very personal. They became like members of the Casey family, whose house became like a home from home for them.#They were given an opportunity to get away from the horrors of going back and forth across the Atlantic with the U-boats picking them off.#We’d like to post copies of the photographs, which the families will never have seen before, to the men#s relatives # we don’t ask for any money or anything in .#Gloria can be contacted by email at historiangmw@hotmail"},{"url":null,"title":"from our files february 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

John Reid and Alex Harvey judged the tractors.Two pairs of horses competed for the first time since .TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOKinloch Park trees face the chopA number of historic trees in Campbeltown are facing the axe.A recent survey of trees belonging to Argyll and Bute District Council has revealed as many as  are in poor condition and may need to be felled.The sycamores at Kinloch Park are amongst the worst hit. The survey, by a private consultant, revealed  trees were causing concern.A number of trees around Kintyre Park have also been identied as suffering from internal fungal rot. The other  trees causing concern are spread around the town. They include at least two at the council offices in Dell Road. The trees at Kinloch Park have suffered damage to their bark over the years and this is thought to have contributed to the rot.Councillors were expected to meet officials to discuss the situation on Wednesday. Councillor George McMillan told the Courier: ‘It is a great pity about the trees that will have to come down. The trees at Kinloch Park have been there as long as anyone alive can remember.’The council#s policy is to replace any trees which have been felled. Councillor McMillan said he hoped it might be possible to phase the felling over two years.The trees were planted shortly after the park was created in the early s by infilling the shallow mudflats between Campbeltown and Dalintober.FIFTY YEARS AGOQuay mishapWestern Ferries# Campbeltown-Ireland vessel the Sound of Islay was delayed on Monday when a large articulated lorry slipped while being reversed on board.The cabin unit of the lorry, which is owned by local contractor Mr William McMurchy, was hitched to a trailer loaded with timber.

Indeed the #evil# Tories are currently in negotiations with the USA, Australia and New Zealand for trade agreements which again would not have been either allowed or possiblewe had been tied to EU regulations.Had the SNP secured independence, it remains to be seenthe EU would have accepted Scotland into the EU, given the financial deficit it currently endures and continues to do so thanks to the current pandemic.Perhaps I should remind Mr Wilson it is the UK government that has managed to secure Scottish jobs using the furlough scheme and secured Covid- vaccinations for all of the UK which seems to have rattled the EU cage that Mr Wilson also occupies.I do agree with him, however, had Scotland been an independent country then his submission of being linked to Somalia and Kazakhstan would be near the truth.Finally, my suggestion to Scottish fishermen was stated in good faith and a possible way out of problems they are experiencing with the EU at present when there was no need to alter the arrangements in place prior to the UK leaving the EU.Knowing from previous items published by the Courier on behalf of Mr Wilson, this is the only time I intend to respond and will continue to polish my brass neck!The vote to leave the EU took place in June , four and half years ago # four and half years in which to start making plans for changes to counter loss or reduction of the existing market for fish products in Europe.I haven#t read of any such plans but, of course, that will be the fault of Westminster the government there should have found new markets for Scottish fish. Doubtless, the government in Holyrood, that is perpetually demanding more powers be devolved to it, was far too busy organising Indyref to spend time looking after the livelihoods of Scottish fishermen.It was obvious that concessions had to be made by both sides in any trade deal, post-Brexit, and it was inconceivable the EU would accept any deal that totally blocked EU boats from our waters instantly. However, Alan Reid and Ron Wilson, it is not bureaucracy on this side of the Channel that is slowing the movement of goods to Europe # that blame lies entirely with a vindictive EU, determined to punish Britain for having the temerity to leave a failing, despotic authority.Ron Wilson, you claim the time is coming when Scotland will reap the benefits of EU membership. Can you explain to me how a country with a massive deficit, . per cent of GDP before the pandemic hit and astronomical now, can even apply for membership, when to qualy a country has to bring its deficit below three per cent Add to that the fact Nicola Sturgeon has affirmed an independent Scotland will retain the pound sterling as currency and EU rules state that a country in monetary union with another country, outside of the EU, cannot under any circumstances join it.Instead of complaining, give thanks that the people of Scotland are being vaccinated now, not in four months# time at best, had we still been dependent on the EU to supply the vaccines.It is being reported, both by opposition MSPs and the national press, that Scotland#s vaccine strategy is being outpaced and starting to seriously lag behind the other three UK home nations and that the SNP has no desire to convene a vaccination task force nor take up the offer of additional British military personnel, to further assist NHS Scotland.Yet, in this time of national emergency, is it not extraordinary that the SNP, Scotland#s devolved administration, has set up a task force to campaign for independence.Rick Warren wrote in The Purpose-Driven Le: #Humility is not thinking less of yourself, but rather thinking less about yourself.#Can Scotland#s domestic government, the SNP, think less on independence and more on beating Covid- and our schools, hospitals and jobs The bins on Kilkerran Road were not collected on Friday last so I left the bin as it would normally be collected the following morning, even though on a weekend.When midday on Saturday came and went, I checked the council website to find out that a vehicle breakdown was the cause of the non-collection and the bins would be collected when a vehicle was available.I left the bin out fully expecting it not to be collected before Monday. To my amazement, at .pm on Saturday afternoon the #freighter# came trundling along and emptied all the bins along Kilkerran Road.This is truly remarkable to have the bins collected not only on a Saturday afternoon but on a freezing cold day into the bargain.These council employees on bin collection, grounds and gardens maintenance deserve every praise and thanks that we the public can bestow.These are the front-line people who keep our town clean and tidy, cemeteries in prime condition and they are often taken for granted.Next time you see them, take a minute to say thanks. They deserve it and more.I have been visited by a Gigha milk #fairy# # or should it be brownie I have been the very appreciative recipient of a large bottle of delicious Wee Isle Dairy milk on a number of occasions. It has appeared asby magic on my back door step.I would love to be able to say thank you to the kind person who has thought of me at this time of lockdown and shielding # thank you Gigha milk fairy, you’ve made me smile!"},{"url":null,"title":"loris lockdown campaign against litter louts","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Also, help to educate our children, as they are our future.#An Argyll and Bute Council spokesperson told the Courier: #We are very grateful to residents who take pride in their local communities and want to help keep them litter free.#Under the Environmental Protection Act, local authorities are responsible for litter collection at the side of the road and we work with BEAR Scotland and Transport Scotland to try and minimise litter.#That people would leave litter anywhere is shameful, but to discard it at our beautul roadsides is a disgrace. Roadside litter is a particular challenge because of how dficult, dangerous and costly it is to remove.#Half of the litter on Scotland’s roads comes from people eating and drinking in their vehicles, so do the right thing – take it home with you.#Members of the public can report concerns on our website at: Looking after your streetsor by calling  .#Lori, who can be contacted by calling  , added: #Thank you to the very supportive council bin men who picked up the six bags collected from day one and took their time to speak to me.#If anyone wants to support me by donating a litter picker, bin bags or gloves, that would be most useful.#Wake up Argyll folk and get picking!

We are delivering the vaccination across a large and challenging geography, during winter, while simultaneously coordinating iable supply of vaccine products.#The challenge really cannot be underestimated but it is thanks to all the staff involved with this programme and the tremendous effort they have put in that we have been able to deliver the vaccine to, as it stands now,  per cent of our population.#Given our remote and rural geography, the majority of the delivery of vaccine to the public will be coordinated by our GP practices, which are ideally located and experienced to do this, given they support our flu delivery programme so well every year. We will, along with Highland and Argyll and Bute councils, provide any additional resources and support that they need to do this successfully.#For our staff in more remote and rural areas, the vaccination is being coordinated by local teams. In Inverness, we are currently using the Centre for Health Science as a location for larger scale delivery.#Dr Davidson explained that one particular challenge was the contact and scheduling of non-NHS frontline staff for vaccination. NHS Highland has a dedicated team in place to support this in the south and mid areas of Highland where the number is largest.He said: #Feedback from colleagues, both those who are vaccinating and those who have been vaccinated, has been positive. We’re also hearing good feedback from those who have been vaccinated by our colleagues in general practice.#We know everyone will be keen to get their vaccine as quickly as possible but would ask that you all please be patient.#We are working our way through the priority groups and you will be asked to attend for your vaccine by your GP practice when it is time for your vaccine. Please don’t call them, they will contact you directly for your appointment.#Dr Davidson added: #Delivery of the vaccine has been exciting to see but it is important to remember that this is only one part of how we can win this fight against Covid-.#Protection for an inidual following vaccination may take weeks to develop and the extent to which vaccination prevents spread of Covid is still unclear. That is why it is so important that, as well as taking up the opportunity to get vaccinated when you are contacted, that we still continue to follow the guidance on how you can keep yourself and others safe.#Please follow FACTS: wear a face covering, avoid crowded areas, clean surfaces, keep a two metre distance and, what I would really like to stress, the importance of self-isolating and booking a testyou have symptoms.#"},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week february 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In winter, there is the prickly holly bush. Another evergreen is a camellia whose leaves have a shiny, smooth surface and, of course, there is rosemary with its stems of small, slender, fragrant leaves so valued as a herb in the kitchen.Perhaps leaves are like people. We can sometimes encounter some prickly characters who leave us taken aback and hurt by their harsh words.On the other hand, some people have a gt for smoothing out dficult situations and whose personalities just seem to shine.Then there are people who at first sight seem insignicant but on getting to know them bring fragrance and blessing.Soeverything in the garden is going to be lovely, we need to learn to respect each other and realise we are all dferent, dferent in beliefs, colour, personalities and political convictions.Former Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks described that respect as #the dignity of dference#. All major religions teach the importance of understanding one another and practising tolerance of dferent views.Christianity’s great exponent St Paul gave us this advice: #Clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. Bear with each other and forgive one anotherany of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.

animalsrsquo excrement was also creating a slip hazard on the footpath.Now, a political party and a bird control expert have called on the local authority to look again at the options available.Among those calling for a rethink is the Animal Welfare Party.Kay Hamilton, Dowager Duchess of Hamilton, is a member of AWP and said: ldquoThe birds certainly shouldnrsquot be killed.ldquoThis is ridiculous and all out of proportion.ldquoNor should the council be thinking of installing netting, as we know many birds can become trapped in netting and suffer horribly before dying.ldquoAlternative solutions

and time for us to accept that we share our spaces with wild animals, including pigeons, and humane solutions should be pursued.ldquoIt is an offence to cause unnecessary suffering to an animal, and nets cause nesting and visiting birds the most horric distress and injury before death by hanging, starvation or dehydration.Guy Merchant, of Bird Control Consultancy Services International , told the Courier that carrying out a cull would be ldquoa waste of time and money.Similarly, he suggested that putting netting under the width of the bridge could create other problems, such as trapping live birds, which could then lead to legal issues.Mr Merchant, who previously lived in East Lothian and operates his business from Cambridgeshire, said: ldquoThe very best thing you can do is mesh above the pavement area.ldquoYou completely mesh above the pavement area so you are excluding the birds from either side but leaving the central reservation open.ldquoThat means that the cost of the netting operation is dramatically reduced and, secondly,you kick all the resident birds out from the under the bridge they are going to go to peoplersquos properties in Dunbar and cause a huge nuisance.\"Mr Merchant said that left the birds to roost and perch in the central reservation of the bridge and their droppings would fall onto the road, rather than the pavement.At a meeting of Dunbar Community

How can anyone doubt the threat this poses, and go around feeling insouciant and safe  At a time when every shop door handle holds the menace of a grenade, such an outlook is unfathomable.Yet it is not as uncommon as you might think. Nor is it linked to intelligence or education, or lack thereof. For whatever reason, baffling though it is to those of us who trust reliable sources of information, there are countless iniduals who are adamant that Covid is either a hoax, a conspiracy, or a fuss about nothing and that the vaccines are intended to wipe us out. Behind all this lie malevolent manipulators, intent on...well, quite what they hope to achieve by terrying or killing us off remains unclear, but the fear remains potent.Astonishingly, not all Covid naysayers come to their senses when they fall victim. Last autumn, as cases in the US soared, there were reports of victims gasping for air in the emergency room, yet still insisting that Covid was fake. That really does take the breath away. ROSEMARY: In praise of JennersSomehow, though, it feels worse that anyone here could also deny it. It is not aswe live in a chaotic or rogue state, where we have been deluged in unchallenged propaganda or starved of reliable information. Nor is that information dficult to access. Indeed, one of the most miserable aspects of the past year has been the dogged coverage of escalating tragedy: footage of mortuaries filled with the dead, of serried ranks of coffins in funeral homes, of the mortally ill saying goodbye to their loved ones from behind oxygen masks.Do Covid deniers never watch, listen or read the news, or do they tune in only to what they want to believe  Certainly, down the rabbit holes of social media it is possible to find yourself in a netherworld, so far from reality you could be a character Alice in Wonderland. Except that Alice kept her wits about her, and never lost her grip on sanity.Alarmingly, as is becoming clear, the pandemic is only the latest of the fault lines opening up between people whose world views lie at opposite ends of a spectrum. We can mock thwarted Trump voters who continue to believe that the election was rigged, despite not an iota of evidence to support that conclusion. Unlike Covid, where the facts are omnipresent, the US election result has been contested without any foothold in reality. Believing the Democrats cheated says more about protestersrsquo state of mind than about what the ballot boxes contained.And yet, their certainty and grievance are real therersquos no denying that. Nor is any of us entirely immune to being manipulated by tricks or lies. You can point to the Brexiteer threats of a tsunami of immigrationwe stayed in the EU as an egregious hood, but many of those who swallowed it whole were already at a point where it merely bolstered their convictions, rather than shaped them.When it comes to medical denial, there is a long and sorry history of refusniks. Just think of John Gummer, obliging his daughter to eat a beef burger on camera to show that there was no danger of Mad Cow Disease . The government similarly played down the dangers of contracting salmonella from eggs, until Edwina Currie spoke up.The more facts and figures we are bombarded with, in our never-sleeping news cycle, the trickier it becomes to find a reasonable position between unquestioning credulity and healthy scepticism. For years it was possible to be a climate change denier, and remain intellectually credible. Now, yoursquore considered nuttyyou still donrsquot get it.What is troubling about those who refuse to believe what is happening around them, despite the evidence of their own eyes, is that it doesnrsquot make sense. It suggests wholesale disparagement, mistrust or terror of those who run the country, a determination to find hidden and sinister motives behind every announcement and regulation.Some deniers, doubtless, have no guiding principles or cosmology whatsoever, and simply prefer to ignore the wider world beyond their walls. In general, though, the level of suspicion and the passion with which untenable beliefs are held are motivated by something far stronger than lack of engagement. Discrediting Covid even when it has you in its grip denouncing global warming, despite the wildfire sweeping over your house, suggest advanced paranoia and a sense of persecution. ROSEMARY: In the footsteps of medievel pilgrimsNor is such an outlook entirely unreasonable at all times. Leadership in many countries is at worst despotic, and at the best, frequently mendacious, opaque, contradictory and evasive. Traditional media outlets deliver news that is properly researched and sourced, yet often biased in tone or emphasis. And the web is awash not just with documented fact but with misinformation that goes largely unchallenged.The fact that anyone can seriously and sustainedly deny Covidrsquos existence is merely the tip of an iceberg wersquove been trying to ignore. It is a shocking demonstration of a breakdown in societal trust and cohesion. When people refuse to acknowledge reality, and choose instead to believe what they want to believe, facts, truth, testimonies, photographic or recorded proof are cast aside as irrelevant.Despite the decline in religion in the West, maybe there is an ongoing hunger to put faith in the unprovable and intangible, an urge for creeds and a community of the likeminded based on unveriable feelings and imaginary connections. Who knows what makes people enter a parallel world to the one beneath our feet. Personally, however, I find the idea that facts and evidence no longer matter even scarier than Covid.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Its asTony Blair had sacked Gordon Brown in . It has brought to a head three isions which have shattered the unity of the Scottish National Party: the Salmond affair, the transphobia row and the lack of progress toward independence.Ms Cherry had called for Alex Salmond to be readmitted to the party after he was acquitted of all sex harassment charges last year. This did not endear her to the party leader. Next week, Mr Salmond is scheduled to give evidence to the Holyrood inquiry investigating how the Government came to lose a total of pound, fighting a doomed defence against his judicial review in . There has been a clearing of the decks in advance of this appearance, in which the former leader is expected to blow open the conspiracy he claims led to his downfall.Read more: The jury found him innocent but Alex Salmond is still on trialMs Cherry has also been an inconveniently outspoken supporter of womens rights. Indeed, she may be the first senior politician to be sacked for believing that a woman is an adult human female. She is a lesbian and a feminist who does not accept that womens sex-based rights should be sacriced on the alter of an ideology which denies that sex is binary. In short, she does not believe ldquotranswomen ARE women. For months, Ms Cherry has been the target of vilication, abuse and even death threats from numerous trans activists in and out of the party.This is such an arcane issue, baffling to the vast majority of Scottish voters, that it seems hard to believe it could have come to this. But Nicola Sturgeon has staked her reputation on driving through a new Gender Recognition Act which will allow men to self-identy, legally, as women merely by making a declaration to that effect. Last week the First Minister made a thinly-veiled attack on Ms Cherry in a video accusing her own party of transphobia. Yesterday, amendments to the much-criticised Hate Crime Bill that would have protected ldquogender-critical women like Ms Cherry from prosecution for ldquostirring up hatred were suddenly withdrawn by the Justice Secretary, Humza Yousaf.The key amendment gave freedom of speech protection to ldquodiscussion, criticism or rejection of concepts or beliefs relating to transgender identity. It also protected ldquostating that there are only two sexes and using the words ldquoman and ldquowoman to define a persons sex. The deletion of these amendments could mean that women who object to the presence of natal men in their changing rooms, or in womens sporting events, may in future be committing a criminal offence.The SNP NEC has been trying to enforce a new definition of transphobia in which even the phrase ldquoadult human female would itself be regarded as hate speech. However, it is also the dictionary definition of a woman, andquoting it is to be regarded as transphobia then there might have to be a bonfire of biology textbooks. Universities could have trouble teaching medical students about binary human reproduction.Read more: Dont tell women what makes a woman: they were born that wayMs Cherry is an experienced advocate and the best legal mind in the SNP. She took Boris Johnson to the Supreme Court in  over his prorogation of Parliament and won. In recent months she had been advocating a legal route to independence through court action on Indyref. This is a route which Ms Sturgeon has reportedly endorsed herself. So it might seem perverse to dispense with the services of the only figure in the party with the legal expertise to prosecute it. But in the SNP right now legal expertise appears to be regarded as a threat.These issues have been boiling and roiling beneath the surface of SNP politics for the last two years. The waves of scandal have been lapping around Ms Sturgeons ankles as she tries to deal with the pandemic. Now, rather like Chairman Mao in , she has decided to deal with troublesome opposition by launching a purge, and giving a green light to trans activists in her youth wing, who are highly organised on social media.There is a generational ide in the SNP. Many younger nationalists are zealous advocates of identity politics. Older, analogue politicians, like the former Justice Secretary, Kenny MacAskill tend to side with Mr Salmond and Ms Cherry. The influential Wings Over Scotland blog, penned by the Rev Stuart Campbell, which was essential reading for independence supporters in , is now calling for the resignation of Ms Sturgeon and the ldquowoke legions who are her new praetorian guard.Wings has been assisting the former British diplomat, Craig Murray, in his attempts to disclose details of the alleged conspiracy against Mr Salmond. Mr Murray is in turn defending himself against contempt of court charges relating to the Salmond trial. Another prolic SNP blogger, James Kelly of Scotland Goes Pop, has called on Mr Salmond to launch a new independence party.Like most SNP intellectuals, Mr Kelly had been arguing that it would be senseless to promote ision on the eve of a crucial election which could trigger independence. The SNP lead in the polls indicates a landslide in May. However, he now believes the situation is so dire that the two wings ndash no pun intended ndash can no longer coexist.The truth is that many in the party no longer believe that Ms Sturgeon is serious about delivering independence ndash at least not in any timescale they would regard as acceptable. Thousands have reportedly left in disgust. Ms Sturgeon dominates Scottish opinion polls and the opposition parties are disarray.

First: the expertsare going to be subject to what is now known as The Govian Response, or ldquoWhat do experts know anyway  The report will also be subject to the Look Over There! Response, which involves ignoring the central conclusions by talking about something  instead.This, in effect, is what Fiona Hyslop, the Scottish Governmentrsquos Economy Secretary, did when she was presented with the findings. ldquoAs an independent member of the EU, she said, ldquofree from the damage of Brexit, Scotland would be part of the huge single market, which is seven times the size of the UK.But that completely ignores what the LSE report actually said ndash what they call the independence paradox. No one denies that Scotland,it rejoined the EU, would be part of a huge single market, but what Ms Hyslop ignores is that the EU is a much less important trade partner for Scotland than the rest of the UK and would remain so for a long time to come, even after rejoining the EU. MARK SMITH: The dilemma every unionist is about to encounterIt is this fact that sets up the paradox. Yes, rejoining the EU as an independent country would boost trade with the EU, but it would also lead to an increase in trade costs with the rest of the UK. What this means is that, in order for Scotland to be better off inside the EU, independence would have to destroy a sufficiently large share of our trade with the rest of the UK to make the EU Scotlandrsquos most important partner. This is the paradox: for joining the EU to be economically desirable, independence would have to damage our current economy.Sadly, a lot of that would happen naturally, which is the other part of the report that jumps out at you. When neighbouring countries, or regions, or countries in a close union, set up borders between each other, trade between the two starts to decline big time and this is what would inevitably happen to Scotland for reasons that arenrsquot just economic. Look at this bit of the report: ldquoborder costs result not only from economic policies, such as tarfs, but also from cultural and social dferences between nations that reduce the effectiveness of international communication or lead consumers to prefer domestically produced goods and services. MARK SMITH:Why support for independence is up hellip and the three groups of voters who are still resistant to YesThe logic of that is undeniable ndash you put up a fence, itrsquos harder to talk to the guy on the other side and miscommunication develops. The bit about consumers preferring domestically produced goods and services is also disturbing, isnrsquot it  I can see it now: ldquoBuy Scottish! ldquoBuy English! And the English would have much less to lose ndash trade between RUK and Scotland accounts for .% of RUK output compared to % of Scottish output.The SNP would saythat the lost trade with the rest of the UK would be made up by increased trade with the EU ndash just as Brexiteers said lost trade with Europe would be made up by trade with the rest of the world. But the LSE report makes the reality of that clear: the rest of the UK would remain our biggest trading partner for a long time to come, except that, under independence, the trade would be in terminal decline.In a way, I think thatrsquos the hidden sadness of this new report. No doubt, some of the economic damage of independence would be countered by increased trade with the EU, but those cultural, social and personal dferences the report mentions are a dferent matter altogether.

The Inclusive Growth Commission revealed uncertainties over currency, central bank and foreign reserves, presaging at least  years of super-austerity, tax rises and service cuts and an extended period before even attempting to qualy for EU membership. The Scottish Governments annual GERS figures show a huge pound billion hole in the Scottish Governments annual budget. These findings are not surprising: while it is always possible to find an economist or two to support the nationalist cause, the vast majority of respected economic opinion holds that independence would be a disaster.Independence is a low priority for Scots, ranking below health, education, poverty, the cost of living and the economy in recent polls. Isnt it time to abandon independence and concentrate our political energies on addressing the peoples real priorities rather than pursuing a course which would, on all the facts and evidence, make us so much poorer and undermine our ability to improve society in the ways that the of Scotland people really want Alex Gallagher, Labour Councillor, Largs.LSE REPORT IS NOT CREDIBLETHE LSE report claiming Scots will be pound.k poorer per capita after independence is not credible.First, the Covid crisis means no longer-term economic forecast is reliable, so what data was used  Did the authors account for the city of Londonrsquos shrinking tax base and the slower growth resulting from the Brexit own goal Second, it only looks at trade and assumes a loss for Scotland. But why should we be the only country rUK would refuse to trade freely with  For starters, it will desperately need our energy and water, not to mention our high-quality food and drink.Third, the report admits there is no actual income loss, only dferential growth rates, meaning the bankers and Charlotte Square investment trusts would see a decline in their wealth, not a bad thing. Real incomes in the UK have been flat for decades, a reason Scotland needs independence so it can control the economic levers and craft tax and spending policies to attract investment, grow and share prosperity more widely.Fourth, Scottish economic growth as part of the UK has been half that of similarly-sized EU countries. More than  EU countries with smaller populations than Scotland have higher incomes, pensions, le expectancy and less poverty and inequality than the UK, but none has our abundance of natural wealth.Finally,Scotland is so poor, rUK should want us gone.

As we have previously set out, our ambition is to offer all priority cohorts vaccination by spring and that remains our position.Later during a daily briefing with journalists when it was pointed out that the Cabinet Officersquos erroneous announcement was still online, the spokesman paused and then said: ldquoI was wrong in my initial answer in relation to the Cabinet Office press notice. It isnrsquot actually being withdrawn.Askedit was, therefore, now the case that all nine priority cohorts would be vaccinated by the beginning of May, he replied: ldquoAgain, as the PM has said our priority is to offer all the priority cohorts vaccination by spring. The precise timeline will be set out on February  when the current target of vaccinating groups one to four expires.Pressed that No  was now saying, on the one hand, the Cabinet Office timeline was correct but, on the other, it would not confirm this was the case, the spokesman said: ldquoErm, Irsquom saying, erm, erm, what the PM has repeatedly said, in terms of what the ambition is, erm, erm, for offering priority roll-outs for vaccination and thatrsquos by the spring.He pointed out the official timeline was dependent on the availability of supply but the Government was ldquoextremely confident in the success of our vaccines programme and remain on track to meet this ambition.According to Whitehallsvaccines delivery plan, some  million people across the UK are estimated to fall into the first nine groups.The Government is on track to vaccinate the first four cohorts by February  ndash including NHS and care home staff, care home residents, and all those aged  and over.So far, more than .m people in the UK have received their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine.Categories five to nine include all those aged  and over, as well as adults aged -

The researchers ignore any tax changes designed to boost exports or any investment in new export industries after independence. This is virtually to rig the calculations to reach a pre-determined outcome.No wonder the principal author admitted on the BBC Scotland Nine programme that the report should be ldquotaken with a pinch of salt.

Several health care professionals with many years frontline experience volunteered to help administer the vaccines and were either rebuffed or put through \"training\" before they could be used. This \"training\" included ersity, equality and gender modules.I thought the vaccine rollout was all about getting needles into arms with the greatest possible speed and efficiency regardless of the lestyle of the recipient. Obviously I am wrong.Celia Judge, Ayr.* I NOTICE that Paul Teenan, who makes scathing remarks on the vaccination roll-out, is a former surgeon. I am a former GP with younger family members, who are also GPs, working on the frontline. I would not dream of commenting on the efficiency of the vaccination delivery as I am not involved and I do not know. Locally, I can say that it is very well organised indeed.Dorothy Dennis, Port Ellen.THE A SHOULD BE A PRIORITYI READ with great interest your article on the Scottish Governmentrsquos plan to improve public transport systems in Scotland . It beggars belief that the A at the Rest and be Thankful only gets ldquoimproved resilience, while light rail and metro systems in the Central Belt seem to take priority.The A is the only connection for much of Argyll and the islands beyond. There is no railway line. Having travelled extensively in alpine regions in mainland Europe where trunk roads that are at risk from landslides and avalanches, galleries are built to protect the roads from closure. This is the only way forward for the A instead of the piecemeal efforts to date.While I acknowledge improvements to the public transport system in the Central Belt would be wonderful, I feel that the importance of the leline of the A should not be overlooked.Marjorie Macintyre, Stirling.LET OUR LEADERS WALK THE WALKCATRIONA Stewart makes the important point that our politicians are good at talking the talk on public transport and associated \"green\" issues. Many of us remember the proposal round about  to double the subway with another loop out to Parkhead in time for the Commonwealth Games, and we are well used to seeing politicians and civic leaders getting on, or merely straddling, a bicycle when a new active travel initiative is announced.Sadly, we rarely see them walking the walk. How many of our politicians and leaders commute by train, by bus, by bike  They can all make the excuse that they have so many meetings, so many places to go that they really do need that private car, along with its expenses and private parking at City Chambers, or wherever they work.If public transport is going to work then we need changes from the top, with politicians and others travelling out to Castlemilk and Easterhouse, and to the well-heeled areas of Kelvindale and Pollokshields, by bus, subway metro, train or perhaps even the bike.Patricia Fort, Glasgow G.THERE ARE MANY CAPTAIN TOMSI NOTE with interest Rebecca McQuillans article .There are many Captain Toms of both sexes, in care homes, living alone and soldiering on, or with family, stoical, kind, modest and unsung.Captain Tom caught the nationrsquos heart and raised many millions of pounds.

At Holyrood their numbers are reinforced by a smattering of serfs willing to abase themselves in the hope of garnishing their otherwise unremarkable CVs.The Labour Party presents a model case for prosecution under the Trades Descriptions Act. Their leader, Sir Keir Starmer each week fastens the red rose more tightly to the Union flag, the armed forces and a non-aggression pact with the Tories in the class struggle, the only war that ought to matter to this shambles of a party.The Scottish Greens occasionally look like they represent their supporters. Yet, as the hounding of Andy Wightman has shown, this party exists solely at the pleasure of Patrick Harvie and his obsession with sexual identity. A lot of public money is spent each year keeping this group of self-indulgent performance artists in a job and expensive office suites just so Holyrood can look erse and inclusive. KEVIN McKENNA: Third World needs vaccineItrsquos in the recent behaviours and conduct of the SNP, though, that the contamination of public le is most grievously evident. Their leader, Nicola Sturgeon, and a host of her most unquestioning acolytes have manipulated the transgender issue and deployed it to squash all opposition in the party, especially those who have dared to criticise its glacial pace towards a second referendum on independence.If you retain any doubts about how far this party will go to weaponise any seemingly innocent cause consider its new Equalities Mechanism. This lists a bewildering suite of physical and mental impairments that qualy as lsquodisabledrsquo for the purposes of securing preferment on the partyrsquos Holyrood list of electoral candidates. If it was an organisation other than the SNP, yoursquod be inclined to view it as a genuine attempt at widening access. In this party, though, at this time, you know that it will be used to reinforce the credentials of a favoured few.What lends a sinister edge to the party within a party which has begun to emerge in the SNP is the malevolent intent of some who have hollowed it out. It risks permanently disfiguring the legacy of Ms Sturgeon.This is what can happen when a party has been in power too long and there is no meaningful opposition. When Ian Blackford, its Westminster leader, gets to his feet and opens his mouth to squawk another little bit of Scotlandrsquos reputation for integrity and eloquence slinks away mortied to die.Of course,you measure this on numbers alone you might be gratied by that run of polls indicating persistent support for independence. Letrsquos be honest here: such is the toxicity of Boris Johnson and the Faragists who have occupied the UK Conservatives that Osama Bin Laden would have fancied his chances against them in Scotland.Itrsquos a massive grt and an expensive con trick played on the Scottish people who were assured  years ago that Scotland would become home to a new kind of politics. In this, the interests of ordinary workers would be paramount in the long-term goal of redistributing wealth and tilting the scales in favour of the many. In , though, we find that the dial hasnrsquot moved at all. To cover its failures the SNP ndash in power for  of those years ndash has opted instead for government by announcement and a series of applause breaks.It has become home to a self-indulgent class of political hustlers leeching on power and putting their stage-managed whims ahead of real issues by using their superior connections and networking skills gathered on dozens of approved leadership courses. KEVIN McKENNA: SNP duping supportersTwo decades of devolution have produced this land of make believe where nothing is as it seems and all the main players are actors who have forgotten what it was they once actually stood for. Civic Scotland has thus become a chilling re-working of the Truman Show. In this version, we are all the schmucks, believing that what we experience each day is real and that the men and women who shape our lives really are working for social improvement and a fairer society.Underpinning all of it is a press and media where too many journalists are eager to touch the hem of power in the hope of a cosy, well pensioned adviserrsquos job or a position in one of Holyroodrsquos pet lobbying firms. Theyrsquod rather be exchanging Christmas cards and affectionate DMs with the FM and her Stepford cabinet. Defending her at every turn is preferable to holding her to account.This political land of moonbeams and unicorns doesnrsquot actually celebrate dference but imprisons it. Only a state approved and orthodox ersity is permitted, underpinned by a lexicon of words and phrases to sort out the wheat from the chaff. When Irvine Welsh had Renton spit those immortal lines in Trainspotting at Corrour station  years ago he couldnrsquot have known that they have become prophetic. ldquoItrsquos a s***e state of affairs to be in, Tommy, and all the fresh air in the world wonrsquot make any f****** dference!The sweetness of independence will be soured knowing that in order to achieve it we had to keep this shower of inauthentic charlatans in large salaries, swollen expenses and gold-plated pensions to achieve it.

There’s a whole chain of businesses in Orkney negatively affected by this.“It beggars belief that, during a pandemic and with an economic recovery effort underway in the islands, our own local authority would bypass Orkney businesses in this way, threatening local jobs in their own community.#What happened to their ‘buy local’ ethos  There’s also the issue of sustainability to think about and the impact of shipping stone all the way from Oban to Orkney, when it’s available right here on our doorstep.#Hard questions need to be asked about how a situation like this could possibly arise, particularly during a pandemic when the economic welfare of our community should be a top priority.“I’m fully aware that, by drawing attention to this issue, I’m probably doing my own business no good at all in terms of future orders from Orkney Islands Council, but this is much, much bigger than Orkney Aggregates.#This is about proper, transparent procedures and the massive, negative impact this questionable decision will have for our community.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Diplomacy is back.US State Department spokesman Ned Price said the ministers had ldquoaffirmed the centrality of the Transatlantic relationship in dealing with security, climate, economic, health, and other challenges the world faces.He added that Mr Blinken ldquounderscored the US commitment to coordinated action to#overcome#global challenges. The statement offered no other details.Mr Biden has turned sharply away from the ldquoAmerica first policies of his predecessor, former President Donald Trump, on issues such as climate change and Russia. One of Mr Bidenrsquos first acts as president was reversing Mr Trumprsquos withdrawal of the US from the  Paris climate accord. vw,vw,px, px\"President Joe Biden: lsquoAmerica is back. Diplomacy is backrsquo Mr Biden said on Thursday the days of the US ldquorolling over to Russian President Vladimir Putin were over.He committed to reversing Mr Trumprsquos order to withdraw US troops stationed in Germany and ending support for Saudi Arabiarsquos military offensive in Yemen.Britain, which is heading the G- group of industrialised nations this year and is set to host a global climate conference in November, has welcomed the United Statesrsquo renewed focus on engaging with its allies around the world.The UK is also seeking new ways to exert influence now that it has left the European Union, such as working with small groups of like-minded countries on major issues.copy -.

In the islands, Highland and rural areas and villages across the country, BBs and self-catering properties are often the only tourism accommodation, and the spend by their guests supports these fragile economies.“The business owners on today’s webinar were understandably very concerned that the poorly-drafted ‘Short-Term Lets’ licensing legislation would be hugely onerous to microbusinesses in Skye and right across Scotland and would be a catastrophic ‘double whammy’ after these very same, small family businesses have been so disproportionately hit by Covid-.”SkyeConnect maintain that the fees for licensing accommodation with the council could be as high as £, per business. that the process to determine the fees has not been completed, and urged those affected to respond to the Parliamentary consultation before the cut-off date of this Friday. The draft regulations, published just before Christmas, will then be considered by the Local Government and Communities Committee.A spokeswoman added: “The fees are not proposed to be the subject of a statutory instrument but instead are at the discretion of each local authority to set. However, the fees must be set to ensure they are sufficient to cover the local authority’s administrative expenses.“In order to calculate this, it requires work to be carried out with our finance department as to the cost of processing and determining a licence taking into account income vs expenditure. It also requires to take into account the cost of resourcing the new licensing regime including factors such as recruiting additional staff, building and IT costs.“In terms of setting dfering levels of fees, this also needs to be assessed based on whether the processing of these applications will take longer, ie be more costly to administer.“This is an ongoing exercise and ultimately cannot be completed until the draft Regulations are finalised and we know for certain what types of letting premises will or will not be included within the licensing regime. Once this is known, it will require a paper to go to the Licensing Committee on the setting of fees for their determination.” she had “raised the concerns of constituents# with the Housing Minister Kevin Stewart. She also stressed the importance of responding to the consultation.She added: “I fully understand the concern of those across Skye and Lochalsh. In particular, I realise that the tourism industry has been through the most awful time. To that end, the deadlines associated with this have been extended to April  so that the sector has some breathing space. The purpose of the licensing scheme is a set of mandatory standards which apply to all short-term lets and I imagine that the vast majority of hosts already comply with all of these standards – and more.”A working group is currently being established to develop guidance, she said, and there will “definitely be a representative from the BB sector, as well as self-catering to “influence, inform and shape” that guidance.She also maintained that the Scottish BB Association responded to both Scottish Government consultations on the issue, in  and , and were “clear that they were in favour of levelling the playing field between BBs and properties listed on s such as Airbnb.”Ms Forbes added: “In terms of fees, there has been much concern about fees of several thousand points. The Scottish Government has not specied the specic fee level that local authorities should charge, and there is scope for local authorities to consider setting dferent fees for dferent types of short-term lets.“As the MSP for Skye and Lochalsh I will ensure that the concerns of SkyeConnect and others are passed on to those steering the legislation through parliament.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CARBOST-SHOP-1.jpg","title":"community purchase secures future for carbost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe project was delayed due to the first covid lockdown and since then the Carbost Community Shop Community Interest Company has been working hard to organise the legal side of the purchase.: “We are so pleased that everything has gone through at last and the current owner, Sharon Thacker, has been so supportive and patient during the whole process.

Officials recommended approval.A motion tabled by Skye councillor John Gordon to reject the application was seconded and supported by Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and fellow Skye councillor Calum MacLeod. It was defeated by eight votes to six.A statement on behalf of a number of Stein locals opposed to the Morgans’ development said: “Obviously, the community is shocked and deeply disappointed at the decision made at planning committee yesterday.“It is widely felt that what we are seeing is the result of a planning system that is broken. A system that has lost all integrity of intention and total collapse in community trust and respect. Everyone is talking about it.“It would seem, that a system of double standards exists, where one set of rules apply to the long-standing residents and a dferent set for the speculative, corporate developer who demonstrates no understanding interest or empathy for local heritage or the community they impose their developments on.“The progress of this application through planning has totally failed to uphold the objective of the conservation area and fails to recognise the importance of the setting of the listed building. Neither does it take account of the numerous natural heritage and wildle issues raised.”Approving the application “makes a mockery of the term conservation area and neither does the proposal comply with the terms” of Highland Council’s own local plan, the statement said.It added: “From the moment this application, with very signicant potential for detrimental impact, was accepted into the system amidst the strictest part of the pandemic lockdown, it has been felt that it sought to subvert the right of the local community to fair comment.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/James-Rebanks-and-dogs-credit-Andrew-Heading-edited.jpg","title":"we can learn a lot from old henry of the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineHis debut book, ‘It’s A Shepherd’s Le’ — which I stumbled on by accident— went on to become a best-seller.It’s a wonderfully evocative account of the massive challenges and privilege of being a hill farmer in the fells of the Lake District.Like all good writing, it doesn’t feel like reading you are just taken on an effortless journey of the imagination.I’ve never been to the Lake District myself, but from all accounts it’s quite spectacular — a bit like our own Highlands — and Rebanks captures that vividly.But what comes across more than anything is the sense of privilege he feels from being connected to the land, the massive challenges of trying to make a living from a harsh environment and his profound sadness that a way of le which was once the bedrock of rural communities is now fast disappearing. The parallels to our own circumstances is quite striking.His second offering, ‘English Pastoral’, offers a bit more optimism. Once again it’s a tremendously easy read and we are back on the fells, among the distinctive Herdwick sheep, the cattle, the characters — in particular his grandfather whose farm he inherited —and the drystone dykes. Except this time we are offered a lesson, and it is one that should make us sit up and take notice.Through charting the history of his home valley, Rebanks shows how agricultural practices have changed over the course of time and goes on to explain how similar trends have taken place throughout the UK and, indeed, across the globe.After the Second World War, governments rigorously pursued policies of producing more and more food. Farmers were offered huge subsidies and incentives, so farms became bigger, semi unproductive land improved through mechanisation and modern practices, and on and on the juggernaut ploughed.Then came the supermarkets. Their over-riding aim was to drive down prices, so farms had to become more efficient. Economies of scale became the mantra. Traditional family farms disappeared, swallowed up by larger businesses, machines became bigger and more expensive and farmers became captains of industry and capitalists.None of this happened overnight, of course, but it is heartbreaking to read of the struggles of the Rebanks’ own traditional family farm, trying to stay afloat financially while competing with the drive for modernisation going on all around them. The le of a hill farmer —or crofter for that matter — can seem romantic, but the reality is often very dferent.Eventually, Rebanks’ father had an epiphany – and it was something that the younger ones had also realised. And it was all to do with ‘Old Henry’.Old Henry was a neighbouring farmer, an eccentric bachelor. As all those around him invested in new machinery and chemical fertilisers, Old Henry never bothered, or even seemed to care.He just continued in his own stubborn way, farming the way it had been done for generations with native breeds of livestock, cutting hay well into the autumn , thistle and weeds adorning every nook and cranny and his old stone barns more a haven for birdle than serving any useful practical purpose.Rebanks always used to take more than a passing glance at this farm. With its vast array of wildle and ancient practices, it reminded him of the way his grandfather’s farm used to be.When Old Henry passed away, the inevitable happened and the farm was broken up and sold to larger businesses. The agronomists came with their scientic degrees to survey the land and assess what inputs were required to transform this antiquated model into profitable production. Their conclusion astounded them: never before had they seen soil so healthy. It required not a jot of chemical input.And here’s the crux of the lesson: Old Henry was onto something, whether knowingly or not. And the Rebanks were to take heed.Over the course of time, as the drive for greater efficiency became ever more necessary, farmers began to specialise in one or maybe two products – whether that was focusing on huge livestock numbers or on a particular crop. Traditional mixed rotation became a thing of the past. It was seen as unnecessary, as chemical fertilisers and pesticides could ensure continued productivity and profitability.But, through time, it all led, perhaps inevitably, to the destruction of the soil and natural environment. The evidence was there all along, but perhaps no-one had the time or inclination to see. The farmland birds — the curlew, the lapwing, the corncrake — were disappearing the earthworms, such a crucial indicator of soil health, non-existent. ‘Modernisation’ had come at a very heavy price indeed.And so the Rebanks family began to reassess. Fast-forward to today and their family hill farm now derives part of its income from subsidies geared towards environmental improvement: from the hedgerows planted, the trees, the fenced off waterways, from ious bits of wildle havens dotted around the farm.But, be under no mistake, this is still very much a working livestock business, just that the main enterprise is now dove-tailed with nature and bioersity, just as it once was through natural occurrence back in his grandfather’s day.There is a growing realisation that this is the way forward for agriculture and land use – and might even be a way of getting the wider populace to warmly embrace the countryside once again.Due to simple economics and geography, a lot of the ‘modernisation’ of which the book speaks passed crofting by, so who knows maybe we could be in the vanguard of this new agricultural and land-use enlightenment – given the proper vision and the right political will, of course.As Old Henry of the fells so ably demonstrated in his own idiosyncratic way, there’s a lot to be said for the old ways. Maybe it is time to re-connect with the past."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/363-Katherine-Dix-Ceit-at-spinning-wheel-outside-Nissen-Cottage-from-Alison-Dix-daughter-via-EM.jpg","title":"traditional journey of the swelling","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSometimes we can follow the journey of a specic story by comparing earlier texts from the great collections of the th century with later recordings, especially those in the School of Scottish Studies archives available online at the digital archive Tobar an Dualchais. We catch characters, plots and inidual episodes changing to reflect new environments, audiences and times as each version is transported by the carrying stream.How a story changes informs us about the people who tell them – their culture, beliefs, and worldview. A setting may be changed to make a story more appealing to a local audience. An episode may be omitted because it isn’t seen to be relevant – or because it is too sensitive. The same story may be repeated because it is an effective warning: be wary of the wilderness lying beyond our township’s boundary.With the help of Tobar an Dualchais, we can follow one story’s journey from Highland moor to the island of Hearmatraigh, near North Uist, in real-time. Folklorists call this kind of story a migratory legend: where the same type of story is told in dferent areas, but with dferent settings and characters, localised where it is told.Catherine Dix, or Ceit an Tàilleir, was a remarkable storyteller who contributed hundreds of items to the School of Scottish Studies Archives. Born in , Ceit spent her early le in Beàrnaraigh, before moving away for work on the mainland at the age of . After a prolonged time away, she ed with her family to the island at the start of World War Two. She was recorded extensively during the s and s.One traditional story features a shepherd and his dog who stay in a shieling overnight. A hag arrives to warm herself by the fire. She swells to the size of a peat-stack, remarking that it’s only her ‘plumage’ rising with the heat. The hag attacks the shepherd but is driven away by the dog. The story is often called ‘m’ iteagan is m’ oiteagan’ : the phrase appears in most iants of this tale.Ceit recorded the story on at least three occasions in  , and with Iain Paterson , himself a native of Beàrnaraigh employed as a collector for the School of Scottish Studies. The  recording is transcribed in the excellent  publication by Ceit’s granddaughter, Alison – Ceit an Tàilleir.Ceit clearly enjoyed telling the story, but during a decade of performances it changed its setting: from a nondescript Highland moor in , to an unnamed island in , and finally to Hearmatraigh in . A story, originally set on the mainland, is gradually reworked by the storyteller, perhaps to make it more appealing to an island audience.It’s in the nature of migratory legends to change – it’s what makes it easier for them to migrate in the first place. But can we also trace where the story came from  Where did Ceit first hear her story: in Beàrnaraigh, or where Folklore recorders are trained to ask about where tradition comes from. At the end of every story, Iain Paterson would ask Ceit where she heard the story. In , she mentioned her father, Archibald Macleodfrom Baile Mhàrtainn in North Uist. But in the  recording she offered an extra explanation: the story in fact came from Archie MacColl of Ardtur in Appin, where she worked on a farm between the ages of  and  years. Paterson, clearly intrigued, asks how the story came to be set in Hearmatraigh. Ceit replied that Archie MacColl had heard the story from a boy from the Outer Hebrides who was working for him.It’s interesting that Ceit maintained here that the story was set in Hearmatraigh in both versions she heard – the one from her father and the one she heard as a teenager working in Appin. In her first recording she had set the tale in the Highlands.By comparing this story and its episodes to similar ‘migratory legends’, we can try to trace how it might have spread. The villain of Ceit’s story is the ‘swelling hag’. This redoubtable character is met with in a type of traditional story that once was told across Eurasia. It is known by folklorists as ‘The Two Brothers’.In the Scottish Gàidhealtachd, we have a version of ‘The Two Brothers’ recorded in Beàrnaraigh. It is called ‘Cailleach na Riobaig’and was collected in  for John Francis Campbell’s ‘Popular Tales of the West Highlands’ project. Despite similar wording between the two tales, Ceit’s story contains episodes not present in the  tale, episodes resembling other versions of the story collected on the mainland, east of Appin.On the whole, Ceit’s story is more similar to these mainland versions than anything recorded in the Outer Hebrides. Although she told Iain Paterson in  that both versions of the story she had heard were set in Hearmatraigh, it may be that, to make the story more attractive to an island audience, Ceit deliberately relocated an originally mainland story to the Sound of Harris. This comes through in the changing setting of her three versions of the story.But why Hearmatraigh  In relocating her story, Ceit chose a location which preserved the kind of setting in the original mainland story. She keeps the shieling, an outpost of civilisation in the wilderness where many stories tell of conflicts between human society and the supernatural.Hearmatraigh might have been chosen as it was one of the principal islands where Beàrnaraigh folk would stay in shielings for short periods to hunt, fish, and harvest peat. One recording on Tobar an Dualchaisnotes that the bothy on Hearmatraigh was built using lime-mortar: this construction technique would have made it stand out among other island shielings built of stone and turf.The Hearmatraigh settlement was centred around the natural harbour known as An Acairseid Mhòr. It is very likely that the fishing station from the time of Charles I mentioned by the Hebridean author Martin Martinwas located here. Could the fishing station’s ruin have been later repurposed as a shieling It may be, then, that when Ceit was looking for a local setting for the story she had originally heard in Appin, moving the tale to Hearmatraigh made it more relevant and appealing to her listeners. But with this clever transfer she also skilfully preserved the cultural signicance of its original moorland setting: a place out in the wilderness where dangerous supernatural creatures could overwhelm the unwary.Ceit Dix’s stories demonstrate the richness and iety of Gaelic traditional culture and offer a glimpse of how skilled storytellers adapt and localise their tales to entertain and intrigue their dferent audiences. contains some , oral recordings of songs, music, poetry and factual information made in Scotland and further afield."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3603301.jpg--.jpg?1612448490000\n","title":"iron ore mines and ghost railway stations just part of the dungonnell trail","story":"ONE of the Ballymena area’s best kept walking ‘secrets’ is found in the hills above the village of Cargan which is the population centre for the beautul wider area known as Glenravel.

Under the energetic management of this enterprising gentleman it was opened about  months ago.”So read the editorial of the Ballymena Observer, Saturday, July th, , commemorating the opening of the first of the Glenravel iron ore mines.Just three weeks earlier Mr. Fisher himself had given an open-air party for about fty gentlemen friends on the mountainside near the mine. It was an unusual repast, but no more unusual than the event it commemorated for here, in one of the bleakest, most barren and out-of-the-way places in the country, rich seams of iron ore had been found and mud-stained miners were raising  tons of top quality ore per week.This situation could hardly have been envisaged a few years earlier, not even by Fisher. Others before him were aware of the existence of iron-bearing rock but failed to exploit it or to locate the richer seams.The first had been Nicholas Crommelin, who, in , in his task of settling the area and building the village which bears his name, found a sample of the ore.He had it analysed by Professor John F. Hodges who found it to contain from  to % peroxide of iron. Crommelin’s enthusiasm got the better of him and he set about building a furnace to smelt the ore using the local peat for firing.He made repeated attempts to smelt the ore and succeeded in obtaining some metallic iron but the dficulties were so great that he abandoned the idea altogether.His furnace still stands near the village of Newtowncrommelin, a monument to his endeavours.Some years later Hodges was again called to examine some specimens in the possession of Edward Benn, the Glenravel landlord.These were obviously much richer specimens than Crommelin’s for Hodges was now convinced that valuable deposits lay hidden in the Glenravel mountains.Benn had his ore smelted by a local smith, John McAlister of Legegrane, who managed to produce a small sample of iron.This was then taken to Rowan’s foundry in Belfast where it was mistakenly identied as having been produced from the best Swedish ore.This was praise indeed but it seems strange that Benn himself took his discovery no further.Perhaps he was deterred by the failure of ious other projects with which he was connected — the distillation of alcohol and the distillation of paraffin — and was reluctant to invest money in any new venture.At any rate, it wasn’t until the arrival of James Fisher on the scene that mining the ore became a serious proposition.Credit for the initiation of the successful exploitation of the mineral wealth of this area is traditionally given to the parish priest of the time, Rev. Wm. John Macauley. He was a keen rambler and interested in geology and he was aware that the home-based linen industry, by which the majority of his parishioners lived, was in decline owing to the rise of the large spinning mills.His parish included the Braid and no doubt because of this he became acquainted with James Fisher who was then residing at Cleggan House, the property of Lord O’Neill.When a parishioner showed Father Macauley a piece of red rock he had found, Mr. Fisher was immediately contacted for Fisher already had mining interests in N. W. England, an iron ore producing region.The pair of them then set off on an exploration trip to Ballynahavla, near Cargan accompanied by two other men, one of whom had found the ore in the first place.They went almost directly to the spot and lting back a piece of overhanging turf discovered a seam two feet thick. They at once proceeded to Glenravel House to see Edward Benn who encouraged them to investigate further and gave Fisher permission to dig for a year at a rent of pound. The stage was thus set for one of the greatest industrial booms of the century which was to last nearly  years.In  Fisher began by outcrop digging or opencast mining at a place known as the Gullets, on the slopes of Slievenanee, and in the first six months was able to ship , tons of ore to England worth about pound per ton. It was not long, however, before he realised that more and better ore lay within the outcrop and he began to drive adits.The first underground mine to be opened was aptly named the Glenravel mine, situated in the townland of Legegrane on the south slope of Slievenanee.This was in January . Soon, other enterprising gentlemen began to take note, among them Silas Evans who laid the foundations of the Antrim Iron Ore Company which quickly took up large parcels of the country.There was a great influx of people into the area and several mining villages sprang up, chief among them Fisherstown, named after James Fisher, but now with the uninteresting name of Cargan.The ordinary farm workers of the area took to the novel type of employment and soon acquired the new skills of mining.Wages of  - per week in  rose in  to  - and  - per week for underground workers and to  - and  - per week for surface workers. By  there were about  men employed directly in the mines and  horses were being used in carting away the ore. To facilitate this Fisher had built his own tramway which ran from the Gullets to Parkmore, a distance of two miles.There was as yet no narrow-gauge railway from Ballymena.Most of the miners were labourers and small farmers and the owner of a small farm could even do part-time work at the mines when farming conditions permitted.This helped to supplement his farm income. This new-found source of wealth led to a rather unruly sort of le and drinking sprees and brawls were common.Fisherstown was so wild that children were not allowed on the street when the miners were in town — a situation more akin to the Wild West in the goldrush days.At the start of mining operations levels were driven generally two or three at a time. A connecting passage was then cut to join these levels together to provide a cir-culation of air to the miners and to disperse explosive fumes.From this stage the mine was extended horizontally generally following the ore seam and this gave rise to the term — the Longwall method — literally along the wall of the passage. As soon as a sound roof was met with, side roads were driven right and left and from these the working areas branched off approximately  yards apart. In these areas the miner excavated the ore with a pick and shovel in a cramped and awkward position lying on his side. He removed the ore and waste rock in a wide circular sweep andthe roof was thought to be unstable or unsafe he left pillars of rock standing to support it. This method of mining was known as the ‘room and pillar’ and many examples of it are still visible today in these mines.Probably early in the process rails were laid into the mine to provide a means of removing the waste rock as well as the ore. For this reason the main adit was driven  feet high by  feet wide to accommodate a double line of rails. Alternatively,a single line was considered sufficient or the level was for ventilation only, e.g. an air drt, it was driven only  feet wide. As the workings progressed the waste rock within the mine was used to block off workings which became exhausted or to support the roof in place of the ore which had been removed.The miners worked on a sht system so that they would not be mining ore all day.This meant that they worked half the day in the mine digging ore and the other half on the surface loading it or doing some other job. They would be replaced at the ore face by other miners who had been on the surface during the morning sht.The hours in the Glenravel mines were  a.m. to  p.m. By the early ’s several mines were being worked — Fisher at Slievenanee, the Crommelin Mining Co. at Tuftarney, the Antrim Iron Ore Co. at Cargan and Dungonnell and Mr. Charles Chambers and the Evisnacrow Iron Co. at Evishnacrow. Mining had also extended to other areas, namely Parkmore, Glenarf, Rathkenny, Carncormick and Broughshane.Up to this time the mines had been worked solely for iron ore. Aluminium was still a virtually unknown commodity and it was only in  that it was realised it could be obtained from bauxite.In fact, these minerals, aluminium and iron, are two of the most common elements of the Earth’s crust between them making up nearly % of the total composition. It is no coincidence, therefore, that the ores of these metals, bauxite and iron ore, formed by the prolonged weathering of basalt lavas, are found side by side in the Antrim hills.It was Professor Hodges again who, probably because of his familiarity with the ores of the district, discovered bauxite in the Cargan Mine in .This discovery added more interest and potential to the mining industry and boosted out-put from the mines for several years. During these years too the narrow-gauge railway had arrived, reaching Cargan in May  and Retreat in October . Branch lines were laid to the ious groups of mines and these facilitated the ore being removed quickly from the mines to Ballymena and thence to Larne for shipment.The Wire Tramway, an overhead bucket system built in  for transporting the ore from Cargan to Red Bay, had come and gone, having been sabotaged on the night of Sunday, July th  and never repaired. Nevertheless, mining then even as today was dependant on an efficient means of getting ore away quickly. The railway encouraged expansion in the mining industry and made the ore more valuable because it was more accessible.However, in the early ’s, due to a slump in the iron industry in Britain and the exhaustion of the better-classores, production started to dwindle. The production of bauxite continued and some mines went over completely to the mining of bauxite e.g. Tuftarney and Evishnacrow mines, the latter being worked up to . Iron ore production carried on at a reduced pace in most of the mines and towards the turn of the century the Crommelin company even opened a series of new mines along the east side of the Skerry Water and two bauxite mines on the west side.In general, however, the number of working adits steadily declined and desperate ef-forts were sometimes called for to prolong mining, e.g. at the Cargan Mine where numerous volcanic dykes displaced the ore seam, the miners had to bore their way through  feet of solid rock in an attempt to locate the seam but had to give up. Three of the five adits were soon to be closed but in , in attempting to reopen one of them, an additional problem was encountered for the mine was by this time flooded.In , a prophetic writer, R. A. Watson, in an article in the Dublin University Magazine, made the comment that it would take some hundreds of years before these ore deposits would become exhausted, but sadly prophesy and actuality are seldom one and the same. All mining enterprises have to be abandoned sooner or later either because the deposits are exhausted or their extraction no longer pays. Mining, therefore, must eventually disappear from any area since it is only a temporary form of occupation. It is a natural progression. It took Nature millions of years to produce these minerals and what the miners removed in a few short decades cannot be replaced.The mines eventually closed and no one is really to blame. Various factors contributed to the decline, one of the main ones being the unfavourable dip of the ore seam which often caused flooding.Fisher’s mines, the original Glenravel Mines closed on --  because the best quality ore had been worked out and the second quality was considered uneconomical to work. Adits  and  of the Evisnacrow Mines were last worked on -- and closed because of the company’s inability to work them at a profit.The British Portland Cement Manufacturing Co. took over the bauxite mine here in  but the bauxite proved unsuitable for their purpose and the mine was abandoned on --. The Dungonnell Mines were subject to flooding but they were abandoned in  because of disagreements between the mining company and the leaseholders. The Crommelin Co. too was plagued by flooding problems as well as the ore failing but still managed to excavate an exten-sive series of workings at Skerry East, many of which are still accessible.Quite apart from these reasons there are three other factors which contributed to the closure of the mines.Firstly, there were no smelters in Co. Antrim and the ore had to be shipped to mainland Britain.Secondly, the quality of the iron ore was not good enough for smelting on its own — it had to be mixed in the furnaces with other richer, imported ores. The bauxite, too, was not entirely suitable for the manufacture of aluminium and only a small proportion was used for this purpose. Imported bauxite was cheaper and more suitable and so the demand for Antrim bauxite declined.Thirdly, the high cost of transport from the mines to the smelters and processing plants left little profit for the mining companies.Although the mining industry in Glenravel appeared to have died prematurely it was not forgotten. With the outbreak of World War Two a new crisis loomed in the shape of U-boats and it became increasingly dficult to obtain foreign bauxite.In  Lord Beaverbrook announced to the nation that there was a scarcity of aluminium, and aluminium was a vital ingredient in the manufacture of war planes.By this time Germany was producing about % more aluminium than the USA because of her control of Aluminium-producing countries. So it was that interest in the Antrim bauxites was rekindled and this led to re-investigation of local reserves. In  new bauxite mines were opened at Newtowncrommelin known as the Skerry Mines.Other abandoned workings were reopened for their bauxite content and many Glenravel miners and sons of miners were recruited to work in the new mines. Many travelled daily to work in the vast labyrinth at Lyle’s Hill, Templepatrick.The Skerry Mines closed early in  and mining as an industry finally ceased on --.

The contractors, Garden Escapes, will be arriving on site on Wednesday  February to commence work.This is the first of three replacement play parks that will be completed under Council’s current round of investment in play. Work will also be commencing shortly at Legg Park, Carrickfergus and at Ballygally play park.Further investment has also been secured which will see an extension to the play provision at Millbrook Play Park that will include a number of new, inclusive pieces of play equipment, thanks to funding from the Department for Communities.Championing the vital role that play parks have on the health and wellbeing of young people in the borough, the Mayor of Mid and East Antrim has welcomed news that works are commencing at Ballykeel.Councillor Peter Johnston said: “Access to quality play parks has an important role for the mental, physical and social wellbeing of all of the children in Mid and East Antrim. “Establishing better quality play parks is part of our wider ambition to ensure that communities have a real sense of identity and place, and that everyone has the opportunity to enjoy them. This Council is determined to supply and look after our parks for future generations to enjoy.“I am delighted that so many people engaged with Council’s online surveys last year which have helped inform the design of the replacement play parks at Ballykeel, Legg Park and Ballygally and I look forward to these designs coming to fruition.”All four projects are due to be complete in spring .

Although the registration forms stated that only £ would be refundedthe assessment was cancelled, the AQE Board and its membership of  local grammar schools decided unanimously that an additional exceptional ex-gratia payment of £ should also be provided, given this year#s unique circumstances.

Travelling to an airport or port to take a holiday abroad is not an essential journey, the Garda said in a statement.The force saidenforcement is required a fixed payment notice for € will be issued to each person who is in breach of the regulation.The new rules mean the Garda can turn back day-trippers from Northern Ireland.Under the Republic#s current Covid- restrictions, travel is restricted to within km of a person#s home except for essential reasons.People travelling to an airport or port to take a holiday abroad may also be liable for a € fine.On Friday night, unionist politicians said the Garda action undermined Irish Government claims the border could not be policed.East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson said: This is a bit awkward for Simon Coveney and the #no hard border# sledgehammer brigade. Seems like the RoI government is taking a decent go at hardening the existing international border between their country and Northern Ireland. It would seem the Republic can enforce a north-south border when it suits - which once again blows apart their arguments about the NI Protocol and it also demonstrates how hollow their antics have been for the last four years. The Irish position was never about the Belfast Agreement or peace. It was entirely self-serving. The border deniers will have been left scratching their heads on this one, the MP said.UUP MLA Doug Beattie said the Garda move was a game-changer.We have been told for four and a half years that not only can we not have a hard border, we cannot have a single camera on the border, he said. Within the past week we have seen that the EU is prepared to instigate a hard border and today we find the Garda are ready, willing and able to secure the border from am on Monday. This is an absolute game changer and means that the entire Brexit negotiations took place under  pretences. Given the fiasco that the Protocol has turned out to be, it is now time to reassess the situation. A border was put in the Irish Sea to placate those who promoted veiled threats of a potentialto violence should the hardening of the land border be considered. That has now been exposed as a sham. We must now negotiate an agreement which restores the trading links with the rest of the UK and undoes the damage done to the Belfast Agreement by the Protocol.Belfast Top VideosVideoExclusive Belfastpoll: DUP support takes a e in wake of Irish Sea border rowVideoWatch: The moment a tractor crashes into Co Fermanagh homeVideoPolice name Cltonville Road murder victim as Danny McCleanMost ReadIRA bomber Kavanagh#s Education Authority role beggars belief, says victim Arrest of Mark Sykes during Sean Graham Bookmaker Massacre anniversary event has caused #unprecedented anger and distress#, says O#NeillSF man#s #no comment# on Captain Tom Moore tribute snub , doses of Covid- vaccines lost to wastage ... but almost , inoculated Foster thanks #people from all backgrounds across UK# for signing Article  petition as parliamentary debate secured with k signaturesLatest CoronavirusO#Neill hits out after arrest of bookmakers atrocity survivorAQE presses on with plans for November transfer testCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and  new cases reportedMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageLatest from Belfast Joe Root and Ben Stokes pile pressure on IndiaMyanmar junta shuts Twitter and Instagram to curb protestsBrendan Rodgers hails ‘step forward’ as Premier League welcomes concussion subsWhat the papers say – February Priyanka Chopra Jonas reveals The White Tiger viewing figures,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The petition was launched at am on Thursday and in just over  hours hit the threshold to require a parliamentary response.Mrs Foster said: “As one part of our five-point plan to scrap the Protocol, I applied for and secured a Parliamentary e-petition.

The campaign has not finished. We need to keep going. The First Minister continued: We have made the case to the Prime Minister and now the people have made a very public appeal to the Government of their country to act. This is not the time for more words and drawn-out processes. This time for affirmative action to ensure that there is an unfettered flow of goods within the United Kingdom single market.YES!

In particular, I commend unionist colleagues from across the spectrum in Northern Ireland who embraced this initiative.”Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken has also urged everyone in Northern Ireland and beyond to sign the petition calling on the UK Government to trigger the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement clause.Now that it has reached , signatures, the petition demanding unfettered trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, will be considered for debate in Parliament.Article  allows either the EU or the UK to disregard certain measures of the Withdrawal Agreement should they feel it is causing major problems.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_deb-ce-d-ba-eaedeb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_deb-ce-d-ba-eaedeb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_deb-ce-d-ba-eaedeb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_deb-ce-d-ba-eaedeb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_deb-ce-d-ba-eaedeb_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_deb-ce-d-ba-eaedeb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_deb-ce-d-ba-eaedeb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_deb-ce-d-ba-eaedeb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_deb-ce-d-ba-eaedeb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_deb-ce-d-ba-eaedeb_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"UUP leader Steve Aiken PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueUUP leader Steve Aiken Read MoreDynamics have changed, says DUP#s Foster on NI protocol benefits remarksArlene Foster:OpinionIt#s time for Boris Johnson to deliver the unfettered access to GB he promisedThe EU was heavily criticised last week after it’s swt u-turn on invoking Article  to block Covid- vaccines entering Northern Ireland.As part of the agreement, the Northern Ireland Protocol sees checks on goods coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain, creating a de facto Irish Sea border - something which has angered unionists.As part of the DUP’s five-point plan to undermine the protocol, the party launched the petition and said it will not participate in any north-south political engagements on issues relating to the protocol.Mr Aiken said it’s clear the protocol is not working and alternatives must be found.“This week the Ulster Unionist Party published our own proposals and I would ask everyone to read them,” he continued. “We need to find a solution.“The message from the Irish Government’s Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, to Northern Ireland this week was ‘own it’, but that’s not good enough. “That type of intemperate language and approach which seeks to punish all the people of Northern Ireland for the mistakes of others will get us nowhere. “If that had been the approach of unionists in , there never would have been a Belfast Agreement. “It seems apparent that for Simon Coveney, the principle of consent and cross community support only applies when it suits the Irish Government’s agenda.”Meanwhile, the County Armagh Grand Orange Lodge stated that the protocol was designed to “placate those with aspirations for an all-island republic” and will ultimately lead to a united Ireland.“We would encourage all our unionist representatives throughout the province to form a strong united unionist coalition in this the centenary year of the formation of Northern Ireland,” the lodge said in a statement. “It is imperative that all party dferences are set aside and that all our unionist representatives unite and pledge to work together for the abolition of this iniquitous deal which,it remains in force, will ultimately see an all-island republic which our forefathers strongly opposed.”Belfast Related ContentComment PremiumArlene FosterOpinionIt#s time for Boris Johnson to deliver the unfettered access to GB he promisedThis Prime Minister promised unfettered access and now must deliver.

Northern Ireland#s decline compared with a % year on year fall across the UK which marked the worst January since .It is now six years since car sales here had signicantly increased - a trend which would hit the second-hand market. He added: The fall in new car sales over the last few years, and particularly last year, will reduce the supply of vehicles into the used car market.  was the last year that NI posted a meaningful increase in new car sales with registrations down % since then. It remains to be seen whether the new car sales market can reverse its recent decline in  and climb the priority spending list for consumers.Karen Johnson, head of retail and wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking, said selling online had not been enough to halt the drop in new registrations.Lessons learned from the first lockdown have seen traders bolstering their e-commerce propositions to meet the changing purchasing habits of the consumer, selling cars via delivery and on a #click and collect# basis, but their valiant efforts fell short last month.As well as a desire to see forecourts reopening sooner rather than later as we move further into , sellers will also be looking to those consumers who have built up savings during the pandemic to start committing again to big ticket purchases like a new car.Although the industry is still producing high quality vehicles and is doing its best to stimulate demand with attractive financing deals, concerns still abound re the infrastructure needed to support dferent fuel types.Ms Johnson said more charge points were needed for a rise in sales of alternatively-fuelled cars.She added: Consumer demand for the next generation of vehicles with low or zero emissions is undoubtedly muted due to the underlying caution around the well-publicised roll out of charging points - particularly in rural areas. Northern Ireland has the lowest number of charging points per capita than any other region in the UK, so it is clear more must be donesales are to gather pace in the next few years.Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said it was a bad start to the year for the industry, which lost £.bn in sales last year. He added: The necessary lockdown will challenge society, the economy and our industry#s ability to move quickly towards our ambitious environmental goals.

Now he has decided to tackle the man he considers the greatest to have ever played the game.The book, which has the backing of the Best family, features wide-ranging interviews with George#s loved ones, team-mates and friends.The foreword is provided by George#s brother Ian and brother-in-law Norman McNarry.Much has been written about Best#s rise from the Cregagh estate to the top of the footballing world. The controversial star was followed by the media throughout his le, his every move documented in column inches. Mr Barton said he wanted to get away from the stories of drinking and womanising and concentrate on George Best the footballer. Best died as a result of alcoholism in November . Before his death he asked that people remember me for my football.I#ve talked to so many people while writing my other books, many of them tell stories about George Best, it#s just mesmeric from my point of view, said the author. I#m a United fan, I#ve seen all the tapes and everything of George, and I always felt that George was the best player we#ve ever had.I feltI was going to do something about him I#d have to come up with something dferent than everything that#s been written.I thought the one thing that was missing, as stupid as it sounds, was a book about George the footballer. He said he doesn#t shy away from the negative aspects of George#s le when it pertains to football.They are such prominent things in his le you can#t completely pretend that it doesn#t exist, that wouldn#t do his story justice, he explained.Mr Barton referred to the story of the hotel bellboy who delivered champagne to Best#s room and found him with a scantily-clad Miss World on a bed covered with his winnings from the casino. The bellboy asked Best: #Where did it all go wrong # Mr Barton said it has become a bit of a punch line, but he hopes to understand Best#s mindset.The writer said that during his research he discovered the true story behind the star#s exit from Old Trafford.He left the club in January  amid a turbulent season that saw United relegated just a few years after their  European Cup triumph. Mr Barton used information published in this newspaper at the time to uncover the story. It#s never been documented before, it#s been said he came into the stadium drunk, but I have found a lot of stuff that rubbishes that story and clears George#s name, he said.It#s dficult to say when it#s your own work, but I think it#s the biggest untold story in United history.My motivation was not only to tell the story about George, but make sure that I was being true to him. Rather than just telling a story about a famous player, I wanted to make sure I was being loyal to the way he would have wanted it to be told.With his birthday coming up I imagined the book would be a positive celebration of George#s le, and I think I#ve achieved that.Belfast Top VideosVideoExclusive Belfastpoll: DUP support takes a e in wake of Irish Sea border rowVideoWatch: The moment a tractor crashes into Co Fermanagh homeVideoPolice name Cltonville Road murder victim as Danny McCleanMost ReadIRA bomber Kavanagh#s Education Authority role beggars belief, says victim Arrest of Mark Sykes during Sean Graham Bookmaker Massacre anniversary event has caused #unprecedented anger and distress#, says O#NeillSF man#s #no comment# on Captain Tom Moore tribute snub , doses of Covid- vaccines lost to wastage ... but almost , inoculated Foster thanks #people from all backgrounds across UK# for signing Article  petition as parliamentary debate secured with k signaturesLatest Northern IrelandSerious road collision at west Belfast roundabout say PSNIJournalist threatened after probe into KinahanBBC Panorama team threatened following Kinahan programmeBrexit leads to delay in introduction of criminal assets lawGarda to close border to all #non-essential# travelLatest from Belfast Joe Root and Ben Stokes pile pressure on IndiaMyanmar junta shuts Twitter and Instagram to curb protestsBrendan Rodgers hails ‘step forward’ as Premier League welcomes concussion subsWhat the papers say – February Priyanka Chopra Jonas reveals The White Tiger viewing figures,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Last night Sir Tom#s memory was marked with a national clap.In Belfast, the Lord Mayor opened an online book of condolence.

He became the epitome of all that is good and noble about how we have come together in a common cause of defeating Covid and supporting our health service and our health workers, he said.However, a row broke out after Sinn Fein did not pay tribute during a meeting of Fermanagh and Omagh council.The Belfastcontacted Barry McElduff, the party#s group leader on the council, but he refused to comment.It drew criticism from DUP councillor Errol Thompson, who said: Captain Tom was someone who fundraised for our country as a whole and a lot of that funding came towards our own Trusts here. The Western Trust received £, from his efforts and the Southern Trust received £,. What a treasure he was. It is disappointing and I know other people who would call themselves nationalists or republicans actually did pay tribute.He added: They [SF] probably had their own reasons for doing it.During the meeting, Ulster Unionist councillor Victor Warrington said: The man was a great inspiration at the start of this pandemic, with his efforts of doing the walk to raise millions for the NHS. He had a great le of  years and would have had some great stories to tell. On behalf of my party, I want to express our sincere sympathies.This was followed by a tribute from Mr Thompson of the DUP.Independent councillor Emmet McAleer said: The money that Captain Sir Tom raised during his activities was absolutely inspiring.Independent councillor Josephine Deehan told members she was greatly saddened.Another independent, Donal O#Cofaigh, referred to Sir Tom#s inspirational efforts.SDLP councillor Paul Blake said he was a real inspiration, adding: We owe a great debt of gratitude.Yesterday, hours before a national clap in his memory took place, the House of Commons fell silent in tribute to Sir Tom.Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs the centenarian had dedicated his le to serving the needs of so many others. He said: We all now have the opportunity to show our appreciation for him and all that he stood for and believed in. That is why I encourage everyone to join in a national clap for Captain Tom and all those health workers for whom he raised money at pm this evening. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Captain Tom#s contribution - having raised more than £m for the NHS during the first coronavirus lockdown - will be formally marked, possibly with a statue.Belfast Top VideosVideoExclusive Belfastpoll: DUP support takes a e in wake of Irish Sea border rowVideoWatch: The moment a tractor crashes into Co Fermanagh homeVideoPolice name Cltonville Road murder victim as Danny McCleanMost ReadIRA bomber Kavanagh#s Education Authority role beggars belief, says victim Arrest of Mark Sykes during Sean Graham Bookmaker Massacre anniversary event has caused #unprecedented anger and distress#, says O#NeillSF man#s #no comment# on Captain Tom Moore tribute snub , doses of Covid- vaccines lost to wastage ... but almost , inoculated Foster thanks #people from all backgrounds across UK# for signing Article  petition as parliamentary debate secured with k signaturesLatest Northern IrelandSerious road collision at west Belfast roundabout say PSNIJournalist threatened after probe into KinahanBBC Panorama team threatened following Kinahan programmeBrexit leads to delay in introduction of criminal assets lawGarda to close border to all #non-essential# travelLatest from Belfast Joe Root and Ben Stokes pile pressure on IndiaMyanmar junta shuts Twitter and Instagram to curb protestsBrendan Rodgers hails ‘step forward’ as Premier League welcomes concussion subsWhat the papers say – February Priyanka Chopra Jonas reveals The White Tiger viewing figures,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The site has lain empty since  but in recent days trees and weeds that had grown over time were removed. A planning application was previously lodged for the construction of  residential apartments which will comprise of  one bed and  two bed apartments. The site was granted outline planning approval but there is an application before the council for ‘Reserved Matters’ - aspects of a proposed development which an applicant can choose not to submit details of initially. googletag.cmd.push Therefore, full planning permission has not been granted at this stage. If approved, people will be able to gain access to the apartments from Foyle Roadand John Street.  There will also be a ground floor parking area that can accommodate  cars. The accommodation is viewed as a good location for non-car use and car ownership will be being actively discouraged at the site. A Travel Plan will be promoted by a ‘Travel Coordinator’ who will promote other forms of transport. A document accompanying the application, states: “The measures will encourage the use of sustainable modes, reduce dependence on the car and therefore contribute to reduced car growth in car journeys, increase the use of healthier alternatives such as walking and cycling, and contributing towards making a safer, healthier environment around the development.” googletag.cmd.push A report also highlights the servicing arrangements for the building which sits close to the bottom deck of the Craigavon Bridge. It identies the challenges posed by vehicles collecting or delivering goods to the apartments but deems these activities to be ‘low-impact’, aside from removal vehicles, which was categorised as ‘medium impact’ – but something that will happen ‘once a year’. The site was formerly occupied by Hamilton  Sons factory which was demolished in . At the time there were concerns about the stability of the building, which had been derelict for years. Foyle Civic Trust was disappointed by the decision, saying that everything should be done to save the industrial heritage of the city.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Extremely quiet. The other places Ive visited have been quiet, but not to this extent. Just like it takes your eyes a while to adjust to new light,you wait long enough, things come into focus. A Claudy Fuels lorry roars past and when it clears, there is movement. A young boy in Banagher gear emerges from the Spar shop clutching a plastic bag. He hasnt far to go, and with a quick look either way, darts across the road and disappears into a house on Feeny Road. At its heart, Feenys main thoroughfare is a residential street, and the people who live there are staying at home. googletag.cmd.push Walking up the hill towards the GAA pitch, the sun briefly illuminates figures at windows. An elderly man squints against the sun as he peers out his window. I catch glimpses of home-schooled children appearing at the windows as I make my way past. The distinctive air brake of the bin lorry comes at regular intervals. One woman rushes from her house with a bin in tow, spinning it on the kerb before retreating back into her home. Covid- messaging on the gates of Fr McNally Park. Smoke from internal fires wafts through the air as I reach Fr McNally Park, where the sun is breaking through the haze to create a spectacular backdrop. googletag.cmd.push The pitch is the first place of note you reach when you enter Feeny. It acts almost as a gatekeeper for the village, but its own gates are open. There dont appear to be any walkers on the grounds though, and I head back towards the centre of the village, where cars are parked around its hub the pharmacy, supermarket and chippy. A man stops me in the pharmacy car park, askingI know where he can find the boy that does the tarmac – McCloskey. Its as near to the needle in a haystack conundrum as you will find. I wish him luck.     Outside Feeny pharmacy, a makesht shelter has been erected to facilitate a socially distanced queue, but there is none today. Local pharmacist Declan Bateson believes people are taking things seriously. Owner Declan Bateson tells me this lockdown has been much quieter than its predecessors. “After Christmas, its been quieter. People are taking it seriously and have seen the surge in the hospitals,” says the  All-Ireland winner. “In the run-up to Christmas it was very busy. Retail shops were closed for a while and with the pharmacy being allowed to stay open, it meant we were busier. “GPs have tightened up who can come and theyve had a lot less people going through their doors, which means a lot more people coming through ours.” The pharmacy is at the centre of the village, both physically and metaphorically. Although he brushes off the notion of a pastoral role with modesty, its clear this is the case. “With the elderly living alone and feeling a lot more isolated, we are one of their few points of contact,” he says. “We know everybody who comes into the shop, we know their families and we can ask after them. Were part of the community. “We do try and reach out and have those chats, seethey are doing okay, orwere delivering to them we can have a chat on the doorstep and see how theyre keeping. “Its always felt that way though. Its a small village, there are a couple of pubs, a local shop with the post office, ourselves and the doctors. “The pubs have been closed and the doctors have been less available, so ourselves and the shop next door have probably been pivotal in keeping people going.” All over, this lockdown has been very dferent to its initial version last Spring. Covid has come creeping in to the Feeny community like many across Ireland. “We got lucky the first time round, there were no surges here, but in September and October you began to see local people testing positive. Reality dawned on people that this was serious,” he says. “The lockdown before Christmas frustrated a lot of people, but in hindsight it was a mistake to let things open up again in the run-up to Christmas. Its cost lives. “We would have had the odd doubter of Covid coming in during the summer months, but we dont seem to have them coming in any more.” Wise words greet customers at Sizzles in Feeny. Next door, in Sizzles chippy, they are cleaning in preparation for the evenings business. The door is open for ventilation when I askanyone is around to speak. Grainne plays the role of gatekeeper, listening to my reasons for disrupting their Thursday afternoon, before owner Marlene appears from the kitchen, satisfied with my explanation. “There is no fortune being made, but at least were surviving and looking forward to getting back to normal,” she tells me. “You always worry, because you think will this week be okay  Its stressful for anybody, but I feel sorry for people in the restaurant game. “I always want to work, but sometimesthe government says you cant, then you cant. Youre always concerned about your staff and customers.” Marlene echoes Declans analysis of how the virus has crept up on the people of the village. “At the start it didnt really sink in, until people started to get unwell. You just didnt want to see loved ones get taken to hospital and you were watching horror stories on the news of it being fatal,” she says. “The summer was great because you were home early in the evenings and there was nice weather. Its tough now on peoples mental health, trying to stay positive. “Since the schools closed, its hard for childcare as well. It affects the whole community, but keeping going is important.” There is a big push to improve broadband in the area at present. It is clear the business owners in the centre of Feeny feel a wider responsibility than simply providing a service. Marlene says its hard to lt peoples spirits in such emotionally sanitised circumstances. “Everybody expresses theyre fed up, and were all in the one boat, but you cant spend a lot of time because we can only allow one person in at a time,” she said. “It removes that bit of banter between people, but thats the times were in. You still have people who want to come in and stand and you feel bad askingyou can bring it out to them.” “If one of us went down though, thats the whole team down and it has a knock-on effect.” Birds are dancing back and forth across the Feeny Road as I make my way back towards the car. I note the name of the pub – Sperrin View. I take a moment to savour it, looking down Glenedra Road as the sun breaks over the Sperrins. Its a pity no one will be able to experience it for a while. On the way back out the road, I stop off at Banagher Glen, on the off chance any walkers want to share their lockdown experience. Im halfway down the narrow road when Im waved down by two perplexed looking men standing outside a van. “Do you knowThomas Murphys gravel pit is anywhere round here ” asks one of them. I shake my head. Its probably time I went home.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The had time left on their degree courses and their leadership and commitment aided a developing club into a growing entity. The club continued to grow in numbers and grow stronger both on and off the field year on year. Several players, including Stephen, went on to play for Scotland at the British Universities Tournament. And members of the club gained colours for their contribution to sporting le while at University. “Stephen was captain on the field and went on to show these same leadership skills, whilst in the chair,” Declan commented. “Gaby contributed immensely throughout the formative years as well in ious roles within the committee. “Having worked closely with both, I knew the club and the future were in safe dedicated hands,” Loane added. “All university clubs need and rely on a continuation of committed iniduals beyond one degree term, to keep the momentum of any club. With each new academic year, all clubs hope that a committed fresher will come on-board – both on and off the field. In my time, that fresher was Stephen.” It was only the beginning and it wasnt too long before there were Derry fingerprints on the clubs baton again. Oisin Moran and Aaron Conwaypictured at Freshers Day  in Stirling Magherafelt man Oisin Moran, son of former Derry physio Sean, arrived in Stirling to study Sports and Exercise Science. He was part of a very successful underage team at home, which culminated in winning the  All-Ireland U Féile. On new soil he didnt know anyone and had to build a new friendship network that remains strong to this day. Oisin takes up the story. When I joined the team, there was a mix of Irish and non-Irish players with a  of . As most of the players were in their final year, it created problems when I took over the club the following year. During my first year I learned a lot about the club traditions and values which Declan had cited. The Stirling team did not have a large  of  plus Irish players to choose from like some universities so we had to branch out and attract players from a non GAA background and from dferent parts of the world. A sense of family was soon established, much like clubs at home. We had the opportunity to go down and play in the British Championships in Birmingham, which helped give me an insight to the championship and made me determined to bring the club down every year and to compete against other Universities from Scotland and England. Towards the end of my first year we held our AGM and I put my name forward to be nominated for captain of the team the following year and I was successfully appointed. Odhran Hassan from Banagher was elected president of the club at the same time and we came together at the end of our first year to develop a plan to build and grow the club both on and off the field. I think this is a challenge for most University Clubs as teams have to be rebuilt regularly and it’s an even bigger challenge for teams like ourselves as we don’t get an influx of Irish students every year. At the start of second year, myself and Odhran began the process of rebuilding and quickly started the recruitment process. This included social media posts, putting posters up around the university, handing out flyers. We also had a stall booked for the sports bazaar which is held during Freshers week. Overall our recruitment drive was very successful and we got around  people to join the club. Myself and Odhran ran the club, we trained the team as well as honouring and managing our sponsorship agreements. We arranged referees for games andplaying away would secure transport to and from the venue. We needed good time management, as we were doing this alongside studying for a degree. However I wouldn’t have changed it for the world. Id happily do it again as I was doing the role because I love the sport and wanted to grow and develop the club. At the AGM I stood for the position of President and I was successfully appointed for the - season. As President, I continued to build on the good work myself and Odhran started and continued to expand the clubs numbers and also had the opportunity and resources to attend British Championships again that year. We also combined the women’s Gaelic team onto our sponsorship agreement which helped bring the two clubs closer together. Throughout the year we held joint social events which were great craic and also every week we held a joint training session on a Sundayno league games were being played that weekend just to get everyone together and have a bit of fun playing the sport we all love. Towards the second half of the year I made the decision that I should pass the responsibilities of running the club over to someone  as I was going into my final year and needed to focus on my studies and I knew I couldn’t commit the proper time that was needed to successfully run the team. At this point I could see Aaronwas very committed to the team and could see he shared the same love and enthusiasm for the sport. Maybe it was because we are both from Derry, but I knew the club would be in safe hands so I encouraged him to run for President at the end of year and I would be there in my final year to give him any advice he would need. Overall I’m very proud I had the opportunity to be a part of the club and learn its history and then be able to contribute to maintaining the traditions and club values whilst helping build the club over the years I was attending University in Stirling. If you asked me what was a more important achievement to me gaining a degree or running a Gaelic team it would be the Gaelic team and it wouldn’t even be close. *** Aaron Conways first experience of the Stirling University Gaelic football team was on a Wednesday afternoon, in September , at the sports bazaar. Having moved over from Derry, without knowing anyone beforehand, he figured it would be a good way to settle in and make friends. He takes up the story. I had just put my name down for trials for the soccer team when I overheard a thick Irish accent say ah lads Mayo have no chance against Dublin on Sunday, I looked over to see a guy in a Roscommon jersey sat at a table with a tricolour hung in the background. As I walked over, I saw a sign which read Men’s Gaelic Football and a laptop on the table which was showing the  All Ireland Football Final. As I approached the table, a guy in a Derry jersey introduced himself as Odhran and askedI was interested in joining the team. We chatted for a few minutes and I gave him my contact details and that was it. For me this was better than expected, as I was able to make friends with people from home and to have the chance to start playing Gaelic football again as I had stopped playing for Craigbane at U level. At the end of my first year, I was voted onto the committee as the social secretary and it was only here where I started to see the work that went on behind the scenes to keep the club running. One of the major challenges which most university sports teams face is the constant turnover of players and members. We had to try and find as many Irish players as we could and then supplement that by training up non-Irish guys who were interested in playing and try to get them up to speed before the first games of the season which were usually in the first weeks of October. This didn’t give us much time and wasn’t helped by the lack of floodlights on the grass pitches which meant that from October until February most of our training sessions were held on a G pitch with only soccer goals to use for shooting drills. Throughout my time at Stirling, we were lucky to have a good core of Irish players and managed to successfully train up a few from scratch into fairly decent players. Most of the players during my time were from the UK and Ireland but we also had players from Sweden, Spain and even Australia. The league was always dficult to compete in as we were coming up against teams from Glasgow, Edinburgh Aberdeen and Dundee most of whom were able to field teams with at least  or  Irish players. We might have only had six or seven, with the rest made up of players who may have only had a handful of training sessions before being flung in at the deep end so to speak. This meant some one-sided matches at times but the key thing here was to try and make sure the new lads didn’t get too disheartened. The British Championships would have been our main focus each year as we would be playing teams from all over Britain with similar ability to ourselves. In , which was my first time going to the British Championship, we reached the quarter finals where we were beaten by a strong Heriot-Watt team that reached the final that year. The following year in , when I was now President of the club, we were confident of doing well as we had a good squad and had trained hard however fortunes weren’t to be in our favour as due to waterlogged pitches. All  teams in our ision had to play their matches on one already drenched pitch in Leeds. By the time of the fourth game of the day the surface resembled a bog more than a football pitch, games were changed to  minutes straight to try and get the competition finished. Our last game of the competition finished - to -, giving you a taste of the conditions which also meant we would finish second in the group and miss out on the semi-finals. In  in my final year on the team and still president we were determined to go one step further, but a last-minute change of dates meant we wouldn’t be able to send a team that year as everyone had already changed their commitments for the original date which was disappointing personally. Outside of football the British Championship weekends in Manchester were always a great weekends craic and was good for team bonding. The St Patricks Day Festival Cup was a challenge match we played every year against Sands McSwineys Coatbridge who are a club team from just outside Glasgow. Despite the name the cup match has been played anywhere from December to April but was usually played a week or two after St Patricks Day. This was good for us in the committee as it gave us something to keep training for after British championships. The games against Coatbridge were always competitive and occasionally controversial. After two attempts – a defeat and a controversial late abandonment when we were seven or eight points clear - we eventually got our hands on the trophy which was a good experience for some of the lads who were new to the sport. We were able to defend our trophy the following year as well. The social aspect of the club was also very important, having a strong social element allowed the guys who maybe weren’t the best players or couldn’t make training sessions or matches due to other commitments were still very much included in the club. Throughout the year we would hold multiple socials and nights out alongside the ladies team. The All Ireland Final and the Sky GAA TV deal was a major boost for us at the time, because it meant that we would be able to hold the social in Molly Malones Bar in Stirling instead of having to travel to Glasgow or Edinburgh. It quickly became a tradition that every year ourselves and the ladies would watch the game and it was an important social event. It was usually on the weekend after the sports bazaar so it was good for anyone who was joining the team to come along and meet the current team. Through sponsorship agreements with Dusk nightclub in Stirling we were able to help subsidise our travel to matches, referees, equipment and our accommodation for British Championships. One year we managed to raise over £, between ourselves and the ladies team through the sponsorship agreement which was huge for both teams financially. In October , the club’s th Anniversary, we reached out to as many former players as we could contact and invited them to Stirling for a meal in aroom at the event centre of the University. The event was well attended and a number of the former players turned up to support us earlier in the day as we had a home game against Heriot-Watt. It was great to meet former players and hear stories of their time as part of the club. We had been planning to do something along the same lines last October for the th Anniversary, until Covid- scuppered our plans. From humble beginnings and  years later, the GAA roots in Stirling remain. Central to all of that was the Derry influence, as the baton was passed along the line.- Part one of the story of Stirlings Derry roots - Build it and they will come CLICK HERE...\",\"keywords\":\"GAA,Oisin Moran,Derry,StirlingGAA,Scotland,Aaron Conway\",\"articleSection\":\"Features\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"In part two of our look at the Derry influence on Stirling University, Michael McMullan looked into the experiences of Magherafelt man Oisin Moran and Craigbanes Aaron Conway as they kept the club on track.\",\"author\":,\"dateCreated\":\"--T::Z\",\"dateModied\":\"--T::Z\",\"datePublished\":\"--T::Z\" cmspos   *** Handle jQuery plugin naming conflict between jQuery UI and Bootstrap *** .widget.bridge@-webkit-viewport @-moz-viewport@-ms-viewport @-o-viewport@viewport - Twitter, Inc.

Every four years, the le-cycle of the average course, the committee members will move on. The early years in Stirling, with Magherafelt man Declan Loane founding the club in , were fruitful with the establishment of the clubs sevens tournament. But it needed to have a spine to carry it all the way to the current day. Lisburn man Peter ONeill and Ben McCloskey of Ballinascreen are at the forefront of the club, but passing the baton was the important piece of the puzzle. In Loanes final final year, a new committee was elected to take the club forward and keep the transition smooth, with members having experience in running all aspects of the club. googletag.cmd.push Down man Stephen Gallagher, the team captain, became Chairperson and Gabrielle Dunne , hailing from Strabane, took up the position of Club Secretary.

For me this was better than expected, as I was able to make friends with people from home and to have the chance to start playing Gaelic football again as I had stopped playing for Craigbane at U level. At the end of my first year, I was voted onto the committee as the social secretary and it was only here where I started to see the work that went on behind the scenes to keep the club running. One of the major challenges which most university sports teams face is the constant turnover of players and members. We had to try and find as many Irish players as we could and then supplement that by training up non-Irish guys who were interested in playing and try to get them up to speed before the first games of the season which were usually in the first weeks of October. This didn’t give us much time and wasn’t helped by the lack of floodlights on the grass pitches which meant that from October until February most of our training sessions were held on a G pitch with only soccer goals to use for shooting drills. Throughout my time at Stirling, we were lucky to have a good core of Irish players and managed to successfully train up a few from scratch into fairly decent players. Most of the players during my time were from the UK and Ireland but we also had players from Sweden, Spain and even Australia. The league was always dficult to compete in as we were coming up against teams from Glasgow, Edinburgh Aberdeen and Dundee most of whom were able to field teams with at least  or  Irish players. We might have only had six or seven, with the rest made up of players who may have only had a handful of training sessions before being flung in at the deep end so to speak. This meant some one-sided matches at times but the key thing here was to try and make sure the new lads didn’t get too disheartened. The British Championships would have been our main focus each year as we would be playing teams from all over Britain with similar ability to ourselves. In , which was my first time going to the British Championship, we reached the quarter finals where we were beaten by a strong Heriot-Watt team that reached the final that year. The following year in , when I was now President of the club, we were confident of doing well as we had a good squad and had trained hard however fortunes weren’t to be in our favour as due to waterlogged pitches. All  teams in our ision had to play their matches on one already drenched pitch in Leeds. By the time of the fourth game of the day the surface resembled a bog more than a football pitch, games were changed to  minutes straight to try and get the competition finished. Our last game of the competition finished - to -, giving you a taste of the conditions which also meant we would finish second in the group and miss out on the semi-finals. In  in my final year on the team and still president we were determined to go one step further, but a last-minute change of dates meant we wouldn’t be able to send a team that year as everyone had already changed their commitments for the original date which was disappointing personally. Outside of football the British Championship weekends in Manchester were always a great weekends craic and was good for team bonding. The St Patricks Day Festival Cup was a challenge match we played every year against Sands McSwineys Coatbridge who are a club team from just outside Glasgow. Despite the name the cup match has been played anywhere from December to April but was usually played a week or two after St Patricks Day. This was good for us in the committee as it gave us something to keep training for after British championships. The games against Coatbridge were always competitive and occasionally controversial. After two attempts – a defeat and a controversial late abandonment when we were seven or eight points clear - we eventually got our hands on the trophy which was a good experience for some of the lads who were new to the sport. We were able to defend our trophy the following year as well. The social aspect of the club was also very important, having a strong social element allowed the guys who maybe weren’t the best players or couldn’t make training sessions or matches due to other commitments were still very much included in the club. Throughout the year we would hold multiple socials and nights out alongside the ladies team. The All Ireland Final and the Sky GAA TV deal was a major boost for us at the time, because it meant that we would be able to hold the social in Molly Malones Bar in Stirling instead of having to travel to Glasgow or Edinburgh. It quickly became a tradition that every year ourselves and the ladies would watch the game and it was an important social event. It was usually on the weekend after the sports bazaar so it was good for anyone who was joining the team to come along and meet the current team. Through sponsorship agreements with Dusk nightclub in Stirling we were able to help subsidise our travel to matches, referees, equipment and our accommodation for British Championships. One year we managed to raise over pound, between ourselves and the ladies team through the sponsorship agreement which was huge for both teams financially. In October , the club’s th Anniversary, we reached out to as many former players as we could contact and invited them to Stirling for a meal in aroom at the event centre of the University. The event was well attended and a number of the former players turned up to support us earlier in the day as we had a home game against Heriot-Watt. It was great to meet former players and hear stories of their time as part of the club. We had been planning to do something along the same lines last October for the th Anniversary, until Covid- scuppered our plans. From humble beginnings and  years later, the GAA roots in Stirling remain. Central to all of that was the Derry influence, as the baton was passed along the line.  - Part one of the story of Stirlings Derry roots - Build it and they will come CLICK HERE...  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The had time left on their degree courses and their leadership and commitment aided a developing club into a growing entity. The club continued to grow in numbers and grow stronger both on and off the field year on year. Several players, including Stephen, went on to play for Scotland at the British Universities Tournament. And members of the club gained colours for their contribution to sporting le while at University. “Stephen was captain on the field and went on to show these same leadership skills, whilst in the chair,” Declan commented. “Gaby contributed immensely throughout the formative years as well in ious roles within the committee. “Having worked closely with both, I knew the club and the future were in safe dedicated hands,” Loane added. “All university clubs need and rely on a continuation of committed iniduals beyond one degree term, to keep the momentum of any club. With each new academic year, all clubs hope that a committed fresher will come on-board – both on and off the field. In my time, that fresher was Stephen.” It was only the beginning and it wasnt too long before there were Derry fingerprints on the clubs baton again. Oisin Moran and Aaron Conwaypictured at Freshers Day  in Stirling Magherafelt man Oisin Moran, son of former Derry physio Sean, arrived in Stirling to study Sports and Exercise Science. He was part of a very successful underage team at home, which culminated in winning the  All-Ireland U Féile. On new soil he didnt know anyone and had to build a new friendship network that remains strong to this day. Oisin takes up the story. When I joined the team, there was a mix of Irish and non-Irish players with a  of . As most of the players were in their final year, it created problems when I took over the club the following year. During my first year I learned a lot about the club traditions and values which Declan had cited. The Stirling team did not have a large  of  plus Irish players to choose from like some universities so we had to branch out and attract players from a non GAA background and from dferent parts of the world. A sense of family was soon established, much like clubs at home. We had the opportunity to go down and play in the British Championships in Birmingham, which helped give me an insight to the championship and made me determined to bring the club down every year and to compete against other Universities from Scotland and England. Towards the end of my first year we held our AGM and I put my name forward to be nominated for captain of the team the following year and I was successfully appointed. Odhran Hassan from Banagher was elected president of the club at the same time and we came together at the end of our first year to develop a plan to build and grow the club both on and off the field. I think this is a challenge for most University Clubs as teams have to be rebuilt regularly and it’s an even bigger challenge for teams like ourselves as we don’t get an influx of Irish students every year. At the start of second year, myself and Odhran began the process of rebuilding and quickly started the recruitment process. This included social media posts, putting posters up around the university, handing out flyers. We also had a stall booked for the sports bazaar which is held during Freshers week. Overall our recruitment drive was very successful and we got around  people to join the club. Myself and Odhran ran the club, we trained the team as well as honouring and managing our sponsorship agreements. We arranged referees for games andplaying away would secure transport to and from the venue. We needed good time management, as we were doing this alongside studying for a degree. However I wouldn’t have changed it for the world. Id happily do it again as I was doing the role because I love the sport and wanted to grow and develop the club. At the AGM I stood for the position of President and I was successfully appointed for the - season. As President, I continued to build on the good work myself and Odhran started and continued to expand the clubs numbers and also had the opportunity and resources to attend British Championships again that year. We also combined the women’s Gaelic team onto our sponsorship agreement which helped bring the two clubs closer together. Throughout the year we held joint social events which were great craic and also every week we held a joint training session on a Sundayno league games were being played that weekend just to get everyone together and have a bit of fun playing the sport we all love. Towards the second half of the year I made the decision that I should pass the responsibilities of running the club over to someone  as I was going into my final year and needed to focus on my studies and I knew I couldn’t commit the proper time that was needed to successfully run the team. At this point I could see Aaronwas very committed to the team and could see he shared the same love and enthusiasm for the sport. Maybe it was because we are both from Derry, but I knew the club would be in safe hands so I encouraged him to run for President at the end of year and I would be there in my final year to give him any advice he would need. Overall I’m very proud I had the opportunity to be a part of the club and learn its history and then be able to contribute to maintaining the traditions and club values whilst helping build the club over the years I was attending University in Stirling. If you asked me what was a more important achievement to me gaining a degree or running a Gaelic team it would be the Gaelic team and it wouldn’t even be close. *** Aaron Conways first experience of the Stirling University Gaelic football team was on a Wednesday afternoon, in September , at the sports bazaar. Having moved over from Derry, without knowing anyone beforehand, he figured it would be a good way to settle in and make friends. He takes up the story. I had just put my name down for trials for the soccer team when I overheard a thick Irish accent say ah lads Mayo have no chance against Dublin on Sunday, I looked over to see a guy in a Roscommon jersey sat at a table with a tricolour hung in the background. As I walked over, I saw a sign which read Men’s Gaelic Football and a laptop on the table which was showing the  All Ireland Football Final. As I approached the table, a guy in a Derry jersey introduced himself as Odhran and askedI was interested in joining the team. We chatted for a few minutes and I gave him my contact details and that was it. For me this was better than expected, as I was able to make friends with people from home and to have the chance to start playing Gaelic football again as I had stopped playing for Craigbane at U level. At the end of my first year, I was voted onto the committee as the social secretary and it was only here where I started to see the work that went on behind the scenes to keep the club running.

Every four years, the le-cycle of the average course, the committee members will move on. The early years in Stirling, with Magherafelt man Declan Loane founding the club in , were fruitful with the establishment of the clubs sevens tournament. But it needed to have a spine to carry it all the way to the current day. Lisburn man Peter ONeill and Ben McCloskey of Ballinascreen are at the forefront of the club, but passing the baton was the important piece of the puzzle. In Loanes final final year, a new committee was elected to take the club forward and keep the transition smooth, with members having experience in running all aspects of the club. googletag.cmd.push Down man Stephen Gallagher, the team captain, became Chairperson and Gabrielle Dunne , hailing from Strabane, took up the position of Club Secretary. The had time left on their degree courses and their leadership and commitment aided a developing club into a growing entity. The club continued to grow in numbers and grow stronger both on and off the field year on year. Several players, including Stephen, went on to play for Scotland at the British Universities Tournament. And members of the club gained colours for their contribution to sporting le while at University. “Stephen was captain on the field and went on to show these same leadership skills, whilst in the chair,” Declan commented. googletag.cmd.push “Gaby contributed immensely throughout the formative years as well in ious roles within the committee. “Having worked closely with both, I knew the club and the future were in safe dedicated hands,” Loane added. “All university clubs need and rely on a continuation of committed iniduals beyond one degree term, to keep the momentum of any club. With each new academic year, all clubs hope that a committed fresher will come on-board – both on and off the field. In my time, that fresher was Stephen.” It was only the beginning and it wasnt too long before there were Derry fingerprints on the clubs baton again.     Oisin Moran and Aaron Conwaypictured at Freshers Day  in Stirling Magherafelt man Oisin Moran, son of former Derry physio Sean, arrived in Stirling to study Sports and Exercise Science. He was part of a very successful underage team at home, which culminated in winning the  All-Ireland U Feacuteile. On new soil he didnt know anyone and had to build a new friendship network that remains strong to this day. Oisin takes up the story. When I joined the team, there was a mix of Irish and non-Irish players with a  of . As most of the players were in their final year, it created problems when I took over the club the following year. During my first year I learned a lot about the club traditions and values which Declan had cited. The Stirling team did not have a large  of  plus Irish players to choose from like some universities so we had to branch out and attract players from a non GAA background and from dferent parts of the world. A sense of family was soon established, much like clubs at home. We had the opportunity to go down and play in the British Championships in Birmingham, which helped give me an insight to the championship and made me determined to bring the club down every year and to compete against other Universities from Scotland and England. Towards the end of my first year we held our AGM and I put my name forward to be nominated for captain of the team the following year and I was successfully appointed. Odhran Hassan from Banagher was elected president of the club at the same time and we came together at the end of our first year to develop a plan to build and grow the club both on and off the field. I think this is a challenge for most University Clubs as teams have to be rebuilt regularly and it’s an even bigger challenge for teams like ourselves as we don’t get an influx of Irish students every year. At the start of second year, myself and Odhran began the process of rebuilding and quickly started the recruitment process. This included social media posts, putting posters up around the university, handing out flyers. We also had a stall booked for the sports bazaar which is held during Freshers week. Overall our recruitment drive was very successful and we got around  people to join the club. Myself and Odhran ran the club, we trained the team as well as honouring and managing our sponsorship agreements. We arranged referees for games andplaying away would secure transport to and from the venue. We needed good time management,as we were doing this alongside studying for a degree. However I wouldn’t have changed it for the world. Id happily do it again as I was doing the role because I love the sport and wanted to grow and develop the club. At the AGM I stood for the position of President and I was successfully appointed for the - season. As President, I continued to build on the good work myself and Odhran started and continued to expand the clubs numbers and also had the opportunity and resources to attend British Championships again that year. We also combined the women’s Gaelic team onto our sponsorship agreement which helped bring the two clubs closer together. Throughout the year we held joint social events which were great craic and also every week we held a joint training session on a Sundayno league games were being played that weekend just to get everyone together and have a bit of fun playing the sport we all love. Towards the second half of the year I made the decision that I should pass the responsibilities of running the club over to someone  as I was going into my final year and needed to focus on my studies and I knew I couldn’t commit the proper time that was needed to successfully run the team. At this point I could see Aaronwas very committed to the team and could see he shared the same love and enthusiasm for the sport. Maybe it was because we are both from Derry, but I knew the club would be in safe hands so I encouraged him to run for President at the end of year and I would be there in my final year to give him any advice he would need. Overall I’m very proud I had the opportunity to be a part of the club and learn its history and then be able to contribute to maintaining the traditions and club values whilst helping build the club over the years I was attending University in Stirling. If you asked me what was a more important achievement to me gaining a degree or running a Gaelic team it would be the Gaelic team and it wouldn’t even be close. *** Aaron Conways first experience of the Stirling University Gaelic football team was on a Wednesday afternoon, in September , at the sports bazaar. Having moved over from Derry, without knowing anyone beforehand, he figured it would be a good way to settle in and make friends. He takes up the story. I had just put my name down for trials for the soccer team when I overheard a thick Irish accent say ah lads Mayo have no chance against Dublin on Sunday, I looked over to see a guy in a Roscommon jersey sat at a table with a tricolour hung in the background. As I walked over, I saw a sign which read Men’s Gaelic Football and a laptop on the table which was showing the  All Ireland Football Final. As I approached the table, a guy in a Derry jersey introduced himself as Odhran and askedI was interested in joining the team. We chatted for a few minutes and I gave him my contact details and that was it. For me this was better than expected, as I was able to make friends with people from home and to have the chance to start playing Gaelic football again as I had stopped playing for Craigbane at U level. At the end of my first year, I was voted onto the committee as the social secretary and it was only here where I started to see the work that went on behind the scenes to keep the club running. One of the major challenges which most university sports teams face is the constant turnover of players and members. We had to try and find as many Irish players as we could and then supplement that by training up non-Irish guys who were interested in playing and try to get them up to speed before the first games of the season which were usually in the first weeks of October. This didn’t give us much time and wasn’t helped by the lack of floodlights on the grass pitches which meant that from October until February most of our training sessions were held on a G pitch with only soccer goals to use for shooting drills. Throughout my time at Stirling, we were lucky to have a good core of Irish players and managed to successfully train up a few from scratch into fairly decent players. Most of the players during my time were from the UK and Ireland but we also had players from Sweden, Spain and even Australia. The league was always dficult to compete in as we were coming up against teams from Glasgow, Edinburgh Aberdeen and Dundee most of whom were able to field teams with at least  or  Irish players. We might have only had six or seven, with the rest made up of players who may have only had a handful of training sessions before being flung in at the deep end so to speak. This meant some one-sided matches at times but the key thing here was to try and make sure the new lads didn’t get too disheartened. The British Championships would have been our main focus each year as we would be playing teams from all over Britain with similar ability to ourselves. In , which was my first time going to the British Championship, we reached the quarter finals where we were beaten by a strong Heriot-Watt team that reached the final that year. The following year in , when I was now President of the club, we were confident of doing well as we had a good squad and had trained hard however fortunes weren’t to be in our favour as due to waterlogged pitches. All  teams in our ision had to play their matches on one already drenched pitch in Leeds. By the time of the fourth game of the day the surface resembled a bog more than a football pitch, games were changed to  minutes straight to try and get the competition finished. Our last game of the competition finished - to -, giving you a taste of the conditions which also meant we would finish second in the group and miss out on the semi-finals. In  in my final year on the team and still president we were determined to go one step further, but a last-minute change of dates meant we wouldn’t be able to send a team that year as everyone had already changed their commitments for the original date which was disappointing personally. Outside of football the British Championship weekends in Manchester were always a great weekends craic and was good for team bonding. The St Patricks Day Festival Cup was a challenge match we played every year against Sands McSwineys Coatbridge who are a club team from just outside Glasgow. Despite the name the cup match has been played anywhere from December to April but was usually played a week or two after St Patricks Day. This was good for us in the committee as it gave us something to keep training for after British championships. The games against Coatbridge were always competitive and occasionally controversial. After two attempts – a defeat and a controversial late abandonment when we were seven or eight points clear - we eventually got our hands on the trophy which was a good experience for some of the lads who were new to the sport. We were able to defend our trophy the following year as well. The social aspect of the club was also very important, having a strong social element allowed the guys who maybe weren’t the best players or couldn’t make training sessions or matches due to other commitments were still very much included in the club. Throughout the year we would hold multiple socials and nights out alongside the ladies team. The All Ireland Final and the Sky GAA TV deal was a major boost for us at the time, because it meant that we would be able to hold the social in Molly Malones Bar in Stirling instead of having to travel to Glasgow or Edinburgh. It quickly became a tradition that every year ourselves and the ladies would watch the game and it was an important social event. It was usually on the weekend after the sports bazaar so it was good for anyone who was joining the team to come along and meet the current team. Through sponsorship agreements with Dusk nightclub in Stirling we were able to help subsidise our travel to matches, referees, equipment and our accommodation for British Championships. One year we managed to raise over pound, between ourselves and the ladies team through the sponsorship agreement which was huge for both teams financially. In October , the club’s th Anniversary, we reached out to as many former players as we could contact and invited them to Stirling for a meal in aroom at the event centre of the University. The event was well attended and a number of the former players turned up to support us earlier in the day as we had a home game against Heriot-Watt. It was great to meet former players and hear stories of their time as part of the club. We had been planning to do something along the same lines last October for the th Anniversary, until Covid- scuppered our plans. From humble beginnings and  years later, the GAA roots in Stirling remain. Central to all of that was the Derry influence, as the baton was passed along the line.  - Part one of the story of Stirlings Derry roots - Build it and they will come CLICK HERE...  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This column also feels there would be some mileage in Prentys thoughts, which he said would stop what he called the runaway train that is the inter-county game. While he cites costs as one of his reasons, and it is an issue, I think a more streamlined county scene would allow club and county to dovetail nicely together. googletag.cmd.push Albeit forced on us by Covid-, the split season has already been a great move by fixture chiefs in the association. It enables club and county to have their dedicated piece of the pie, something Shane McGuigan outlined in a recent interview. It allowed players, in his experience, to be fully in the room when the county or club is taking preference. No more would it be a case of just having one eye on the prize at stake. And the club game delivered by the lorry load. It offered a product that the national print and broadcast media embraced. Club players were now front and centre. Just as they should be. googletag.cmd.push On the county scene, we will park the overusedDublin are miles ahead narrative for now. The  season gave us Cavan, a story that so many of us can be inspired by. But with a shortened championship, it allowed us to escape the kerfuffle of the Super s. However, we paid the price with two landslide semi-finals. Tyrone, Donegal, Galway, Cork or Kerry would have added more substance to the last four hands grasping for Sam Maguire. Its up to them to get themselves back out of their province. Until Leinster can get back to the level Dublin are at, we are always going to have a lopsided championship.     Thats why I feel John Prentys thoughts need proper consideration. Its time the GAA took a truthful look in the mirror. And reflect where it will be in five years time. Almost five years ago now, I had a conversation with a club manager. One of those off the record what do you think of the game type of chats. As we tried to put the world to right, he said one thing that summed up our conversation. We agreed that an All-Ireland winning manager lting the lid on his teams path to success, revealing just two collective training sessions per week as the core to their championship fine-tuning would be a game-changer. It wouldnt be long until every manager would follow suit. The sheep mentality in us latches onto winning trends. Kieran Donaghy was in the inter-county wilderness, a midfielder on the fringes of Kerrys starting , until Jack OConnor threw him in at full-forward during a qualier game against Longford. It worked a treat, in that Jack had the players to leave the ball hanging over his head and make him the ideal target-man. Donaghy became highly effective in Kerrys system. Soon club managers were throwing every big man they would find, not making the cut at midfield, onto the fringe of the square. Players were put in goals for their kicking accuracy to be the next Cluxton. After Alex Fergusons use of super subs Sheringham and Solskjaer to land the  Champions League, certain players were soon called impact men, left on the bench so a manager could finish with a stronger team when he started when the defenders legs began to tire. People are easily influenced. Mick ODwyer and Kevin Heffernan always ramped their training upthey lost out to each other in the s tussles between the teams. ODwyer was reported to have trained the Kerry team  days in a row, to find an edge. Thats why it would be a breath of fresh airDublin and Limerick, the GAAs current benchmark, were to strip back their management teams and train collectively for two pitch sessions a week. With an increase in the number of gyms in clubs across Ireland on the up, would it not make better sense for county players to conduct their strength and conditioning work among their grass-roots. Counties who have invested a small fortune developing state of the art facilities will be pulling their hair out, but there are benefits to be had from a change in tact. Firstly, it would save the county board an extra couple of nights of travelling and feeding expenses. The players would have a greater bond with their club, who have spent money to kit out their facilities. Every county player would be given a programme to follow and be tested at ious key intervals. Lets face it, the players who really want to succeed will follow the plan. They could even educate their club friendship group on the basics, so there is a trickle down effect. And they can revolve the gym session around their work, family and getting home to watch Liverpool or Man United slug it out on the telly. The multiple lock-downs have shown us that video analysis meetings could all be done remotely via zoom. Counties could streamline feedback to last shorter and done from the players sofa. All of a sudden, the inter-county scene – while still offering a high level of preparation – is no longer equivalent to a second job, with the amount of travel and collective time a player has to commit to. Imagine this was of Peter Keanes tale after Kerry could manage to win Sam later this year and everyone followed. It would leave team expenses more manageable to county treasurers. Players would be able to fit in study, a family le and overtime at work. If this was the case, would the sixMayo players have retired  I think it would allow players to have a longer playing career, it would mean that less players would be fast-tracked in from minors. It would allow students to get a proper crack at playing for their Fresher and Sigerson teams. The club and county U competitions would find a proper home. As a result, the inter-county game would be closer to the amateur side of the scale than elite. The knock-on is having a better balance all round – both in the countys bank account and the players lestyle. And they will still get the buzz when they run out to test themselves against the best every other county has to offer. I have never met John Prenty, but I like his idea. It makes so much sense.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In this article, he pays tribute to his friend and former colleague, Doctor Tom McGinley, who died last week. --------------------------------------------- Recent days saw the passing of a greatly loved and appreciated ‘son’ of the city. Though a deeply sad time for his family and the many thousands who benefited from his prolonged services to the terminally ill and their families, it is also a time, soon, to begin to celebrate the le of someone who will, it can be said, never be forgotten, and whose legacy is very personal to many. googletag.cmd.push When the book, BUILDING BRIDGES, the story of Foyle Hospice, was launched in December  it was dedicated to the people of the north-west corner of Ireland who have, in myriad ways, contributed to the success of Foyle Hospice to Dr Tom McGinley without whom it could not exist, and to Deirdre, his beloved we, whose wholehearted support allowed him the time and the space to fulfil his dream. Tom always related the ongoing success to the ‘people’ who generously donated and volunteered in many ways. Every great project starts with a ‘thought’, a ‘dream’you will. But how many have the driving force, the determination, as well as the time and energy to make that dream come true  Very few I guess. googletag.cmd.push Tom was one, who forced his way through all challenges, not without pain himself. Many were the ups and downs. The challenge was triggered when, in the ’s as a GP in a large and busy City Practice, he was treating a young man terminally ill with bone cancer. Morphine was considered a very dangerous drug which could not be given too frequently. Tom realised that treating those with a terminal illness was not easy or advanced in those days. This problem sank into his soul and, while still working as a full-time GP, he decided to study anaesthetics to learn about pain control.     By the end of the s and into the ’s he suddenly heard that the new Northern Hospice was raising money in the North-west. He said “We need a hospice – and we need it now.” The pace picked up rapidly. He founded the Foyle Female Five a race for ladies which raised many thousands of pounds. A small steering committee was started, by Tom and myself in the autumn of  which was soon joined by Dr Ailbie Bierne, Hugh McElhinny, Ken Goodall, and Grainne Nugent. An official Guildhall launch took placein January  with a goal to raise pound, - .  A centre was bought in Crawford Square and a Home Care Service started in . Fund-raising accelerated and the search for a suitable site was the next huge step. This was to support the home-care with ‘inpatient back-up beds’. Tom agreed that the Foyle Bridge should be the symbol for the hospice – which assisted patients and their families across three bridges, the one between le and death, the one that traversed the border between North and South, and the one which broke barriers between Catholic and Protestant. He was firmly told by a priest at the time, that the new hospice had to be Catholic in character, while a Protestant group complained that it would be too nationalist. We secretly decided one night to build it in the middle of the bridge! The triumphant goal of opening the Inpatient Unit came on a Thursday in June . A large group from all levels of society were invited – too many to accommodate inside. Prayers were said to prevent rain. Well, it did rain on the Monday, the Tuesday, the Wednesday, but on the Thursday the sun shone all day. Radio Foyle broadcast the ceremony live. On the Friday it rained again! A problem had reared its head prior to the opening. The decision to ask someone to ‘cut the ribbon’ was not an easy one, as you would guess. Would we ask a politician  A church leader  A film star  Given the social milieu we all lived in, the task was not easy. The perfect solution suddenly occurred. Tom agreed would invite two children, whose mothers had passed away from cancer. One was a Catholic and the other a Protestant. They would cut the ribbon together.  Since then the hospice has grown, the virgin gardens have bloomed more beautully every year. The services of the Hospice have expanded and developed. In  a new day centre was opened onsite, expanding services yet again. The fund-raising centre was also on-site, headed by Ciaran McGinley. Towards the end of , Dr McGinley felt that due to health reasons he must step down. The Board reluctantly accepted his decision and fully appreciated his reasons. Tom had dreamed a dream. He had become the driving force towards founding the Foyle Hospice. He had been Medical Director, chairman of the Board as well as acting as CEO. History has been made, his accolades well earned. Tom was awarded a Papal Knighthood for his work, received Freedom of the City, and many other awards. There is a statue placed close to the path between St Columb’s Park and the Foyle Bridge right beside the courageous flier, Amelia Earhart. More than all of these awards, however, are the thoughts and prayers of those many thousands of patients and families who, over many decades, have benefited from the services of a dream come true. The poem, Ulysses, by Alfred Lord Tennyson, ends with the following: “To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.” Tomaacutes McGinley gave us a dream, and then left it with us.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In this article, he pays tribute to his friend and former colleague, Doctor Tom McGinley, who died last week. --------------------------------------------- Recent days saw the passing of a greatly loved and appreciated ‘son’ of the city. Though a deeply sad time for his family and the many thousands who benefited from his prolonged services to the terminally ill and their families, it is also a time, soon, to begin to celebrate the le of someone who will, it can be said, never be forgotten, and whose legacy is very personal to many. googletag.cmd.push When the book, BUILDING BRIDGES, the story of Foyle Hospice, was launched in December  it was dedicated to the people of the north-west corner of Ireland who have, in myriad ways, contributed to the success of Foyle Hospice to Dr Tom McGinley without whom it could not exist, and to Deirdre, his beloved we, whose wholehearted support allowed him the time and the space to fulfil his dream. Tom always related the ongoing success to the ‘people’ who generously donated and volunteered in many ways. Every great project starts with a ‘thought’, a ‘dream’you will. But how many have the driving force, the determination, as well as the time and energy to make that dream come true  Very few I guess. googletag.cmd.push Tom was one, who forced his way through all challenges, not without pain himself. Many were the ups and downs. The challenge was triggered when, in the ’s as a GP in a large and busy City Practice, he was treating a young man terminally ill with bone cancer. Morphine was considered a very dangerous drug which could not be given too frequently. Tom realised that treating those with a terminal illness was not easy or advanced in those days. This problem sank into his soul and, while still working as a full-time GP, he decided to study anaesthetics to learn about pain control.     By the end of the s and into the ’s he suddenly heard that the new Northern Hospice was raising money in the North-west. He said “We need a hospice – and we need it now.” The pace picked up rapidly. He founded the Foyle Female Five a race for ladies which raised many thousands of pounds. A small steering committee was started, by Tom and myself in the autumn of  which was soon joined by Dr Ailbie Bierne, Hugh McElhinny, Ken Goodall, and Grainne Nugent. An official Guildhall launch took placein January  with a goal to raise pound, - .  A centre was bought in Crawford Square and a Home Care Service started in . Fund-raising accelerated and the search for a suitable site was the next huge step. This was to support the home-care with ‘inpatient back-up beds’. Tom agreed that the Foyle Bridge should be the symbol for the hospice – which assisted patients and their families across three bridges, the one between le and death, the one that traversed the border between North and South, and the one which broke barriers between Catholic and Protestant. He was firmly told by a priest at the time, that the new hospice had to be Catholic in character, while a Protestant group complained that it would be too nationalist. We secretly decided one night to build it in the middle of the bridge! The triumphant goal of opening the Inpatient Unit came on a Thursday in June . A large group from all levels of society were invited – too many to accommodate inside. Prayers were said to prevent rain. Well, it did rain on the Monday, the Tuesday, the Wednesday, but on the Thursday the sun shone all day. Radio Foyle broadcast the ceremony live. On the Friday it rained again! A problem had reared its head prior to the opening. The decision to ask someone to ‘cut the ribbon’ was not an easy one, as you would guess. Would we ask a politician  A church leader  A film star  Given the social milieu we all lived in, the task was not easy. The perfect solution suddenly occurred. Tom agreed would invite two children, whose mothers had passed away from cancer. One was a Catholic and the other a Protestant. They would cut the ribbon together.  Since then the hospice has grown, the virgin gardens have bloomed more beautully every year. The services of the Hospice have expanded and developed. In  a new day centre was opened onsite, expanding services yet again. The fund-raising centre was also on-site, headed by Ciaran McGinley. Towards the end of , Dr McGinley felt that due to health reasons he must step down. The Board reluctantly accepted his decision and fully appreciated his reasons. Tom had dreamed a dream. He had become the driving force towards founding the Foyle Hospice. He had been Medical Director, chairman of the Board as well as acting as CEO. History has been made, his accolades well earned. Tom was awarded a Papal Knighthood for his work, received Freedom of the City, and many other awards. There is a statue placed close to the path between St Columb’s Park and the Foyle Bridge right beside the courageous flier, Amelia Earhart. More than all of these awards, however, are the thoughts and prayers of those many thousands of patients and families who, over many decades, have benefited from the services of a dream come true. The poem, Ulysses, by Alfred Lord Tennyson, ends with the following: “To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.” Tomaacutes McGinley gave us a dream, and then left it with us.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The mural at Great James Street was created by local company UV Arts. Ahead of the broadcast of the new ITV programme Home Sweet Home, which will feature Derry in an episode airing on Tuesday, February , it has been revealed that the mural was suggested by Joanna Lumley, the show’s presenter. Ms Lumley visited Derry in  to take part in a conference marking the th anniversary of Children in Crossfire, the charity set up by Mr Moore. She ed last autumn to film for the series in which she visits places special to her. googletag.cmd.push Ms Lumley said: “In Derry we wanted to film the historic murals, The Derry Girls and my friend Richard Moore, the ‘Derry Lama’, as the Dalai Lama calls him. “It suddenly seemed that we could link these three stories together by art: the ravishing mural Saoirse-Monica showed me of the Derry Girls led us easily to Karl, whose team is creating such important new art work in this fabulous city. “Would it be possible to celebrate the le-affirming achievements of the man the Dalai Lama calls ‘My hero’ in a mural  “The finished work is utterly magnicent, and I am proud that I was allowed to spray a tiny bit of it under Karl’s watchful eye. Part of me will always remain in Derry, a city I love with all my heart.” googletag.cmd.push  Mr Moore said: “When Joanna told me towards the end of our recording that we had one more stop to make, I could not have ever imagined what I was about to be shown. “I am so honoured and humbled at this wonderfully generous gesture. Joanna has been a good friend to me and a great supporter of Children in Crossfire, both of which mean a great deal to me. “She has also built a great rapport with Derry and many of its people, and I look forward to tuning in to Home Sweet Home to see our city at its best.     “I am also grateful to Karl Porter from UV Arts for his vision and genuine passion for this project”. Karl Porter from UV Arts, the creative arts team behind a whole host of public artworks in the city and the artist who painted the mural, said: “Its not everyday you get to paint a mural with Joanna Lumley, who is apparently very afraid of heights and I was told she will not get on the lt, but she did! “ “Joanna helped me direct the cherry picker and also painted one of the most important parts of the mural - the connection, the area where The Dalai Lama and Richard Moore touched. “I think the symbolism of this helps strengthen the relationship and the meaning behind the mural. “The mural depicts a Buddhist blessing, a signicant moment between His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Richard Moore. “The Unalome symbol rising from that connection is the Buddhist symbol representing the path to enlightenment. “Our journey in le is never perfect, never straight or even in the right direction but a journey nonetheless, full of lessons and experiences. Something that Richard has lived experience of, having overcome such a powerful injury to lead a wholesome and selfless le dedicated to others.” Karl said that when first approached about the project he was delighted to have the chance to celebrate one of Derrys greatest living heroes. “The chance to create our own connections led us to collaborate with Belfast based artist and illustrator Conor McClure and together create this powerful piece of art. “If you look closely, the shape of the heads and the Dalai Lamas embrace - forms the shape of a heart, a simple yet subtle way to celebrate the connections between these two iniduals. “It was a great privilege for me to be asked to produce this new mural. The image we have used is iconic, showing the Dalai Lama’s deep spirituality as well as his admiration for Richard Moore. I hope it will attract locals and visitors alike for many years to come and a poignant new addition to our street art movement in the city.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The plans involved the construction of  houses at a riverside site at Rossbay off the Limavady Road. Residents in the area had raised a large number of concerns in relation to the plans, including road safety and congestion issues. The plans were first submitted to Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning department in . They involved the proposed construction of  houses and eight bungalows on the land overlooking the River Foyle. After detailed examinations, the councils planning department recommended that the plans be approved. googletag.cmd.push However, the final say on planning applications rests with councillors on the councils Planning Committee. The committee held its monthly meeting today and there was a y discussion on the plans for the Rossbay site. Representatives for local residents opposed to the development and the company behind the housing plans were given the opportunity to address the meeting. The meeting was told that although  objections had been received in relation to the plans, they involved multiple submissions from  properties in the surrounding area. This was the largest number of objections that the council has ever received in relation to a planning application. googletag.cmd.push After the ious arguments were put forward at todays meeting, DUP councillor Hilary McClintock proposed that the committee go against the recommendation of the councils planning department and refuse permission for the Waterside development. Her proposal was seconded by SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins and supported unanimously by all the councillors who were eligible to vote at the meeting. If so wished, the developer can now appeal the councils decision through the Planning Appeals Commission.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Signicant progress was made today in our challenge against the continued prohibition on children’s outdoor sport, said Mr Atherton. At the th hour, lawyers acting on behalf of the Department of Health conceded that we have presented an arguable case before the Court and the challenge will now move to a full expedited hearing on March . googletag.cmd.push While pursuing the review, Mr Atherton has again called on the Executive to lt the restrictions on youth sport immediately.

Mr Fitzsimons is well-known for his walking tours in this area.ldquoI came up with the idea of doing the coastal path and following the pilgrim path to the holy well, he said.ldquoThe reason we did that was because of the outstanding natural beauty that is there. It is a really undiscovered kind of gem in the whole of the island in terms of the natural beauty.As part of the filming, Duane met the former president and Ciara for a picnic and a chat. ldquoWe staged the picnic at Ballyhornan with an upturned boat and our lunch on top of it, he explained.He added that it was a delight to meet the former president.ldquoMary McAleese was really quite personable and willing to get to know a bit about me and also about the whole area.The programmes takes guests to dferent locations in Ireland to talk about their spiritual journey through le.It is the second film in the current series to showcase the beauty of the Co Down countryside.The first film aired last month and featured the former president with Dundrum-born comedian Patrick Kielty on a walk through St Patrickrsquos Way in the Mournes.Mr Kielty was asked about his faith in God and replied: ldquoIf you are not going to believe in God walking up the Mourne Mountains, when are you going to believe in Him Former Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has also taken part in the series this year.

A number of residents were also forced to leave their homes.The mortar was discovered at the side of a busy road close to the entrance to Tievenadarragh Wood and after it was inspected by Army Technical Officers and declared safe, the device was taken away for detailed forensic examination.A number of politicians have expressed concern that this is the third device of its kind linked to dissident republicans which has been discovered in the area over the past two years.Previous devices linked to the terror group have been discovered just a few miles from Seaforde at the Priestrsquos Road and Drumcaw Road near Clough.PSNI District Commander, Superintendent Norman Haslett, has confirmed that the device discovered at the Newcastle Road was a suspected component part of a mortar, but did not contain any explosives.He said that while it was too early to attribute ownership to any particular grouping, he believed that dissident republican terrorists were responsible.Mr Haslett said the matter remained under investigation and appealed for anyone who can assist police with their enquiries to get in contact with them.Politicians have roundly condemned those responsible for leaving the device at the side of one of the districtrsquos most busiest roads.South Down SDLP MLA Colin McGrath, Sinn Fein MLA Emma Rogan and Slieve Croob Ulster Unionist councillor Alan Lewis, said there was no justication for the actions of those responsible.Mr McGrath described the discovery of the mortar component as ldquovery concerning and said the repercussions of the weekend incident could have been devastating.He declared: Such devices are a thing of our past and have no place in our modern country. The inconvenience and impact of this incident on the local community will be considerable and I condemn those that placed that device.ldquoThe fact that the Newcastle Road had to be closed for a number of hours last Saturday evening is both infuriating and depressing. Infuriating because some iniduals wish to bring violence upon us and depressing at the thought of what might have come to pass,the device had not been found and dealt with.Mr McGrath, who thanked the emergency services for their swt response to the security alert, said those responsible ldquohave nothing to offer our society and are utterly contemptible.Condemning those responsible for the ldquodisruptive security alert, Ms Rogan described what happened as ldquoreckless activity.She declared: ldquoThe arearsquos district police commander has confirmed that a component part of a mortar device was found which could have been more sinister. Whoever was responsible for leaving this device and causing this disruption has shown complete disregard for the local community. There can be no justication for this type of reckless activity and those responsible need to cease these futile acts.Cllr Lewis said leaving a device at the side of the road ldquodemonstrates the stupidity of those responsible.He declared: ldquoTerrorism always finds a cause to attach itself and those seeking to ignite chaos and mayhem should reflect on the long-term realities of their aims. Tit-for-tat violence reenergises age-old conflict and no one will benefit from rising tension and public disorder.ldquoThose responsible are Neanderthals, plastic soldiers with romantic fantasies of days gone by. Just what are they trying to achieve Cllr Lewis said residents were ldquorightly alarmed at what happened last weekend, confirming that he is angry that a third mortar-type device has now been found in this part of the district in the past two years.He added: ldquoIt is time for the police to act. I want to see searches, investigations and arrests. I fear that dissident republicans are armed and dangerous and weapons in the hands of those who lack intelligence could quite possibly result in the loss of le.ldquoThis is  not  and those behind this incident need to pack up and go home. If they canrsquot win elections it demonstrates that the community doesnrsquot want nor support them and I question what mindless criminals behind this behaviour have to offer society.Anyone who can assist police with their enquiries is asked to get in touch using the non-emergency  number, quoting reference    .Information can also be provided online at http:www.psni.police.uk makeareport  or by using the confidential Crimestoppers number  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3Feb2021-Conor.jpg","title":"Downpatrick’s Conor makes move to Glens  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS Conor McMenamin has made the cross-city switch from Irish Premiership side Cltonville to Belfast rivals Glentoran.The -year old midfielder is back at the Oval for a second spell after a move to Warrenpoint Town followed by over two years at Solitude.Glentoran striker Paul OrsquoNeill is moving to Cltionville as part of the deal.Glentoran manager Mick McDermott said was delighted to secure McMenaminrsquos capture.ldquoWe are excited to secure the signature of Conor, arguably the hottest property in the league at this time, he remarked.ldquoI have always said that we will be interested when quality players become available.

It was something in the back of my mind to do but lockdown made me do it a lot earlier.She started up her consultancy business just over a year ago and has had to ldquothink outside the box since last March when social distancing became a new norm in the pandemic.ldquoWhen I first started the business, I wanted to empower children and their parents who would get an extra boost of some specialised training from me, she said. ldquoSometimes itrsquos hard for children to get all of their educational needs fully met in school.ldquoWhen I work one to one with them, itrsquos amazing to see their progress, even in such a short space of time. You see them really start to fly once their sensory system calms down and they are ready to take in information.Challenged by how she could still run her business during lockdown, Judith decided to put the eight acres of woodland she and her husband owns around their Crawfordstown Road home to good use.ldquoWe took over one acre and created the woodland classroom which can be accessed by a lot of willow structures that I created myself. Therersquos a massive tree house, things to swing on and climb on for the children to enjoy before they go into the woodland classroom which has everything an indoor classroom would have, she said.ldquoItrsquos actually great for both parents and children as they can listen to the birds and enjoy the woodland while their children are involved in learning activities.Judith has  years of experience of education special needs children after graduating from Cambridge University.ldquoI was always passionate about working with children with special needs and when I came back home I was fortunate enough to start working in Knockevin rather than starting in primary schools which I fully expected to do, said Judith.ldquoAfter a while I went to work in Bahrain to set up a school for special needs children on a three-year contract. I came back home just as things began to kick off in the Arab Spring and ed to work at Knockevin.ldquoI decided to set up my own practice in  as it was time to give some empowerment to parents as well as children. It gave me a chance to work with all aspects of a childrsquos development rather than working with one class for the whole year.Judith specialises in working with children aged -. She is also a training consultant for parents to help them understand their childrenrsquos sensory needs and working with staff from health organisations.Judith explained that while working with children with special needs is more complex and involves eight senses mdash not the five senses that we are all more familiar with mdash it can be very rewarding.ldquoAny child whorsquos born does not come with a training book, said Judith. ldquoSpecial needs children have very specic needs and you need to be able to read them in order to cater for that need.ldquoWith the coaching style I use, itrsquos about empowering parents to understand which sensory need their child needs to be fulfilled. With special needs children, you have to fill up with their sensory cup with all eight senses before they can start to learn, When the three extra senses are stimulated, they can be super-calming for everyone but particularly for children who canrsquot communicate their needs.ldquoWhen I coach parents, I explain about the three other senses, and tell what Irsquom doing and why Irsquom doing it to calm their child so that they then can keep using the same strategies at home. As the child learns to self-regulate more, the strategies change and the child is helped along the way.Despite having the space to accommodate more children after lockdown and when group activities are allowed again, Judith is focussed in developing her consultancy with the child always in mind.ldquoThe whole essence of the business is that it does not become a massive enterprise, she stressed.ldquoItrsquos about providing a more quiet, intimate area for the children so that they can feel safe and secure and itrsquos not overly busy.

Not of greed or profligacy but simply an acknowledgement that our daily bread must come from somewhere.    \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Back then Ulster had industries not only to protect but ones that were a cause for envy, a feat made all the more remarkable considering our land’s lack of natural resources in terms of steel and coal. Now, these industries have been replaced by others. Perhaps neither as impressive nor as lucrative as the iron-wroughts of the past but still they are a source of daily bread. However, for people such as myself this source is now at risk. Whomever was tasked with representing Northern Ireland’s interests at the Brexit trade talks saw fit to acquiesce in Northern Ireland’s removal from the single market for services. In layman’s terms this means that contractors, freelancers, specialists and consultants who have their practices based in Northern Irelandare potentially barred from trading in the EU . If this comes to pass then I will have to take my practice out of Northern Ireland and base it in a country that can allow me to work with the EU . Though not immediately apparentit will certainly be felt by those whom manage my affairs in Northern Ireland and of course Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs will no longer be entitled to its percentage of my company’s earnings. This act could be replicated a thousandfold as northern based consultants have to move their admin where. I would ask that those who claim to stand for NI’s best interests go back to the drawing board and see to it that NI can be re-inserted into the single market for services. Rather than being a place that consultants will have to relocate from NI could instead become a place that consultants relocate to, as such a development would not escape the attention of consultants and service providers in GB who find themselves similarly cut off from EU work. Surely it is in our interests to have thousands of companies set up shop in Northern Ireland, pay tax here and utilise local services  There needs to be more examination of the actual consequences of our Brexit arrangements and proposals rather than acting out of blind zeal, which, I fear, has been the guiding hand of too many of those involved. If people find themselves more easily moved by rhetoric and fervour rather than daily bread issues then perhaps they could honourably choose to stand aside in favour of those whose vision is less clouded  Neale Weir, Castledawson, Co Londonderry——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I would categorise the album’s genre as a kind of mix between indie folk and dream pop. “The title ‘Destroyer’ came from a personal point of view. Depression and mental health is a big theme on the album and intends to allude to the idea of one’s own worst enemy who causes their own problems - your own destroyer.”Abraham’s Daughter was released in May  to much acclaim in the Belfast music scene and Conn also has some classical piano compositions and short film scores under his belt to date.“I take inspiration from a lot of dferent musical styles such as my background in classical and jazz piano, but my main influences now would include David Bowie, Sufjan Stevens, Phoebe Bridgers and Fiona Apple.”For the self-produced album, the versatile former Larne Grammar School pupil had to teach himself how to record, mix and master the audio for its release. “It was completed in just over a month, save for the two tracks recorded in March for the Abraham’s Daughter EP which reappear on this album, which was recorded by my university classmate Lewis Murray.”The experience of playing the piano for nearly two decades - including successes at Larne Music Festival - and performing at classical concerts across Northern Ireland should also stand Conn in good stead as he pursues his dream during the pandemic.---Click here to read: Larne musician’s new stage show for when the curtains go back up.--Thank you for reading this article.

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

Business support was a key topic, and it was devastating to hear Tina McKenzie, Chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, discuss the hardships being faced and demonstrating the very bleak outlook for many businesseswe do not find a way forward both in terms of the handling of the pandemic,but also enhancing the support available to these businesses. The impact on business is substantial and that on each of their employees is devastating. Furlough has been a hottopic during this lockdown and as we have seen business vilied for not looking atrestructures, she reminded us of the fact that whilst the support available is welcomed, itremains far from enough to enable survival. I recently received an email from a local politician who stated, “I’m in awe you are still in business”. While this could be accepted as a compliment, this is far from the support andvoice a small business like mine requires or is looking for, and this was conveyed to them. The business community needs a clear voice with a key message and desire, rather than noise. These voices, like Tina, work tirelessly to press the government to step in with moresupport, minimising their costs and contribution while revenues are non-existent, and Iapplaud them for doing so. With news breaking this week that there is still pound million remaining in the Stormont COVID “pot” to be allocated towards businesses before March, I would urge Diane Doddsand Conor Murphy to listen to businesses and their representatives to ensure businessessurvive. It would be truly shamefulthis money had to be ed to Westminster as a result of poor planning and slow reactions, while local businesses are making very dficultdecisions due to lack of financial support which clearly is available, but not utilised. With financial survival for businesses and more importantly each of us as iniduals and our families the sole aim, Tina succinctly reminded us that our elected representatives should beheld to account, not the businesses themselves. The Sunday Times recently reported that the public feels more frightened now than at any time before with % of voters feeling ‘personally threatened’ by COVID. It also reportedthat Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have agreed on a ‘recovery plan’ to save jobs. The realityis however, thatthey and our own Executive do not deliver this strategy correctly, without delay or U-turn, the job market will constrict further. Many professional trade bodies arereporting that their members don’t have enough in the bank until April and judging bynumerous reports this past week, lockdown and on-going restrictions are likely to extend beyond April. How can businesses be expected to survive without this  We all have a voice, but not all of us use it. As a business community we need vocal and active business leaders to speak out to help fight our case. A great demonstrative exampleof this is the great work of my good friend Brian Donaldson from Excluded NI. Throughout,Brian has spoken out and acted to help thousands who have been financially excluded with no support being provided to them. Brian had established himself as newly self-employedchef just before lockdown, only to find that as support packages were announced, he quickly found himself excluded from all government support offered. With a family, and amortgage to pay, Brian created a  for his case to constructively find a resolution forall those who found themselves in the same situation. By working closely with local politicians, Brian, has researched and submitted proposals to the Department for the Economy with numerous resolutions and proposals to deliver financialassistance to these groups, which has resulted in thousands, including Ltd Company directors,eventually being awarded some financial support. Brian continues daily to ensure the excluded have a voice and shows how being a voice can bring about change! As a business owner, I send a huge thank you to all the hard-working professional trade bodies and voices for our communities, who throughout this time have worked tirelessly toensure we all have all have a business toto in the future. If you, like so many, are in adficult situation, be sure to reach out to your local business trade body today to highlight your plight and use their voices as much as you can. We all need as much support andsurvival mechanism as possible. It’s evident that the more voices there are and the louderthey become successful outcomes can be delivered. I will wrap up by leaving you with a well-known quote by Napoleon Bonaparte: ‘Ten people who speak make more noise than ten thousand who are silent’. Until next week, stay safe!

Heres how you can make it and what you need to serve it up!  Pancake mix - serves   egg  cup of self raising flour  potato peeled and grated   bunch of spring onions Salt and pepper  cup of milk  For the salad  bag of mixed leaf salad salad  cherry tomatoes    red onion sliced  packet of smoked salmon   Cream cheese mix  tablespoons of cream cheese  tablespoons of wholegrain mustard  To make the pancakes Transfer the grated potatoes to a dry tea towel and squeeze any excess water out. Transfer to a large bowl. Break in the egg and mix well, add the flour and mix again. Slowly add spring onion and gradually add milk . Heat a large non stick pan to the stove bring up to a medium heat. Drizzle in a little oil . Add approximately one tablespoon of the mix and cook for approximately three minutes each side until golden brown. Repeat For the poached egg bring a small saucepan with   pint of water to the boil, add one tablespoon of white vinegar or the juice of one lemon and a pinch of salt. Whisk it together - this will create a whirlpool effect. Add in your egg and take off the heat. To make the salad Place the mixed leaf in a large mixing bowl along with tomato and red onions and season with salt and pepper. Drizzle a little olive oil through the salad. For the cream cheese mix, quite simply mix together! Add a little salt pepper to taste of your liking. The presentation In a large bowl or plate place the pancake at the bottom of the dish. Arrange your salad . Neatly place on the smoked salmon and while this is being done the egg will be cooked. Lt it out with a slotted spoon and dab onto a sheet of kitchen paper - this drains off any access water. Place it on top of the salad, add the bit of baby spinach and some black pepper... and enjoy!
