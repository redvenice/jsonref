Get your hiking boots onIt’s hard to think of another state so richly blessed in the beautiful scenery department, and California seriously rewards travellers who take on its hiking trails. With big-hitter national parks such as Yosemite, Kings Canyon and Sequoia, Joshua Tree and Death Valley all easily drivable from San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, California is an ideal destination for those wanting to mix up a culture-crammed city break with awe-inspiring outdoor adventures.2. Eat the street at an iconic farmers’ marketCalifornia is deservedly proud of its fabulous fresh produce, with a farm-to-table dining scene that makes it the envy of the rest of the world. For Californians, the weekly farmers’ market has become a social institution akin to attending church, so plan to make a meal of visiting the Ferry Building Marketplace in San Francisco or San Luis Obispo’s friendly downtown market. San Diego in particular has made an art form of farmers’ markets, with countless neighbourhood markets popping up across town. If you’ve only got time to do one, make a Sunday pilgrimage to the LGBTQ-friendly, progressive neighbourhood of Hillcrest for their weekly 175-vendor market.3. Be put in your place by big treesSoaring coast redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) lace the coastline from just south of Big Sur to the Oregon border and beyond. Humboldt Redwoods state park is where you’ll find some of the oldest and tallest, and it’s easily accessed off Highway 101.“Farmers’ markets are a great way to support responsible travelling,” says Flight Centre’s Brown. “It’s pretty easy to do in Cali, as it’s the largest agricultural producer in the US.”4. Sip Chardonnay by the seaCalifornian wine is popular around the planet, but it really does taste better when you’re staring out at the crashing waves of the Pacific. A favourite spot is the clifftop restaurant of Nepenthe in Big Sur, where you can choose from more than 400 local tipples.5. Go vintage shopping in Joshua TreeThe other-worldly landscape of Joshua Tree national park is the area’s main draw, but a cluster of quirky desert communities are well worth lingering in. Close neighbours Pioneertown, Joshua Tree and Yucca Valley are all worth a snoop, and keep a particular eye out for the excellent vintage shopping on offer. Local designers and makers are showcased at Shop on the Mesa, while Hoof \u0026amp the Horn does excellent vintage gear, and The Station is a great spot to linger over a latte after finding some retro treasure. Rise with the birds at the weekend to snaffle bargains at the Sky Village Swap Meet before the sun gets into its stride.6. Cycle the beach path from Santa Monica to VeniceSanta Monica and the neighbouring, more hipster, Venice are LA’s best-loved city beach communities. Grab a Breeze bike and cruise down the coast, past the kitsch pier amusements, skateboarders, beachfront bars and fitness fanatics working out at Muscle Beach.7. Take a taco tour of LAWhat Indian food is to Londoners, Mexican cuisine is to Angelenos. The best taco trucks are found in the traditionally Hiic neighbourhoods of Echo Park and Los Feliz, as well as downtown. Stalk cult taco trucks Guerrilla Tacos and Korean-infused Kogi BBQ on Instagram (@guerillatacos and @kogibbq) to gorge like a local.8. Immerse yourself in San Francisco’s colourful cultureFew cities can claim the cultural clout of San Francisco – synonymous, as it is, with beat poetry, jazz and alternative rock, the 1970s counterculture movement, and LGBTQ voices. For literature lovers, sipping a beer in the Vesuvio Cafe beloved by beat generation writers Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, as well as the likes of Bob Dylan and Dylan Thomas, will send a shiver down your spine. The famous City Lights bookstore is literally next door.“The murals of San Francisco are an Instagrammer’s dream,” says Brown. “The Mission district has the highest concentration of street art of any neighbourhood in the world.”9. Breakfast with the stars in MalibuLA’s Malibu Farm Pier Cafe at the end of the pier is one of the best positioned beach cafes on the planet. If you can tear your eyes away from the sea views, you’ll spot local celebrities sipping Vietnamese coffees and nibbling avocado on toast behind oversized sunglasses.10. Laze by the pool in Palm SpringsA playground for the rich and famous since the Brat Pack made it their home in the 1950s, Palm Springs is a must-visit for lovers of modernist architecture, poolside bars and luxury hotels. In 2019, this desert hideaway continues to offer weary urbanites, solitude-seeking celebrities and LA’s fashion crowd some seriously decadent R\u0026ampR.California dreaming?

He shares his plans for his tenure, his aversion to ‘big P political poetry’ and the rejected poem that got him startedSimon Armitage wrote his first poem when he was 10 for a school assignment. “I didn’t know what a poem was. I knew it was short, so that was appealing,” he confesses when we meet at the London offices of Faber, which has published his work for more than 25 years and where his books – 28 in all – take up a couple of shelves on an impressively appointed bookcase. His teacher selected six poems to put on the wall Armitage’s wasn’t among them. “What particularly upset me was that for the first time, maybe ever with a bit of writing, I’d actually put some effort in,” he recalls. “And I was quite pleased with the thing I’d made. So not to be among the chosen was a setback.” Sometimes he wonders if he has been pursuing a “career of revenge” ever since. On 10 May Armitage succeeded Carol Ann Duffy to become the 21st poet laureate: as he jokes each time he finishes a poem, “Stick that on your board, mister!”The official call from No 10 kept being delayed – “she’s quite busy, apparently” – but after Theresa May had congratulated him and outlined the job requirements (there aren’t any), they had a chat about geography (in which they are both graduates: May from Oxford, Armitage from Portsmouth Poly). “Five minutes and that was it.”His parents cried when he rang them to tell them the news. “They’ve wanted it for a long time,” he says, recalling the moment in the early 90s when he told them he was giving up his job as a probation officer to concentrate on poetry. “There were a lot of unknowns. So it was great to go back to them and say it sort of worked out,” he adds with endearing understatement. He and his wife, radio producer Sue Roberts, celebrated with a bottle of champagne and a jump on their daughter’s trampoline in the back garden of their home – Emmeline, a prize-winning slam poet, is now in her first year at university – a few miles from the village of Marsden where he grew up and his parents still live.Every so often, he is struck by the realisation that he has followed in the massive footprints of his hero, fellow Yorkshireman Ted Hughes, who was poet laureate until his death in 1998. “His poetry woke me up, not just to poetry, but fundamentally,” he says. “He came from the next valley. The house where he grew up looks almost identical to the house I grew up in.” When Armitage started writing in his early 20s the idea that he might get published was a “fantasy. I had no literary pedigree. Poetry still felt like quite a closed establishment.” But, he reflects, “I suppose I always thought, if he can do that from there, why can’t I do it from here?”The departing professor of poetry at Oxford University, Armitage has already won pretty much every poetic laurel going, and last year won the Queen’s gold medal. He collected the award last month in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace, where the winner is traditionally introduced to the Queen by the poet laureate – in this case, himself. “Here he is and here I am,” he laughs. “It’s a shame really because I would have liked Carol Ann to be able to do that.”The search for a new poet laureate can be a fraught affair. In 1999 Tony Blair reportedly thought Duffy too controversial a choice and recommended Andrew Motion instead. Today, with record poetry sales, the rise of performance poetry, “Instapoets” and a new generation including Kate Tempest, Hollie McNish and Rupi Kaur making “poetry cool again”, Armitage’s appointment was met with questions as to whether, in 2019, the top job should go to a middle-aged white man. (Imtiaz Dharker, who calls herself a “Pakistani Scottish Calvinist Muslim”, was tipped to become the second female laureate, but took herself out of the running last month.) “I just hope that I won’t be judged on my identity, but on my values and what I bring to those issues,” Armitage says. “I think I’ve got a good track record on that front.” In many ways his wide-ranging writing life has been “a 30-year apprenticeship to this moment”, as demonstrated in a new collection, Sandettie Light Vessel Automatic, made up of poems written as either commissions or collaborations.He is looking forward to being able “to lend a voice” to the exhilarating changes in a genre that “even 10 years ago still looked like a relatively mono-cultural experience”. Although “these are really exciting times”, he cautions against complacency. “If you talk to people from erse or disadvantaged backgrounds they will still say they feel under-represented, under-served, under-recognised.”Despite having been a high-profile fixture of the poetry scene for the last three decades, he is still keen to stress his northern, outsider status. “Keep your distance London”, he wrote in a 2014 letter addressed to the capital. “It probably helps living up there in terms of an attitude,” he says. “You are operating from the margin or outside the centre.” The morning we meet he had taken a train from Wakefield to King’s Cross, and “walked across London utterly incognito”. There’s something about poetry “which is about leading from the back”, he says. “You can still operate under cover.” As his friend and fellow poet Glyn Maxwell remarked: “Being famous and being a famous poet are two completely different things.”The title poem in his first collection, Zoom!, which launched his career in 1989, zooms from a terraced house to a “neighbouring galaxy” before plummeting back down to a supermarket check-out queue – a blueprint for Armitage’s knack of focusing on the mundane (spark plugs, say) while reaching for the stars (most obviously in his 1997 collection CloudCuckooLand). His wit, grit and gift for mixing the demotic with the metaphorical have long made him the people’s poet, whose “no brow” (his description) work spoke to the Britpop-New Labour moment. But the young poet who wrote in “Goalkeeper with a Cigarette” that he had “no highfalutin song  to sing, no neat message for the nation” has now become his country’s team captain.Today, he describes himself as “prompt, diligent and fearful of missing deadlines” – a far cry from the “mad, bad and dangerous to know” writer of Romantic tradition. But at 56, with his trademark earring and floppy fringe (“My father thought it bloody queer,  the day I rolled home with a ring of silver in my ear  half hidden by a mop of hair”), he says he still feels like the “new kid on the block”. An “obsessive” Smiths fan, he used to sing in a band called the Scaremongers, and has just finished an album with his new “ensemble”, the Land Yacht Regatta, which he describes as “more spoken word and electronica”. And he’s surely the first poet laureate to moonlight as a DJ.Since his appointment, he has been criticised by some in the poetry community for being “too approachable” and by others as “too complicated, too highbrow”, he says. The late Irish poet Dennis O’Driscoll sniffily observed in a review in 2000 that Armitage “likes to have it both ways”, he is a “streetwise poet”, cheekily “two-timing Radio 1 and 3” – but then went on to tip him as “a poet laureate in waiting”. Two decades later, if Armitage has a mission statement it is “to try and keep the middle of poetry in the centre ground. Poetry is already an obscure art form, so if you are an obscure poet within that you’re really obscure, you are operating beyond Pluto.” He once compared his frustrations with “the smallness” of poetry to “talking down a toilet”. “It doesn’t always get the audience and the readership that it needs or it wants,” he says now. But he also sees it as the antidote to “the constant diarrhoea of information”. He wants “poetry to be able to speak to people who would go to a cinema or a gallery or a museum or a show … to have a voice in that marketplace.”Few poets have so enthusiastically “got out from behind the keyboard and the dusty tomes … to go into the schools, prisons, communities and hospices”, as he wrote in an impassioned op-ed for this paper last autumn, in what now looks rather like a bravura job application. “I’ve never been satisfied with the idea that poetry just lives in books. ‘Poetry is a go anywhere art form’”, he says, quoting the Australian poet Les Murray, who died in April.Like another laureate, John Betjeman, Armitage is fairly comfortable on TV, but he doesn’t do Twitter (“It’s just not my thing”), remembering Ted Hughes’s dictum of “always keeping something back”. Most significantly for the new job, he has been unafraid of taking on “moments of national or collective consciousness”, such as the millennium, the 911 attacks and most recently Brexit, in his poem “The Brink”. “I have chosen to e into those occasions,” he says of his sense of artistic responsibility to engage with the world. But he’s always “tried to talk about the universal in terms of the particular”, such as the fictional British trader in the north tower of the World Trade Center in “Out of the Blue”. “That’s my modus operandi,” he says. Does a public poet require a new approach? “I can’t change my poetics over night. Big P political poetry rarely works anyway. Poetry is the art of subtlety and to try and meet these subjects head-on isn’t my style. I’m not even sure it is poetry’s style.”How is he going to deal with the expectation to respond to events at the call of news editors rather than the muse? Both Motion and Duffy endured a mixed reception each time they entered the public arena – a din amplified for Duffy by social media. He would “rather have a kicking” for saying “no” than for a bad poem: “I don’t want to give anybody anything that I don’t think is any good.” He is keen to collaborate with other artists – so maybe a pop song or installation for the next royal baby?Armitage has found the poetic in prisons, porn and Poundland. “I’m only interested in everything”, he says, quoting Murray again, and credits this eclecticism to not having had a formal literary education. He “arrived at literature like a kid in the sweetshop” and worked his “own way outwards and backwards” from the then-modern poets he grew up with (he particularly remembers an all-male 1970s anthology called Worlds) in a “kind of retrospective education, all the way back to Homer”.While his reworkings of Homer’s Odyssey and Euripides’s Heracles may seem a world away from his grittier Larkinesque poems, they explore similar questions of masculinity – “How can you be a hero in your own home, as a father?” – that have preoccupied him since his 20s, now that “those ideas of heroism that you grew up with on TV and in comics are not really viable options any more”. He has also sought to use poetry to express the point of view of “people from the margins not properly able to articulate for themselves, or voices that have been lost or taken away”, such as the residents of a Rochdale housing estate in Xanadu (1992) or the murdered teenager Sophie Lancaster in Black Roses (2012).And then there is his nature writing (Hughes’s muddy footprints again), which has seen him take to the hills with his accounts of trekking the Pennine Way (Walking Home, 2012), or physically writing on to the landscape in Stanza Stones (2013). A series of poems on the subject of rainfall, carved into rock faces around Marsden, these stones are “probably the most satisfying” as well as the most “complicated and arduous” of his projects.He is “absolutely determined” that writing about the environment, “the issue of our time”, will be at the heart of his 10-year tenure, with a new award (he’s looking for sponsors) for poets responding to the crisis. He also has more concrete poetry ambitions, with dreams of establishing a national centre, “a place that hosts and houses what I think of as these islands greatest art form”, he says. “So if you know somebody who has got a spare building …”Motion famously grumbled that the laureateship had been “very, very damaging” for his own work. Is Armitage worried about the curse of the poet laureate?“No. I can’t help writing poems. I was at home the other day. I got up in the morning thinking: ‘I’m the poet laureate!’ Two hours later I was writing a poem. I just can’t help it,” he says. “You can only walk around your own house for a few minutes every day thinking ‘I’m the poet laureate!’ You have to go and do something real, which in my case is writing poems.”• Sandettie Light Vessel Automatic by Simon Armitage is published by Faber.

The top players don’t yet have the celebrity of their male counterparts, and there remains a somewhat unfair prejudice that the women’s game is inherently less enjoyable. (Come on, it’s at least 47 years since the FA graciously lifted its ban on women’s football!) Will anything have changed at the end of this tournament?I truly hope so: a newfound appreciation for women’s football would be an even greater turnaround than the deification last year of Gareth Southgate for his feats in charge of the England men’s team. If mass audiences do start to watch women playing top-flight football, the rest – equitable sponsorship, packed stadiums, decent player salaries, not asking the world’s best forward to twerk – may follow.Viewers might even discover they prefer it to the men’s game. There is less ing, faking and arguing with the ref. It is perceived as being more accessible, according to the European Club Association, “because women players tend to behave in a more genuine way”.One of the major problems women’s football (in Britain and beyond) faces is exposure – but not this month. Tonight’s opening game, and all the subsequent matches, have primetime coverage on BBC One. The last major event in the sport’s calendar – the daftly named SheBelieves Cup, a four-team tournament held in the US in February – had half-empty stands, a rather drab atmosphere and was shown after 10pm on BBC Four. (England won, in case you missed it.) Exposure on the main channel, a decent line-up of pundits – ex-England defender Alex Scott is among the best – and a European time zone for all the matches should maximise eyeballs here.And yet, where is all the publicity that should be supporting the terrestrial coverage? Yes, it’s great that the woman-led Offside Rule podcast will be doing daily reports, but over on the newspaper back pages and main sports bulletins it’s hardly wall-to-wall hype and pap shots of off-duty players.For those who already follow the sport, today is a real moment of hope and determination that 2019 might mark the start of a new era. Next year the Tokyo Olympics will showcase women’s football (Japan, ranked seventh in the world, is the toughest competitor in England’s group D). And in 2021 the Uefa Women’s Euros are set to be hosted in England. By then, we might know if the great women’s football experiment will ever succeed here or not.It all comes down to fandom. The World Cup could be the best chance yet for female footballers – but also specifically England’s Lionesses and Scotland – to gain home support. The top domestic league, the Women’s Super League (WSL), is now fully professional. Five or six years ago the best players were paid almost nothing, forcing them to take second jobs. Tales of players paying for their physio and travel were not uncommon. The best talent emigrated to the US college system, which is still one of the most lucrative destinations for an upcoming female footballer. (This month the youngest ever pro soccer player, Olivia Moultrie, was signed to the Portland Thorns, at the age of 13. Premiership academies sign boys at nine.)It doesn’t really help matters to make comparisons with the Premier League. Today, women’s salaries barely match Héctor Bellerin’s monthly wardrobe allowance (WSL pay is around £25,000 per annum, roughly doubled with an England salary). Media coverage and sponsorship in the WSL is patchy.But young female talent has strengthened, with some of the finest England players – look out for star defender and vice-captain Lucy Bronze and 25-year-old forward Nikita Parris – transferring to Olympique Lyonnais, the world’s best women’s team. (Earlier this year, in the course of researching a profile I wrote about Bronze, I kept count of who, out of various football-loving friends and acquaintances, had heard of her: there was a generational ide, with her 11-year-old-boy fanbase surprisingly strong.)England’s current strength is one of the most compelling reasons to believe that the sport could at last gain support here, the birth nation of football. The Lionesses are now ranked third in the world. Manager Phil Neville, who took over in 2017 after the ignominious sacking of Mark Sampson, has made himself popular with his players, proving that professional management experience (he didn’t have much) can sometimes matter less than empathy, years of actually playing the game and sheer energy.He will know, as his players do, that success at this World Cup would bring more than a trophy home. It would inject the oxygen of publicity and popularity into a sport which has flagged over recent decades, as funding, sponsorship and crowd numbers fluctuated. England have a good chance of going deep into the competition, hopefully bringing along with them a watching nation who might be willing to give this burgeoning sport a shot. Let’s see how we all do.• Susie Rushton is a writer, editor and sports fan"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62f64b184ffb05d4ca2d574e7da93f46b9dd9fd1/0_298_2912_1747/master/2912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e176780d5a28a504cb82c392f6e1b87","title":"the guardian view on labours victory now for the tories to decide","story":"One can read too much into any single byelection in Britain. Most pundits thought that the seat in Peterborough would be won by the rightwing populist Brexit party, which was riding high in the opinion polls after emerging triumphant from the European elections. National politics is focused on a Conservative leadership race revolving around how and when this country could exit the European Union. It seemed that Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party would be swept away, not least because the vacancy was created by the jailing of the previous Labour MP for lying to the police. Yet Labour squeaked in with a candidate who had had to apologise for approving – inadvertently, she said – antisemitic material online.What will change is the nature of the Conservative party under a new leader. In the race to replace Theresa May almost all the contenders are rushing to consign her legacy to the dustbin of history. Almost every candidate is signalling an appetite for more public spending or more tax cuts or both. Even Mrs May wants to get in on the act, urging her chancellor to end austerity as she is on her way out. This has an obvious political logic to it. The party is too unpopular to do anything other than opt for change, and the public would finally see their politicians talking about the issues that affect their everyday lives.But to get to such a position requires Tory leadership candidates to map a way out of the Brexit maze. This means persuading enough of the 313 MPs and then a majority of the 124,000 Conservative party members to stop indulging hard Brexit fantasies. Crashing out of the EU without a deal on Halloween this year would damage the economy, place Britain in thrall to Donald Trump’s United States and envenom relations with our nearest neighbours. If a Tory prime minister insisted on pursuing a no-deal Brexit then the question for other parties is how it could be stopped. With a Speaker who is prepared to be helpful to parliament and with Conservatives prepared to bring down the next government, there might be a route to block a damaging and chaotic exit.The Tory party’s dilemma is whether to adopt the Brexit party’s push for no-deal and its culture wars in the hope of a sugar-rush recovery, or whether to head back to the centre ground while delivering a Brexit deal. The former would mean electing Boris Johnson. Mr Johnson is a vacuous and irresponsible dissembler whose Islamophobia is uttered with a wink and a smirk. The Tories would make a mistake to pick him, one which the country would pay for dearly.Conservatives ought to take more time to evolve a new Brexit position. France’s Emmanuel Macron has conceded that leaving the door open for another extension of the deadline would be sensible to accommodate an outbreak of realism. With the decline of class, the electorate is becoming ided along lines of age, ethnicity and education. A new leader will be able to reinvent and re-anchor Toryism demographically and philosophically. Those are pressing problems for a party, but for the country the most important task is to reset its Brexit position by honestly confronting its negative consequences."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d1db4f539eef75132ad64b91f23eb50360a76b6/0_0_2945_1767/master/2945.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a5fa15ebd056e6becadff4184b68370","title":"tory fantasists theresa may leadership candidates brexit","story":"As Theresa May formally relinquishes leadership of fratricidal comedy troupe the Conservative party, the contest to succeed her remains a dish best paired with arsenic. Or perhaps a lightly oaked strychnine. Still, what news from the revels? I’m afraid Kit Malthouse is already out. And that other guy. James Cleverly, maybe? They simply burned too brightly.Dominic Raab seems to have been disturbed during some policymaking again, leaving dogwalkers to find the remains of an idea to prorogue parliament so that no deal happens by default. On one level, this is the only policy position Dominic can adopt, having already resigned in protest at a deal he himself negotiated as Brexit secretary. However, Raab remains at large in this contest, with people warned not simply to avoid approaching him – that is a given – but to stay away from anyone even backing him. I mean, is he really going to drag the Queen into it? By “it”, I obviously mean a constitutional crisis, not his van.Elsewhere, Jacob Rees-Mogg’s robot sidekick Steve Baker is still hearing the clamour for him to run, and will if no one else signs up to the ERG’s no-deal plan. “I did go through some training on this,” he announced. “In moments of death or glory, you tell people what you’re doing, you don’t participate.” Two things. One. Is “death or glory” an intentional reference to the 17th Lancers – “the death or glory boys” – and their notable role in the Charge of the Light Brigade? If not, perhaps a less auto-satirical military reference might be found. Two. What “training”? Is this about the time you got an ex-services guy to take you round the back of the warehouse and floor you, apparently for a self-defence video?But this week, let’s focus on the chaps – and they are all chaps, as rival candidate Sam Gyimah noted – who reckon they can go back to the EU and get a better deal by sheer force of their personality or something. Even though they’ve been told, many times, that they can’t. Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Boris Johnson, Matt Hancock … you know the pack drill.As far as this prong of their Brexit strategy goes, they resemble one of those guys whose girlfriend has broken up with them for her own reasons, but who just knows she’s going to change her mind if they make a sufficiently big and bold gesture. You know, like send her flowers. Write her a letter. Write more letters. Start sending the flowers to her work. Play the violin in the street below her flat. Turn up at her work. Call her repeatedly at 1am to demand she doesn’t do this to you both. Send her dogshit at work. What can I tell you? They’re incurable romantics.Staying in the world of metaphor, I see Michael Gove is back on the analogies again. In the immediate wake of the EU referendum vote, when Michael felt forced to knife Boris Johnson and embark on his own leadership run, he justified it thus: “I compare it to a group of people standing outside a collapsing building, wondering who is going to rescue a child inside. I thought: well, I don’t think I’ve got either the strength or the speed for this, but as I looked around, I thought, God, I’m at least as strong and at least as fast as the others. I’ve got to try to save the child.” I will never get over this characterisation. IT WAS YOU WHO STARTED THE FIRE, YOU MAD BASTARD!Indeed, there is a distinct flavour of the end-to-end service Michael Gove offers in his latest analogy. “Who is the pilot who has landed the plane successfully at times of turbulence,” he wondered rhetorically this week, “and made sure the passengers are safe and the destination has been reached? I’ve been through a lot of political turbulence and I’ve always been able to land the plane.” Is this the version of the Tom Hanks movie where Captain Sully Sullenberger spends the first act nobbling the engines?Michael’s what I think of as a Gwyneth Paltrow Conservative, in honour of the way the Goop founder’s fringe lunacies create ailments specifically so she can cure you of them. Or to put in terms the 1922 committee would feel most comfortable with: she’ll sell you a $66 jade egg to pop up your fanny, causing you intense lower back pain, which you will then be advised to cure with a $180 subcutaneous tissue roller, causing livid bruising best treated by some $300 arnica oil. And so on. It becomes very expensive very quickly. (And yes, I AM hoping that this article ends up being headlined “BREXIT WAS A JADE FANNY EGG”.)And so, finally, to the man Michael’s going to try and reknife at some point in the coming weeks. Boris Johnson has informed MPs they need to “stop banging on about Brexit and put that bawling baby to bed”. Yup, there’s no show without Punch.News that Johnson has pocketed £700,000 for speeches since leaving office is embarrassing for anyone who paid him, though sadly not surprising. Johnson’s oratorical style is best categorised as speeches for people who don’t like speeches. Indeed, as far as I am aware, he only has one speech – the one where we’re going to sell French knickers to the French, sparkling wine to the Italians, naans to the Indians and so on. I’ve seen it live about 10 times, and in print at least 30. Here he goes again. Off the bar stool for the second chorus.Like everything about Johnson it is an ersatz version of something else. He is the X Factor contestant covering Winston Churchill. Yet just as Simon Cowell would always rather listen to some autotuned teen’s version of Feeling Good than the Nina Simone original, so large numbers of people seem to prefer Johnson’s inauthentic nonsense to anything of actual quality. He remains the runaway favourite for this contest – the greatest shitshow on earth – and we must all adjust our bunker arrangements accordingly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/304d0e087810e4968a898f9c79605329523ba3ec/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21b17e9b2da686bd7e072e51832f39ae","title":"ashes to ashes 20 how womens cricket developed to embrace new formats","story":"Ahead of this summer’s Women’s Ashes tour, Kalika Mehta takes a look back at the tournament’s history, from its unofficial beginning in the 1930sAlthough women’s competitive cricket dates back to the foundation of the Women’s Cricket Association (WCA) in 1926, it wasn’t until eight years later that an England team set sail for Australia for their first “unofficial” Ashes tour.With the hosts refusing to pay travel expenses, the team consisted of players who could afford the considerable £80 – nearly £5,000 in modern-day terms – charged by the WCA. If that didn’t rule out a large enough section of society, married women were also barred from selection – on the grounds that it would not be appropriate for them to be away from home for a six-month tour.The youthful team – all were under 25 – set off for Australia with a squad of seven teachers or future teachers, two secretaries, an art student, a lawyer, a nurse, and three “ladies of leisure” – plus Myrtle Maclagan, who was employed by the army.Having agreed to not smoke, drink, gamble or find themselves “accompanied by a man”, England’s players were also far more prepared than their Australian counterparts, who only began searching for players 28 days before the first Test was due to begin.Unsurprisingly, England romped to victory. All-rounder Maclagan sent down a searing spell to earn figures of 7-10 and rattle out Australia for 47 in the first innings – picking up the first five-wicket haul in a women’s international in the process.Maclagan followed that up with another impressive milestone, hitting 72 of the visitors’ first-innings score of 154. Though the home side were more resilient with the bat at the second time of asking, England comfortably knocked off the required 32 runs to secure a nine-wicket win.The second Test at the historic Sydney Cricket Ground followed much the same pattern. Maclagan’s century in England’s first innings was the highlight of a match that saw the visitors requiring just 10 runs in the second innings.Although this eight-wicket victory sealed the series, there was no trophy for England captain Betty Archdale to raise in triumph – the WCA’s founding constitution, set out in 1930, proclaimed that “no member of any affiliated club shall take part in any cricket challenge cup or prize competition”.England retained the Ashes on home soil in 1937 after a drawn series and the second world war put paid to the scheduled 1939-40 Ashes it wasn’t until the winter of 1948-49 that England’s players set out for Australia once more. This time around, the hosts were much better prepared. The team were fitter and more skilful, and the crowd of 17,025 across three days in Adelaide – still the highest for a women’s Test in Australia – cheered on a comprehensive 186-run victory, which gave the Australians a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.Australian all-rounder Betty Wilson – who turned down three marriage proposals during the  of her international career in order to continue playing cricket – was the undoubted star of the Test. Her brilliant knock of 111 – ended by run-out – was followed by a six-wicket haul, then 3-39 in the second innings.Although the following Tests were more competitive, two draws earned Australia’s women their maiden Ashes series victory. Scoring 268 runs and picking up an impressive 16 wickets across the three matches, Wilson stood head and shoulders above the rest of the players. But still no trophy.It took 34 more Tests and more than 64 years for England and Australia’s women to have something to fight over. In 1998, a miniature bat was burned in a wok in the Harris Garden at Lord’s on July 20, and the ashes were placed in a small wooden trophy.Also in the wok was a copy of the WCA constitution and rulebook – the WCA was finished, having voted to merge with the newly formed England and Wales Cricket Board, and it seemed only right that its “no prize” rule go up in smoke.England were unable to break Australia’s dominance at that stage, however, and the Southern Stars retained the Ashes until 2005 (which some will remember as a good year for the men too).In 2013, the Ashes changed from being Test-only to consist of one Test, three one-day internationals and three T20 Internationals. Six points were awarded for a Test win, or two points for a draw, with two points awarded for a limited-over win and one for a draw.Although the Test match in 2013 was drawn, England triumphed in two ODIs and three T20s to win the home series 12-4 and reclaim the Ashes. A second – but closer – series win followed in Australia, less than six months later, before the format was tweaked in 2015 to reduce a Test win to four points Australia have won then retained the Ashes since.While so much of women’s sport struggles to emerge from the shadows of the men’s game, or strives to emulate it, the Women’s Ashes has always forged its own path, with four-day Tests – an option often discussed for the men’s game – and now an exciting multi-format competition that has opened up new audiences.But it would be nothing without the players, and these days those players come from all walks of life.

But they didn’t make it easy for themselvesPerched on the edge of the North Sea, miles from anywhere, without even a railway station and less famous than the local golf course, the University of St Andrews would seem to have no business being one of the best universities in the world.But not only has St Andrews thrived for centuries, it’s done so on its own terms. In recent years, it has embraced the equality and ersity agenda to widen its student intake, without joining the corporate dash for growth seen among its peers in London, Birmingham and Bristol.Now, for the first time since the  University Guide of 2003, St Andrews has disrupted the Oxbridge duopoly, overtaking Oxford to be ranked second overall among UK universities, thanks in part to its academic excellence, but also to its track record in student achievement before and after graduation.“We think it’s remarkable that a small university like St Andrews – which has a miniscule endowment in comparison to those of Oxford and Cambridge – competes so effectively with them,” says Sally Mapstone, principal and vice-chancellor.“I think St Andrews has many of the qualities of Oxford and Cambridge, although it’s not a collegiate university. It’s a small, highly international university. It has things in common with them, but it is also dramatically different,” Mapstone says.“I don’t really like these ‘is X as good as Y?’ questions. But can St Andrews be counted in the company of Oxford and Cambridge? Yes, I think we are showing it can.”While St Andrews has always been highly ranked, in the latest table it overtakes Oxford by a sliver, helped by outstanding performances in some of its traditional strengths, such as economics.St Andrews also outdoes its Oxbridge rivals on improving and adding value to the academic performance of its students, partly because of the success of its widening participation schemes, some of which are more radical than even the latest announcements from Oxbridge envisage.That increase – from one in three Scottish students admitted five years ago – has been the result of a determined effort to meet access targets set by the Scottish government.For several years, the university has been offering so-called “gateway programmes”, a profoundly different route into some of its most academically demanding courses, including medicine and physics, for students who otherwise would struggle to get a look-in. These programmes offer sharply reduced entry criteria for Scottish applicants and take advantage of the longer four-year undergraduate degree in Scotland by using the first year to bring disadvantaged students up to speed. They continue the remainder of the course alongside their peers.“The key thing is that it isn’t just about recruiting people, it’s about supporting them while they’re here. Helping our students to flourish is one of the distinctive things people may not realise about what we do here,” Mapstone says.St Andrews’s strong reputation as an elite institution can hamper its efforts to widen access. “I entirely recognise that St Andrews is associated with history and tradition, and with a certain style of person. But what our new strategy is seeking to convey is that we welcome all styles of people,” Mapstone says.“St Andrews should be better known for its inclusivity and its ersity. Last year we were at the Pink News awards because we were nominated in the public sector category for our LGBTQ+ engagement. We’re very proud of our record on LGBTQ+ issues, but would people automatically associate St Andrews with that? No they wouldn’t, but that is part of the community we have here.”Lucy Hunter Blackburn, an independent observer of Scottish higher education based in Edinburgh, says: “Official monitoring only looks at Scottish students, so ignores the relatively advantaged demographic of the fee-paying ones – from the rest of UK and overseas – which may have some impact on the university’s ability to attract recruits from a broader background.”St Andrews recruits heavily in England’s schools, both state and independent, and receives around 10 applications for every place awarded, with few apparently dissuaded by the additional cost in money and time that a four-year degree requires.Applications from outside Europe are also strong, from India and – unusually for a British university – the US. Part of the reason is St Andrews’s international reputation as the university that educated Prince William, who met fellow student Kate Middleton there. “It gave St Andrews a certain status, because people are so interested in the royal family,” says Mapstone. “I think also because Prince William and Catherine espouse the sorts of causes we believe in: sustainability, mental health care. We believe in a combination of formal and informal here, and I think they encapsulate that.”Paloma Paige, the president of St Andrews’s students association, says her decision to come here from California had nothing to do with the royal graduates and everything to do with the quality of the international relations degree she wanted to study. “US universities are far more lecture-based, students take copious notes, and it all seems very restricted. Here you get to take the initiative. It’s smaller, but there’s a lot of ersity among staff and students,” Paige says. “It’s not posh. In fact, I was surprised at how ‘un-British’ it was. The institutional ersity means you’ll find people accept you, no matter who you are.”Paige is an example of Mapstone’s maxim: “Where people identify quality they will seek it out.” Asked if the university’s remoteness and size are barriers to recruitment for staff or students, Mapstone responds that application rates continue to rise from all parts of the UK.“It’s not in the North Pole. I wouldn’t say it was profoundly remote. You have to make an effort to get here, but everyone who does thinks it’s worth it. It’s less than 90 minutes from an international airport, so let’s not overdo the remoteness.”Admissions director Julie Ramsay says when recruiting in the south of England, she has encountered hesitation about the journey – not from students but from their parents.“It’s the parents who will take me to one side and ask, ‘I’m worried about my child going to Scotland, what’s it like up there?’”Regardless of its location, St Andrews could fill its places many times over. While the number of Scottish students – who pay no tuition fees – is fixed by the Scottish government, it could copy its English counterparts and fill its halls and coffers with many more students from England, each paying £9,250 a year.But that sort of rapid growth, according to Mapstone, is not an option for St Andrews, in a town of just 17,000 people with the North Sea on one side and farmland on the other.“We don’t intend to go beyond 10,000 students we’re around 9,000 at the moment. Our reason for that is a simple one: we’re in this beautiful Fife town and we have limited capacity, but also we think 10,000 students is about right for the kind of education we offer and the way we offer it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6eab52b12c97551ee5c2b01daa48adfde035a84/0_4_3920_2352/master/3920.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=ee406cc81ba3b0aa726d2e9dd8ffadd8","title":"chernobyl now i was not afraid of radiation a photo essay","story":"Photographer Tom Skipp visited Chernobyl and nearby Pripyat, its replacement town Slavutych, and the abandoned sites of the region – meeting the people behind the disaster: from the liquidators who worked at the fallout site, to the resettlers and the community who live and work in the area nowI arrived in Ukraine on the eve of the 32nd anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster. I had not intended for it to be the focus of my time in Kyiv, but leading up to my departure it became an obsession. My arrival in Kyiv on 25 April 2018 was maybe happenstance of planning but I was impelled to head straight from the airport to Slavutych. This was the town built to replace Pripyat and host the evacuated personnel of the Chernobyl power plant, after the decision was made to continue power production following the disaster. All of the Soviet republics were called upon to hurriedly help with the construction of what would eventually be the last atomic town.Liquidators. This term became my obsession. They were the people who had tended to the Chernobyl fallout. A lesser known name for them was “the green machines”, a reference to the colour of their uniforms and the fact that, where machines would fail because of the unimaginably high levels of radiation, they would not.What I saw in Slavutych at 1.24am, the time when the nuclear reactor in Chernobyl power plant exploded 32 years ago, was a solemn outpouring of raw emotion. Representatives of the church, scientists and members of the army mixed to pay tribute to a group of people who fought an invisible war against the atom. Later that day, at the town museum, a group of liquidator veterans had gathered for me to interview and photograph them. Following those encounters, I made my way to the home of another man, Iakov Mamedov. “There were 12 people in my hospital ward, only four survived. The others were just covered and taken away.”I knew I had to go to the exclusion zone. I had been in contact with the head of communications of the power plant and eventually was given approval to enter the plant and take photos. It is very simple to get to the zone as a tourist, as many operators organise day trips from Kyiv, but I wanted to go alone. Vitali was appointed as my guide to organise my itinerary and make sure I did not go where I should not. The 19-mile radius exclusion zone includes the site of the nuclear power plant, but also abandoned villages, a children’s holiday camp, the Duga military radar and it is inhabited by a group of people known as “resettlers”. After the accident, the zone was completely evacuated and locals were told they would have returned to their homes within two or three days. Residents , however, were never officially allowed back. Some people decided the need to stay in their home was greater than the risk of living in a radioactive area and illegally made their way back.Soon after entering the exclusion zone, I discovered my permission to visit the station had been overturned. On the same day, in Chernobyl town – where 1,500 people still work, servicing the power plant – my guide and I remained locked in the local museum, and had to jump out of a first-floor toilet window to get out. Then I blew a tyre, which meant changing it under what I paranoically assumed was radioactive rain. It felt like a post-Soviet cloud of bad luck was following me in my every move.The source of the nuclear fallout, now encased in a steel and concrete sarcophagus, can only be photographed from one angle, with tourists dutifully disembarking from their tour buses to snap the shot.Nearby, there are cooling lakes full of oversized fish. They used to be farmed to feed bears for the local fur industry, but after the accident the furs were too contaminated to be worn and the fish were left to their own device.The people working at the power plant do so usually for 10 days at a time, to service, monitor and safeguard the power plant, which is about five miles away.Resettler Vasiliy Semyonovych Razumenko at his home in the exclusion zone. Vasiliy claims to be 113 years old, although records say he is 95. He used to work at a shipyard in Odesa.“Tell them this old bastard is still alive,” were his parting words. “Those men in the shipyard I worked with, tell them Vasiliy is still breathing.”Hanna has looked after her younger sister, Sonya, since she was born. They live on their small farmed land, food brought by the military police and donations from tourists.Pripyat is the closest town to the power plant. It used to be the shining example of Soviet modernity, with nuclear scientists from around the world visiting it every year. In the centre of the abandoned town sits the amusement park that was supposed to open on 1 May 1986. The rusty ferris wheel has become iconic of the Chernobyl dystopia.The very nature of the disaster means that everything is frozen as it was at the time of the accident and nothing should be touched because of fear of radiations.The exclusion zone covers around 1,000 sq miles. From the area, about 91,000 people were evacuated. Within the zone, there was a secret military facility containing part of the Duga radar system, a Soviet missile defence radar.The location that interested me the most was a children’s holiday camp that lays abandoned just off a main road in the zone of alienation. I had not seen many photographs of it before, but it seemed to sum up the thousands of innocent lives that had been affected by the Chernobyl accident, and the reasoning behind the unquestioning sacrifice of the liquidators.What at first had seemed to me illogical self-sacrifice, not unlike the nonsense of going to war, started to make sense in this abandoned Soviet paradise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ab31406d7177b9d6fbee844c465546321e96777/57_5_1790_1074/master/1790.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c74e19bb3a2c76fe7768fd32d8d3235d","title":"oceans demise the end of the arctic as we know it","story":"Less oxygen and ice, more acid and heat.  Jonathan Watts joins an expedition studying what this means for the planetThe demise of an entire ocean is almost too enormous to grasp, but as the expedition sails deeper into the Arctic, the colossal processes of breakdown are increasingly evident.The first fragment of ice appears off the starboard bow a few miles before the 79th parallel in the Fram strait, which lies between Greenland and the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. The solitary floe is soon followed by another, then another, then clusters, then swarms, then entire fields of white crazy paving that stretch to the horizon.This is where ice floes come to die, and the cemetery is filling faster each year, according to the leader of this scientific expedition, Till Wagner, of the University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW). One of the objectives of the expedition is to investigate why the collapse of Arctic ice is happening faster than climate computer models predict and to understand what this augurs for the rest of the planet. The melt is not simply a seasonal process. The natural thaw that starts with spring’s warm weather is being amplified by manmade global heating. The Arctic has heated up by 2C above pre-industrial levels, twice the global average. Some hotspots, including parts of the Fram strait, have warmed by 4C. There are variations from year to year, but the trend is clear and accelerating. Sea ice is melting earlier in the spring and freezing later in the autumn. Each summer it thins more and recedes further, leaving greater expanses of the ocean exposed to 24-hour sunlight. This is driving back the frontiers of ice and fragmenting one of the planet’s most important climate regulators. It is also creating a series of feedbacks that are accelerating the Arctic melt. Several are only partially understood.The team and crew set out on the Greenpeace ships Arctic Sunrise and Esperanza from Svalbard’s port at Longyearbyen in May, less than a month after the sea ice reached yet another record low. At the start of the melt season, this is a fast-changing body of water. The Greenpeace crew say high winds and strong currents have pushed the ice front southwards by 50 miles in the last four days. The floes appear on the radar screen as a thickening swarm of yellow flies. When the bands of ice cannot be evaded, they are nosed aside by the prow, scraping the hull as we pass. Occasionally, they are smashed through with a clanging jolt.The combinations of shade and shape are endlessly varied: here an opal gorge, there an emerald grotto, some floes so perfectly rectangular they could have been cut with a guillotine, others as jagged as a Cornish coastline. Many surfaces are topped with snowy peaks or crenellations others look as flat as a tennis court. Depending on the sea motion when it was formed, the ice can be frazilled into loose white ice crystals, pancaked into bluish layers, or dense, hard nilas so transparent that they appear to be black.But all the floes have one thing in common: they are steadily diminishing as they head south. On the surface you can see the outliers, tiny translucent chunks that are destined to shrink to the size of an ice cube before they finally melt into the Atlantic.Ice-free summers are 10 times more likely if the world warms by 2C rather than 1.5C, according to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The body of top international scientists said last year that the Arctic and coral reef systems were the ecosystems at greatest risk.The Fram strait is one of the few places in the Arctic where the ice extent has not declined, but that is probably not good news. One of the theories being tested on this trip is whether this is because more ice is being flushed through this channel. The pace of change is mindblowing, Wagner says. “What we are looking at is whether this exit is accelerating.”The team is also examining other processes to help gauge the health of the ocean and how it is changing. To get a baseline, they conduct tests at intervals along the 79th parallel. First, they identify a suitably sized floe, then an armed polar bear guard ensures there are no predators and checks the solidity of the ice. After the all-clear, a dozen or so scientists and volunteers pull up on motor dinghies to drill, measure, take water samples and extract cores. Every five metres a square trench is shovelled out of the surface snow down to the hard surface of the ice below. All the while, the floe drifts with the current and bobs gently in the swell. On the ship, crew members test the water at different depths for acidity, temperature, turbidity, dissolved oxygen and acidification.In the past, the data would have been related only to physics and chemistry, but there is a growing awareness of the crucial climate role played by marine organisms, so biologists are also part of this interdisciplinary team. They scan the horizon for whales, seals and walruses and use tightly meshed zooplankton nets to capture teeming masses of minute shrimp- and wormlike creatures.Far more than polar bears, these tiny creatures and the algae on which they graze play an essential role in not just the local ecosystem, but the global climate and food chain, according to a growing body of research. The largest synchronised movement of biomass on the planet is the vertical migration of zooplankton, which happens daily as the tiny creatures move from the depths to surface feeding waters. The area under the ice floes is such a rich source of nutrients that it has been described as an all-you-can-eat buffet for zooplankton.Researchers are discovering that the floes are home to an extraordinary variety and abundance of life, even during the four-month darkness of Arctic winter. Depending on how the ice is formed, it can be permeable and elastic, with space inside that can be colonised by bacteria, fungal spores and the tiny creatures that feed on them such as the transparent jellyfish Sympagohydra tuuli, which squeezes inside the cracks in the ice to hunt for food. The green and yellow shades at the base of floes indicate the presence of phytoplankton – algae that use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and energy. These are the pastures on which the zooplankton graze. Most important among them are copepods, a fat-filled staple in the diet of whales and fish.Together, millions of these species form an oceanic pump, says Mattias Cape, a biological oceanographer with the University of Washington. Phytoplankton help the oceans produce more oxygen than all the world’s forests. They also sequester carbon dioxide more effectively because copepods and the bigger creatures that eat them take the gas down to the depths, where it can be stored for hundreds of years. Nowhere is this pump more effective than near the poles – the zooplankton here are bigger, so they sink deeper.But this is changing. When Cape observes the zooplankton through a microscope in the hold of the ship, he can see that the chubby Arctic copepods have competition from their slimmer and shorter Atlantic counterparts. This invasion has been recorded in other parts of the ocean. “We see a shift from big to small, which is a concern, because it will make this pump action weaker,” he says. The study may help to explain why the Arctic is losing oxygen faster than almost anywhere on Earth. Another factor is that cold water absorbs more carbon dioxide, which gives it high levels of acidity. “We talk about the ocean being hot, sour and out of breath,” Cape says.If the Arctic were a patient, doctors would be alarmed by its vital signs. As well as hot flushes, asthma and contamination (the researchers are following up on studies that suggest the Fram strait has one of the highest levels of microplastics in the world), the ocean has also been diagnosed with a weakening of its immune system. For centuries, the Arctic’s distinctive character has been shaped by a layer of cold, relatively fresh water just below the surface, produced by melting ice and glaciers. This has insulated the sea ice from the warmer, denser, saltier waters of the Atlantic currents that flow in the depth. But this stratification is collapsing as temperatures rise.The oceanic shift was outlined in a landmark study published last year in Science, which found that the water density and temperature of the Fram strait and Barents Sea were increasingly like those of the Atlantic, while further east, Russia’s Laptev sea was starting to resemble what the Barents used to be. “The polar front is shifting,” the lead author, Dr Sigrid Lind, of the Institute of Marine Science and the University of Bergen, told the  this year. “The Arctic as we know it is about to become history. It will go when stratification breaks down completely and the Atlantic takes over the whole region.”This has not happened for more than 12,000 years, but the shift is well under way. First to succumb, according to Lind, will be the Barents Sea, which will have no fresh water by 2040, then the Kara sea. The consequences will be far-reaching. The food chain is already affected. Atlantic species of cod, herring and mackerel are moving northwards. For the next 20 to 30 years this could boost fishing catches, but forecasts by Norway suggest boom will turn to bust later as the waters grow too warm for fish larvae.There are signs elsewhere in the Arctic that the arrival of smaller Atlantic copepods may be associated with a decline in the whale populations that rely on them. This is not yet certain. It may be possible for whales simply to eat more. But Heather Koopman, a marine physiological ecologist at UNCW, says she is concerned that the speed of change is outstripping some species’ ability to evolve.“The bowhead whale, for example, can live for 200 years, so some are having to adapt to a modern climate with faculties developed in the Georgian age,” Koopman says. “Things are moving far too rapidly for them to keep up. Perhaps small invertebrates can cope with year to year because their breeding cycles come round more quickly. But for a 200-year-old whale, how can they change that fast? Things are so accelerated.”For humanity, the biggest impact is on the weather. The area between the cold pole and the warm equator is a ramp that propels weather fronts across continents. Its incline has always varied from season to season as the icecap expands in winter and shrinks in summer, providing a global pulse that pumps sea and air currents around the world. But that frozen heartbeat is warming and weakening as the Arctic becomes more like the Atlantic. Lind speculates that ocean destratification is the key driver for ice loss, which in turn affects the jet stream, weakens the polar vortex and can lead to heatwaves in the southern US and cold weather extremes in Asia. “The rules of the game are changing. We seem to be seeing large-scale weather pattern changes connected to the shrinking Arctic. As the Arctic becomes history, we need to understand how it affects the globe.”Such concerns are part of the motive for a new wave of international research. From September a German research vessel, Polar Stern, will drift across the north pole and be frozen into the ice over the winter so that 600 scientists can conduct tests billed as the biggest ever study of the Arctic. Norway has just launched a new icebreaker, the Nansen Legacy, which will embark on a series of trips over the next six years in conjunction with Birmingham University to examine ocean acidification and food chain contamination. “This area has been ice-covered and will change once the trawlers move in,” says Marit Reigstad, of the Arctic University of Norway. “We need to know more before we do anything. We need to develop new laws and regulations for the area.”Greenpeace is calling for the central Arctic to be declared a protected marine area. On World Oceans Day on Saturday, campaigners will rally outside parliaments in several countries to demand a new global treaty to end the overexploitation of the high seas.The US, China, Russia, Canada and Korea are more focused on the commercial and strategic opportunities that are emerging as the Arctic melts and opens. Fishing, mining, tourism and cargo shipping could profit, but any gains will be far outweighed by the costs of a diminished Arctic. A recent study found melting permafrost alone would cause $70tn of damage, 10 times the expected revenue from resource extraction and new trade routes.Adding further to that enormous, existential reckoning could be other feedback loops that are now being investigated. Among them is the possible loss of the Arctic’s soothing influence on the northern seas. Bands of ice buffer the waves. Inside the floes, the ship’s passage is far smoother. Wagner speculates that when this calming barrier melts away, the swells will churn the ocean and bring warm water to the surface, which could further accelerate the fragmentation of the polar cap. It is yet another potentially grim area of study, but he views it – like other signs of the Arctic’s demise – with professional composure.“Emotionally, I detach myself,” he says. “The Arctic is an object of study. It’s like a doctor observing a patient to see how sick they are.” He is reluctant to offer a prognosis without a longer-term study, but he says the physics make a recovery extremely unlikely.“I have to hurry up or my science will become archaeology,” the 34-year-old jokes. “There will still be sea ice during the winter, but in the summer it will probably disappear. It won’t be the death of the Arctic, but will be the end of the Arctic as we know it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac9e47da54e2f5310435e703d014c78857de565f/0_265_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3dc3db79708dfe7d8b56a87f84bdb9d","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"White tiger cubs, urban deer and many millions of ladybirds"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba9dd8ad698ab03edd9f951c94020490fd356ae8/0_4_7200_4320/master/7200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31c578e8afe4e0eeb36e32883e794b4d","title":"actors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema ranked keeanu reeves","story":"Keanu Reeves’s cameo in Netflix’s Always Be My Maybe – as himself, yet absolutely ghastly – is a showstopper. But what about those other stars who have parodied themselves on screen?The collision of high and low culture that occurred when Al Pacino appeared as himself in Adam Sandler’s lamentable cross-dressing comedy must have been visible from space. Pacino falls in love with Sandler in drag but the sorest indignity comes when he rechristens himself Dunkaccino to star in a Dunkin’ Donuts commercial in which he raps mangled lines from Dog Day Afternoon, The Godfather Part II and Scarface (“Say hello to my chocolate blend”).Jim Jarmusch’s portmanteau film features various celebrities from music and cinema, among them Alfred Molina being fobbed off by Steve Coogan (in an early instance of the comic playing himself prior to A Cock and Bull Story and The Trip). Blanchett gives an intriguing double-performance as both herself and her own cousin, Shelly, who resents Blanchett’s glamorous life, in an episode that demonstrates the actor’s effortless versatility.Ever wondered what happened to the star of Leaving Las Vegas, Cocktail and Adventures in Babysitting? Turns out she jacked it all in to become a nurse in a Tucson fertility clinic. That’s the conceit of this comedy starring Steve Coogan as a pretentious drama teacher with delusions of talent. “I got sick of the business, sick of all the horrible people,” Shue explains when he recognises her. “It’s all about being a fucking celebrity now.”Michael Cera already had experience playing Michael Cera in Paper Heart. But he ditched his winsome, milk-and-cookies persona spectacularly for the apocalyptic celeb-fest This Is the End, in which he gropes Rihanna, snorts cocaine and has a bathroom threesome. “Michael was just ready to fucking rock,” said the co-writer and co-director Evan Goldberg. “All the other actors knew he was probably going to be the one who stole the movie.”Stories abound of Keanu Reeves’s widespread beneficence, which only makes his auto-cameo as a self-satisfied bore in this Asian-American Netflix romcom all the more delicious. Sitting down in a restaurant, he asks the waiter: “Do you have any dishes that play with time? The concept of time?” Then he sobs as he eats venison while listening on headphones to the sounds of the deer in happier times. He also settles the table’s $6,400 bill (“Less than a residuals paycheque for my hit movie Speed”), shows off his knowledge of Chinese dignitaries and claims that his childhood crush was Mother Teresa.This comedy by the actor-writer-director Michel Blanc won the screenplay prize at Cannes and deserves recognition for its ingenuity and prescience in blurring the lifefilm ide, with the likes of Charlotte Gainsbourg, Carole Bouquet and Philippe Noiret playing themselves. But if the movie was in poor taste in 1994, it looks excruciating now. Blanc, as Blanc, is chagrined to find he has been accused of crimes trivial (blagging Gérard Depardieu’s hotel suite) to heinous (raping the actor Josiane Balasko). If the revelation that there is an imposter in his midst – also played by Blanc – scarcely sweetens the pill, the presence of Roman Polanski may make it downright unpalatable to modern viewers.One of the few blips on Bill Murray’s CV is the 2004 Garfield movie, for which he provided the voice of the languorous feline. Murray signed up for it in the mistaken belief that the script was by one of the Coen brothers (close: Joel Cohen, writer of Daddy Day Camp, had a hand in it). Still, it was worth the error when he got the chance to play himself in the comedy-horror Zombieland. Asked on his deathbed whether he has any regrets, he sighs: “Garfield, maybe?” Perhaps in the upcoming Zombieland follow-up he will reveal why he went on to appear also in the Garfield sequel.The joy of Anna Faris’s cameo as a drug-crazed, samurai-sword-wielding psychopath in this Key and Peele vehicle lies in our initial assumption that she is playing a role. Only once she is complimented for her work in The House Bunny does the penny drop. The director Peter Atencio told her: “Don’t play a different person, but do play what you would be like if you were insane and doing a bunch of blow.” It’s just one scene but the pleasures are twisted and numerous, from Faris trying to convince Tiffany Haddish to shoot Jordan Peele (“Come on, show us what death looks like!”) to Peele begging for his life: “This is black-on-black violence! Don’t fucking let Anna Faris tear us apart!”Separated from the accusations of sexual harassment levelled during production at its director Casey Affleck, I’m Still Here represents a staggering feat of orchestration. Joaquin Phoenix really did capsize his career temporarily by becoming a mumbling, bearded wreck and announcing his retirement from acting to focus on rapping. (Spoiler: he couldn’t rap.) The whole thing was a wheeze that lasted more than a year, all for the purposes of this mockumentary. Part of the fun is seeing the mischief spill over into reality: the car-crash interview with David Letterman, or Ben Stiller mocking Phoenix at the 2009 Oscars. The film is let down only by a limited emotional range that permits its star to be a nitwit or a boor and nothing in between.Charlie Kaufman’s mind-boggling screenplay marked the first time the concept of auto-performance had been put so squarely, and so bizarrely, at the centre of an entire movie. John Cusack is the office worker who discovers behind a filing cabinet a portal leading into the head of John Malkovich anyone who ventures inside can enjoy a full 15 minutes of seeing the world through the actor’s eyes before being dumped unceremoniously next to the New Jersey Turnpike. Malkovich’s essence, combining the recognisability factor with a highfalutin haughtiness, is crucial Being Tom Cruise wouldn’t have had the same effect, but then nor would Being Frank Langella. “It was never going to be anybody other than Malkovich,” Kaufman confirmed. The film’s reach and influence has been wide and eclectic – Paul Giamatti (in Cold Souls) and Jean-Claude Van Damme (in JCVD) are among those to have been Malkoviched – yet the film stands bald-head and shoulders above the rest, every bit as seductively peculiar as Malkovich himself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/301dea0f2eb5d2a567d1a4fb57254bfd257c9f24/130_20_1729_1037/master/1729.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b73a6ed67fcdd1914e19aaa7e748dae0","title":"get on one comrade the story of russias post soviet rave scene","story":"For a brief period in the early 90s, anything seemed possible for the pioneers of a new youth culture. But as a new film reveals, things didn’t turn out quite as hopedIn 1991, the Soviet Union finally crumbled under the weight of its own contradictions. As the walls came tumbling down, it looked as though a space was finally opening up for young people to express themselves after the crushing conformity of the communist years.“For us it was awesome when the Soviet Union fell, because we could fool around,” says artist Illya Chichkan. “And that’s exactly what we did. We experimented with psychedelics and psychotropics. We tried everything.”But things didn’t turn out quite as hoped. The brief window of opportunity that followed communism’s demise soon descended into the dangerous anarchy of unbounded capitalism. As for the stories of the cohort of Russians who attempted to articulate a new youth culture in those chaotic years, they’ve become the basis for director Clayton Vomero’s film 3OHA, which is about to receive its UK premiere at Sheffield DocFest.The first half of the film is dedicated to stories of what the 90s generation went through.Troitsky, who became one of the nascent Russian club scene’s key figures, recalls organising the legendary Gagarin party in 1991: “I had been following the electronic scene in Riga, then Leningrad, then we brought the first rave to Moscow in December.”Another organiser, Igor Shulinsky, pushed out into the world of publishing with Ptyuch magazine. “We tried to do something like the Face magazine at the time,” he says in the film, acknowledging the fact that magazines such as NME, the Face and Melody Maker had been smuggled across borders during the 80s to feed a fervent hunger for another life. “We were like a bible for many people from all over the country. We did what we wanted, we had no taboos. We published everything we were interested in.”But while some embraced the freedoms, which were being enacted against an increasingly violent and rackety background, others noticed that their understanding of the capitalism that was freeing them was sketchy at best.Artist Vova Vorotnyov says: “Everyone was copying the west. They took the western stereotypes and the western mentality as they perceived them. And of course we’d been living behind the iron curtain so a lot of information was not reaching us.”Increasing violence was also rendering much of the country ungovernable. As Vomero notes: “It was more dangerous in the 1990s than it had been in the 1980s. People lived through a broken and horrible state, and people like Shulinsky and Troitsky endured that and insulated themselves by creating clubs and magazines.”There had been a period, Vomero says, when “there was a very short window of about two or three years where there was a moment of people being able to potentially build something, but the temptations of money and success were also great and so new that it was just two years that passed so quickly.”Many of Troitsky’s generation “had a lot of regret for not having taken over ministries, of not having become the people that redid the train lines, did the things which would have had a long lasting effect politically and governmentally and institutionally.” The second half of Vomero’s film fast-forwards to the present, and follows the current generation in Moscow, Kiev and St Petersburg, crushed by the repressions of Vladimir Putin’s modern gulag. The class of 1991 seem incredibly glamorous and with far more agency over their lives than their contemporary counterparts, whose narrow lives encompass illicit street meetings to hawk knock-off trainers on Moscow streets, or discussions of Crimean culture in dusty Kiev apartments. But Vomero’s lens treats the latter’s efforts to create ersatz visions of the west – dancing along to silent music videos in overgrown urban wildernesses while they capture themselves on Instagram – with sympathy.And he captures the terrible pathos of a young couple discussing the possibility of a trip to Los Angeles – which is as likely as a trip to outer space – so poignantly that it has you choking back the tears. The current generation are left untethered at the end of the film, snapping selfies in front of western fashion outlets that remain as untouchable for them as they were for their forebears.• 3OHA screens at Sheffield DocFest on 8 and 11 June"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e975b7b7453fadd92ee2f217f3d79bb186489c5/898_276_2686_1612/master/2686.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2300fe29dd086cf8d458d251561af5b","title":"james bond 25 film cursed","story":"Explosions, injuries, rewrites … Bond 25 seems beset by crisis. The result of intense media scrutiny, or a sign that the series is struggling to find a new direction? The new Bond film is tearing the roof off – literally, it would seem. Reports emerged this week from Pinewood Studios that an explosion on the film’s set on Tuesday destroyed part of a sound-stage roof and tore off large chunks of exterior panelling, as well as causing a “minor injury” to a crew member.The explosion is the latest setback to affect production of the film known as Bond 25, the 25th and latest in the hugely profitable series based on Ian Fleming’s books that began in 1962 and has earned over $7bn worldwide. The UK’s Health and Safety Executive has announced it is to make inquiries into the incident, though it as yet has stopped short of a full investigation.Bond 25 has been hit with a series of problems that, though in some ways not unusual for a production of its scale, are causing repeated delays and suggest a sense of crisis is enveloping it, and there is even talk of a “curse”. Shooting had to be cancelled after lead actor Daniel Craig injured his ankle in May and needed surgery that put him out of action for a fortnight. Producers have hired multiple writers to rework the script – most eyecatchingly, Fleabag’s Phoebe Waller-Bridge, only the second woman to receive a writing credit on a Bond film, who has called for the series to “evolve” and “treat women properly”. And a recent launch event in April, streamed live on Facebook from Jamaica, proved a disappointment, with lead producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson unable to confirm the title of the film, due to be released in less than a year’s time, in April 2020.Arguably the most significant setback, however, occurred in August last year, when the original director, Danny Boyle, abruptly left the project over “creative differences”, meaning Broccoli and Wilson had to start again almost from scratch, with no way to meet the original planned release date of autumn 2019. A month later, Cary Fukunaga was announced as Boyle’s replacement.Part of the difficulties the Bond film is facing is a result of its attempts to overhaul and reposition a series that – despite the strength of its traditionalist appeal – looks in danger of becoming rapidly outdated in the current climate. “There’s no doubt that the 007 franchise needs to make a big effort to be fresh and current in the age of Time’s Up,” says Anna Smith, chair of the London Film Critics’ Circle and host of the Girls on Film podcast.“Though Bond films are hardly woke, representation has been improving over the years, though I think there is still a long way to go when it comes to female characters – the cavalier treatment of Monica Bellucci in Spectre springs to mind. I’m excited to see what Phoebe Waller-Bridge does with the script, and if it takes time to get that right, I’m ready to wait.”Crisis has never seemed far away in the Craig era, with the actor repeatedly sustaining injuries since taking on the role, including losing two teeth in a fight scene in Casino Royale and having a fingertip sliced off during Quantum of Solace. External factors have also contributed: the 2007-08 writers strike hampered the production of Quantum of Solace, with Craig admitting he rewrote scenes with director Marc Forster, and a financial crisis at parent studio MGM in 2010 meant extensive delays before Skyfall could get under way.However, the extraordinary box office success of Skyfall and its follow-up, Spectre – the second and third highest-grossing films of all time in the UK – has meant that the series has had to cater to growing fan demands and wider scrutiny in the press and social media.Smith says: “The challenge will be balancing political correctness with reassuring their core audience that James Bond is still a traditionally ‘masculine’ man and avoiding a backlash. Trolls are very quick to panic about their favourite franchises going feminist – often just based on a trailer. But I hope there are many other Bond fans who would welcome further progress.”•This article was amended on 7 June, to correct the figure of the Bond series worldwide earnings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f25e1e7fe5adbf5cfb8a1f93f8e5a6d4d0d74f0/25_125_1296_777/master/1296.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d191835b3a11a0f26ac648f9932dfe62","title":"straight pride brad pitt milo yiannopoulos","story":"The ‘campaign’, which has ties to far-right US groups and advocates for ‘oppressed majority’ of heterosexuals, dropped images of actorA small group of men with ties to far-right groups who have applied for a license to hold a “Straight Pride March” in the US have taken down a photograph of Brad Pitt from their website after the actor complained.Three men, who call their campaign Super Happy Fun America, had adopted the actor as an unofficial mascot for the “movement”, which “advocates on behalf of the straight community” and describes straight people as an oppressed majority.The move follows a complaint by Pitt’s representatives, who confirmed to the Hollywood Reporter on Thursday that they had officially requested the group stop using his name and likeness.The three men aiming to organize the event in Boston, planned for 31 August, include Mark Sahady, who has ties to the Proud Boys, which has been classified by the FBI as a rightwing extremist group.

Join us in celebration this Saturday for the @bostonpride Parade and in the fight for progress and equality for all.”Chasten Buttigieg, whose husband is 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, highlighted the dangers faced by LGBTQ people in the US and across the world in a series of tweets.The New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez mocked the concept of “straight pride”.The Super Happy Fun America website had previously featured two pictures of Pitt, and declared: “Congratulations to Mr Pitt for being the face of this important civil rights movement.”The site’s homepage now prominently displays an amended version of its previous announcement, redacting the actor’s name and declaring the images “censored”, while another post, published on Friday, said its new mascot was the controversial author and far-right activist Milo Yiannopoulos.Yiannopoulos will act as both mascot and grand marshal of a proposed parade to be staged by the group in Boston, mirroring the route taken by the city’s annual Pride parade.Sahady said the proposed march was a response to the Massachusetts administration turning down the group’s request that a “straight pride flag” be raised at city hall.“We will fight for the right of straights everywhere to express pride in themselves without fear of judgment and hate,” said John Hugo, president of the group.On Wednesday, the actor Chris Evans took issue with the group’s proposed march on Twitter, describing it as the work of closeted toddlers.Pitt, who has won praise for his role as an ageing stuntman in Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood, said in 2006 that he would only marry his then girlfriend, Angelina Jolie, when people of all sexual orientations could do so in the US.Pitt’s activism to overturn Proposition 8, the 2008 legislation that temporarily made same-sex marriage illegal again California, has involved substantial financial donations to the cause, as well as taking part in a staged reading of Dustin Lance Black’s play about the legislation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/843457421f7d520fc7afc0189b70ec627644fd1a/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0a41b18279de7d485c3a526fe784f95","title":"womens world cup 2019 hopes expectations","story":"The most anticipated Women’s World Cup in history is just days away.

But as the club has grown from a handful of players in 2015 to more than 150 now, Simpson’s administrative responsibilities can no longer be described as mundane.Pitch space limits the number who can train to 60, and the list often fills up within seconds. “I get so stressed because I have to put it on at the exact right time,” the 25-year-old says. When one player realised what time it was, she jumped off a train and tried to get signal so she could sign up. “It’s like getting tickets for Glastonbury.”Simpson believes the club’s growth is evidence that when women are given a welcoming space in which to play football, they’ll come and play. Goal Diggers, which is open to women and non-binary players, is one of a handful of new grassroots football clubs that prioritises accessibility over ability. The club’s founder, Fleur Cousens, says: “I founded the team because I was basically fed up of being told that football is a man’s game.” At training, excitement about the upcoming Women’s World Cup is palpable. “I’m going to France three weekends in a row. I’m going by ferry, train and plane. I can’t wait,” says Gaia Laidler, 24. But Cousens says more needs to be done to raise the profile of professional and grassroots women’s football. “At the women’s Euros we had to hunt down places and plead for them to put the football on,” she says.The Women’s World Cup will be a landmark moment for the sport. Fifa expects 1 billion people will tune in to watch the tournament, and in the UK the BBC will broadcast every game. “There’s a lot of excitement, awareness and anticipation that I’ve never felt before,” said Kelly Simmons, the FA’s director of women’s football. While Goal Diggers players welcome the increased coverage and sponsorship, they believe community events stressing inclusion and ersity are key to shifting perceptions. They want to ensure the increased interest in women’s football is sustained long after the World Cup ends.The club has partnered with bars, brands, and nonprofits to create the Festival of Football. As well as film screenings, panel talks and photography exhibitions, the festival will have football taster days for beginners and women over 40. “The more people see women’s football being screened in pubs and bars, the more people think that’s something they can do. The more spaces there are for women to play football, the more they are inclined to watch it,” said the festival’s founder, Hannah Wright.Jenna al-Ansari, who runs cultural events at the Book Club, a bar in east London, said the decision to screen every match was a no-brainer. “The Women’s World Cup didn’t really have a home. There isn’t a particular bar or a particular pub that had embraced the World Cup and we thought we’d be perfect for that.” She said women’s football was no longer a “niche interest that can be brushed under the carpet” and it was important fans had a place to go where there would be an atmosphere.Cousens first started playing football in primary school. “I played in a mixed team and got pushed out because I was a girl, though I was one of the best in the team. I was about nine and at that age that rejection meant I stopped playing, I thought it wasn’t a sport for me,” she says. It’s a story that resonated with other players at Goal Diggers. Amy Lester, who is training to be a coach, says the club’s greatest achievements are not matches won but the growing number of women and non-binary people who become more confident and skilled.The club is struggling to find a council willing to provide a larger pitch space. Cousens says it isn’t good enough for local authorities committed to gender equality to say bookings are on a first come, first served basis, allowing a handful of guys to block-book pitches months in advance.Angela Murdock, whose 13-year-old daughter Ruby plays for Chelsea’s under-15s, says it requires a great deal of time and effort from parents to nurture their child’s interest in the sport. “It’s a hell of a lot of driving to get them to games and training,” she says, adding that more clubs and opportunities would be welcomed.As for Ruby, she says it never crossed her mind that football wasn’t for girls. “I’ve grown up with really good female players and I’ve always thought girls could play,” she says. Some boys at school initially refused to pass to her, but that didn’t last long. “They all pass now because of how good I am.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e854efee55a6de6169b014226d5476b5a748bfad/0_0_4739_2844/master/4739.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e046221caab6aaacedd5d43d1f010223","title":"ryan sessegnon not renew fulham wants tottenham move","story":"Ryan Sessegnon has told Fulham he will not sign a contract to replace the one that expires next summer and has set his heart on a move to Tottenham.The 19-year-old winger, who will be involved with England at the Under-21 European Championship in Italy and San Marino this month, has been chased by other top clubs, including Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United.

Perhaps “Love” and “Island”, I’ll give you that, or “Dawson’s” and “Creek”. But no, it’s “World” and Cup”. Look, take a moment to feel what happens when I put them together: World Cup. Spooky, right? Make no mistake, this means everything. By now we’re beyond the point where it feels necessary to explain why women’s football matters. Sorry to break it to all the sexists out there, but it’s here, it’s staying and it’s only going to get bigger from this point onwards. The interest in this tournament is going to be enormous, with coverage like never before, and a multitude of compelling storylines ought to attract even more fans to a sport growing in strength all the time. I’ll level with you, chums: I had a bit of a tear in the eye watching that Nike advert last night. That girl ... she was just so ... so ... so ... so inspiring! Hopefully children everywhere will be watching, ready to be captivated and enthralled by a month of non-stop football, and thinking they can change the world for the better. This is expected to be the best women’s World Cup yet – you’d hope so given that almost one million tickets have already been sold – and rather brilliantly nobody seems to have any clue which team will achieve sporting immortality by lifting the trophy on 7 July.Twenty-four countries have made it to France (six groups of four, in case you’re wondering), but there’s no widespread agreement on who’s going to win the thing. Our expert writers certainly can’t agree. Some went for England, glorious England, others went for those ominous Germans. Holland, the European champions, can’t be overlooked, and it’s going to take an almighty effort to stop the USA retaining their trophy. Australia are also tipped to go far.Then there’s France, tournament hosts and perennial quarter-finalists. They begin their campaign against South Korea at the Parc des Princes and will be desperate to get off to a flyer. It’s unlikely to be straightforward, though. South Korea have the outstanding Chelsea forward Ji So-yun in their ranks and their squad is crammed with players who won the Under-17 World Cup and also reached the Under-20 World Cup semi-finals in 2010. No wonder Korea’s Golden Generation have designs on pipping Norway and Nigeria to a knockout spot.All of which means it will be interesting to see whether it will help or hinder France to play in front of an expectant home crowd, not least because they can complete a historic double by emulating the success of the men’s team in Russia last year. No pressure. Just one of the many subplots to keep us occupied over the next month.

Think againOne of the most famous (and most obnoxious) observations of the existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre concerns a waiter in a cafe, whose bearing is somehow a bit too, well, waiterish. “He comes toward the patrons with a step a little too quick. He bends forward a little too eagerly his voice, his eyes, express an interest a little too solicitous.” He seems to be playing a part, with a surfeit of enthusiasm.Why? To deceive himself, Sartre concludes. The waiter throws himself into the role because he wants to persuade himself he has no choice – that he’s “some kind of automaton”, whose very essence condemns him to be a waiter. That’s more comfortable than facing the truth, which is that he’s choosing to be a waiter and is free to make a different choice – though you can’t help wondering how Sartre, who basically lived in cafes, would have coped had the waiters of Paris all acted on his advice.I thought about Sartre’s waiter the other day when I read an article in the magazine Fast Company, which offered tips on using meditation to cope with the stress arising from watching the closing episodes of Game Of Thrones. It’s slightly mean to single it out, given that stories with gratuitous Westeros angles have been such a staple of the last eight years. Still, it seemed to capture something essential about life in 2019. Since you had to watch Game Of Thrones, the article implied, and since the final season had been so infuriating andor emotionally draining, didn’t it make perfect sense to find time in your schedule for a little calming meditation? To be sure, there was a more elegant solution to this problem: not watching Game Of Thrones. But, as with Sartre’s waiter, the possibility of that choice didn’t even seem to arise.In reality, I doubt many people felt truly obliged to watch Game Of Thrones. But most of us do make this error in some domain or other. Digital technology offers an obvious wealth of examples. We persuade ourselves that something is a non-negotiable aspect of modern life – being on Facebook, carrying a smartphone, being reachable on email at weekends, keeping up with the news – then figure out ways to deal with the downsides, rather than stopping to wonder if it’s even necessary in the first place.The tricky part is that some things are obligatory: any given person’s situation genuinely might oblige them to be (say) reachable at weekends or be on Facebook, or to work as a waiter when they would rather not. But the same economic forces that constrain our choices like this also want us to believe that our choices are more constrained than they really are.The truth is that, however little choice you have, you almost certainly have more than you believe. These days, were he to accuse a waiter of failing to appreciate the full range of his options, Sartre would be told to check his privilege, and fair enough. But it wouldn’t follow that he was wrong. Maybe you actually don’t need to keep doing the thing you tell yourself you have to keep doing. Maybe you could turn on your heel and walk out of the cafe, oblivious to the philosopher snapping his fingers for another espresso.Sarah Bakewell peers through the Parisian cigarette smoke to bring Sartre’s insights to life in her vivid history, At The Existentialist Cafe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f4bc00457633a2f90c0d68e8173b632f3a86bb5/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03ea7967f980a515f0b3e06b19d06589","title":"how long should i stay in my loveless marriage","story":"I want to leave.

He could be found in contempt of parliament if he refuses to appear in front of MPs, although recent cases have highlighted that there is a limited amount that politicians can do to make people give evidence.Kyle could find himself publicly shamed in the national media if he fails to attend the hearing, which will focus on how the show exercised its duty of care towards participants and on the wider issues facing reality TV shows.The inquiry will look at other programmes, such as Love Island, ITV’s highly profitable reality TV ratings hit which returned this week with record viewing figures for a launch programme.The programme, which is attracting young audiences who often eschew live television, has come under increasing scrutiny after the incident on The Jeremy Kyle Show and the suicides of two former participants. In response, Love Island staff have announced extra safeguarding measures, especially with regards to coping with the pressures of social media fame.ITV’s chief executive, Dame Carolyn McCall, chairman, Sir Peter Bazalgette, and director of content compliance, Chris Wissun, are to appear in front of MPs on Tuesday 25 June.

Here, it seemed, was another: a session musician reinventing himself as Dr John, singing songs about Louisiana voodoo thick with New Orleans slang and Creole patois, clad in a flamboyant Mardi Gras headdress and facepaint. Yet Gris Gris was anything but a novelty record. It was both one of the most extraordinary debut albums of the 60s and the beginning of a solo career that would last 51 years.Its presentation certainly courted the psychedelic market – Dr John billed himself as the “Night Tripper”, a lysergic honorific that nodded to the Beatles – but the music bore almost no relation to anything else in rock music at the time. Instead, it boasted an innovative, brilliant and at times unsettling synthesis of New Orleans musical traditions – jazz, funk, rhythm and blues – made by a man steeped in both the city’s culture and the darker side of life. He certainly sounded like he knew of what he spoke: all the lyrics about serpent spirits and curses and witch doctors, which should have seemed like hokum, sounded authentically ominous and disturbing in Dr John’s coolly menacing drawl.Mac Rebennack was nearing 30 when he transformed himself into Dr John and released Gris Gris: he had already packed a lifetime’s worth of musical experience and incident into his 27 years. His father’s connections as a record store owner in New Orleans’ Third Ward enabled him to sneak into local recording sessions: by 13, he was a professional musician, playing organ in strip clubs in the Third Quarter and performing with Professor Longhair, a local pioneer whose blend of blues, boogie-woogie and Afro-Cuban rhythms, Rebennack would later claim, “put the funk into music”.By 16, he was a session guitarist and occasional producer, working out of Cosimo Studios and playing in a succession of bands. He even had a local solo hit in 1959, a brooding Bo Diddley knock-off called Storm Warning, but Rebennack was also trouble: his career as a guitarist was ended when his finger was injured by a gunshot at a gig in Jackson in 1960 he became a heroin addict and dealer he was involved in running a brothel. In 1963, he was sentenced to two years for drug offences, and on release shifted operations to Los Angeles, where a contingent of exiled New Orleans musicians – led by arranger Harold Battiste – were making headway as session players.Rebennack became a member of the most revered Hollywood session group of all, the Wrecking Crew, playing with everyone from Sonny and Cher to Frank Zappa, but professed himself dissatisfied and homesick. Pining for New Orleans, he created the character of Dr John, loosely based on the legend of a 19th-century Senegalese freed slave turned New Orleans voodoo king, the music inspired by the disparate sounds Rebennack had heard at a spiritualist church in the Lower Ninth Ward. Here, he claimed, “Hindus and Buddhists, Jews, Christians, Masons, even voodoos” all worshipped together. He initially developed the idea for singer and actor Ronnie Barren, but when Barren balked, Rebennack took on the role, surrounding himself with fellow New Orleans expats and recording Gris Gris in late 1967.The music Rebennack and Battiste concocted for the album was so out of step with prevalent trends that Atlantic Records boss Ahmet Ertegun initially refused to release it. In Rebennack’s retelling, Ertegun dismissed him as a “boogaloo motherfucker” when their paths crossed in the studio. But when it finally did come out, Gris Gris oddly chimed with the times. It sounded like it was recorded live, which clicked with the shift away from psychedelia to something more earthy and traditional, exemplified by the rootsy Americana of the Band’s Music from Big Pink, on release the same year.Moreover, 1968 was the year that flower-power idealism curdled: it was a year of rioting, violence and upheaval, of Sympathy for the Devil rather than All You Need Is Love. That suited the album’s sinister atmosphere perfectly. Its flatly astonishing closer, I Walk on Gilded Splinters, offered up eight minutes of crawling malevolence and threatening braggadocio: if you took the title as a reference to needles, as plenty did, it sounded remarkably like a sneering, screw-you defence of Rebennack’s drug use, a distant Louisiana relation of the Velvet Underground’s Heroin. The live show Rebennack devised to support the album was a sensation, involving dancers wearing nothing but body paint, the singer disappearing in a puff of smoke and voodoo rituals. In St Louis, they were arrested after a band member bit the head off a chicken on stage.If anything, Gris Gris’ followup, Babylon, was even further out: the lyrics more political and apocalyptic, the time signatures off-kilter, many of the instruments made by the eccentric inventor and composer Harry Partch. Rebenack and Battiste fell out after its recording, the latter protesting that his former collaborator was “a hopeless drug addict”. Certainly, Rebenack’s life seemed to be unravelling. During the making of 1970’s Remedies, he was committed to a psychiatric hospital, but escaped. Released unfinished, the album was as otherworldly and evil-sounding as ever, as demonstrated by the supremely disturbing 17-minute Angola Anthem. On arrival in London shortly after its release, Rebenack was feted by fans from the rock aristocracy, Mick Jagger and Eric Clapton among them, but recording sessions on which both featured descended into chaos – “everything was confusemental”, as Rebenack characteristically put it – and The Sun, Moon \u0026amp Herbs was scythed from a projected triple album into a mere seven tracks.And yet Rebenack survived, even thrived. Pragmatically retiring the theatrical excesses and sonic weirdness of his Dr John persona, 1972’s Gumbo saw him charging masterfully through a selection of New Orleans R\u0026ampB classics – Professor Longhair’s Tipitina among them – while its follow-up, In the Right Place (1973), pared him with funk band the Meters and legendary producer Allen Toussaint to striking effect: the album was his biggest US hit and the raw groove of Right Place, Wrong Time his biggest single.It was a commercial peak he never scaled again. Desitively Bonnaroo attempted to repeat its predecessor’s formula with diminishing returns. Thereafter Rebenack’s albums became increasingly sporadic and variable in quality – 1979’s Tango Palace saw him unexpectedly, perhaps ill-advisedly, dabbling in disco – although he remained in demand as a sideman, working with everyone from Rickie Lee Jones to Van Morrison. He kicked drugs in 1989, and released In a Sentimental Mood. It wasa good album, his drawling vocals added real licentiousness to Makin’ Whoopee and a dissolute air to Accentuate the Positive, but a world away from Gris Gris and Babylon.He was finally persuaded to don his Mardi Gras headdress once more by Jason Pierce of Spiritualized, on whose 1997 album Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space Rebennack guested. The same year he released Anutha Zone, supported by a starry cast of younger British musicians – Supergrass, Paul Weller, the Beta Band, Martin Duffy of Primal Scream – all clearly in thrall to the Dr John myth and the strangeness of his first three albums.

I have said all along that we would put to parliament our proposals on a customs union on a trade relationship and the dynamic protection of consumer and workers’ rights.“As our conference resolution agreed last September, we would then be prepared to put that to a public vote. We are not at the stage yet where parliament has actually voted on that. I think it would be much better if there was actually a general election.”Corbyn’s comments came as the internal Labour row about Brexit heats up, after the party’s disastrous result at last month’s European elections.Grassroots activists are organising for constituency Labour parties (CLPs) to pass motions demanding a second referendum in the run-up to the party’s autumn conference – the same process that laid the groundwork for the shift in policy last year.Mike Buckley, of the campaign group Labour for a Public Vote, said: “Hundreds of CLPs are already set to debate motions for conference calling for the party to back a new referendum, and to campaign for remain. We’re confident of winning in September – but would much prefer the party to shift now. If we don’t, we’ll lose more voters over the summer and we won’t be able to oppose no deal as effectively.”The Labour MP Clive Lewis, of the pressure group Love Socialism Hate Brexit, tweeted in response to the Peterborough result: “We’ve blunted our opponent’s momentum with an overwhelming home field advantage. Now we must arm our activists with the radical policies they need to finish the job in the long slog ahead, including a public vote”.Party insiders said tensions between Corbyn’s office and those pushing for a more full-throated anti-Brexit stance were running high.The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, was dropped as Corbyn’s usual stand-in for prime minister’s questions this week after she spoke out about Labour’s strategy for the European elections. On polling day last month, Thornberry said Labour was “not clear on the one single thing that people wanted to hear”. She was replaced at the dispatch box by Rebecca Long-Bailey, a rising star on the left of the party and a staunch Corbyn loyalist.Meanwhile, there is growing chatter about the possibility of the party’s rules being changed to create a second deputy leader, alongside Tom Watson, who has pursued a vocal campaign to toughen Corbyn’s Brexit position.The proposal was mooted last year, but dropped at the last minute because of fears that a vote among party members could be used as a proxy referendum on Labour’s Brexit policy.A source close to Watson said: “Lashing out by expelling Alastair Campbell, publicly humiliating Emily Thornberry and challenging Tom for the deputy leadership is not the way to resolve this situation.“No matter how many punishment beatings are meted out, Tom will continue to speak out for what he believes in – a confirmatory ballot and a broad church Labour party that is avowedly pro-European.”However, one close ally of Corbyn suggested the idea of challenging Watson may just have been “loose talk” in the aftermath of the European elections shock, which was then being “actively briefed by Corbyn’s opponents” to “add to the sense of victimhood” on the right of the party.In Peterborough, amid cheers from supporters, Corbyn called for Tory leadership contenders to give the general public a chance to vote them out of office. “On the day that Theresa May ceases to be leader of the Conservative party, my message is to all the squabbling contenders for the Tory party leadership: bring it on. We are ready for a general election at any time,” he said.Farage left the count through a back door minutes before the result was announced. But Greene said the Brexit party had made a significant breakthrough, despite not winning. “We have shaken up British politics with none of the data that is necessary to win a parliamentary election,” he said. “We’ve had two parties ruling for decades that’s not happening any more.”Despite Corbyn’s attempts to use the victory to champion Forbes as a new MP, some Labour MPs and Jewish campaign groups expressed unease at her election.It was revealed last weekend that Forbes, a Unite union activist, had liked a Facebook post saying May had a “Zionist slave masters agenda” alongside a video of children praying after the New Zealand terror attack. Another posting from Forbes said she had “enjoyed reading” a thread that said Islamic State was created by Mossad and the CIA.She later apologised, saying she had meant to “like” the video of children praying in solidarity with the victims of Christchurch attacks, not the accompanying views.After her victory, the Jewish Labour Movement said Forbes needed to go “far further” to demonstrate to the Jewish community that she was not racist.Phillips added: “Lisa ignored and endorsed antisemitic things, I’ll take her explanation and apology at face value and look forward to her proving, as others have, that actions not excuses alone can heal. But with every case the party’s values chip away and our ability to stand up against hate erodes.”Haigh, who worked closely with Forbes, said the emergence of the postings was a low point for the campaign. She said: “The whole campaign team were really upset when the posts that Lisa had mistakenly engaged with came to light and that was definitely a very difficult point for the campaign. But Lisa fully accepts they were wrong. She is really, really sorry.“I will be working with her to engage with the community and deepen her understanding and help her to be an ally in the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fdd00fc1692a6b3ebcf8dec2881123199b7c346/0_403_6048_3629/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f72f29306bae714c655d92dfa45fd0f8","title":"nasa international space station commercial access tourism","story":"Move will allow private astronauts to spend up to 30 days in low-Earth orbit and businesses to shoot film and adverts in spaceNasa will allow unprecedented commercial access to the International Space Station (ISS) for marketing, business and space tourism, the agency announced on Friday.The change paves the way for the wealthy to rocket from Earth and spend time aboard the astronaut home and laboratory in space, through trips planned by private enterprise, and for businesses to develop products or shoot film – including adverts – in space.The move is part of Nasa’s effort to put the first woman and another man on the moon by 2024. Until now, the space station has only been used for research and development.“We are so excited to be part of Nasa as our home and laboratory in space transitions into being accessible to expanded commercial and marketing opportunities, as well as to private astronauts,” said astronaut Christina Koch, in a Nasa tweet.“Enabling a vibrant economy in low-Earth orbit has always been a driving element of the space station program, and will make space more accessible to all Americans,” Koch said. “Transitioning toward this new model of business is an important step to allow Nasa to move full speed ahead in landing the first woman and the next man on the moon.”The new directive will allow private astronauts to spend up to 30 days in low-Earth orbit aboard the ISS through trips planned by private companies. Nasa said it believes it can accommodate up to two privately funded, short-duration missions a year with, essentially, space tourists.Private astronauts will have to reimburse the government for the costs to the space station, including $11,250 a day for life support and toilets, and $22,500 a day for food, air and medical supplies. However, astronauts will have to pay a private company to get to the space station, and those tickets will probably cost millions.Eventually, Nasa hopes the space station will be just one of several “commercial and free-flying habitable destinations in low-Earth orbit”. For now, Nasa is making one space station port available for commercial uses “for a finite period of time”.The move is part of a broader push by the Trump administration to end government funding for the ISS, and allow commercial enterprise to fund what is now astronauts’ home in space.“Nasa is opening the International Space Station to commercial opportunities and marketing these opportunities as we’ve never done before,” the chief financial officer, Jeff DeWit, said in New York, according to the BBC.Other details, such as exactly who would be eligible to buy a ticket to the ISS, were not disclosed.Last year, a committee formed by the Trump administration floated the idea of allowing astronauts to appear in marketing, such as on cereal boxes, for commercials to be filmed in the space station or even for extra-terrestrial rover vehicles to have logos in the way that racing cars do. The committee is headed by an attorney who works in government relations for the space tech firm Maxar Technologies.“Commercial companies will play an important role both here in low-Earth orbit and around the moon, working with Nasa to test technologies train astronauts and develop a sustainable human presence,” said Koch.Astronauts have lived aboard the space station for more than 18 years conducting thousands of experiments. The ISS costs Nasa roughly $3bn to $4bn a year to operate, according to the Verge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab309586e55bd02f5ee85455752643cf5918b5e/0_2614_3370_2021/master/3370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28f1928947d8c7bea65c453b3c93bace","title":"share your experiences of sure start childrens centres","story":"Whether you helped set up the programme in your area or your family used a centre near you, we would like to hear your storiesThe flagship Sure Start programme has saved the NHS millions of pounds through the benefits it has brought to children including some of the most deprived areas and reducing the number of those taken to hospital, according to a study.Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies “found that where Sure Start offered high levels of service in poor neighbourhoods in England, visits to hospital to treat injuries fell among all children of primary school age, and by a third of all 11-year-olds”.Tracy Brabin, the shadow early years minister, said: “This research shows the critical role Sure Start plays in children’s health, as well as their development.

But on Friday, after he produced a rock-solid performance in horrendous wind to see off Roger Federer, Nadal was handed a further boost when the semi-final between Novak Djokovic and Dominic Thiem was only midway through when it was held over until Saturday because of rain.With an extra day to recover compared with his opponent – Djokovic and Thiem were one set all with the Austrian leading 3-1 in the third – Nadal will surely be even more confident. The stars, it seems, are aligning in the Spaniard’s favour.Nadal was at his resilient best as he beat Federer 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 to dash the 37-year-old Federer’s hopes of adding a second French Open title, 10 years after his first. As he has done so often in his career, he ran down everything, forced Federer to miss and coped better with the gusting winds to claim his place in the final.Such was his dominance that at one stage Federer found himself considering just how difficult it is to play Nadal on clay. “He makes you feel uncomfortable the way he defends the court and plays on clay,” Federer said. “There is nobody who even plays remotely close to him. I don’t even know who I need to go search for to go practice with somebody who plays like him. I was thinking that during the match. It’s just amazing how he plays from deep and then is able to bounce back and forth from the baseline. It’s just quite interesting.”This was the 39th meeting between the two men, a rivalry that has produced some of the best matches in tennis history. Going into the semi-final, the 33-year-old led Federer 23-15 and though the Swiss had won their past five matches, they had not met on clay since 2013, not played at Roland Garros since 2011 and the last time Federer beat Nadal on clay was in Madrid in 2009. Having dropped only one set on the way to the semi-final after three years away, there were some who believed Federer could do it again this year but Nadal was too solid, too good.No one likes playing in the wind – and conditions were close to unplayable at times, with gusts of 50 miles an hour plus occasionally making both men look foolish – but Nadal was unflustered. By contrast Federer’s plan went out of the window and the precision he needed to attack was impossible to achieve. “There was so much wind, it was incredible,” Federer said. “It was just crazy. No excuses, but it was crazy. You get to a point where you’re just happy to make shots and not look ridiculous. I don’t know what I could have done a whole lot different. I don’t think I played poorly in the wind today. It’s just it’s tough on clay. You’ve got to try to take on the half-volleys, too, all that stuff. It just adds to the equation. He’s the best clay-court player, so I can accept that. It’s not a problem.”Nadal saved a break point in the first game but adjusted better, marching to a 3-0 lead. Federer, trying to attack with his backhand, using the space on Nadal’s forehand side, got himself back on serve at 2-3 but Nadal broke again after a long sixth game and held the advantage throughout to take it 6-3 with a stunning cross-court backhand.As the clay whipped up off the court and even the heavy court-covers rippled in the wind, Federer tried everything, from drop shots to serve and volley, with angles and slice and he broke for 2-0. Nadal, though, broke back immediately, against the wind. At 4-4, Federer was pressing but from 40-0, he was broken and Nadal served out the set.There was no way back for Federer from there, Nadal breaking in the third and fifth games of the third set as he clinched victory, putting him in the final yet again. “My personal feeling is I have been playing a great match with that conditions,” Nadal said. “I’m confident in myself. If I’m not able to execute my game plan, it’s going to be complicated. But if I play well, and I have played well up to now, I’ve got all my chances.”Trailing 5-2 in the first set to Thiem, last year’s runner-up, Djokovic, called the supervisor on to court to ask at what stage the wind would became too extreme to play. Thiem took the first set but, after a brief rain delay, the world No 1 regrouped and levelled the match.Thiem broke to lead 3-1 before the rain returned and the covers were immediately placed on the court. And though there was bright sunshine at the time, play was cancelled for the day shortly before 6.30pm. With the final scheduled for Sunday, the winner will have played on four straight days. Advantage Nadal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa956313e3a0d8e7bcb1fd3bf5efd34867f4b9a5/0_62_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=352d587758757d191f50f22ebf4ca8ce","title":"duck eggs irritating noises and why cricket was better in the 90s the spin podcast","story":"Emma John, Rob Eastaway and Jon Harvey discuss who’s made an impression in the World Cup so far, demystify some of cricket’s oddities and decide what’s the most irritating noise to be sat next to during a gameCricket author Rob Eastaway and comedy writer Jon Harvey (recently revealed to be Theresa May’s electoral nemesis Lord Buckethead) join Emma John to discuss who’s made an impression on the early stages of the World Cup.

There’s no doubt Rafa will be enjoying this. Thanks for readingemailingtweeting today, sorry we couldn’t continue, but we’ll be back tomorrow. Au revoir!As the sun peeks out from behind the grey skies, it’s announced that ... play has been cancelled for the day. A big call from the organisers. They must be expecting some heavy rain. It’s hard to know whether Djokovic will be pleased, given how unhappy he was with the conditions today, or annoyed that he now faces playing on three consecutive days if he’s to win the title. I’m sure Thiem, however, would have liked the chance to get back out there this evening.Meanwhile Johanna Konta has had her say on the scheduling at Roland Garros.Here’s the match reports from the other semi-finals in case you’ve missed them:That 5.05pm BST6.05pm Paris time marker has ticked by and still no word when this semi-final may resume ...The weather forecast for the next few hours in Paris isn’t looking too great, with the rain not expected to completely clear until around 9pm (8pm BST), by which point it’ll be too dark to play, in the absence of any floodlights. At least there’ll be a roof on Philippe Chatrier, hopefully next year if not for 2021. This is the only slam without a roof on the main court.Meanwhile Abhijato Sensarma emails, offering a far more considered analysis of this semi-final than anything I’ve managed so far: “The first set reminded me of cricket in England. Thiem was Jimmy Anderson (anytime post-2008) while Novak was Virat Kohli (pre-2018) - the latter would dominate the former on the ‘hard’ surfaces, but in windy conditions the former has dominated the latter with unexpected authority, helped by the Kohli-eque rage from the opponent when things haven’t gone his way. In the second set Thiem continued like Anderson always does, at the top of his game. But Novak is now Kohli (post-2018): he’s learning to respect the conditions as well as the skills of his opponent. That has made it a highly entertaining contest between two people trying to utilise their widely-acclaimed skill-sets to their best to come out on top. Makes for incredible viewing!”Jacob appears to be enjoying the adverse weather about as much as Djokovic did in that first set, and he’s decided he’s had enough, so I’m back. Fair-weather Steinberg. We were just discussing whether there have been windier conditions at a slam, when I found this gem on Twitter, from Indian Wells in 2009:The match will not resume until: at least 5.05pm BST6.05pm Paris time.The covers are on. We could be waiting a while.That was a wonderful spell from Thiem, but the worry is his momentum might be halted by another rain delay. The umbrellas are up again and both players have left the court. This might be a longer delay than last time.Third set: Djokovic* 2-6, 6-3, 1-3 Thiem (*denotes server): Djokovic looks on forlornly as another Thiem backhand flies by for 30-all. He doesn’t seem entirely comfortable. Suspicions that he’s still not right when a dismal drop shot hits the net, gifting Thiem a break point. Then the wind starts to cause problems for both players. They both struggle to read the bounce of the ball and the rally ends with Thiem completely misreading a Djokovic forehand. No bother, he makes up for it with a brilliant backhand pass down the line for a second break point. This time Thiem goes on the offensive, pushing Djokovic back with a series of enormous forehands, and he grabs the break when the world No1 blocks a forehand long. Third set: Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 1-2 Thiem* (*denotes server): At 15-all Thiem lashes a forehand out of reach and punches his fist. These are crucial moments. He holds to 15 with a gorgeous backhand that draws coos of admiration from the crowd.Third set: Djokovic* 2-6, 6-3, 1-1 Thiem (*denotes server): Djokovic double-faults to make it 15-all. Then at 30-all Thiem produces a stunning, chopped drop shot to earn a break point. Djokovic glares and stares at his box, a flummoxed man. There follows a tense rally, but Thiem overcooks a sliced backhand, the ball drifting wide. The Austrian buries his face in his shirt for a moment. It was a poor shot and it allows Djokovic to scramble clear.Third set: Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 0-1 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem starts the third set with a hold to love.“For whom to root?” asks Gregory Phillips. “I wanted Federer, as the underdog, to beat Nadal, and once he lost I wanted Nadal to beat Djokovic because I just can’t warm to Novak even though I’m not sure why. But if Thiem wins here, I’ll be at a bit of a loss. I should root for the underdog to get his first slam, but wanting Rafa to lose a French Open final feels like heresy.” And with that to ponder, I’ll leave you with Jacob. I’m off for a break. À plus tard!Since the resumption this has been a different match. Djokovic charges to 40-15 in the blink of an eye and secures the set on the first of his set points. Having resented the adverse conditions it’s an irony that it’s the rain that has completely changed the complexion of this contest.For the first time, Djokovic gets to 15-30 on the Thiem serve. He does so with a lovely volley that has the crowd chanting his name. And they’re roaring in delight after the next point, which he wins with a probing shot that Thiem can only net, after several sliced forehands from Djokovic to deal with the wind. He’s starting to get the measure of it. And from 15-40 he breaks! The real Novak Djokovic, the world No 1 and current holder of three of the four slam titles, is standing up.Djokovic seems slightly more at ease since the delay. He no longer seems to be raging against the conditions. Admittedly his rage often makes him a better player, but I’m not sure it has today. 15-0, 30-0, 40-0. Game, as his effort just clips the sideline. And game on. This is so much more competitive now.As the delay was so short, only seven minutes, they’ll get straight back to business rather than having a warmup. Thiem, remember, is serving at 30-0. The break appears to have done Djokovic some good. He wins the first two points but then, off-balance and on the stretch, slaps into the net. 40-30. Deuce. Djokovic is spinning and sliding on the baseline, showing the best of his defence in a 19-shot rally, but Thiem is the one celebrating when he punches away a winning volley. Advantage Thiem. And that’s an impressive hold given the mid-game interruption.The players are back out. While we wait for them to resume battle, here’s some news regarding Serena Williams:The rain is already easing, though little chance of the wind doing the same. This could be a fairly brief interruption.Djokovic decides to reply with a love hold of his own, rounding things off with a wonderfully nonchalant volley on the spin. The commentators are discussing what it would take for play to be suspended, with the umpire having told Djokovic earlier the wind would have to be “dangerous”. How do you define that? The wind does seem to be picking up even more speed, but with Thiem serving at 30-0, it’s the rain that takes them off court. For the first time today, play has been halted. Djokovic couldn’t have got off court faster arguably it’s the most dynamic move he’s made today.Even on the television, you can hear the wind whistling loudly around Chatrier. It must be ringing in Djokovic’s ears when he slumps 15-40 behind on serve. Thiem’s won twice as many points as Djokovic so far. Thiem lobs long on the first break point after a Djokovic serve-volley, and Djokovic repeats the tactic on the second break point. Again it’s a successful one. Deuce. Thiem repeatedly slices his backhand on the next point before cutting himself into pieces. Advantage Djokovic. Egalite. Advantage Djokovic. Jeu Djokovic. Perhaps he’ll feel a little more battle hardened after that.With the Djokovic slam in danger, the world No 1 decides to step up early to serve at the start of the second set. He does at least regroup enough to hold to love. But Thiem has won 15 consecutive points on serve, and he makes that 17 as he sprints 30-0 ahead in the next game. Djokovic draws from cheers from the crowd when he stops the sequence with a winner down the line. 15-30. 30-all. Thiem holds from there, but at least there were signs of some green shoots of recovery from Djokovic. “Walk on through the wind ... walk on through the rain,” emails Peter Oh. “As a Domi Thiem fan I was hoping that Djokovic would get blown away, but not literally.”Djokovic is calling for the referee. He thinks the wind is making this unplayable. But it’s the same for Thiem, too, and it was the same for Nadal and Federer before them. Djokovic needs to accept the conditions and move on. Thiem is taking little time here to serve the set out. 15-0, 30-0, 40-0, game and set, as Djokovic, barely moving his feet, blazes into the tramlines.Djokovic is at the net when Thiem’s effort rocks him back, before a giant gust of wind blows a cloud of clay into his face, to add insult to injury. 0-15. 0-30. 0-40, when Djokovic uncharacteristically flunks into the net. Djokovic attempts the serve and volley but is broken to love.After the greyest of skies, the sun decides to briefly make an appearance, before disappearing as quickly as it came. Thiem appears to be almost relishing these conditions, while Djokovic is clearly uneasy, he just seems to be waiting for them to change. If he’s not careful this set will get away from him before they do. Some smart serving from Thiem gives him a two-game cushion once more.Djokovic seems to have adopted Federer’s mindset. He’s playing well within himself. But it’s enough to get him through this game, conceding only the one point. I’m not sure who’s more muted: him or the crowd. Strange scenes as Djokovic, his head covered in a towel as he hides from the wind and rain, appears to have told the umpire he won’t play. He then changes his mind and decides to get back to action. This being clay, the players can carry on unless the rain gets much harder. But Djokovic clearly isn’t relishing these conditions. Thiem holds to 15 once more. He’s won 12 of the last 14 points.Thiem, the fourth seed, navigates his way through his opening service game with almost as much ease, before stealing the first point on Djokovic’s serve. 0-15. 0-30, when Djokovic hits long - blame the wind for that. It’s also starting to rain harder now. Those fans who’ve decided not to take a break are getting their umbrellas out. We’ve done well to get this far through the day’s play without a rain break, however the forecast for the next few hours is worse. Djokovic scrambles to 15-30, appears to be in charge of the next point, approaches the net ... but Thiem’s pass is just too good. 15-40, two break points. Djokovic drives his backhand into the net and Thiem takes the first break! The spectators, having failed to all take to their seats until about an hour and a half ago after a long lunch, are now being bumped out because tickets for this match have been sold as a separate event. The stadium is virtually empty as Djokovic steps up to serve. The pair sound each other out in the opening exchange, which lasts 20 shots. The next three points are much quicker and Djokovic delivers a love hold.One thing that will always bug Djokovic, even if he does hold all four slam titles by Sunday and goes on to chase down Federer’s grand slam record, is that he’ll never be as loved as the Swiss:Tik! Tok! Tik! Tok! They’re warming up, so proceedings will commence soon.A crazy stat for you: Thiem is the only active player under the age of 28 to have played in a men’s grand slam final. Djokovic hasn’t dropped a set this fortnight but you’d expect this semi-final to be more competitive than the first. Thiem is such a talent on clay, and is appearing in the last four at Roland Garros for the fourth consecutive year, having finished runner-up to Nadal last year. Thiem has beaten Djokovic at the French Open before, prevailing in straight sets – 7-6, 6-3, 6-0 – two years ago. But that was the 2017 Djokovic, who was injured and suffering a crisis of confidence. This is the 2019 Djokovic, the current holder of three of the four slams who has reacquainted himself with greatness and is chasing his second Novak slam.Here’s Simon Cambers’s match report for you:Nadal wasn’t quite the all-conquering force on clay that we’ve come to expect in the buildup to this tournament, losing three matches on the surface this spring, but he’s showing no signs of relinquishing his French Open crown. Today’s win in the Chatrier dust bowl - perhaps some of the worst conditions seen at Roland Garros – means Federer still hasn’t beaten him here. Only two men have managed that ... and of course one of them is coming up next. Novak Djokovic will be on court shortly against Dominic Thiem.Nadal certainly seems to hope so, as he lavishes praise on his defeated opponent in the on-court interview. Which is en Francais. Merde! But suffice to say Rafa’s happy to be in the final of what he calls the most important tournament of his career.Nadal wallops a forehand winner down the line for 15-0. Federer whacks a tame backhand into the net for 30-0. They’ve put a lot of water on the court to stop the clay from blowing about – but the dirt is flying into Nadal’s face, stopping him from serving. Eventually he does, 30-15. Which soon turns into 40-15, two match points. Federer’s rocket of a return draws the error from Nadal. But it matters not because Federer’s next return sails well long and Nadal is through to his"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bb72c2f4b5bf1d7d18e0a227ce3268a3615a184/0_132_3947_2368/master/3947.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=266a4d2a1ec1952a73cf811ede4b6daa","title":"google walkout organizer claire stapleton resigns","story":"Longtime employee who helped organize global protest alleges Google’s response was designed to ‘have a chilling effect’ on growing workplace activismA prominent internal organizer against Google’s handling of sexual harassment cases has resigned from the company, alleging she was the target of a campaign of retaliation designed to intimidate and dissuade other employees from speaking out about workplace issues.Claire Stapleton, a longtime marketing manager at Google and its subsidiary YouTube, said she decided to leave the company after 12 years when it became clear that her trajectory at the company was “effectively over”.“I made the choice after the heads of my department branded me with a kind of scarlet letter that makes it difficult to do my job or find another one,” she wrote in an email to co-workers announcing her departure on 31 May. “If I stayed, I didn’t just worry that there’d be more public flogging, shunning, and stress, I expected it.”Stapleton was one of the core group of Google employees who sprang into action in October 2018 following a report in the New York Times that Google had paid a $90m severance package to the former executive Andy Rubin despite finding credible an allegation that he had forced a female employee to perform oral sex.The employees organized a “Google Walkout for Change” on 1 November 2018 that drew tens of thousands of participants at Google offices around the globe. Among the group’s demands were an end to forced arbitration in cases of harassment and discrimination, as well as the appointment of an employee representative to the company’s board of directors.Google executives publicly supported the employee activism, and acceded to one of the demands on arbitration.But in April, Stapleton and her fellow organizer Meredith Whittaker spoke out in internal letters about what they said was a “culture of retaliation”.In the letters, Stapleton said that two months after the walkout, she was demoted and “told to go on medical leave” despite not being sick. The demotion was reversed after she hired a lawyer, she said.In a statement, Google said: “We thank Claire for her work at Google and wish her all the best. To reiterate, we don’t tolerate retaliation,” It added: “Our employee relations team did a thorough investigation of her claims and found no evidence of retaliation. They found that Claire’s management team supported her contributions to our workplace, including awarding her their team Culture Award for her role in the Walkout.”Stapleton says the backlash intensified after her allegations spread both internally and in the press. Two managers emailed her entire department to rebut the allegation, she said, a move she claims was “unbelievable” and “truly unprecedented” given company norms around speaking about inidual personnel issues. “In a way it showed me how powerful the organizing has been because it was truly extreme,” she added.Stapleton’s departure comes amid considerable turmoil for Google and YouTube, which are facing increased antitrust scrutiny from the US government, criticism over inconsistent and controversial decisions related to content moderation, and growing activism from employees over issues including the company’s treatment of temps, vendors and contractors (TVCs).Stapleton said that in her view, all these problems were related: “The one very simple thing that connects all these issues is that it requires leadership and real accountability, and that’s not something that we’ve seen in these very challenging, high-stakes times.“You could connect the way that TVCs are treated all the way up to how an Andy Rubin payment happens,” she said. “These are systemic imbalances.”Stapleton said that despite her decision to leave the company, she was optimistic about the future of worker organizing at Google.“I’ve paid a huge personal cost in a way that is not easy to ask anyone else to do,” she said. “There’s a lot of exhaustion and there’s a lot of fear, but I think that speaking up in whatever way people are comfortable with is having an absolutely tremendous impact.”“It’s not going away,” she added.

By  Jessica LoudisJust after midday on Tuesday 12 February, word came down that the verdict was ready in what had been widely described as the trial of the century. “United States of America v Joaquín Guzmán Loera” had lasted approximately three months – it took prosecutors that long to present what they described as “an avalanche” of evidence, which had taken more than a decade to compile. The government called 56 witnesses, the defence called only one: an FBI agent, who finished testifying within an hour.There was little expectation that Guzmán would mount a convincing defence. The diminutive 61-year-old (his nickname, El Chapo, means “shorty” in Spanish) was known around the world as a leader of Mexico’s Sinaloa cartel, and the most high-profile drug kingpin since Pablo Escobar. In addition to smuggling thousands of tonnes of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and synthetic narcotics across the US-Mexico border, he had successfully pulled off two dramatic escapes from prisons in Mexico. He has been the subject of dozens of books, two popular TV series and, in 2009, was included in Forbes magazine’s list of billionaires. The following year, that same magazine named Guzmán one of the world’s most-wanted fugitives, second to only Osama bin Laden. As Guzmán’s lawyers liked to tell anybody who would listen, even before their client set foot in Brooklyn, he had already been convicted in the court of public opinion.When he was captured by Mexican marines on 8 January 2016, Guzmán became the prize feather in the cap of the country’s law enforcement. Barack Obama called Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto to congratulate him on the arrest, and in a move that could be interpreted either as a parting gift to Obama or a peace offering to his successor, Guzmán was extradited to New York on 19 January 2017, a day before Trump took office. Jack Riley, a retired Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) chief who recently published a book about his role in Guzmán’s arrest, told me that in the view of US authorities, catching El Chapo was an important warning to criminals around the world. Regardless of where you are, if you are breaking American laws, “eventually, we’re going to get you”.Americans spend around $109bn on illegal drugs each year, and Bloomberg estimates that the Sinaloa cartel makes at least $11bn in annual sales to the US. But while Mexican cartels regularly appear in the US media, most people are unfamiliar with the circumstances that contributed to their rise. It is not common knowledge that Mexico launched its own war on drugs in the mid-2000s, or that the biggest cartels are sophisticated operations worth billions of dollars. Nor are many people aware that cartels are increasingly responsible for fentanyl, a form of synthetic heroin, entering the US. In an address to the media after the verdict was handed down, US government officials emphasised this point and the role of illegal fentanyl in perpetuating the opioids crisis.While the workings of his business may be a mystery, Americans have heard of El Chapo. By the time he appeared in court in 2018, he was a late-night TV punchline, a symbol of extreme wealth and an escape artist with a talent for leaving law enforcement with their hands empty.At the trial, Guzmán was found guilty of all charges against him, including the most serious – having engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise. He will be sentenced at the end of June, and is almost certain to be jailed for life. His lawyers are seeking a retrial on the basis of jury misconduct, but the chances of that happening are slim.When I was in Mexico City this spring, a month after the verdict, talk of the trial had already died down. Guzmán’s image had mostly disappeared from the magazine covers on display at the news kiosks that dot the streets of the capital. While people could still name the Sinaloa cartel’s leaders and lieutenants, they were more interested in the newer cartels, such as Jalisco Nueva Generación or the local La Unión. Many people didn’t want to discuss El Chapo at all. “Narco fatigue” – the exhaustion that comes with being oversaturated by news and pop culture about the drug trade – had long ago set in. Over the past 13 years, Mexico’s internal war on drugs has dominated the media, resulted in the deaths of over 100,000 people and failed to stop narcotrafficking.Guzmán’s arrest did not magically rid Mexico, or the US, of violence or drugs. Above all, his trial demonstrated how disposable any single person is in the larger machinations of the narco-state. There has never been a clear definition of what exactly constitutes a cartel, and as smaller, more transient gangs replace larger organisations, going after leaders like Guzmán seems increasingly pointless. Rather than reducing the levels of violence and trafficking in Mexico, that approach – the so-called kingpin strategy, employed by Mexico and the US – has enabled new forms of crime to flourish. As Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, Chapo’s longtime partner, said in 2010 in a rare interview with the Mexican news magazine El Proceso, the problem of narcos isn’t going away: “As soon as capos are locked up, killed or extradited, their replacements are already around.”Since the early 1990s, the US has targeted cartels via their leaders. It is a fairly straightforward idea: take out the head of an illegal organisation and the rest will collapse. The approach was developed to bring down the Colombian cartels, and in that case, it had some success. When Pablo Escobar was shot to death by Colombian police in 1993, his cartel went down with him.But even as the structures of organised crime have evolved, US law enforcement has generally stuck to this top-down model. If they are not killing drug lords, they are using the American judicial system to make examples of them. Since 2001, when Mexico’s supreme court agreed to allow the extradition of criminals so long as they would not face the death penalty or life in prison (this ruling was amended four years later to permit life sentences), dozens of narcotraffickers have been extradited to the US, including members of the Tijuana, Beltrán-Leyva, Sinaloa and Los Zetas cartels. If Guzmán ends up in the supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, as he is expected to, he will share the facility with former Gulf cartel leader Osiel Cárdenas Guillén.While Sinaloa has historically been, and still remains, Mexico’s most powerful cartel, the world it came up in no longer exists. Between the early 90s and the mid-2000s, the Sinaloa, Tijuana, Juárez and Gulf organisations were mini-monopolies, with borders that more or less stayed the same. Then, with the start of Mexico’s drug war in 2006, that arrangement started to fall apart. As Mexican and American authorities took out cartel leaders, groups fractured and new ones emerged. Previously, the Zetas, whose leaders came from the special forces of the Mexican army, had been a mercenary group in the employ of the Gulf cartel. Now they became an autonomous organisation. Jalisco Nueva Generación, which had been linked to Sinaloa, morphed into one of Mexico’s most ferocious cartels. Splinter groups and gangs that had originated in prisons or as local militias began to gain power.This fragmentation altered the way cartels do business. To distinguish themselves in a crowded field, the new groups pioneered the use of sadistic, headline-grabbing violence. They also ersified. Whereas an old-school cartel might have once only sold drugs, the upstarts are expanding into different forms of crime. The Zetas are notorious for stealing petrol from nationalised pipelines and selling it on the black market – a business that Sinaloa previously dominated, as journalist Ana Lilia Peréz documented in her book El Cartel Negro. The Santa Rosa de Lima cartel also specialises in petrol theft, known nationally as huachicol. Protection rackets are common. And cartels are kidnapping and extorting migrants on their way to the US border. In 2010, the bodies of 72 Central American migrants were found on a ranch in the north-eastern state of Tamaulipas. According to the lone survivor of the massacre, an 18-year-old Ecuadorian, the Zetas murdered the group when they refused to either pay for their freedom or serve as cartel hitmen.At the same time, older cartels are expanding and decentralising. According to law and economics scholar Edgardo Buscaglia, Sinaloa has a presence in 54 countries and Jalisco Nueva Generación, one of Mexico’s fastest growing cartels, is said to have branched out throughout the Americas. Maintaining such operations requires a vast and erse network of legal fronts and elaborate systems of money-laundering. To illustrate this point, the journalist Diego Osorno recently noted that the most popular brand of milk in Sinaloa is made by a company owned by Guzmán’s colleague El Mayo. The Sinaloa cartel operates on such a large scale – connecting manufacturers and distributors, bankers and businesses and extracting money at each step – that there is no longer a single face of the organisation. Buscaglia told me that that if I wanted to see the “sophisticated” side of the Sinaloa cartel, I should visit a particular gated community in Argentina. I wouldn’t find any gangsters flashing guns, he clarified, only the wealthy managers of the cartel’s legal operations in that country.This fragmentation also means that cartels and low-level gangs are harder to police and prosecute. Paradoxically, there are also more mini-kingpins to capture. And once they are in the US, narcotraffickers can cut plea deals and help prosecutors capture their former bosses and colleagues. Captured Mexican narcos generally have few qualms about cooperating. A good outcome might mean a radically reduced sentence and half their fortune waiting for them on release. An even better outcome might resemble that of Andrés López López, one of the former leaders of Colombia’s Norte del Valle cartel. In 2006, López had an 11-year sentence knocked down to 20 months after working with authorities. Now based in Miami, he has written three books about trafficking, one of which was adapted into a wildly successful TV show in Latin America. His most recent book, which was also optioned for television, is a biography of El Chapo.I first went to the Guzmán trial in early December, and began to go more frequently as a broader picture of cartel operations came into focus. In building the case, prosecutors approached it like a classic mafia roll-up, offering leniency to each captured narco and gradually working their way up the chain until they reached Guzmán. As Miami defence attorney Joaquin Perez, who has represented many extradited narcotraffickers, told me, it was a “significant effort for a fait accompli”.It also made for good theatre. There were accounts of diamond-encrusted guns and cocaine stash houses in fancy Brooklyn neighbourhoods, million-dollar smuggling submarines capable of evading police radars and elaborate schemes to outwit US law enforcement. Week after week, witnesses described in intricate detail the inner workings of la oficina (the internal nickname for the cartel): its lavish displays of violence and wealth, its complex transportation networks and how Mexican authorities were systematically paid off. In search of material, screenwriters and actors showed up at the trial.Tabloid headlines advertised the “wacky world” of the trial, and newspapers ran lists of its most bizarre disclosures. By the time the prosecution rested after 11 weeks of testimony, jurors had heard from Juan Carlos Ramírez Abadía, AKA “Chupeta” (lollipop), a formerly handsome Colombian kingpin who had undergone such extensive plastic surgery to stay in hiding that his face looked like a rubber Halloween mask Jorge and Alex Cifuentes-Villa, brothers and Colombian career criminals who had worked closely with Guzmán and Lucero Guadalupe Sánchez López, Guzmán’s mistress and one-time accomplice. Jorge Cifuentes-Villa described attempting to kill a man with a poisoned sandwich, and Alex told the jury that Guzmán had allegedly boasted about bribing former president Peña Nieto for $100m. (Peña Nieto’s former chief of staff described this claim as “false, defamatory and absurd”.)Yet to many of the seasoned narco corresponsales, the trial offered few newsworthy revelations. “Everything that was astonishing to American audiences was not to Mexicans,” said David Brooks, the US correspondent for the progressive Mexican newspaper La Jornada. Mexican readers were no longer scandalised by accounts of extreme wealth or violence. Besides sex and infidelity, which were of universal interest, Brooks told me that the stories that landed with his readers were ones that named names, confirming that long-suspected officials had taken bribes or worked both sides of the table.The more I spoke with the Mexican journalists, the more I became aware of the underlying issues going unaddressed in the courtroom. There were few mentions of the consequences of the war on drugs, which had led to the deaths of thousands of Mexicans. And because it was being held in the US, some saw the case as a finger in the eye of Mexican sovereignty, a serious injury to national pride. (There was some irritation over the fact that Guzmán was being tried, as several journalists grumbled, in a court where the judge couldn’t properly pronounce his name.)At the same time, nobody seemed to think the trial should have been held in Mexico, where the police and judicial systems were too weak to guarantee that Guzmán wouldn’t escape jail for a third time. Again and again, I spoke with journalists and academics who described corruption in Mexico as something like a tide, a force that grew steadily and drew everything towards it. Police were underpaid, crime was lucrative and the government was compromised by the cartels. Political corruption, usually through campaign contributions or by laundering money through public procurement projects, is standard. When I asked people in Mexico City about the enthusiasm surrounding the new president Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who took office in December 2018, I often heard that his willingness to take on corruption was his main selling point.The basic problem in Mexico, Buscaglia told me, is that nobody is policing the courts. Mexico doesn’t audit judges or prosecutors, and lacks independent monitoring agencies. Despite recent reforms to the criminal justice system, Buscaglia does not think that Mexico currently has the capacity or political will to execute major organised crime cases like Italy did with its famous “Maxi trial” in the late 1980s. There, Sicilian prosecutors indicted 475 mafiosi over a six-year period. That, he added, indicates the most significant difference between Mexico and Italy: organised crime didn’t infiltrate the Mexican state – it helped shape it. “Politics in Mexico,” Buscaglia likes to tell people, “is the most sophisticated form of organised crime.”Did the state shape the cartels, or was it the other way around? The standard narrative is that the cartels infiltrated the state, blurring the lines between police, politicians and traffickers. Others contend that government authorities exaggerated the power of the cartels in order to blame them for their own transgressions. It is possible some version of each is true. Either way, there is no single force in control.There has never been a hard ide between the state and traffickers in Mexico. In the 1920s, farmers began growing poppy to meet US demand for opium, and after the second world war, representatives of what would become Mexico’s Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) were rumoured to have made handshake deals with smugglers, allowing them to export illicit crops across the border in exchange for a cut of the profits. The PRI was the de facto government for most of the 20th century – the novelist Mario Vargas Llosa once called Mexico under the PRI “the perfect dictatorship” – and during its tenure, politicians generally took a lax attitude towards the drug trade, regarding drugs as more of a health issue than a criminal one.By the 1980s, narcos had solidified their power by vying up trafficking routes and letting groups run their own territories. At the time cocaine trafficking was starting to become big business in Mexico. When the US DEA began targeting Colombian cocaine distribution routes between the Caribbean and Miami, the cartels had found an alternative in the Mexican “trampoline”. Traffickers started moving shipments across the porous US-Mexico border, and American officials redirected their attention to Mexico. From 1985 onwards, US operations in Mexico became more aggressive, following the kidnap, torture and murder of a DEA agent by the Guadalajara cartel. With the cold war receding, drugs replaced communism as the enemy No 1 of the American people.The Americans did not find the Mexican authorities the most co-operative of partners in the “war on drugs”. By the 80s and 90s, writes the sociologist Luis Alejandro Astorga Almanza, “it was practically impossible for society to ignore the unbreakable links between police and traffickers”. Particularly in states such as Tamaulipas, cops would moonlight as traffickers – and traffickers as cops – with the tacit blessing of local authorities and elites. “Various governmental structures seem to have been born captured by the illicit interests of their own creators,” writes Carlos Antonio Flores Peréz, a social anthropologist who studies the institutional protection of the drug trade. US army intelligence cables from the 80s and early 90s reveal that American officials were fully aware that all over Mexico, officials, politicians and state and federal police were in on the take.In April 1989, Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo, the former police officer who founded the infamous Guadalajara cartel, was arrested, but like Escobar, he continued to run his cartel from prison. That year, his most powerful lieutenants – one of whom was a young Guzmán – assembled in Acapulco and were each assigned a territory. El Chapo and El Mayo took the Pacific coast. This kingmaker moment ushered in a new era, and preceded yet another big shift. Instead of continuing to accept cash from weakened Colombian suppliers, Mexican narcos began demanding payment in cocaine so they could go into business on their own. Before long, they went from being couriers to distributors, which was far more profitable, and overtook their former employers as the world’s biggest traffickers.While agreements between cartels and Mexican authorities had previously kept violence between the two at bay, by the late 80s these relationships were strained. With the US putting more pressure on the Mexican government to target traffickers, the old arrangements dissolved. Under these new circumstances, violence became common among gangs, writes Sinaloan historian Froylán Enciso, and “a way of confronting the government”.Still, it rarely spilled into public view. So the country was stunned when in May 1993, a Mexican cardinal was killed in a shootout between the Tijuana and Sinaloa cartels at Guadalajara airport. Although it was later discovered that Tijuana sicarios had mistaken the cardinal’s car for Guzmán’s – they were retaliating for a Sinaloa attack that killed nine Tijuana members – he was initially blamed. A nationwide manhunt was called, and with Guzmán splashed all over the papers, he became a household name in Mexico.In June 1993, he was captured in Guatemala, extradited to Mexico and later sentenced to 20 years in jail for drug trafficking and murder. But for the next eight years, until he escaped in 2001 – allegedly hidden in a laundry cart pushed by a guard – Guzmán, like Félix Gallardo before him, continued to run his business from jail without any difficulties.While this pattern played out across the US, Sinaloa’s power and logistical strength were concentrated in Chicago, the main hub from which they distributed drugs around the country. Cartel operations were so well organised, said Riley, that “you could hit a house with 50 kilos of heroin in it, and two doors down you could hit a house with $5m in it, and neither of the people running the houses even knew the other existed”.Calderón’s announcement initiated what would become one of the deadliest periods in Mexican history. With billions in funding from the US, Calderón pursued his own version of the kingpin strategy, deploying the military to fight cartels and targeting their leaders. During his six-year tenure, 25 of Mexico’s “most wanted” – two-thirds of the entire list – were arrested or killed. As cartels pushed back, extortion and kidnappings spiked, and the number of homicides reached an average of 20,000 a year. “In this new atmosphere of fear,” wrote novelist Juan Villoro in an essay about the era, “10,000 companies offer security services and 3,000 people have had chips inserted under their skin so they can be located if they’re kidnapped”.Despite this violence, Sinaloa seemed to receive less attention from the authorities than other cartels. An investigation by the US broadcaster National Public Radio (NPR) reported that between December 2006 and May 2010, Sinaloa members were arrested at significantly lower rates than those of rival groups. A congressman from Sinaloa also told NPR that the government “has been fighting organised crime in many parts of the republic, but has not touched Sinaloa”. Explanations for this varied from low-level corruption in the armed forces to more elaborate conspiracies involving the government – accusations that Calderón told reporters were “totally unfounded”, naming various Sinaloa members that the government had arrested.In the next general election, in 2012, the PRI retook power and Peña Nieto became president. Although his administration retreated from the kingpin strategy, in 2014, more than a decade after he had first escaped from prison, Guzmán was recaptured and sent to the maximum-security Altiplano Ffederal prison. The following year, he escaped once again, before he was recaptured for the final time in 2016. “Mission complete,” tweeted Peña Nieto.Drug trafficking and cartel violence affect both the US and Mexico, but when it comes to addressing them, the US government has typically strongarmed Mexico into following its lead. Long before the overt bullying of the Trump administration, American officials were known to pay little heed to Mexican sovereignty. Yet even when US violations of that sovereignty pertained to the trial, they were rarely discussed in court.Even in less dramatic instances, the “business as usual” of international law enforcement is fraught. Writing for El Proceso, J Jesús Esquivel described the Guzmán trial as having exposed “betrayals, corruption, lies and regular violations of Mexican sovereignty by DEA agents”. Esquivel also zeroed in on cooperating witness deals that the justice department offered to certain traffickers, including Vicente Zambada Niebla, the son of El Mayo and Sinaloa’s heir apparent. “El Vicentillo” was one of the trial’s most anticipated witnesses. He was flown in from Chicago, where he had yet to be sentenced on his own trafficking charges, and took the stand in dark blue prison clothes. In a five-hour testimony that the New York Times described as a spectacular betrayal of his father and birthright, Zambada Niebla gave a detailed insider account of cartel workings, describing how the organisation spent at least $1m a month on bribes to police and politicians, and detailing a failed plot to use a government petrol tanker to transport South American cocaine to Mexico.For taking the stand against his “compadre”, as he politely referred to Guzmán, the 44-year-old was promised a shorter sentence and a possible path to US citizenship. Others were given similar offers. The Cifuentes brothers, who sent tonnes of drugs to cities all over the US, may serve less than 15 years for their cooperation. Even Chupeta, the Colombian trafficker who confessed to having ordered the killings of 150 people – and to having personally shot one man in the face – may be free in 10-15 years for his testimony.In his plea agreement, Zambada Niebla also agreed to forfeit $1.37bn (yes, billion) to the US government, although it is highly unlikely any money will actually change hands. Since narcos don’t purchase property or open bank accounts in their own names, it can be difficult to locate assets, and if the money is in Mexico, US authorities rarely bother to track it down. Of course, there is no public information about how many narcos are in witness protection, or whether those living under assumed identities have managed to recoup some of their former fortunes. But it is not far-fetched to assume this could happen: on 30 May, a federal judge in Chicago sentenced Vicentillo to 15 years in prison. With time served, this leaves him with five years to go, which may be further reduced for good behaviour.Outside the courtroom, away from the trial, the US-Mexico relationship is also defined by a kind of mutual obliviousness on the part of each country’s citizens. David Brooks, the Jornada reporter, told me there is still “mass ignorance about what’s happening next door”. In Mexico, he observed, Trump coming to power “reinforced every stereotype of America for the past hundred years”. At the same time, while there are 35 million Mexicans in the US, Americans are generally ignorant of what’s happening below the border. One thing that has gone notably unnoticed, according to Brooks, is the victory of left populist López Obrador. Since he took office in December 2018, Mexico has entered “a moment of potential transformation”, which, if the new president follows through on his promises, could reshape the way Mexico deals with drug trafficking.A month after the verdict, I met journalist Ioan Grillo in the middle-class area of Roma in Mexico City, several blocks from the house where Alfonso Cuarón had shot his Oscar-winning film, and next to a Sinaloan seafood restaurant. Grillo had recently written an opinion piece rejecting the idea that Guzmán’s conviction was a victory in the war on drugs. “To bring a real sense of justice, you’d need something like a war crimes tribunal,” he observed. Grillo was building on a point that had been made repeatedly by members of the Mexican press at the trial – the case did not seem not to acknowledge how the war on drugs led to thousands of deaths and profoundly altered Mexican society.There were mixed feelings in Mexico, Grillo added – not about whether Guzmán should go to jail, but about what justice should look like, what closure his conviction could offer and what the whole trial ultimately meant. This was the biggest trial in a drug war that has lasted more than a decade, and it didn’t even take place in Mexico. No actionable evidence against any officials had emerged, and Grillo said most Mexicans were not particularly surprised to hear any of the corruption allegations that the case brought to the surface.It is clear the public wants reform, but the question is whether López Obrador will be able to do anything about the corruption that has for so long hobbled the state, including parts of his own administration. Three days after Guzmán’s sentencing, López Obrador visited Badiraguato, the kingpin’s hometown. Guzmán is by no means a popular figure in Mexico, but in Sinaloa, one of the country’s most dangerous regions, T-shirts with his face on them are sold in markets and he is widely regarded as a local hero. In a state where the federal government is largely absent, El Chapo is credited (without any evidence) with building roads and providing social services. After he was apprehended for the second time in 2014, hundreds of people turned out to demand his release. During his visit, López Obrador promised jobs to the town’s young people and vowed to make sure that they would not be obliged “to take antisocial paths”. That was four months ago. The jobs haven’t yet materialised, but it was the first time residents could recall a president visiting the region.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1c7699c19e52d4544c5552f7fd72b418611762b/0_350_5314_3189/master/5314.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e59ba60d585ba239de5c2af0f694d9f2","title":"i feel hopeful new zealanders cautiously welcome wellbeing budget","story":"Praise for spending on mental health and child wellbeing is tempered with concerns that the economic plan fails to address root causes of inequalityPensioner Garry Harvey lived in Australia for decades before returning home to a tidy council flat in South Dunedin earlier this year. The socio-economically deprived suburb at the bottom of New Zealand’s South Island is in the crosshairs of the nation’s first-ever “wellbeing budget”, a radical economic plan for the country devised by Jacinda Ardern to improve the lives of the poorest citizens.For the first time the annual budget puts social wellbeing indicators ahead of GDP when it comes to spending decisions. From now on, the health of New Zealand will not be measured by growth alone, but instead by the overall wellbeing and prosperity of its nearly 5 million people.It is a tall order. New Zealand has the highest youth suicide rate in the OECD, the fourth highest rate of family violence and diseases of poverty seen no-where else in the developed world.Harvey, 67, a gruff but loquacious former seaman, hopes the wellbeing budget will transform his suburb, where many locals battle mental health issues and crime is prevalent. He returned to New Zealand from Australia because of rising racism, and says his native country is now more “equitable” than its neighbour across the Tasman Sea.“It was a good start, because you can’t get all your Christmas crackers in one day,” he says.When finance minister Grant Robertson announced the budget last week he said it would make New Zealand “both a great place to make a living, and a great place to make a life.” Vicky Freeman, 40, who appeared on the front of the budget document with her daughter Ruby-Jean, says the priorities of the budget are “solid” a record NZ$1.9bn for mental health, NZ$1bn for child wellness, and a record NZ$320m to combat domestic and family violence.Despite gracing the cover of the budget, Freeman and her daughter no longer live in New Zealand, having relocated to Australia in December after the high-cost of living in the country’s largest city of Auckland proved too much.“We do need help for people that are mentally ill and committing suicide. We need to help the children, we need to bring up Kiwi children better. I really hope this makes a difference in people’s lives. I hope they’re not just saying stuff and won’t follow through,” Freeman says.But the praise has not been universal. At Child Poverty Action Group, which campaigns on behalf of more than a quarter of New Zealand children who live in income poverty, there was disappointment.Spokeswoman Jeni Cartwright described the budget’s mental health focus as “an ambulance at the bottom of the cliff” that instead of tackling entrenched poverty issues in New Zealand, it was throwing money at the end result of long-term, inter-generational deprivation.“We were looking for significant improvement to people’s incomes, and we didn’t see that,” says Cartwright.While Harvey remains “hopeful” about the government’s commitment to helping the country’s most vulnerable people, he remains concerned that structural change – such as the introduction of a capital gains tax – have been ruled out by Ardern.“I agree with putting money into a wellbeing budget but they are periphery things,” says Harvey. “This country is run by the rich to exploit the poor and lets face it, and say it, and plan for it.”Robertson admits inter-generational transformation will take decades, but the building blocks of changing New Zealanders lives from the bottom up have now been put in place.“Our North Star is now reflective of a broader set of values,” he says.“The answer, in my view, is that the government wasn’t sufficiently valuing those things … if it wasn’t being valued it wasn’t being measured. And if it wasn’t being measured it wasn’t being done.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c14ecec7877b815a76502c7a7401a7d86f3bfd9d/0_156_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eaa1155f965d3eafa6362edf12a2607a","title":"rome clamps down on tourists uncouth behaviour","story":"Messy eating near monuments and singing on public transport are also banned by new rulesDressed as a gladiator, Remi Sanz, a visitor from Spain, was unaware that his outfit might land him in trouble as he hung around Rome’s famous Trevi Fountain on Friday morning.Authorities in the Italian capital have now enforced a slew of rules, updated from legislation drafted in 1946, as they seek to clamp down on uncouth behaviour that has long been a source of frustration. One of the measures is a permanent ban on modern-day centurions – men who dress up in tunics and leather breastplates, wielding plastic swords – and make money by posing for photos.Sanz is not a centurion – he is in Rome with a group of friends for his stag do – but he might be mistaken for one.“We just dressed up like this for fun,” he said. “So long as I don’t make a disturbance, I guess I’ll be OK. The bad thing would be to get drunk while dressed like this. I can understand such rules and I’m glad to know about them now.”But it wasn’t just Sanz. The Trevi Fountain area was full of people unwittingly committing transgressions, particularly those flouting the ban on “messy” eating near monuments.“This is against the law now?” asked Giuseppe, a visitor from central Italy, as he tucked into pizza while standing by a church opposite the fountain. “I didn’t know, but I think it’s a good thing. They have a similar law in Venice. You shouldn’t be eating by monuments and making a mess.”Clara Jankovitch, a tourist from Hungary, was perched on the steps of the church enjoying an ice-cream.“I can understand pizza and sandwiches, but surely an ice-cream is OK? Look around, everyone is eating one,” she said.It is unclear whether people will be served a penalty for such infractions or simply get a ticking off from the tourist police patrolling historic sites, but Rome authorities have promised “severe fines” for those caught taking a dip in the city’s fountains – a frequent occurrence during the summer.Other rules include bans on wheeled suitcases and buggies being dragged down historic staircases, walking around bare-chested, and pub crawls. The authorities are also taking aim at “nuisance drunks” or people who sing on public transport, as well as those who wrap their mouths around the nozzles of the city’s drinking fountains. Illegal street trading and ticket touting outside tourist sights have also been banned, as has the Roman custom of hanging laundry out to dry between neighbouring buildings.“Old regulations have been updated to adapt to the needs of a modern society,” said Marco Cardilli, deputy chief of staff and security delegate at Rome’s council."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43d3534461ed6f84420cbf3bbe91c0125ffc19a9/0_416_5376_3226/master/5376.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00f70e8f849554e59d7e3386646d5656","title":"d day landings remembered on 75th anniversary in pictures","story":"Veterans and world leaders have attended ceremonies to mark 75 years since allied troops landed in France during the second world war"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3918599.1559931058!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hundreds of parents sign petition urging return to books","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tParents  sign a petition to review Ratoath College’s iPad-only policy, organised by a group of concerned parents, at the village supermarket. Photograph: Dave Meehan Parents campaigning against an iPads-only policy at a Co Meath secondary school says hundreds have signed a petition calling for a return to schoolbooks.Ratoath College, which does not use printed books for junior cycle students, has advised parents to buy iPads – at a cost of €500 or more – for their children ahead of the new school year.However, dozens of parents attending a meeting this week said their children’s education had been harmed by spending too much time on screens since the policy was introduced in recent years.Many of those who are refusing to purchase new iPads have been told they face late payment fees of €50 by a third-party technology provider.The petition is due to be handed to the school’s management body, Louth-Meath Education and Training Board (LMETB), on Monday morning.The board’s chief executive is due to meet the school principal and senior officials to respond to the matter next week.The row has turned a spotlight on the role of technology in education at a time when some schools are embracing the use of digital devices, while others are restricting their use.While there are no official figures on how many schoolchildren are using devices for learning, Wriggle – one of the largest firms supplying iPads to schools – manages up to 40,000 devices for students in more than 100 secondary schools.The Department of Education’s digital learning strategy advocates greater use of technology.However, a department spokesman said use of devices was a decision for inidual school boards of management.The principal of the school, Oonagh Prendergast, declined to comment when contacted on Friday.In a previous statement, she said she appreciated that the changes were raising concerns for some parents.However, she said the school was seeking to meet the needs of students emerging into a rapidly changing world and that “21st century skills” such as collaboration, creativity, critical thinking and problem-solving “cannot be taught from a textbook”.ComplaintsA meeting of about 100 concerned parents this week heard numerous claims that children using the devices were more distracted and had no access to ebooks for certain subjects.Others were critical of the quality of course content available on the devices and said their children found it more difficult to retain information or take notes using devices.The group, which has gathered more than 200 parents’ signatures at the meeting and at the local Supervalu, calls for parents to be allowed to purchase books instead of iPads.It also says that where iPads are used in class, it should be under the supervision of teachers. Mr Byrne said that while he was not directly involved in the campaign, he was satisfied there was a substantial number of parents with genuine concerns and requested that the penalty charge for late iPad purchase be suspended.“I think we need to research this in more detail. There are genuine concerns and I will be looking to have these issues examined by the Oireachtas education committee, so we can hear from educators and experts on this matter,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3918118.1559910315!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leaving cert geography brexit features in paper with no surprises","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe impact of Brexit on Ireland and the EU featured in today’s Leaving Cert higher level  geography exam. Photograph: iStockThere was a strong emphasis on environmental issues in this year’s Leaving Cert higher level paper and many of students’ favourite topics cropped up.Michael Doran, a geography teacher at the Institute of Education in Dublin, said it was an “excellent” paper.“There were a few nice twists on old questions and it was great to see the subject is emphasising environmental challenges and issues,” he said.Luke Saunders, a geography teacher at Jesus and Mary Secondary School, Enniscrone, Co Sligo, said that there were no surprises on a paper that will have put students at ease. “All three options in the physical geography section had had no surprises for any student who had looked at previous years papers,” said Mr Saunders, founder of Studyclix.ie.He said section three - the optional section of the paper - required students to write a longer essay which carries 80 marks. “Today’s paper, particularly the geoecology option, would have had questions that most students would be well prepared for.”There was a very good mix of short questions, said Mr Doran. “Question four on isostatic processes might have challenged some students, but overall the questions in this section were very fair.”Good mixIn the physical geography section, there was also a good mix of topics. “Plate tectonics appeared in two essay questions. Environmental issues appeared in 2C, with a nice question on how human activity impacts on surface processes.”He said the regional geography questions were very approachable. “Regional geography is a very broad section and a lot of students can feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of topics to be covered. “However, there was a superb selection of fair questions here. Question 4C, on how borders affect different cultural groups, and Question 5C on population distribution across the European region, were interesting and contemporary themes to explore.”In the electives section, students will have liked a question on EU policy in Ireland, Mr Doran said. “Environmental issues featured again, in Question 8C, with a nice question on renewable energy. For the first time in years, a question on multinational corporations did not appear in the economic elective. “A nice question on the global economy did appear, however, which would have tested students to use this information in a different way.Excellent choiceHe added that there was excellent choice in the human elective, with some questions on changing land use in cites, migration and overpopulation.Students were also asked questions on how Brexit might impact on Ireland and the European Union. “Overall there was nothing in today’s higher geography paper that would throw any student who had familiarised themselves with previous years papers,” said Mr Saunders. “Students had plenty of choice in all sections any reports I have heard back from students are resoundingly positive.”Try this at home:Examine the impact of colonialism on a developing economy that you have studied.

Photograph: iStockHigher level maths students faced an algebra-dominated paper which was much fairer, shorter and easier than in their mock exams, according to teachers.As with last year, students may have been surprised that financial maths did not appear on paper one, said Aidan Roantree, senior maths teacher at the Institute of Education.“Don’t put away your financial maths notes just yet,” warned Mr Roantree.A large number of questions in both sections required different elements of algebra, he said.“This is not to say that calculus, both differentiation and integration, complex numbers and sequences \u0026amp series were absent. They were there, all right, but not in any dominant way.”He said that many of the section A questions were very well thought-out and quite clever and some managed to range over three topics in the one question.“The section B questions were fair and manageable. Although one required the solutions of a number of slightly awkward trig equations, question nine involved the much-anticipated practical max and min questions.”PleasedOverall, students will have been pleased with the exam, said Mr Roantree. “While some of the more tricky elements of the course were examined, these would only have accounted for a relatively small number of marks - and most of them had been well flagged,” he said.Eamonn Toland, founder of TheMathsTutor.ie, said that overall, the accessibility of section A balanced out some challenging parts in Section B.Some of the scenarios students faces included air conditioning, fractals and Norman architecture.“The concepts and skills section was quite straightforward for higher level. The only slight twist in this section was the appearance of mean and median in an question on algebra, which might have been a little surprising at first., he said.In the contexts and applications section, the examiner continued a trend of borrowing some concepts from advanced third level maths to create a question.“This year they used the Cantor set which is a famous example of a fractal. The description of the question is quite difficult and may have caused problems for some students.“Good students had a chance to show their stuff on the question on the Cantor set,” he said.The question on calculus in this section was pretty straightforward, although part (iii), he said, was not clearly stated.AccessibleJean Kelly, a maths teacher at the Institute of Education, said that the ordinary level paper was nice and clear with accessible language.“Algebra, financial maths, and functions \u0026amp graphs all appeared heavily on the paper. The last question, question nine, may have thrown some of the weaker students, but the income tax question was straightforward and the question on algebra was completely expected. A question on the trapezoidal rule involved a bit of measuring and may have surprised some students, as area and volume normally appear on paper two.”Of the longer questions, some weaker students may have been thrown by a financial maths question. “This was a little more challenging and thought provoking, but again, the language used was nice and easy to understand,” she said.Record numbers of students continue to study higher-level maths, with 21,024 of 56,028 (37.5 per cent) students taking the paper."},{"url":null,"title":"a baby born today the climate and their future","story":"Life-support systems that nature provides – an intertwined web that sustains humans, plants and animals – are at risk of unravelling in a matter of decades.Deforestation, intensive agriculture, overfishing, development and other human activities are breaking the bonds that combine to make a healthy planet. Their destruction, fuelled by rampant consumption and obsession with economic growth, is accelerating.“The evidence is crystal clear: nature is in trouble. Therefore we are in trouble,” declared Sandra Díaz, who co-chaired the completion of a global assessment of bioersity published this week.There is a dual threat to life on Earth: species loss and climate change. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ranked the main factors causing species loss: changes in land and sea use exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species.These are “eroding the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”, and climate breakdown could soon become the main driver.Nature is being destroyed at such a rate that a million species are at risk. On the day the IPBES report made headlines, Dr Allan Mee of the Golden Eagle Trust checked for sightings of the Ring Ouzel in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in Co Kerry, one of just two of its remaining habitats in Ireland. “No birds located. Sad but likely witnessing local extinction of the species, once found in 28 Irish counties,” he tweeted. Pádraic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust replied: “This is mass extinction unfolding before our eyes.”How is the potentially lethal cocktail of bioersity loss and climate disruption going to impact on coming generations in contrasting parts of the globe? Equally, what does it mean for an animal that dominates the Irish landscape (the cow), and the majestic lion, not critically endangered yet rapidly disappearing?The baby born in IrelandConscious of what the next generation is facing, Australian Jim Scheer helped set up the FridaysForFuture climate action movement in Ireland, which is driven by young people. As for the babies of today, “their freedom is limited”, he believes. As a child, “the most I had to worry about was, ‘is there air in the tyres of my bike?’” he says.They are facing a whole different world of realities, a place where the First World problem of “where will I go on my holidays?” may be replaced by “where is my next meal coming from?”The issues weigh heavily on the current generation of young people, he believes, which is why “coming together to grieve” – a feature of recent protests – matters, and is part of telling the truth. There is much frustration too at the inaction of elders.“Uncertain” is the future of that child, says climate activist Dr Lorna Gold. Hope is emerging through the climate movement but, looking at the timelines required for transformational shift, there is “more and more uncertainty”.Children growing up in Ireland will be relatively protected, by location, wealth and assets they will have access to, “but even in the best-case scenario, it will be a diminished world.”This will be due to loss of species and a more complicated world, disrupted by climate and associated conflict, where Dr Gold fears the freedom to explore and travel in relative peace is undermined. It’s a place of learning from the internet rather than real life. The pluses will be better local connectedness with “their own earth” and nearby food production.That Irish child will never hear the corncrake or the curlew, says climatologist Prof John Sweeney, and, as they grow, they will be confronted with hard choices on lifestyle and mobility. The fossil fuel-driven car will be forced out by regulation, he says, but different ways of getting off the island, for example, will be needed if aviation does not overcome its emissions issues.By mid-century, most will live in green cities with an almost total absence of the private car. The transport revolution will be in urban areas but slower to come to the countryside until battery technology improves, Sweeney notes.A near zero-carbon world will mean less air pollution. Clean energy in their home and workplace will mainly come from offshore wind.A downside will be more extreme weather events attributable to climate change more intense storms and rainfall, increased flooding with sea level rises – and yet water shortages in summer.The child born today in Ireland – and the adult they become – will cope far better than their counterpart elsewhere.The developing world babyA baby born today in a developing country, on the other hand, will be at the frontline of climate disruption, says Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins. They will have to contend with stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer heatwaves.“Here in Ireland we will have the resources and ability to adapt and deal with these unprecedented weather events, but in many parts of the world, going to Tesco to stock up on sliced pan won’t be a possibility.”They will be the ones who will suffer the worst consequences of our inaction on climate change. “Sustained periods of unseasonably heavy rain can have a damaging impact on agriculture, causing the loss of topsoil and serious nutrient leaching,” says Higgins.In Ireland, save for the odd hosepipe ban, water is always on tap for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. “But in the developing world, where most people depend on agriculture to earn a living or just stay alive, it’s a scarce and precious resource.”Those living in coastal regions will suffer a loss of coral reefs, which half a billion people rely on for fish. For those born among indigenous communities in tropical rainforests, not only will they lose their homeland – already being eroded by increasing industrialisation – but there will be loss of habitat that acts as the lungs of the earth and regulates rainfall.Children will be most susceptible to the increasing diseases that a changing climate will leave in its wake, she adds. Their education may be disrupted when schools are used as shelters when disaster hits their communities.If temperatures increase in already hot areas, it will diminish scarce resources to sustain life and will force many to become refugees.But this may “dwarf numbers caused by conflict or political and economic necessity. When their land becomes uninhabitable because of drought, flood or sea-level rise, they will have to seek a safer place to live,” Higgins predicts.It may be a world where techniques such as conservation agriculture transform crop production and smartphone technology helps drive rural economies backed by deployment of cheap solar PV. But extreme weather events will continue to threaten food production, as seen with recent cyclones in southern Africa.Gold fears a business-as-usual approach means such circumstances can become an intractable problem very quickly, and says solutions are beyond most communities on cost grounds. Therefore the child is facing increased malnutrition, chronic hunger, dependency on external aid, and political instability – an existence marked by inequality and injustice.The IPBES report starkly outlines how indigenous peoples and the poorest are most reliant on land and sea for survival. The combination of land grabs by multinationals facilitated by corrupt governments, extreme climate events and bioersity loss add up to a very bleak future for their offspring, Gold concludes.The future of the cow Humans are not the only beings whose lives will change. The IPBES report emphasises that the effects will be felt first among animals and other living things.In Ireland, there are currently more cattle than people, and they are the most common large animal. For many, the cow (for beef and milk) is the bellwether of Irish agriculture and rural life. For others, it’s the problem because of associated carbon emissions.Teagasc’s head of communications, Eric Donald, says cattle numbers are currently a matter for inidual farmers. With no quotas, no policy instruments are in place. In future we are likely to have fewer beef and more dairy cattle.On emissions, Donald says there is wide acceptance of the need to implement mitigation measures – a process is already in train.Having a grass-based system to feed those cattle will be critical to sustainable farms from an environmental, economic and social perspective, Donald adds. Ireland will need to find export markets for 80 to 90 per cent of its product. Meat consumption may decrease on an inidual basis and there may be a shift to plant-based diets, but increased population growth will mean “demand won’t drop significantly”.But cattle will have to compete for space due to a more erse range of crops, land being used for bioenergy and afforestation (increasingly native woodlands and not just on marginal land) that will act as important carbon sinks, and hedgerows ensuring better bioersity and pollinator capacity.To question beef consumption may currently be an Irish “no-no”, but the reality is the consumers of tomorrow will be confronted by a wide range of new plant and synthetic proteins that will taste surprisingly good and be cheaper, which is likely to mean less red meat is consumed – in line with health guidelines.Eric Donald defends the pursuit of higher genetic quality as a means of increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, especially “because lifetime productivity is better”. With extending grazing seasons, it’s the key measure in improving farm sustainability guidelines. It also complements changes in fertiliser use and slurry management.But John Sweeney says the Irish cow is “reaching limits in terms of genetics”. Like pedigree dogs, they are less able to cope with change and stress compared with native species.Unquestionably, there will be fewer of them, he believes, “if we want to maintain bioersity for future generations”.Expansion in the cattle population has coincided with deterioration in water quality, with widespread glyphosate contamination (one study has found 20 per cent of Irish adults have traces of the herbicide in their urine), nitrates pollution and an emerging ammonia problem.“Continued expansion of the national herd is not compatible with this report. That’s where the crux comes.”The future of the lionJennifer Higgins joins in a lament for so many endangered mammals.Of all species threatened, IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty is shocked by the latest indicators for hippos, giraffes and lions. In particular, “it would be an absolutely travesty if lions were to go extinct . . . The magnificent animal has permeated our culture and imagination, from children’s stories to the pillars on Trafalgar Square.”But maps don’t lie. In 1950 there were 400,000 lions in the wild. Today there are 23,000-39,000 lions in all of Africa, which is “extremely low” in global terms, when once they lived in Ancient Greece and North Africa, and became extinct in Greece only around 100BC.Outside of southern Africa, numbers of lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62 per cent between 1993 and 2014. Asia is home to a small subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat, where numbers are growing, but it’s just a pin on the globe.“There is no data to say that lions are about to disappear, but their populations are shrinking fast,” he explains. The species is classified as vulnerable but the slide into the “endangered” and then “critically endangered” categories looms, while “threatened with extinction” is applied to its current status.For Fogarty, the same pressures apply to other mammals, but the lion’s wellbeing is further undermined by gametrophy hunting and false western-world notions that it is somehow good for population numbers. All told, we are facing a scenario where lions will “shrink to a few corners of the planet”.What to doThis is not going to be sorted by putting bird tables in back gardens. The Ipbes report shows nature-based solutions can help bring “transformative change”, but there is a greater systemic problem.In the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly four-fold, and global trade has grown tenfold, together driving up the demands for energy, food and materials.Thinking that endless economic growth is possible and not valuing the essential services provided by nature is a delusion leading to catastrophe, Sweeney believes.“Until we get away from euros and cents and GDP, we will be in a cul-de-sac . . . Unless we rethink how we value the services provided by the natural world and include them explicitly in a wellbeing measure, we delude ourselves that a sustainable future is possible.”That was the core message in a submission this week to EU leaders meeting on the future of Europe by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and more than 200 academics, including John Sweeney, policy experts and civil society groups.There is an onus too on iniduals to act, according to EEB vice president Attracta Uí Bhroin. “It’s not enough for us to sit on the sofa and watch David Attenborough’s latest breathtaking and terrifying documentary and shake our heads. Every politician coming near your front door needs to know environmental sustainability is your priority, and must be Europe’s priority.”Fogarty hopes people now see the connections between climate breakdown and mass extinction, that they are two sides of the same coin. “We have all of the solutions to hand, but what we’ve been lacking is any sense of urgency to get on with it.”He senses momentum moving in the right direction, though the lack of a response from the Taoiseach or any Government minister “makes me feel that they are still hoping it’s an issue that will go away. We can’t really afford this level of disengagement when we need to be getting on with things.”Scheer is brutally frank about future voters born today. “I don’t think people get a choice of what games they play.”They will have to be focused on survival. “It feels as we have handed them a shitstorm.”As for the current generation, too many are stuck in business-as-usual mode. There is a need to raise consciousness quickly. “Ignorance is not a choice” given the IPBES report. “It’s not an opinion, it’s scientific. It’s happening.”Kevin O\u0027Sullivan is Environment and Science Editor and former Editor of The "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3918104.1559909622!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin sewage overflow happened as it should happen says irish water","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWalkers on Sandymount Strand in March this year. File photograph: Alan BetsonSewage overflows at Irish Water’s Ringsend water treatment plant happen around 15 times a year, but mostly in winter, the utility has said. The entire south Dublin coastline has been made off limits to bathers until next Wednesday following a sewage overflow at the plant due to heavy rainfall during the week.Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and Dublin City Council have issued warnings not to swim at the following beaches Dollymount, Sandymount and Merrion Strands, Seapoint Beach, Sandycove Beach, The Forty Foot Bathing area, Killiney Beach and White Rock Beach. Irish Water said there was a “storm water overflow” from the Ringsend plant for two hours over the course of Tuesday and Wednesday. A spokeswoman for the utility said overflows happen at Ringsend on average around 15 times a year “but mostly in winter, outside the bathing season, when the rainfall is heavier”. She said “there is potential” for an overflow to occur again over the summer period if there is “extreme rainfall”. “It’s a function of all waste water treatment plants all around the world. It wasn’t a failure of the plant or a mechanical breakdown. This happens as it should happen,” the spokeswoman added. Sean Laffey, head of asset management at Irish Water said the overflow from the storm water tank “would have been a very highly dilute settled sewage from the networks that came out of the Dublin area”.“During exceptional rainfall events the storm water tanks get full. We don’t get an opportunity to pass it back into the plant so what we do is we settle the contents of the storm water tank, we screen it for debris and then we discharge it back out into the environment and that’s what happened.”Mr Laffey said the Ringsend water treatment plant “operated exactly as it was designed to operate”. “These type of overflows are best practice across the world. The alternative is that you build your plant big enough to take any rainfall event. From an investment and value for money point of view, that’s just not a runner for us,” he added. Water quality samples have been taken at Dollymount, Merrion and Sandymount beaches on Friday and results are expected on Monday. “The prohibition will be in place until a clear set of results is obtained for the bathing waters,” a Dublin City Council spokeswoman said. “While we cannot predict the results of water quality samples, we would expect the prohibition on bathing to be in place for a few days.”Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council also said sampling will be taking place at the other affected bathing areas. “It is HSE advice that aside from bathers and beach users any organisers of any coastline or water based leisure or sporting event along the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown coastline should pay particular attention to this notification,” a statement from the council said. Irish Water said bathing restrictions are in place for the entire 2019 bathing season at Sandymount and Merrion beaches “due to general water quality”.

Photograph: Cyril ByrneRingsend wastewater treatment plant serves the greater Dublin region and has a notorious reputation for not complying with environmental standards and incidents resulting in discharges into Dublin Bay.What is causing partially-treated sewage from Dublin region to leak into Dublin Bay? The plant treats approximately 40 per cent of Ireland’s public wastewater but has been operating at over capacity and not in compliance with national and EU environmental regulations for many years.Built in 2005, the sewage treatment plant is the largest in Ireland. Although it was designed to cater for a population equivalent of 1.64 million people, it currently treats wastewater for the equivalent of 1.9 million. As a result, the treatment system is constantly overloaded.Treated sewage effluent is regularly discharged into the bay at an outfall in Poolbeg, 1km away from the plant. Overloading is worst after a period of intense rain, as happened this week – or prolonged rainfall.Why is the infrastructure not able to cope with heavy rain? After heavy rain, sewage volumes build up and have to be erted into storm water holding tanks. Once the rainfall eases, its contents are usually fed back into the treatment system. If volumes remain high, the waste is screened to remove solid material and serious pollutants and then discharged into the bay. Has this happened before? These type of incidents take place 15 to 20 times a year, according to Irish Water. They are usually in winter when they have less impact on users of the bay.Earlier this year, Irish Water was criticised for failing to notify bay users after a failure at one of the large processing tanks at the plant, which caused a discharge of sewage sludge into the lower Liffey estuary at Poolbeg over an eight-hour period.Storm water overflows were released untreated into Dublin Bay in October 2017 due to adverse weather conditions as a result of Storm Brian.Separate problems persist at adjoining Merrion and Sandymount strands due to two polluted streams, (including untreated sewage) connecting to the bay at these locations. As a consequence, bathing restrictions will continue there throughout the summer. What can be done to stop it happening? Innovative technology will be used to remove pollutants using aerobic granular sludge (AGS), which allows for a greater amount of wastewater to be treated to a higher standard within the current plant.Significantly, the upgrade will increase the population equivalent by 400,000, and allow for population growth in coming decades. The plant will be tested to the full because climate disruption in coming years is likely to see more frequent extreme rainfall incidents, increased flooding and more intensive storms. A plant to cater for all rainfall volumes would be prohibitively expensive.To date, Irish Water has invested some €100 million in the project, which includes advance work to prepare the site for the upgrade improvements to the odour treatment facilities, and trialling the AGS technology. It is expected to be completed in 2020."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Scottish minister in letter to Government says that it will deploy vessels to protect rightsRatoath College\u0026rsquos iPads-only policy sparks controversy over use of technologyCo Longford partner of Fiona Geraghty also injured but in stable condition in hospitalBar owner is distant cousin of US vice-president Mike PenceMoves comes as management bodies and teachers\u0026rsquo unions warn of a \u0026lsquocrisis\u0026rsquo in supplyNoel Pearse (55) became abusive when garda told him to move off an unauthorised rankDoctors saw 1.11 million male patients and 1.22 million females over five-year periodFormer SF president urges Government to hold consultation on united IrelandRingsend plant leakages happen about 15 times every year, mostly in winterSpecialist says there is a risk of gastrointestinal infections for those who break council\u0026rsquos swim banJonathan Lennon (35) was found guilty of disclosing sensitive information about arrestSean Little died \u0026lsquoin the most horrific, barbaric, senseless act of violence imaginable\u0026rsquoMilltown Cemetery bomber currently serving 30-year sentence for sectarian murdersSolicitor says councillor and co-accused were \u0026lsquovery anxious to have the matter dealt with\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoHe was asking was there going to be any future presidents there,\u0026rsquo pupil saysDublin City Council rejects plan for 160 apartments and houses on GAA groundsGarda Commissioner says by buying cocaine, users are \u0026lsquopurchasing misery\u0026rsquo elsewhere"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3918532.1559930807!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fianna f%C3%A1il s paul mcauliffe elected lord mayor of dublin","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Fianna Fáil councillor Paul McAuliffe was elected as the 350th Lord Mayor of Dublin at Friday’s council meeting.

With Fianna Fáil on 11 seats, the Greens on 10 and Labour holding eight seats, the support of five others was needed. Mr McAuliffe comfortably defeated Independent councillor and homelessness campaigner Anthony Flynn and Fine Gael councillor Ray McAdam at the inaugural meeting of the incoming Dublin City Council in City Hall on Friday afternoon. Fianna Fáil’s Tom Brabazon was elected deputy Lord Mayor. Finglas native McAuliffe, a 10-year veteran of the council, is in line to run for the Dáil in the next general election, where the party hopes he will unseat Fine Gael TD Noel Rock, who he lost out to for the final seat in Dublin North West in 2016.Mr McAuliffe paid tribute to his wife Ciara and family and said he was “overwhelmed”at becoming mayor. He cited housing and climate action as his top priorities for his term. “This council will lead again on public and affordable housing. We will do it on our terms and we will be the lead developers. Housing is a social issue but is also an economic issue. Our failure to tackle housing has damaged families and damaged the competitiveness of this city. The solutions must be delivered and we need to lead by example,” he said. Mr McAuliffe said he was wearing a small blue pin to champion mental health and mental fitness and the doors of the Mansion House would be open to advocates for metal health. He said the council will take a lead in tackling illegal dumping and “the scourge” of drug-dealing on the streets. Independent councillor Damian O’Farrell asked if all three candidates would stay on for the role if some of them are running in the general election. Outgoing Lord Mayor Nial Ring said the Deputy Lord Mayor would take up the role and until the council reconvened and another new one would be voted in. Mr Ring recalled recalled the celebration of the first Dáil and the Dublin football team winning four All-Ireland finals in a row as highlights of his term.“I hope Lord Mayor number 350 has as an exciting term as I had,” Mr Ring said.Fianna FáilFianna Fail looks has consolidated its position on Dublin’s councils taking three cathaoirlighmayor positions and one Leas Cathaoirleach.On local authorities across Dublin, the position of Cathaoirleach is interchangeable with Mayor. The Leas Cathaoirleach is the Deputy Mayor. At the inaugural meeting of the incoming Dun Laoghaire Rathdown Council on Friday afternoon, Fianna Fail’s Shay Brennan comfortably defeated Fine Gael’s Barry Saul by 23 votes to 14. Although in Dun Laoghaire Rathdown Fianna Fáil has only seven seats compared to Fine Gael’s 13, it secured the support of the Labour Party Greens and Independents to take the mayoral role. The Leas Cathaoirleach position went to Independent Deirdre Donnelly. Fianna Fáil councillor Eoghan O’Brien was elected Cathaoirleach in Fingal, due to a combination of support from Fianna Fáil, the Green Party, Labour and Independents. Tom Kett also of Fianna Fáil was elected Leas Cathaoirleach. On South Dublin County Council, Fine Gael councillor Vicki Casserly was elected the first mayor of the council’s term, with Fianna Fáil’s Trevor Gilligan her deputy in a majority grouping combined of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and Independents. Under precedent this would ensure that Mr Gilligan secures the Cathaoirleach’s position next year. In Limerick, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael ided the roles between them. Fine Gael’s Michel Sheahan was elected Mayor of the City and County. He was proposed by John Sheahan of Fine Gael and seconded by Michael Collins of Fianna Fáil. Cllr Adam Teskey (FG) was elected as Deputy Mayor. In Waterford, Labour councillor John Pratt was elected Mayor of the City and County Council.Any party can put forward a mayor for election, with the candidate who gets the most votes from their fellow councillors securing the chain of office for the next year."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3917961.1559890437!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord the people of doonbeg aren t forelock tuggers or cap doffers or eejits","story":"Donald Trump\u0027s sons, Don Jr. and Eric, visit some of the local pubs in Doonbeg as part of the US president\u0027s visit to Co Clare.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA Wire The post office in Doonbeg closed last October.It didn’t command international attention or trouble the national headlines. But it was a big loss to the village. The older people would come in on pension day and there’d be a good buzz around the place.Now, Friday is the same as any other day with most of the pubs staying closed until the evening time.This is not a major story, just a familiar one in many small towns and villages around the country. Keeping these communities alive is hard going.Doonbeg is lucky, though. And that’s down to the Trump hotel and Golf resort and the employment opportunities it has given to the local area.When the TV satellite vans have moved out and the roaming herds of photographers and journalists have left for the next gig, the hotel will still be there, along with the jobs.So on Thursday, as villagers scrolled through their social media feeds and saw themselves labelled “gombeens” by people they never met, and restaurant owners found scathing reviews appearing on Tripadvisor from people who never visited, they laughed and got on with life in the same way they did before the president of the United States of America nearly came to town.Doonbeg was in recovery following the big party the Wednesday night when Eric and Donál Óg Trump called into every pub to mark their father’s arrival in his eponymous hotel. They pulled pints (badly) and put on a good-humoured show for the crowd. They exaggerated the depth of love they believe Ireland and Doonbeg has for them and their father. They splashed the cash and called for drinks on the house, in every house they visited.The local parish priest arrived on the scene and presented them with a painting. There were lots of flags.Scenes from their exuberant progress from hostelry to hostelry upset an awful lot of people.Tiny populationThe population of Doonbeg is tiny. Fewer than 300 people. They aren’t forelock tuggers or cap doffers or eejits. The Trump brothers, Eric in particular, are not strangers to the village. Wednesday was not their first time in those pubs.Strip out the journalists and news crews and the crowd welcoming them would have been small.The village is adorned with some red white and blue bunting, and some of the green white and orange variety too. But it’s a bit sparse. There is the odd American flag about, but it isn’t hanging from the top window of houses and there aren’t any special signs welcoming Donald Trump to the neighbourhood.But his company is a valued employer, people don’t speak ill of the Trump hotel business. Of course they would give the Trump boys a big welcome and there would have been one for president Trump too, had he materialised.The appearance by the two lads fuelled speculation that they were sussing out the territory in advance of a visitation by their father. The happy images of people cheering them to the rafters as céilí dancers spun around in the street and pints of stout were flying out of the pubs would look well back home.Now, if only it could be replicated for the president.All day, Doonbeg was a town in suspense. Streets deserted, apart from hordes of media people and the same amount of Garda officers cooling their heels in the sunshine. Busloads of gardaí went up and down the Quilty Road, which was closed off to the public.Hiding from CNNAll day, the photographers waited. They photographed a man driving a cart with shire horses. They photographed a garda petting the horses. They photographed any publican they could find.We went in to talk to one landlord who wasn’t keen to come to the door. “I’m trying to hide from CNN. They have me persecuted.”Then a man wearing a Vietnam Veteran cap materialised in Tubridy’s bar to the immense relief of the journalists who dutifully recorded his utterances. “I absolutely love Trump,” he declared. And so on, and on.And a Mayo native from Boston appeared who is “an original member of the club” and who, on Wednesday night “met the whole crowd” in the hotel. Except Donald.Back at the small café, sticks of Doonbeg rock were snapped up by visitors – a euro each, six for a fiver.A local told us that some of the Garda sub-aqua team treated a few of their land based colleagues to a trip in the rib out into Doughmore Bay. But the water was a bit choppy. “The lads were sick as dogs.”As the hours slowly passed it was beginning to look like this would be the greatest danger the gardaí would find themselves in during Trump’s visit. A large communications mast attached to a cherry-picker was stationed at the entrance to the village with a very bored man wearing a laminated ID minding it.The last number of weeks have been a triumph of marketing for the Trump brand, but Doonbeg sur Diageo is a marketing haven for Guinness. Every outside wall is emblazoned with the firm’s retro livery.VisitationAnd still, everyone waited and wondered if there might yet be A Visitation. The Garda Public Order unit did a few sweeps of the Main Street. Secret service operatives were spotted in around the back of Tubridy’s pub while a clatter of them were seen entering Morrissey’s bar and restaurant.They only went in to have their dinner.The proprietor, Hugh McNally, had a pristine tricolour folded up and resting on a chair in reception. His dog Pepper – she rules the roost – was away being spoiled at another location. Was this a sign?In the pub, RTÉ’s Brian O’Donovan did his thing from the picturesque riverbank beside Morrissey’s. The room fell silent when he mentioned speculation mounting over a Visitation. But then again, it could be “fake news”. Everyone cheered.A photograph was tweeted showing Trump eating his dinner in his hotel restaurant with the 18 green in the background and the tomato sauce in the foreground.Back in the village, hopes were beginning to fade.Local man Brian Heppell – twenty years in the place, married a woman whose father was from Kilrush but she “ran away with the lead singer of a band” – was not particularly interested in seeing Donald Trump, should he visit.“I’ll think about it and see how I feel – depends on the weather.”Brian is originally from Windsor in the UK and recalled seeing a Royal procession many years ago.“Everyone was peering into this Rolls Royce when it passed. And it turned out to be the Queen mother. We got an absolutely glorious smile and wave from her. It was absolutely genuine and I’ll never forget it. Now, if Donald waved to me, I don’t thing it would have quite the same effect.”The hotel is a good thing for Doonbeg, he says. Only for it, young people who are now living locally would be rearing their families in America or Australia.The photographers stuck it out, but it looked like the most famous person to visit the village (and be universally loved there) continues to be the tremendously tremendous Marty Morrissey.Read more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3917404.1559850113!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"time is up for may but westminster has already moved on","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish environment secretary Michael Gove: in the running for  prime minister role in upcoming Conservative Party leadership battle. Photograph: Andy RainWhen Theresa May resigns as Conservative Party leader on Friday, it will be without ceremony and effected almost invisibly in an exchange of letters with the backbench 1922 Committee.Westminster’s attention has in any case already moved to the contest to replace her, which starts next Monday and sees the first round of voting by MPs three days later.The big, unruly field of candidates includes some preposterous figures and has thrown up its share of outlandish proposals for dealing with Brexit. But the three candidates with the largest number of public endorsements from MPs – Boris Johnson, Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove – are in broad agreement on what it will take to get a Brexit deal through parliament.All three have narrowed their demand to a change to the Northern Ireland backstop that would offer Britain an exit mechanism, a time limit or a guarantee that it will be replaced by alternative arrangements to keep the Border open. They have been encouraged by British media reports from Brussels that the EU is willing to consider a time limit, perhaps of five or seven years.Some senior EU figures have mused in private about the option of a lengthy time limit but the firm consensus among the 27 remaining member states and in the institutions is that the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, cannot be changed.Some leadership candidates have called for bilateral negotiations with Dublin about accelerating the introduction of alternative arrangements but the Irish Government will not enter any such talks before the withdrawal agreement is ratified.Stormont institutionsOf the three leading contenders, Gove is closest to recognising the limits of what Britain can achieve and accepting that the backstop cannot be removed from the withdrawal agreement but could be “supplanted” later by alternative arrangements.He suggested this week that Sinn Féin’s poor performance in last month’s local and European elections could encourage the party to work to restore the Stormont institutions.“One of the peculiarities of the last general election is that there is no representation of nationalists in Northern Ireland in Westminster and therefore they have a missing voice. If we get the institutions back up and running in Northern Ireland, nationalists will be involved in the administration of Northern Ireland.“That will make it easier for us to get those alternative arrangements in place and to provide security to border communities and also to ensure that we can have the both the safeguarding of the Belfast Agreement but also the economic benefits that have flowed since then,” he told the Spectator’s Fraser Nelson in a public interview on Wednesday night.The obstacles in the way of alternative arrangements based on technological and administrative measures replacing the backstop are formidable. This is partly because of the backstop’s dual purpose: to protect the peace process and to defend the integrity of the European single market – and Ireland’s place in it.Trade and peacePeace on the island is clearly a fundamental national interest of the Irish State but so too is Ireland’s full and unencumbered membership of the single market. This is all the more important in view of Ireland’s strategic shift towards Europe after Brexit, which is further encouraged by Donald Trump’s trade policy.Ireland’s future economic relationship with the rest of the world depends more than ever on its place in the EU and any doubt cast over its position in the single market could be exploited by competitors, including other EU member states. This will make it difficult for any Irish government to agree to a replacement for the backstop that does not maintain full regulatory alignment across the island.Johnson continues to claim that he will take Britain out of the EU on October 31st with or without a deal and that he will not seek a further extension. If MPs see Britain heading towards a no-deal Brexit, however, they can tell him to seek an extension – just as they instructed the current prime minister in March.The next prime minister’s interlocutors in Brussels will be more relaxed than\u0026nbspLondon would wish about a no-deal Brexit, not least because they believe it would be short-lived. Any prime minister who leads Britain into a no-deal Brexit at the end of October is likely to face an election before long, which most Conservatives believe they would lose.That would leave the next government returning to Brussels to negotiate a deal, possibly in the midst of economic turmoil and certainly from a much weaker position, outside the EU and with none of the protections currently offered to Britain by article 50.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

In June 1944, as a Switchboard Operator recently trained in the new technology of VHF radio, 17-year-old Marie Scott practically skipped down all 350 of them, deep into the tunnels underneath the cliffs of Fort Southwick.Living, working and sleeping in the tunnels was not very pleasant: eight-hour watches in a 24-hour duty, then off for a day. For the staff of the Naval Command headquarters just outside Portsmouth, the fetid air and lack of natural light underground meant the steps provided welcome exercise on their way back to the surface.Day and night meant nothing to Marie and her colleagues: the wireless operators, plotters, planners and telegraphists from across the services, who sat at their stations in the windowless offices or slept in small, cramped rooms on three-tier bunks.Even so, they knew their hardships were nothing compared to the men they would be speaking to on the other end of their wireless sets. They’d been informed on June 4 that a big operation was planned for the next day, but hadn’t been told why a 24-hour delay meant that it would now be starting on the sixth.Marie Scott at Southwick House, Portsmouth. She was a 17-year-old switchboard operator on D-DayWhatever was happening up there on the surface, in the air and on the sea off the south coast of Britain, the nine WAAFs, Wrens and Auxiliary Territorial Service personnel in Marie’s section knew this was no rehearsal it was the real thing.“I grew up on that day,” Mrs Scott says. “I became aware of the reality of war.”General Dwight D Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of Allied Expeditionary Forces in Europe, had arrived in Southwick House on June 2 to establish his headquarters for the invasion. Chosen because of its proximity to the port, and to the underground naval command headquarters dug into the cliffs, Southwick House had been requisitioned for the Royal Navy’s navigation school earlier in the war.The date for D-Day was dictated by the weather. With a full moon and suitable tide, the period June 4 to 7 was optimal, with a few days from the 18th as Plan B.If they didn’t go in June, the next suitable tide was not until September and by then the secret would have undoubtedly slipped out. The Germans knew an invasion was coming - the mass of Allied vehicles, manpower and ships meant it was only a matter of time - but they didn’t know where, and they didn’t know when.But there was a problem. The British and American meteorologists had different ways of doing things and couldn’t agree on the most suitable date. The situation was not helped by the fact that James Stagg, Eisenhower’s chief weather adviser and a civilian later given the notional rank of Group Captain in the RAF so as to be more readily accepted by the military, was actually a geophysicist.An intense rivalry had developed between him and the weathermen. Meteorology at this time was more art than science and there hadn’t been any significant advances in the subject since the First World War.  On June 4 Stagg recommended to Eisenhower that the weather was so bad, with high wind and cloud cover, that D-Day, planned for June 5, should be postponed.Eisenhower asked his component commanders their view. “Chancey,” said Air Chief Marshal Leigh Mallory, the air commander. “Do-able but risky” thought Sir Arthur Tedder, Eisenhower’s deputy. General Montgomery, the overall ground force commander, in charge of all British, American and Canadian troops (and later Polish forces) was unequivocal in his belief they should launch.Eisenhower made his decision. “OK, we’ll go,” he said to Stagg. A signal sent to London and Washington stated ‘Halcyon plus five’ (Halcyon being the code word for June 1). The invasion was on.Despite knowing an attack was coming, the remarkable success of Operation Fortitude, under General George Patton’s First US Army Group, had convinced the Germans that any attack in Normandy would be just a ersion for the main assault at Pas-de-Calais.General Patton was considered by the Germans to be the best allied general and therefore certain to be the commander of the coming invasion. He based himself in Kent, with real soldiers bolstered by dummy equipment available for the eyes of German intelligence.Operation Fortitude worked so well that even after D-Day the Germans held many of their best troops in the Calais area expecting a second invasion.Further afield Britain’s secret agents, the Special Operations Executive (SOE), were doing their bit. In some areas, the Germans were using carrier pigeons to send messages. The SOE put birds trained to fly towards Britain in German army pigeon lofts so the messages were delayed or simply disappeared. The French resistance blew up the radio land lines, to force the Germans to use other means of communication which, with Enigma cracked, enabled the Allies to listen in.Pigeons had a vital role in the war Dummy paratroopers were dropped across Seine-Maritime, Calvados and Manche and an SAS team, parachuted into the Cotentin peninsula five miles west of Saint-Lo, installed loudspeakers to play combat noises, including explosions and the sound of soldiers swearing.  The RAF’s 617 Squadron - made famous by the Dambusters raid in 1943 - dropped strips of metal foil known as ‘window’ miles away from Normandy. German radar operators were fooled into thinking they were seeing an approaching naval fleet, where in fact there was none.The deception plan was working. Just as well, there was no way now of stopping the vast armada of ships and aircraft departing on the biggest operation of its kind ever mounted what Eisenhower later called “the great crusade”.Having made his decision, Eisenhower was rendered temporarily powerless as the massive machine of war stirred into action.On the afternoon of June 5, he had been driven to Greenham Common to visit the troops of the 101st Airborne Division, a force expected to have one in every two men killed, wounded or captured. He handed out cigarettes and talked to them about fly fishing a photo from the time captures him with hands aloft, as if explaining how to cast.Eisenhower gives the order of the day to US paratroopers on June 6, 1944 Returning to Southwick House he stood on the ridge to watch the deployment. It was said to be the only time he showed emotion a certain moisture around the eyes. New challenges would face him in the future, but nothing ever again on the scale of D-Day.Just after midnight on June 6, paratroopers from the British 6th Airborne Division, the first of 23,400 airborne troops, jumped into Normandy. The German artillery battery at Merville needed to be silenced before it could fire on to the beaches where British and Canadian forces were due to land a few hours later. Two bridges over the Caen canal and the River Orne were to be seized to prevent German reinforcements arriving from Calais.The glider-borne assault on the bridges was so successful - 15 minutes from landing to capture - they were renamed Pegasus and Horsa Bridges, after the emblem of British airborne forces and the gliders they had flown in on.Lieutenant Herbert Denham ‘Den’ Brotheridge, killed just after midnight on the 6th while leading a charge to seize Pegasus Bridge, was the first allied soldier killed on D-Day.Pegasus Bridge: No 1 glider (in background) piloted by Jim Wallwork landed within feet of the planned targetAt 02:40 Field Marshal von Runstedt, commander of the German Army in France, was told of fighting in Normandy, but still believed the main invasion would be at Pas-de-Calais.Although the potent 21st Panzer Division was available, Hitler was asleep at Berchtesgaden and his staff were too nervous to wake him up to order the reinforcements, as they still thought the fighting was a ersionary raid.It was another two hours before Von Runstedt ordered the 12th SS Panzer Division into action, but his decision was rescinded at 06:30 by General Jodl at the Armed Forces High Command, who still wanted to wait for Hitler to wake up.Assault routes into Normandy - DDAYIn the early hours of June 6, the invasion fleet arrived at the assembly point south of the Isle of Wight called Area Z - better known as Piccadilly Circus - and passed through a lane cleared in the German minefield which extended to Norway. It then turned south, towards the Normandy beaches.At 04:30, an hour after the assault troops had started cross-decking into the landing craft far out in the English Channel, struggling to descend the nets into vessels that were pitching uncertainly below them, and just as Von Runstedt was ordering the Panzer reinforcements, two British X-class midget submarines surfaced off the Normandy coast.For the preceding two days, each craft and their five-man crew had sat silently, waiting for the invasion. Their mission: erect 18-foot telescopic masts equipped with navigation lights and radio beacons to guide British and Canadian landing craft to the beaches.Canadian soldiers from 9th Brigade land with their bicycles at Juno Beach in Bernieres-sur-Mer on D-DayAs H-Hour approached, the time of the ground invasion, rocket launcher barges started firing salvoes onto the beaches in a bid to clear the minefields. On Gold, Juno and Sword beaches in the British sector, where 61,715 British and 21,400 Canadian soldiers were to land, 20,000 rockets blasted the sand, with a similar number fired at Utah and Omaha beaches in the American sector, where 73,000 US troops would be arriving shortly.  However, Forward Observers out at sea struggled to see through the clouds of smoke and brick dust being thrown up from the coast by the naval gunfire. Consequently, much ammunition was wasted on targets randomly picked off the map. As the landing craft approached the beaches, smelling of diesel, sweat and vomit, the men geared themselves for the imminent assault unaware that much of the German coastal defence remained intact.Security around the operation had been rigid. The secret map board in Southwick House, depicting the coasts of England and Normandy and which showed all the locations of the deployed forces, covered an entire wall.Produced by carpenters at Chad Valley toys in Birmingham, the section was one small part of a larger piece that had been ordered, showing Britain and the entire European coastline from Norway to Spain.When the carpenters had erected the section they commented that the invasion was obviously planned for Normandy. “Yes,” came the answer, “and you’re going to jail.”Allowed to do odd jobs around the house by day, the two men were locked up each night. They had only planned to stay for the weekend but were kept at Southwick House until September. History does not record what they told their wives upon their return.Not even the tea ladies were allowed in. One Wren, Marsi Taylor (known as Aunt Marsi),  had worked in the headquarters throughout the war but had never seen the map room before visiting in 2014.Two bizarre security incidents had particularly concerned the authorities and show how seriously efforts to deny the plan’s discovery by German spies had been taken.In early 1944 codewords related to D-Day were revealed in the ’s crossword puzzle: Gold and Sword were dismissed as commonly-used crossword answers, but then more exotic words started to appear.On May 22 came the clue ‘Red Indian on the Missouri (5)’. The answer: Omaha, codename for the beach to be taken by the 1st US Assault Division. Then, on May 27, came Overlord, the name for the entire Normandy campaign. Coincidence? Perhaps.But on May 30 came Mulberry (the floating harbours used in the landings) and on June 1 the solution for 15 down was Neptune (the naval assaults onto the beaches). Alarm bells rang and MI5 visited Leonard Dawe, the ’s crossword compiler, who later said “they made me sweat”.Troops landing on D-Day at Sword beach. The picture was taken from a photo reconnaissance Mustang aircraft of II (Army Cooperation) SquadronThe second case involved Helen Duncan, a spiritualist and clairvoyant. She was the celebrity mystic of her day and had supposedly given seances to King George VI and Churchill. She was also a con artist who used to spit out fluid claiming it was ectoplasm, while her husband rattled the windows.She claimed she could talk to the dead through the spirit of an Able Seaman who had been on HMS Barham, a battleship sunk in the Meditaerranean with the loss of 861 men. The Admiralty was concerned as it had not released the details of HMS Barham’s loss.In the febrile and paranoid security atmosphere ahead of D-Day, Duncan was put under surveillance and later arrested after a seance attended by two superstitious naval officers who thought she might reveal the secrets of the imminent invasion. She was acquitted of fraud but found guilty of witchcraft under the 1735 Witchcraft Act and sentenced to nine months in Holloway prison.D-Day 75 years on | Read moreAt 06:30 US troops from the 1st and 29th Divisions landed over a four-mile front at Omaha beach. The US 4th Division put ashore the first of 23,250 men on Utah beach at the same time.Immediately there were problems at Omaha. Many landing craft missed their targets or were swamped in the choppy seas. Of the 29 Duplex Drive tanks (modified Shermans with floats) in the first wave, 27 sank. German resistance - from the 352nd Infantry Division - was stronger than anticipated.On one landing craft a flamethrower operator had been hit and his weapon exploded, blasting him into the sea and spewing blazing fuel over the decks. The vessel caught fire and continued burning all day, periodically lit up again by detonations from exploding 20mm Oerlikon ammunition.At 07:25 the British 3rd Division landed at Sword beach, intending to take the town of Caen and the Carpiquet aerodrome by nightfall. The seizure of the La Breche strongpoint covering the beach took three hours and cost the South Lancashires 107 men killed. On one part of the beach a solitary French girl was seen wading through the surf to help wounded men out of the water.Five minutes after Sword, Gold beach was assaulted by the British 50th Division who must hold the position to allow the two Mulberry harbours - vast prefabricated structures vital for offloading the two million troops and critical supplies - to be established.Marie Scott, manning her VHF Switchboard in Fort Southwick, was shocked when the soldiers on the beaches started radioing back. “When they passed their message you could hear gunfire, cannon fire, all the sounds of war,” she said.“Suddenly you realised that this was the reality of war. Men were dying there. And at 17, and being rather naive, I don’t think it had fully registered, until the moment I got the first message back and could hear the sounds of war.”British troops take positions on Sword beachAfter hours without a decision, and with Hitler still asleep, at 07:40 General Edgar Feuchtinger unilaterally ordered his 21st Panzer Division to reinforce the eastern beaches. Hitler woke up an hour and a half later, but regarded the news from Normandy as excellent, still thinking - thanks to Operation Fortitude\u0027s chain of deceptions - that the morning\u0027s events were a cover for the real invasion at Pas-de-Calais.The assault on Utah progressed well, even though the tide had taken the landing craft a mile south of their intended positions. Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt Jr, the 56-year-old son of the former president, was in the first wave.Meanwhile, wading towards Sword beach, in a bid to rally the men of 1st Special Service Brigade, Piper Bill Millin struck up Hieland Laddie as his Cameron tartan floated around him. The man behind him was hit and sank, but Millin kept going. Once ashore he did not run, but walked up and down the beach, blasting out a series of tunes, including The Road to the Isles. German prisoners later admitted that they had not attempted to shoot him because they thought he had lost his mind.Piper Bill Millin strikes up Blue Bonnets as 1st SS Brigade Commandos wade ashore at Ouistreham on Sword beachThe 3rd Canadian Infantry Division landed at Juno beach at 07:45, having had H-Hour delayed by 10 minutes due to rough seas. But even then some craft were late. As a result, many hit obstacles submerged by the tide and the coxswains could do little to prevent the landing craft becoming entangled. The Engineers struggled to clear a path and almost a third of the vessels were destroyed by mines. They took heavy casualties.Likewise, the situation at Omaha was becoming desperate. Vehicles were stuck in the deep water and wounded men on the beach were drowning as the tide came in. General Bradley, commander of the US First Army and in charge of the assaults on Omaha and Utah, watched the chaos from the cruiser the USS Augusta. He came close to stopping the operation and considered erting troops from Utah.Pinned down on Omaha, Colonel George Taylor, commander of the US 16th Infantry Regiment, shouted to his men: “Two sorts of people are going to stay on this beach, those who are dead and those who are going to die. Let’s get the hell out of here!” There were hundreds of bodies on the beach and floating in the water. Commonwealth personnel, nearly all British and Canadian, outnumbered the Americans on D-Day. Of the 156,000 men landed in France on June 6, 73,000 were American, and 83,000 were British and Canadian, while the Commonwealth naval contingent was twice that of the Americans. The Germans were formidable opponents, and by this stage of the war the British Armed Forces were tired, having been fighting for nearly five years. The Americans wanted to get the job done and some questioned why it was taking Britain so long. But in truth the country was almost exhausted and close to bankruptcy.In late 1943 the Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison, had told Churchill that Britain was unable to replace any battle casualties. Consequently, Montgomery was fighting the war with the Army he had, rather than the one he wanted, and morale was fragile. He was criticised after the war for excessive caution, but the priority at the time was to preserve his fighting power. He had been told by Churchill to win well and sufficient for Britain to maintain her world power status.Ron Smith was a 19-year-old electrical technician on Landing Craft Tank 947 when he left Gosport early on D-Day. He thought at first it was another rehearsal, like he was used to in Scotland, but the skipper said they were going to France instead. “Do we need a passport?” asked one of the crew.The craft landed on Sword beach at 07:30, closed up, at action stations, carrying six 80-tonne Churchill tanks, with a rocket ship behind Ron blasting the mines on the beach. “I don’t reckon a whelk could have survived on that beach,” he said.Ron Smith, who was on landing Craft Tank 947 which was sunk by shellfireRon’s landing craft was hit by shellfire. The third tank was immobilised, blocking the exit ramp, and the torpedoes on the landing craft exploded, killing a number of men on board. They managed to get off the beach but the craft was partly submerged, due to the damaged tank on the ramp, and was mistaken for a submarine on their way back to Portsmouth.Despite the shock of the action Ron, now 94, was impressed with the whole operation. “It was beautifully organised,” he said, “if you can say that in a war.”Back in Eisenhower’s headquarters at Southwick House there was a frenetic atmosphere. The map room was a hive of activity and noise, with telegrams coming in, phones ringing and signals presented to staff officers. Along one wall a huge gantry seated service men and women reporting the progress of the landings. The room was enveloped in a fug of cigarette smoke.People rushed to put things on the map - and remove them. Sybil Parker, a Wren working in the headquarters, had a Canadian boyfriend called Captain James Morley. Sybil watched as the small wooden marker denoting his ship was removed from the map board after being hit by enemy fire. She found out 10 weeks later that he had been killed on D-Day at Juno beach.Sybil Parker only learned her beloved had died when his ship was removed from the big map In the middle of it all was Eisenhower. Under huge stress, he ate little and slept even less, surviving on five packets of cigarettes a day and a lot of coffee.  Billetted in tents in the grounds of Southwick House, Eisenhower relaxed by reading cheap cowboy books and was known to have a volcanic temper that disappeared as quickly as it had flared.With his political master, Roosevelt, 3,000 miles away in Washington, Eisenhower was under great pressure from Churchill. Repeatedly dragged to Chequers, he was served tepid Irish stew, for which he developed a lifelong aversion, and had to endure Churchill’s rambling, alcohol-fuelled monologues.Churchill could be a “terrible pest” in the words of Field Marshal Alan Brooke, Chief of the Imperial General Staff. He had turned up at Southwick House unannounced on May 3 with General Charles de Gaulle. His force of nature character was unwelcome, as was his earlier insistence that the British and Canadian beaches should be called Goldfish, Jellyfish and Swordfish. He was told men shouldn’t have to die on a beach called Jellyfish. It was changed to Juno and fish was dropped from the objective names.  The first tanks enter Sword Beach, near Ouistreham Churchill’s extraordinary ability to lead was beyond question, but he did have one particularly concerning trait: a desire to be in the thick of the action. A soldier at heart, he was never entirely happy allowing the admirals, generals and air marshals a free hand and often wanted to see things for himself.His insistence on being able to watch the beach assaults for himself aboard HMS Belfast  and then set foot on the French coast presented Eisenhower with one of his more delicate diplomatic conundrums. He elected to speak to Alan Lascelles, Private Secretary to King George VI, who, in turn, took the matter to the Monarch.Winston Churchill visiting the Normandy landing beaches in France with Field Marshal Montgomery the month after D-DayThe King wrote a letter to Churchill. It read: My Dear Winston, I want to make one more appeal to you not to go to sea on D-Day. Please consider my own position. I am a younger man than you. I am a sailor and as King I am the head of all three services. There is nothing I would like better than to go to sea, although I have agreed to stay at home. Is it fair that you should then do exactly what I should have liked to do myself?He went on:  You will see very little but you will be at considerable risk. You will be inaccessible at a critical time when vital decisions might have to be taken. However unobtrusive you may be, your very presence on board is bound to be a very heavy additional responsibility to the Admiral and Captain...Churchill stayed at home.De Gaulle likewise was a prickly house guest. He had just arrived from Algiers and was livid to be told about the invasion - which his staff had had no part in planning - and that Eisenhower, rather than he, was to run a provisional government in France.That the US Treasury had been printing ‘French occupation dollars’ was a further point of tension. De Gaulle, already deeply suspicious of what he saw as an Anglo-Saxon plot to marginalise France, objected to the term ‘occupation’.It was at this point Eisenhower’s true greatness shone through. He had the ability to calm things down and was the embodiment of a coalition soldier, able to hold together a very fractious group.Eisenhower had walked in the gardens of Southwick House with De Gaulle. They smoked, and the American let the Frenchman, whom he outranked by three stars, harangue him about the plan. In an inspired moment, Eisenhower tuned and said “General, do you have any further advice for me?”De Gaulle, acknowledging Eisenhower’s patience and position, then said “Mon General, if I were you I would delay no further” and he left. Churchill departed also, in a huff because he had not been allowed to interfere in any way. He said to the staff “good luck and God speed, but I’ve been told not to talk to you,” before storming off.By early afternoon Juno, Sword, Gold and Utah beaches were largely stable and the situation at Omaha was improving, although many hours behind schedule. Lord Lovat and his Commandos, accompanied by piper Bill Millin, had relieved Major John Howard and the 2nd Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry at the Bénouville bridges. Georges Gondrée, proprietor of the Café Gondreé, approached with champagne for Lovat. He was waved away with the words: I\u0027m working.The forces of 50th Division had pushed inland four miles from Gold beach towards the town of Creully and 47 Commando Royal Marines had taken Port-en-Bessin to close the gap with the US forces at Omaha. Caen, home to 60,000 civilians, was bombed at 13:30 by over 70 B-24s of the 2nd Bombardment Division in an attempt to cut German communication lines. Despite a leaflet drop over the town earlier, warning civilians of an Allied air attack, there were many casualties.Winston Churchill talking to British and Canadian troops in Caen, in July 1944  At 15:00  the first sections of two massive artificial harbours code-named Mulberry headed across the Channel. Built of concrete and steel they were critical in the resupply of the Allied forces. It was not until 20:55 that the town of Arromanches, south of Gold beach, was captured, enabling the safe deployment of the Mulberry harbours. Reinforcements started to arrive by glider in the evening. Operation Mallard launched 250 gliders, with RAF fighter escort, in support of the British 6th Airborne Division. Denzil Cooper, then a 23-year-old Sergeant in the Glider Pilot Regiment, flew the third aircraft into Ranville at 21:00, towed behind an Albemarle. Horsa gliders were designed so that the tail could be detached once on the ground, for the easy deployment of the vehicles or men inside.Approaching Ranville in attack formation, he saw the tail of a neighbouring glider suddenly drop off, causing the aircraft to plummet to the ground. “I thought, hmm, that’s the end of them,” he said.Aerial view of pieces of the Mulberry Harbour at Arromanches, built to help troops and machinery onto the beach By the end of the day the 159,000 Allied troops, marines, airmen and naval personnel ashore had successfully established four sizeable beachheads. The invasion front remained vulnerable to German counter-attack, and there was still terrible fighting ahead, but a crucial step had been taken towards liberating Europe.Professor Richard Holmes said of the Normandy campaign: “The forces of a mighty coalition had entered the continent of Europe and mistakes not withstanding, struck a telling blow at its occupiers. They deserve our gratitude.”A month after D-Day, on the afternoon of July 11, Eisenhower found a handwritten note inside his wallet. It had been written on June 5 as he was driven to Greenham Common to visit the 101st Airborne Division.He had prepared the note in case the landings were repulsed and the operation had failed, in a bid to shield his staff from criticism.   The note said: Our landings in the Cherbourg and Le Havre area failed to gain a satisfactory foothold and I have withdrawn the troops. My decision to attack at this time and place was based on the best information available. The troops, the air and the navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do. If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt it is mine alone.As the longest day - as D-Day became known - drew to a close 4,413 Allied soldiers were dead. German losses are thought to be between 4,000 and 9,000. The whole Normandy campaign lasted 77 days (Montgomery had expected 90) and resulted in the destruction of the German 7th Army and 5th Panzer Army.In total 209,672 Allied soldiers were killed, wounded or listed as missing. This casualty rate, including the Germans and civilians, was 6,674 killed a day, each day of the Normandy campaign- a rate that exceeds the attrition rate of Verdun, the Somme and Passchendaele during World War One. An infantry Platoon Commander had a one-in-seven chance of surviving longer than two weeks.Casualties and Deaths - DDAYMarie Scott is now 92, and on June 5, 2019 will be presented with the Legion d’honneur, France’s highest award, as a mark of the respect France continues to have for the men and women who helped liberate the country.Mrs Scott says the significance of D-Day dawned on her only in retrospect. “To have been awarded the Legion d’honneur was remarkable, almost unbelievable, truly overwhelming.“But in comparison to the men who landed on the beaches and were injured or died, there is no comparison.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Brexit is greatly exacerbating sector’s problemsClick to followThe IndependentFord is set to close its engine plant in Bridgend next yearSo it’s goodbye Bridgend. With carmaker\u0026nbspFord shutting its engine plant down there, at the direct cost of 1,700 jobs, not to mention all the roles that will be lost in the supply chain, the future for the town looks bleak.\u0026nbspAll that talk about the\u0026nbsp“special relationship” with the US with Donald Trump in town and yet South Wales is losing out to Mexico.\u0026nbspThat’s where the cost advantage lies.\u0026nbspFord to close Bridgend plant in 2020 with loss of 1,700 jobsFears Ford factory could close costing 1,500 jobsFord warns no-deal Brexit will force it to reconsider UK presenceFord is apparently saying it isn’t Brexit. And maybe Bridgend would have been doomed without it. But the company has previously warned that it would have to consider its UK presence in the event of no deal.The problem with Brexit\u0026nbspis that it imposes a cost penalty on every manufacturer in Britain.\u0026nbspThat penalty is theoretical at the moment because we aren’t yet out of the union. But companies like\u0026nbspFord have to look years into the future and without any clear idea about how it will all end up, they’re reliant on worst-case scenarios, such as the imposition WTO style tariffs on goods going in either direction.\u0026nbspWhere the decision on a plant is a marginal one, and even a not so marginal one, Brexit will inevitably tip things over the edge. There is clear evidence that it is already playing a deeply detrimental role when it comes to decisions about investment\u0026nbspmanufacturers are making.Earlier this week,\u0026nbspEY’s regular report into foreign direct investment found a\u0026nbsp35 per cent fall in the money coming into UK manufacturing when compared with 2017. The most recent set of Purchasing Managers’ Index figures showed the sector is now shrinking as the wider economy stagnates.The GMB union, which is doing its best to support its members through what will be a miserable process, says 500,000 manufacturing jobs have gone over the last decade.\u0026nbspMany more redundancies are pending. There are Jaguar’s woes, the closure of Honda’s plant in Swindon, the Sword of Damocles hanging over British Steel.\u0026nbspSet against that, the government’s much-vaunted industrial strategy would be considered a miserable failure except that, as events have rather served to prove, it doesn’t really have one.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

It is still an important part of the UK economy. Particularly in certain specialist areas, Britain is rather good at it, and it still provides thousands of well-paid jobs in places where there aren’t many of those to be had, where there aren’t many alternatives. Places like Bridgend.\u0026nbspTo avoid more of them being plunged into the horror facing that town, this government, or more likely a future one run by people with a little more concern for working people and their jobs, needs to do more than just talk about an industrial strategy. It needs to heed the\u0026nbspGMB’s call for action.\u0026nbspThese events don’t\u0026nbspjust hurt the economy. They\u0026nbspserve to widen the alarming cracks that have opened up in British society, cracks that are being exploited by some very unpleasant people.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Given that many of the people who incur them are under financial stress, that can only be seen as welcome development.\u0026nbspThis sort of policy work can take time (overdraft fees have been a sore point for years), but the FCA is, as a rule, fairly good at it.\u0026nbspCampaigners I have spoken to have also given it high marks for the work it has been doing on financial exclusion, for example. And prior to its overdraft reforms it had capped the interest rates imposed by payday lenders and followed up by clipping the wings of the rent to own sector.\u0026nbspSo, good at policymaking bad at supervisory practice?\u0026nbspThe criticism faced by the watchdog has extended beyond the Woodford mess, about which it could argue that such funds sometimes underperform and investors’ assets are still there. They’ll be able to get their money out once the fund\u0027s illiquid holdings\u0026nbspare sold, albeit probably at a substantial discount.\u0026nbspTake the collapse of bond firm London Capital \u0026amp\u0026nbspFinance, whose unregulated mini bonds left thousands of people out of pocket. It has led to the creation of a judge led inquiry which will, among other things, consider whether the FCA should have intervened at a much earlier stage.\u0026nbspThe regulator has also taken heat over the handling of complaints from small businesses about Royal Bank of Scotland’s Global Restructuring Group, and whistleblowers at Lloyds Banking Group. And there are other such examples.Set against that is the fact that the watchdog employs 3,700 people, of whom just 900 are involved in the frontline supervision of nearly 60,000 firms. Its remit also keeps expanding. Claims management firms and funeral plans are both being added.\u0026nbspIt begs the question: Does the FCA’s apparent slow footedness stem from its failure to effectively utilise its resources? Or does it have enough?Chief executive Andrew Bailey has a case to answer on the former. A couple of years ago one of his first big decisions was to set up a windy review of its mission, which really ought to have been obvious.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.But it’s also true that City firms continually moan about regulatory fees and pay their lobbyists handsomely to ensure those complaints reach the ears of influential politicians.\u0026nbspAgainst that backdrop, it shouldn’t come as a great surprise that the FCA has had to promise to keep its budget flat.\u0026nbspThere is a strong case to be made that for the watchdog to be effective it needs to be able to get more money from its charges.

The company provides automotive and and industrial parts worldwide and the Llanelli plant employs over 200 people. Juergen Ziegler, chief executive for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocateThe number of cars built in the UK in April plummeted by almost half compared with a year ago, with the drop exacerbated by manufacturers bringing forward summer production stoppages in anticipation of a Brexit\u0026nbspthat was ultimately postponed.Ford workers expressed surprise at how soon the decision to shut the Bridgend plant had been made.Len Jones, 48, who has worked at the plant for seven-and-a-half years, said: It\u0027s devastating. Everyone\u0027s got mortgages to pay and families to support.I expected a little more time to get things sorted.When we found out, everyone was just silent. They gave us letters and we just all went home.It\u0027s hard to take in really, even though we expected it. Now it\u0027s official, it\u0027s a bad thing, really.One worker, who gave the name of Stephen, said: When they came out with the statement, you just don\u0027t take it in do you. But, such is life.The writing has been on the wall for a long time. We knew when the Sigma engine finished there was no replacement. We knew when the AJ engine finished there was no replacement. The predicted volumes for new Dragon engine were 250,000, then 125,000, then the last thing we had was for 70,000.Unions described the news as a “hammer blow” for the community in Bridgend and a “grotesque act of economic betrayal”.The GMB union released an analysis on Thursday showing that the UK has lost half a million manufacturing jobs over the past decade.Ford has announced thousands of job cuts globally\u0026nbspthis year, largely affecting white-collar workers, as the company\u0026nbspseeks to shed unprofitable parts of its business.Brexit could mean more robots in UK manufacturingBrexit prompts slowdown in manufacturing as firms shun UK Video reveals how car manufacturing has changed over 50 yearsBrexit causes record rise in stockpilingUntil recently, the company’s\u0026nbspUK factories had not been thought to be immediately at risk as part of those plans.However, it is understood Ford did not replace a major contract to build engines for Jaguar Land Rover\u0026nbspat the\u0026nbspBridgend plant. That work comes to an end next year.Ford also operates a diesel engine plant at Dagenham, east London, and another factory making transmissions in Halewood, near\u0026nbspLiverpool.The Bridgend plant has been under threat because of falling demand for the two engines it makes\u0026nbspand lower projections for the Dragon engine it is scheduled to start making this year. It has been manufacturing engines for 40 years.\u0026nbspFord’s European profits plummeted 82 per cent last year, in part because of a fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote in June 2016.Jeff Beck, a GMB Union regional organiser, said: “Regardless of today’s announcement GMB will continue to work with Ford, our sister unions and the Welsh government to find a solution to the issue and mitigate the effects of this devastating news.“What makes it worse is Donald Trump is in this country talking about a possible trade deal between the UK and the US – yet when the plant closes the new line is likely to be produced in Mexico by an American company.”Len McCluskey, the\u0026nbspgeneral secretary of Unite the Union, said: “Ford’s decision to shut its Bridgend engine plant in 2020 is a grotesque act of economic betrayal.Car industry workers want to leave the EU“These workers and this community have stayed faithful to Ford, as have UK customers – this is still Ford’s largest European market – through thick and thin, but have been treated disgracefully in return by this company.“Ford broke promise after promise to the UK. First, it was that it would build 500,000 engines at Bridgend. That fell to a quarter of a million, then fell again and again to now just 80,000. The company has deliberately run down its UK operations so that now not a single Ford vehicle – car or van – is made in the UK.”The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “I am aware of the reports and I understand that they will be very worrying for workers at Bridgend but the reports are unconfirmed by the company so it is not appropriate for me to speculate or comment further at this time.”Carwyn Jones, a\u0026nbspformer Welsh government leader who is currently an assembly member for Bridgend, told the Press Association: “This has all been very sudden. There was no warning about this at all. It seems to me that any decision, whatever that decision is, would have been taken very recently.“From my perspective, I want to know what’s going on as to with the workers and want to know a reason for the decision, and to work with the Welsh government to see what we can do to help the workers here.“It’s the biggest single employer in the area, I remember it being built in the late Seventies. There are relatively few suppliers locally but there are a number of businesses that provide services for the plant itself and they would be severely affected because for a lot of them this is the only contract they have.”Ford announced last month it was cutting 7,000 white-collar jobs worldwide, with up to 550 expected in the UK.The US manufacturer said the cuts represented 10 per cent of its global salaried workforce and 20 per cent of its management positions.A spokesperson for Unite said: “Our priority is our members’ jobs, the communities and livelihoods in the supply chain that Ford Bridgend supports.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company provides automotive and and industrial parts worldwide and the Llanelli plant employs over 200 people. Juergen Ziegler, chief executive for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocateThe number of cars built in the UK in April plummeted by almost half compared with a year ago, with the drop exacerbated by manufacturers bringing forward summer production stoppages in anticipation of a Brexit\u0026nbspthat was ultimately postponed.Ford workers expressed surprise at how soon the decision to shut the Bridgend plant had been made.Len Jones, 48, who has worked at the plant for seven-and-a-half years, said: It\u0027s devastating. Everyone\u0027s got mortgages to pay and families to support.I expected a little more time to get things sorted.When we found out, everyone was just silent. They gave us letters and we just all went home.It\u0027s hard to take in really, even though we expected it. Now it\u0027s official, it\u0027s a bad thing, really.One worker, who gave the name of Stephen, said: When they came out with the statement, you just don\u0027t take it in do you. But, such is life.The writing has been on the wall for a long time. We knew when the Sigma engine finished there was no replacement. We knew when the AJ engine finished there was no replacement. The predicted volumes for new Dragon engine were 250,000, then 125,000, then the last thing we had was for 70,000.Unions described the news as a “hammer blow” for the community in Bridgend and a “grotesque act of economic betrayal”.The GMB union released an analysis on Thursday showing that the UK has lost half a million manufacturing jobs over the past decade.Ford has announced thousands of job cuts globally\u0026nbspthis year, largely affecting white-collar workers, as the company\u0026nbspseeks to shed unprofitable parts of its business.Brexit could mean more robots in UK manufacturingBrexit prompts slowdown in manufacturing as firms shun UK Video reveals how car manufacturing has changed over 50 yearsBrexit causes record rise in stockpilingUntil recently, the company’s\u0026nbspUK factories had not been thought to be immediately at risk as part of those plans.However, it is understood Ford did not replace a major contract to build engines for Jaguar Land Rover\u0026nbspat the\u0026nbspBridgend plant. That work comes to an end next year.Ford also operates a diesel engine plant at Dagenham, east London, and another factory making transmissions in Halewood, near\u0026nbspLiverpool.The Bridgend plant has been under threat because of falling demand for the two engines it makes\u0026nbspand lower projections for the Dragon engine it is scheduled to start making this year. It has been manufacturing engines for 40 years.\u0026nbspFord’s European profits plummeted 82 per cent last year, in part because of a fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote in June 2016.Jeff Beck, a GMB Union regional organiser, said: “Regardless of today’s announcement GMB will continue to work with Ford, our sister unions and the Welsh government to find a solution to the issue and mitigate the effects of this devastating news.“What makes it worse is Donald Trump is in this country talking about a possible trade deal between the UK and the US – yet when the plant closes the new line is likely to be produced in Mexico by an American company.”Len McCluskey, the\u0026nbspgeneral secretary of Unite the Union, said: “Ford’s decision to shut its Bridgend engine plant in 2020 is a grotesque act of economic betrayal.Car industry workers want to leave the EU“These workers and this community have stayed faithful to Ford, as have UK customers – this is still Ford’s largest European market – through thick and thin, but have been treated disgracefully in return by this company.“Ford broke promise after promise to the UK. First, it was that it would build 500,000 engines at Bridgend. That fell to a quarter of a million, then fell again and again to now just 80,000. The company has deliberately run down its UK operations so that now not a single Ford vehicle – car or van – is made in the UK.”The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “I am aware of the reports and I understand that they will be very worrying for workers at Bridgend but the reports are unconfirmed by the company so it is not appropriate for me to speculate or comment further at this time.”Carwyn Jones, a\u0026nbspformer Welsh government leader who is currently an assembly member for Bridgend, told the Press Association: “This has all been very sudden. There was no warning about this at all. It seems to me that any decision, whatever that decision is, would have been taken very recently.“From my perspective, I want to know what’s going on as to with the workers and want to know a reason for the decision, and to work with the Welsh government to see what we can do to help the workers here.“It’s the biggest single employer in the area, I remember it being built in the late Seventies. There are relatively few suppliers locally but there are a number of businesses that provide services for the plant itself and they would be severely affected because for a lot of them this is the only contract they have.”Ford announced last month it was cutting 7,000 white-collar jobs worldwide, with up to 550 expected in the UK.The US manufacturer said the cuts represented 10 per cent of its global salaried workforce and 20 per cent of its management positions.A spokesperson for Unite said: “Our priority is our members’ jobs, the communities and livelihoods in the supply chain that Ford Bridgend supports.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

David Barnett opens the cellar door that leads to our ‘uncanny valley’Click to followThe Independent‘The dolls that I think most trigger a reaction are the real baby dolls, which are made to look almost completely lifelike apart from their stillness’The chances are that you have, at one time or another, shared a house with at least one doll. Perhaps you owned a baby doll as a child, maybe you display them in adulthood, or have a friend or aunt who does. If you’ve got young children, you probably trip over one on a regular basis. You might be able to see a doll from where you’re sitting right at this minute.Which is surprising, really, considering the received wisdom we get from horror movies and books is that dolls are generally given to coming alive with psychopathic, murderous intent.This summer sees the return of Chucky to the cinema screens in a reboot of the 1988 horror movie Child’s Play. The new film is pretty much a retread of the old one, in which little boy Andy gets a coveted talking Buddi doll named Chucky from his mother. But this toy-of-the-moment has a little added extra the spirit of an evil crook (voiced this time round by Star Wars’ Mark Hamill) which has been transferred into the doll, resulting in slasherific mayhem and carnage.Whether it was meant to be intentionally played for laughs, the original Child’s Play is, on rewatching, more groan-worthy and darkly funny than outright scary, and it remains to be seen whether the remake keeps Chucky as a wise-cracking mini-murderer or presents it as something more chilling.It’s unsurprising that Child’s Play is getting a fresh outing, given the recent success of the Annabelle movies, themselves a spin-off of the Conjuring franchise, loosely based on the supposed real-life exploits of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren.Created with Sketch.

Starring Ellen Burstyn, Linda Blair, Max von Sydow and Jason Miller. The 2014 film revolves around a possessed porcelain doll terrorising a family in 1960s California, and spawned a prequel, 2017’s Annabelle: Creation, and a third movie, to be released this June, Annabelle Comes Home.Demonic dolls have littered the horror scene for decades, perhaps one of the first and most effective instances being the 1945 portmanteau movie Dead of Night, made by the Ealing Studios. Comprised of five interlinked short stories, it’s most infamous for the nightmarish final segment, in which a troubled ventriloquist played by Michael Redgrave is horribly taunted and hounded by his dummy, Hugo.A particular favourite of novelist Sarah Pinborough is the 1978 movie Magic, starring Anthony Hopkins, Ann-Margaret and Burgess Meredith. It features a nasty ventriloquist dummy as well, Fats, who puts his supposed-owner Hopkins through the ringer, and leads him to commit dreadful crimes.Chucky in the original ‘Child’s Play’ (Rex)Rather than out-and-out supernatural, Magic is more of a psychological study, the ambiguity about the washed-up magician’s sanity in line with Pinborough’s own brand of twisty thrillers such as Behind Her Eyes and Cross Her Heart.“It’s an old one but a goodie,” she says. “More a study of madness, really, but creepy as hell.”Pinborough wrote horror novels before her current stardom in the field of domestic noir, though, and has a cautious appreciation of the doll as scary thing.Have horror movies made a monster out of the older woman?“Dolls always make me think of dead children,” she says, and you can almost see her shudder. “Cheery I know! Kind of one breath away from life. And ghosts of children are without doubt the scariest horror movie trope.”There’s also a weird, twisted inversion of the Toy Story animated movies about dolls, she says. In the much-loved Pixar classics, puppets like cowboy Woody are sad because their owner doesn’t want to play with them any more. But what if toys didn’t get mad, but got even?Sarah says:\u0026nbsp“If dolls were to have emotions I can only see bitterness for all the children who grew up, stopped playing with them and abandoned them. I think we also have a weird guilt about the toys we’ve forgotten.”Did she have dolls when she was a child? “A Tiny Tears,” she says. “One of my sister’s Barbies that I stole. And a Girl’s World.”\u0026nbspNow that is a scary idea the horror movie world hasn’t explored yet… the almost-life-sized plastic disembodied head designed for applying make-up and experimenting with hair styles. On the other hand, perhaps a haunted Girl’s World would have to settle for a sharp tongue, not having the hands to grab a sharp knife…Chucky and Tiffany are armed and dangerous in ‘Bride of Chucky‘ (Rex)But dolls are playthings for children, ventriloquist’s dummies are meant to entertain and make us laugh. So why are they so often sources of abject terror? Aside from the fact that any supposedly inanimate object suddenly standing up and grabbing a kitchen knife is going to be obviously terrifying, there’s also the consideration of the “uncanny valley”.This is a term coined in the 1970s, riffing off Sigmund Freud’s theories half a century earlier, which suggests that the more human-like an inanimate thing is, the more unsettling it is. That’s because it never really looks completely human, no matter how good the craftwork that’s gone into it. Even a thing that looks 99 per cent human isn’t, and that disconnect our brain has between something that looks human but is so obviously not is a valley, an uncanny valley, that we just can’t bridge.Dr Steph Lay, of the Open University, has recently completed a PhD that explores the whole idea of the uncanny valley. Why do we, as children, find dolls just ordinary playthings, but see them as creepy and disturbing as adults?The 10 horror films Jordan Peele told Lupita Nyong’o to watch for ‘Us’How Halloween became a horror film for the #MeToo era“There’s growing evidence that there is a developmental aspect to the uncanny response, and some of that is probably linked to the way that our perceptions of people, and particularly faces, develop as we mature,” says Steph. “My research looked at how artificial combinations of emotional expressions in faces could trigger a sense of eeriness, and found that the biggest trigger of eeriness came when a face presented with a happy, smiling mouth and angry or frightened eyes.”Like, for example, a doll, or a puppet, and maybe the tears of a clown. Steph says:\u0026nbsp“The theory behind this is that it cues us into a state where the person we’re looking at is suppressing their real emotions but they are ‘leaking’ out despite that.”In her research, Steph used actors to express different types of emotions, and created faces from blending the pictures so that, for example, the smile was at odds with the look in the subject’s eyes.She says, “In the real world this type of combination can be seen in people who are trying to mask what they actually feel, and that causes us an immediate sense of alarm or danger. This was quite a surprising finding, as all of the literature at the time suggested that expressive faces that had non-expressive eyes – so, realistic computer game avatars that were not able to fully carry that emotional expression into their eyes, for example – would be the eeriest. It turned out that it was the mismatch in expression in different parts of the face that was the biggest driver of eeriness.There’s growing evidence that there is a developmental aspect to the uncanny response, and some of that is probably linked to the way that our perceptions of people, and particularly faces, develop as we mature“This would manifest more in adults than children as the social aspect of learning to trust people is a late-stage development: the eeriness of someone looking to potentially do you harm is quite a subtle cue to pick up on.”Like Sarah Pinborough, Steph had the odd Barbie and Sindy doll growing up, but we don’t seem to find those as unsettling… they’re very obviously toys, not trying to ape a real person like a baby doll is, or imbued with movement and speech like a puppet or ventriloquist’s dummy.“I wouldn’t say dolls like Barbies were particularly creepy in the uncanny valley sense as they were so unrealistic as representations of human that they stayed very firmly on the artificial side of the valley,” says Steph. “The dolls that I think most trigger a UV reaction are the real baby dolls, which are made to look almost completely lifelike apart from their stillness – and some people do animate them to counteract that. I appreciate they’re filling a different niche to children’s play-dolls, but they can be extremely unsettling.”Given that Steph researched dolls and the uncanny valley for her PhD, you might think she’d be immune to them. But does she find them creepy?“Definitely!” she says. “When I started studying the uncanny valley, someone gifted me a Little Apple Doll, with the white face and black eyes, who sat over my desk while I was working and always served as a source of eerie inspiration.\u0026nbsp“I’ve always been fascinated by things that are creepy rather than outright terrifying, so being able to carry our research in this area was a real delight. When I started out, there was very little psychological research into what it was about almost-human entities that gave people that sense of uncanny discomfort, and I was intrigued to fill that knowledge gap to explain the phenomenon a little more.”iStock)For Sarah, puppets have the creepy edge over dolls. “A friend of mine bought me two really old-fashioned puppets for a birthday gift – I mean, WHY – and they never came out of the boxes. I put them in the wardrobe, and then had to put them in the kitchen and eventually put them in a charity shop because they scared me too much. Dolls I don’t find so scary, although the old-fashioned ones made of china owned by old ladies are a different matter.”That said, what if she went to stay at a friend’s house and they had a load of dolls in the guest bedroom? “I’d call a taxi and go and check into a hotel,” she laughs.Between Dead of Night in 1945 and the new Child’s Play and Annabelle movies, dolls and puppets have featured in a host of stories, especially during the heady video nasty years of the 1980s. You probably don’t remember 1984’s Black Devil Doll From Hell, Dolls (1987) or – to prove that nothing in the nursery is safe – 1981’s The Pit, featuring a living teddy bear even more crass than the critter in the Mark Wahlberg comedy Ted.And the original Poltergeist movie in 1982 managed to wrap up several common phobias in one delicious package when a stuffed clown tie came to horrific life and tried to strangle the life out of one of the eight-year-old Robbie from the desperately unlucky Freeling family.Horror film shown instead of Detective Pikachu at Montreal cinemaNetflix criticised for using Lac-Megantic tragedy footage in Bird BoxThe 20 best horror films on NetflixAnimated toys have also been a feature of horror fiction in one form or another. British author Ramsey Campbell’s unsettling The Doll Who Ate His Mother, for example, and Adam Nevill’s House of Small Shadows. Neil Gaiman’s Coraline, which was made into an animated movie, cast a different spin on the idea, with the threat of buttons being sewn on to living children’s eyes, turning them into a whole different type of living doll.“Laura Purcell’s Silent Companions is probably the most effective one that I’ve read,” says Steph. “The avatars in her story have a real sense of menace and malice, and her descriptive language makes them come to eerie life in a beautiful way.”Chucky and Annabelle will be ramping up the creep factor for cinema audiences this summer, and giving us pause to think that what we once considered so innocent and joyful when we were children actually sends a shiver down our spines as grown-ups.And once you start considering the general creepiness of things like that, it’s hard to know where to stop. Disney has had some great success recently with live-action versions of its cherished classic cartoons, such as The Jungle Book and Dumbo. But take a moment to think what would happen if they gave the same treatment to another of its beloved characters, Pinocchio.Can you imagine anything worse than a wooden puppet shrugging off its strings and staggering towards you, chanting over and over again, “I’m a real boy! I’m a real boy! I’m a real boy…”‘Child’s Play’ and ‘Annabelle Comes Home’ will be on general release in cinemas\u0026nbspon 21 June and 12 July respectivelyOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it will also work with the private sector to allow it to use the ISS to test technologies, train astronauts and encourage the development of the space economy, it said.Nasa will also help develop a whole host of private spacecraft, floating around above the Earth, that can serve as a home for people, Nasa said.The tourists\u0026nbsp– whom\u0026nbspNasa refers to as private astronauts – will go on missions of up to 30 days. While there they will perform duties that can include commercial and marketing activity, which will be limited by Nasa\u0027s rules.There can be two of those short-duration missions each year, Nasa said. They will go on privately funded, dedicated spaceflights that will use a US spacecraft, developed under Nasa\u0027s plan to encourage the private sector to build new spacecraft.The private astronauts will still have to pass Nasa\u0027s medical standards and the training procedures to ensure they are safe on board the ISS.Eventually, private companies could use floating habitations like the ISS to stop off at on their way to further destinations deeper in the solar system.Nasa\u0027s decision to open up the space station comes as a variety of companies start to offer the possibility of space tourism in the future. Elon Musk\u0027s SpaceX, for instance, will send a Japanese billionaire and eight artists around the Moon in a private mission slated for 2023.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The effects of melting ice sheets would have diminished the food supplies. People were dependent on herds of horses and reindeer\u0026nbspand were likely impoverished compared to the previously well-fed population.As a result, Azilian tools were often cruder than those of their ice age predecessors.Gliksman, Inrap)The 25cm x 18cm stone was found during archaeological work at an ”ancient hunting site” near Angoulême train station.The institute said the stone will be presented to the public in Angoulême on the National Days of Archaeology between 14 and 16 June, during the “Blue Suns” festival.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So allow me to make it here, because it’s actually a very good idea.Those concerns about overcrowded, creaking commuter trains are real: but they cannot be solved without HS2, or something extremely similar. The problem is that explaining why is quite complicated, so politicians haven’t really tried.Some people seem to think HS2 is about “knocking 35 minutes off London to Birmingham”. It isn’t. Yes, it will dramatically reduce journey times: the whole project will cut London-Manchester from\u0026nbsptwo\u0026nbsphours to one it takes around an hour off the journey to Scotland Birmingham to Newcastle is cut from three\u0026nbsphours 15 minutes down to two hours. Birmingham to Nottingham, which currently takes over an hour, falls to an almost ridiculous 19 minutes. One misconception is that these will be special “high-speed”\u0026nbsppremium services with higher ticket prices for rich passengers. That isn’t true – these will be the ordinary journey times between those cities, integrated into the existing network.Created with Sketch.Extinction Rebellion: Climate change protests cause chaos in London Show all 46Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester gives a thumbs up as he stalls a DLR train at Canary Wharf station in London246 City of LondonProtesters hold up traffic on Upper Thames Street in the City of LondonProtesters hold a banner as they hold up a DLR train at Canary Wharf station in LondonOfficers remove plants that were placed in the occupation of Waterloo BridgePolice officers arrive at Oxford Circus as they prepare to remove protesters during the fifth day of a coordinated protest by the Extinction Rebellion group, April 19An activist waters the plants at the occupation on Waterloo BridgeUndeterred by over 400 arrests, climate change activists continued their demonstration into a fifth day in London with a small protest at the country\u0027s main Heathrow Airport, along with the ongoing protest camps at other iconic locations around the British capitalProtesters with the words \u0027glued on\u0027 written on their hands hold hands as police officers arrive at Oxford CircusOfficers circle the lorry that serves as the central stage to the Waterloo Bridge occupation, repeating their tactic from a earlier at the Oxford Circus occupationOxford Circus reopens after being closed for days due to occupationOfficers prepare to move in on the occupation of Waterloo BridgeActivists relax on a sofa at the occupation on Waterloo BridgeBritish actress Emma Thompson talks to members of the media from atop the pink boat after police officers surrounded the boat being used as a stage as climate change activists occupy the road junction at Oxford Circus  in central London during the fifth day of environmental protesst by the Extinction Rebellion groupAn Extinction Rebellion demonstrator is carried away by police on Waterloo BridgeActivists on Waterloo Bridge have made a garden for their occupation site, April 20Demonstrators began blocking off a bridge and major central road junctions on April 15 at the start of a civil disobedience campaign calling for governments to declare an ecological emergency over climate change, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2025, halt bioersity loss and be led by new citizens\u0027 assemblies on climate and ecological justiceEmma Thompson joins the Extinction Rebellion protest at Oxford Circus.

The objective is capacity, and not just capacity for fast intercity services, either, but for those local regional and commuter services between small towns that have been so neglected. The complicated bit is explaining why that is.Britain’s railways were largely built in the Victorian era, for a different kind of travel. Today, the same lines carry a mix of express intercity trains – the kind which HS2 will take – and stopping local and commuter services, the kind people use to get to work, or pop to a neighbouring town.The colossal HS2 bill could cost the north its much-needed railwayThis mix is a very inefficient way to run a railway, for a reason that is quite obvious if you think about it: trains cannot overtake each other on the same set of tracks. They would bang into the back of one another if they tried. Not good. To get around this, local stopping trains need a large gap behind them in the timetable, so the express trains behind them do not catch up. That reduces the number of trains you can have per hour on a line, dramatically reducing its capacity for every type of service – local and express.The engineering thinking behind HS2 is to take those express services off the older mainlines, leaving them for stopping local and commuter services. When trains are all travelling at roughly the same speed on a line, you can fit a lot more in, because the gaps needed between them are smaller.HS2 will take express trains off the West Coast Main Line that links London with Birmingham and the cities of the northwest the Midland Main Line that links London with the East Midlands and Sheffield and to an extent the East Coast Main Line that goes up to Leeds and Newcastle. That frees up capacity across a huge swathe of the country for local services, and it’s the whole rationale behind the project. That the government hasn’t been explaining this ad nauseum is inexcusable.So if the plan is to improve commuter services, why not build a new commuter line instead of a new one for expresses? It wouldn’t make sense: these existing lines are already good for slow trains, and they go into the centres of towns and cities, which have since expanded around them. A new high-speed line for expresses can make use of engineering advances since the 19th century to speed up journeys, and doesn’t have to go into as many built up areas as a local line would, where the need for tunnelling and demolitions would make it more expensive and disruptive. And making a line high-speed doesn’t actually cost that much more, either, if you’re building one anyway. But the key point is that local services benefit, despite the new line being for express trains.HS2 will also bring other direct benefits to cities and towns that aren’t London. Northern Powerhouse Rail (stupid name) is the government’s plan to connect up the cities of the north of England with high-speed rail. It’s currently in development, but the plan, as put together by northern councils, relies on vast sections of HS2 track. Liverpool to Manchester Sheffield to Leeds and towards York and Newcastle – these bits of NPR will use parts of HS2.The government arguably made a huge mistake by starting planning on the NPR scheme so late, leaving people wondering why they were prioritising journeys to London – but with Labour and the Conservatives both committed to the project, it is likely to happen. HS2 and better connections between non-London cities aren’t an eitheror: the two projects are intrinsically linked. If HS2 is scrapped, who knows when a government will next be brave enough to try a major rail project again.In the meantime, the West Coast Main Line is filling up, and can’t wait. The reason ticket prices are a rip-off from\u0026nbspLondon to Manchester (£175 for a walk-up, one-way, anytime ticket is absurd no matter what cheap advance fares are available – sometimes you just have to travel) is because the trains are running completely full and Virgin can charge what they like and still have a passenger in every seat – and sometimes the floor. The number of passengers using the route doubled between 1997 and 2005, and it is well on its way to doubling again. The huge capacity increase that HS2 brings is a response to that.It’s understandable that people are sceptical of a project that has been badly explained, when it isn’t obvious why it deals with the biggest problems they see with the railways. That said, some criticisms are red herrings. Take the environmental impact: over the 140 miles of HS2 line, 29 hectares of ancient woodland will be felled. Sounds bad? But for comparison, a single 2.5-mile road scheme, widening the A21 in Kent and Sussex (not even a new road!), will take down nine hectares, around a third of HS2’s phase 1 total. Extinction Rebellion are barking up the wrong tree on this one far more road schemes will be needed if we can’t shift traffic to more efficient rail, and that means building more capacity. High-speed rail has also proven the greenest way to get people off short-haul flights, dominating routes like London-Paris or Madrid-Barcelona, where polluting planes would otherwise be king. Long term, it’s good for the environment. And new trees are being planted elsewhere to replace the ones cut down.Why does Britain keep making a mess of its biggest projects?Lords report recommends HS2 rethink as costs spiral ‘out of control’HS2 accused of poor planning and ‘unacceptable’ damage to wildlifeExtinction Rebellion activists camp out in trees to protest HS2‘Thousands’ of trees die on HS2 route for lack of waterAny large project will be disruptive, but compared to the other options, HS2 is actually pretty good. Consider one much-touted alternative: upgrading the West Coast Main Line with an extra pair of tracks for more capacity. There are several thousands houses built facing onto the line, and you’re going to need to knock them down to put a railway there. And it won’t be high-speed, it’ll be more expensive to do it, and it’ll be massively disruptive – not just for people losing their homes, but passengers who would face about a decade of closures and replacement buses. The more general problem with suggestions that existing lines should simply be “upgraded” (a rather vague proposal) is that there are simply diminishing returns to what you can do with 150-year old infrastructure. The West Coast Main Line already benefited from a major upgrade programme ending in 2005 it took a decade of disruption and cost over £10bn in today’s money, provided only a fraction of the benefits of HS2, and is already full. Plans to upgrade it further were abandoned because they weren’t seen as practical, and planning for a new line that became HS2 is a direct result of that process.Will HS2 suffer from cost overruns? Probably. Delays? You bet. Infrastructure projects are rarely delivered on time anywhere in the world, not least in western democracies with little things like rule of law and environmental regulation. But once they are finally delivered, nobody cares: you probably don’t even remember that the Channel Tunnel or Jubilee Line extension were fiascos in their time nobody would get rid of them now. HS2 will be the same. It won’t solve every problem with the UK’s rail network, but it is a necessary part of solving a hell of a lot of them. If it gets scrapped, in 10 years’ time people will be talking about building something very similar, and moaning that we didn’t get on with it when we had the chance.

Over the campaign, thousands of Momentum members knocked on doors and talked to voters in Peterborough, with more than 500 turning out for polling day and activists carpooling from across the country.Face to face conversations coupled with a radical, positive message about how we will transform Britain does win hearts and minds.”Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage\u0026nbsphas tried to claim he never said his party would win in Peterborough.I always said we\u0027d run it close, I never said we\u0027d win it, he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s\u0026nbspToday programme.He said: We came a very, very close second.But here\u0027s the important thing: eight weeks ago today the Brexit Party launched.What you have seen from this result last night is that British\u0026nbsppolitics\u0026nbsphas fundamentally changed, it is no longer just two parties contesting.He urged Tory supporters to vote tactically for his party to take on Labour in similar seats.The danger is that in seats like this the Conservatives split the Leave vote, he said.Polling guru Professor Sir John Curtice told the Today programme that Lisa Forbes, the Labour candidate,\u0026nbsphad set a record for the lowest share of the vote won by a winning candidate in a by-election at 31 percent.\u0026nbspHe said it was a sign of a\u0026nbsp“different political world” where no\u0026nbspparty dominates any particular election.Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said he was delighted with the result in Peterborough - and rebuked journalists for downplaying the fact that Labour had won.\u0026nbspHe said the party had won against the odds and Nigel Farage had left the count before the result was announced.\u0026nbspPressed on Labour\u0027s Brexit policy, he\u0026nbspsaid there should be a second vote in the face of a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe told Today\u0026nbspprogramme: We accepted the outcome of the referendum and we fought to leave on terms that protect our economy.Andy McDonald and Today presenter John Humphrys then had a terrific row over Donald Trump\u0027s interest in the NHS.\u0026nbspAsked about a future US-UK trade deal, McDonald says Trump wants the NHS to be on the table.Humphrys denies this. McDonald says Trump did say it. Cue shouting.Andy McDonald also said he was \u0027discomfited\u0027 by the fact that Labour\u0027s victorious candidate had to apologise over an antisemitism row last week.\u0026nbspHere\u0027s our story from the weekend:Labour Against Antisemitism has put out a statement, describing Lisa Forbes\u0027 election as a dark day for Labour and calling for her to be suspended.Spokesman Euan Phillips said: “When evidence of Ms Forbes allegedly antisemitic views emerged last weekend she should have been forced to stand down immediately, as urged by the Jewish Leadership Council and the Board of Deputies of British Jews.The Labour Party’s only Jewish affiliate, the Jewish Labour Movement also announced it would not be campaigning for Ms Forbes.Instead we witnessed the unedifying spectacle of dozens of Labour MPs - many of whom moderates, who had signed a letter of solidarity with the Jewish Labour Movement as recently as March - streaming up to Peterborough over the last few days to support a candidate who should have been taken off the ballot paper on Sunday.\u0026nbspIt appears that tribalism has trumped principle, and that the policy of zero tolerance for antisemitism has once again been abandoned by the Labour Party.We call for Ms Forbes to be suspended, and will be submitting a complaint to the party in the next few days.”Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u0026nbsphas told the BBC: This win shows that Labour has support all across the piece, all across the country.We are ready for a general election whenever it comes and we will will stop the Tories taking this country into a no-deal Brexit with all the threats to jobs that go with that.Tory leadership hopeful Esther McVey\u0026nbsphas said the result in Peterborough is the shape of things to come if we don’t deliver a clean Brexit on 31 October.\u0026nbspShe said:“Our persistent thwarting of the referendum result shows that a Brexit Party vote will let Jeremy Corbyn into No 10 by the back door.\u0026nbspBrexit is an opportunity to be seized not a problem to be mitigated.\u0026nbsp The UK can thrive after a clean break with the EU, and we will at last be able to show, once again, how a Conservative agenda can kickstart the economy.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She said she had formally raised concerns with the party leadership, adding: “Lisa Forbes and the Labour Party have a lot to answer for.”The Jewish Labour Movement called for the new MP to have the whip suspended immediately.The group said in a statement that Ms Forbes will\u0026nbsphave to go far, far further than her statement at the weekend to demonstrate to our members and the Jewish community that she isn’t racist against Jews.​Ilford North MP Wes Streeting said he had “given up any hope that the Labour leadership is serious about tackling antisemitism, while Birmingham Yardley’s Jess Phillips said she would take Ms Forbes’ apology at face value”, but added: “With every case, the party’s values chip away and our ability to stand up against hate erodes.”Mr Hunt said it was “incredibly disappointing” that Tories had slumped into third place.He warned: “No future for our party until we deliver Brexit – any elections before then will just allow Corbyn to sneak through the middle. But when the UK has Brexited, we will be back.”Mr Johnson said that if EU withdrawal was not delivered by October 31, “we risk Brexit Party votes delivering Corbyn to No 10”, while Mr Raab said any further delay would let Labour into power “by the back door”.But international development secretary Rory Stewart – who has said he is ready to delay Brexit to deliver a deal – challenged his leadership rivals’ reading of the Peterborough result.“We must reach\u0026nbspch across ides to the centre ground and win back younger, Remain voters as well as Leave voters,” said Mr Stewart. “That’s the right and the smart thing to do. And I will do it.”Labour’s win is a reminder of the power of the political party machineCorbyn’s strategy is uninspiring, but it saw Labour over the lineNigel Farage’s Brexit Party fail to win seat in parliamentLabour MP John Mann, who wants Brexit delivered, said the Peterborough result showed that Mr Corbyn must resist internal pressure to commit the party to supporting a second referendum.“The main conclusion to be drawn is that second referendum for the Labour Party is now dead,” he said. “We didn’t lose many votes to the Liberals. The Liberals got half the votes that they did in 2010. The thing that will stop the Labour Party winning the next general election is all this nonsense about a second referendum.“We promised to deliver Brexit. That’s what we need to do, and if we do we will be in power.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s why we support a Final Say on BrexitAnd they challenged the invocation of wartime patriotism by the Leave camp, pointing out that it was Sir Winston Churchill who called for the creation of a “European family” to prevent another descent into bloodshed.Churchill’s words helped inspire the creation of the Common Market, which evolved into the European Union with “one main purpose - to create lasting peace by entwining our economies and societies together on a continent once ravaged by war,” they said.“Nato does not keep the peace in Europe – it keeps peace for Europe. It is the EU that keeps peace in Europe, because when you trade, you do not fight.Created with Sketch.D-Day 75: Normandy landings in pictures Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created

The aid group was not initially registered as a charity but was later required to by the department.“Based on the media fundraising campaign the Commission formed the view that it was a charity and should be registered,” a spokesperson said.Mr Al-Mukthar later resigned as a trustee.Mr Galloway is not a Viva Palestina trustee but did travel to Gaza with the group’s\u0026nbspaid convoy in 2009.The Charity Commission previously investigated and cleared Viva Palestine\u0026nbspof providing aid directly to\u0026nbspHamas, the militant group which controls Gaza.Galloway sacked by TalkRadio after Champions League final remarksBut Mr Galloway did donate £25,000 to\u0026nbspHamas\u0026nbspin a personal capacity.\u0026nbspThose funds were not from Viva\u0026nbspPalestina.In addition, Mr Galloway reportedly donated\u0026nbspa fleet of vehicles to the charity’s convoy, according to the\u0026nbspBBC.The 64-year-old disputed the inquiry’s latest\u0026nbspfindings on Twitter.“Arriving in Gaza 2009 with hundreds of vehicles with “no aid” in them!” Mr Galloway wrote online, in a series of mocking tweets.“Later I would hand bundles of fresh air “to Hamas”. Quite a triumph actually.”“The same journalists who denounced me for years for “delivering aid to Hamas” and tried to have me punished for it now say there was “no aid” at all,” Mr Galloway added.“The 500 trucks crossing the deserts of Arabia to Gaza were a mirage and were empty and dissolved in any case on our departure.”The Commission\u0026nbspopened a statutory inquiry into Viva Palestina on 23 March 2009.In its report the department said it did so after exhausting “all reasonable methods of dialogue with the charity”.Viva Palestina’s trustees also failed to provide any accounts for the commission’s inquiry, in a breach of charity law.The Commission found the charity\u0026nbspinadequately maintained personnel records, had no employment contracts and that trustees failed to\u0026nbsp”properly manage and administer their charity”.Viva Palestina\u0026nbspwas struck off\u0026nbspthe charities register in 2016.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

With concern mounting that the crowded field – which at one point reached 13 contenders – would mean a long and unwieldy election period, Committee officials last week announced a new format designed to cull no-hopers early in the process.Candidates now require the nominations of eight other MPs to stand, rather than the proposer and seconder demanded in previous contests.In a first ballot of Conservative MPs on 13 June, candidates with fewer than 17 votes will be eliminated.\u0026nbspIf all receive 17 or more votes, the least popular goes\u0026nbspout. If there is a tie for last place, officials will speak to the two candidates involved to see whether both should drop out or the ballot be re-run.A second ballot will be held on 18 June, with candidates needing 33 votes or more to survive. Again, if all pass the threshold, the one at the bottom of the list will be removed.By this point, the field should have been considerably narrowed, and further rounds of voting will take place on the following days in the hope of producing a final two by Thursday 20 JuneBetween each ballot, intensive horse-trading can be expected in Westminster as the surviving candidates seek to poach one another’s supporters and hoover up the backers of eliminated candidates.The final two contenders will go through to a postal ballot of an estimated 160,000 party members around the country in July, with the result currently expected in the week of 22 July.It emerged on Thursday that there is no guarantee the new leader’s name will be announced before parliament breaks up for its summer recess, potentially denying the opposition an opportunity to test whether he or she can command a majority in the House of Commons as prime minister.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Quite clearly, it’s a very troubling and difficult time for her and she’ll need to settle down and see what she wants to do.”Ms May clearly values her constituency role – and continues to play it\u0026nbspactively. She has also been a member of the Conservative Party her entire adult life, first standing as an MP in 1992, with a further unsuccessful attempt before winning in Maidenhead in 1997. It feels unlikely she is about to give up life in the Commons.\u0026nbspBut at the same time, she may decide, as Mr Cameron did, that her presence on the backbenches may prove too much a distraction for her successor.\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The letter, and their reply, are not expected to be published.The final day of Ms May’s stint at the Tory helm was marked by defeat at the ballot box, as the party slumped into third place in the\u0026nbspPeterborough\u0026nbspby-election\u0026nbspbehind both Labour and Nigel Farage’s insurgent Brexit Party.Failure to win back a seat that was Conservative as recently as 2015 set the seal on a calamitous period in power for a prime minister who was forced out by her own troops amid electoral debacle and an inability to deliver\u0026nbspBrexit.Having entered office on 13 July 2016 with a promise to take Britain out of the\u0026nbspEuropean Union\u0026nbspand tackle “burning injustices” in UK society, Ms May found her premiership bogged down in Brexit negotiations and failed in three attempts to get her eventual deal through parliament.She had secured the Tory\u0026nbspleadership\u0026nbsptwo days earlier by default, after her only remaining rival\u0026nbspAndrea Leadsom\u0026nbspdropped out of the contest.But she lost her majority in a disastrous general election, held at a time of her own choosing in 2017, and became the only PM in history to have her government found in contempt of parliament.MPs’ votes will take place in conditions of strict secrecy. Ballot papers will be stamped with a committee mark to guarantee authenticity, and the colour of the paper will be changed for each vote, with the colour chosen the night before.MPs will be required to show their parliamentary passes to enter the Westminster committee room where voting booths and two black tin ballot boxes will stand, and only a few will be allowed access at any time during each two-hour voting period.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The average selling price of a property across the UK in May was £237,837 after a 0.5 per cent month-to-month rise.Experts cautioned that Halifax’s index had been an “outlier” in recent months and that other house price measures have consistently pointed to a slowdown, particularly in London and the southeast of England.\u0026nbspNationwide reported that house prices fell 0.2 per cent between April and May and\u0026nbsprose\u0026nbspjust 0.6 per cent over the year.Created with Sketch.

Before that legislation came in, it was possible to call an election with just six weeks notice.As per her five-year term, Conservative leader Theresa May is signed up to the top job until .But since the PM called the disastrous  snap election that lost her Commons majority she has struggled to make much headway at all with Brexit - her most pressing task at hand.This has contributed to her increasing loss of authority, as MPs on both sides of the benches question her ability to cut a deal theyre happy with.On December , , May faced her biggest test yet after enough Tory MPs called for a vote of no confidence in her leadership.She won the challenge, and cannot be challenged again - including from Jeremy Corbyn - for an entire year.However, after the Commons rejected Mays Brexit deal  to , Corbyn tabled a vote of no confidence in the PMs government.This is dferent than the challenge May faced in December because her partys MPs challenged her leadership.The vote went in Mays favour.Tory MPs from both the pro-Brexit and pro-EU wings of the party warned they could face an electoral disastershe goes to the country early.Labour deputy leader Tom Watson has called for a national unity government.In an interview with Prospect magazine, he said: I prefer Labour governments and I hope we never get to a point where our economy or security is so in peril that we get a government of national unity.But shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald, a reported Corbyn ally, told the BBC Today programme a unity government is not the solution.Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis also rejected the idea, insisting a national government is not the answer."},{"url":null,"title":"gcse pass 2019 quiz questions","story":"The exam consists of  questions from a iety of subjects and indicates whether you would succeed in some of the core subjects.

But the family does not get the support it needs.Thousands of kind-hearted Sun readers have already signed Vickey’s letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond demanding he properly funds services — such as respite and overnight support — for parents with disabled children.We hope more of you will show your backing by signing the letter today, because the Kowal family are not an isolated case.Mums and dads up and down the country feel unable to look after their disabled children adequately because they are so exhausted — and they are frustrated at being let down by a system that is meant to help them.When we surveyed parents, just four per cent said they felt they had the support to safely care for their child.More than half have been treated by a GP for depression, anxiety or stress.Ollies grandad Dave helps out when he can, but the family are far from an isolated case - they need your helpIndependent Provider of Special Education Advice- for specialist legal adviceNewle - a charity that provides help with equipmentGOV.UK - to understand your childs entitlementsNational Autistic Society And a huge  per cent of children have gone without therapies, such as physio and speech and language help, meant to improve their lives.This lack of support starts right from diagnosis — with parents being left alone to come to terms with devastating news.They are then left to care for children with complex needs — often through the night — for months or years without any help or respite.This care is often emotional and stressful, and sometimes physical and back-breaking, too.At my charity, Contact — which works with families of disabled children — we hear all the time from those who have to fight for even the most basic provision.Disabled children and their families are desperately struggling because of a lack of support.We want the Government to reinstate the £m of funding it has cut from early intervention services - such as respite care and vital equipment.It is time for the Government to Give It Back.The number of disabled children in the UK has risen to nearly  million over the past  years - up by a third.But funding and support has been cut.Families with some of the most vulnerable children in the country are struggling to cope.That’s why we’re working with the Disabled Children’s Partnership to help them.Together we can make a real dference and hugely improve the lives of disabled children and their families.We want you to share your stories, email us on giveitback@the-sunPlease sign Ollie’s letter to put pressure on the Government to act now.These families are morally — and legally — entitled to help from local authorities, but it is just not forthcoming.It does not need to be like this. All the families want is a little amount of support to enable them to care safely for their child at home.They want a chance to go shopping, a moment to catch up on sleep or have a bath, or time to spend with their other children.This is not about pity or sympathy for disabled children.The families we work with cherish every day spent with their children, who bring real joy and have so much to offer. Instead, we are calling on the Government to help tackle the problem of the lack of support they are given.I have worked in the field of disability for  years, so I know that services have never been perfect.But cuts to budgets, combined with a  per cent increase in the number of children classed as disabled over the past decade, means we have reached a critical point — one where we need to decide what kind of country we want to be.We are talking about some of the most vulnerable children in society, and also children who have the potential to contribute a lot.This is not a campaign based purely on emotion, compassion or wanting to do the right thing, although those are all important.There is a hard-headed economic case here, too. Without putting funding back into services for disabled children, we can guarantee the taxpayer will be faced with a bigger bill in the long-term.That is because when families break down, children can end up in care or needing expensive crisis intervention from local councils or the NHS.Our families are amazing. When the chips are down, people can be remarkable.But most do not want to be amazing, or superhuman — they want an ordinary le.As Sun readers, you can give families up and down the country a real shot at that.Sign Vickey’s letter using this link, and ask which of our potential leaders will be first to agree to Give It Back.Amanda Batten is chair of the Disabled Children’s Partnership, a coalition of  leading charities, and CEO of Contact.Jane Harris, Director of External Affairs at the National Autistic SocietyWe want as many people as possible to sign the open letter calling on the Government to give back the millions that have been cut from support for disabled children.

She had that very self-satisfied expression on her face.Then to stop the interviewer, Piers Morgan, asking her dficult questions, she started gabbling idiocies at  words per second. Like a maling Chatty Cathy doll. It was hilarious. Jabber The Hutt.She made no sense whatsoever. She appeared deranged.Thornberry is the best Labour has to offer. She is easily the most persuasive and talented member of Magic Grandpa’s frontbench. Yes, sure, that isn’t saying much. But here she was utterly lost.And you could see, as she wittered on, the end in sight for a great political party. One I was proud to be a member of for  years. A party which was once great, but now makes no sense whatsoever. A party suffused with hypocrisy.Thornberry was trying to explain why Jeremy Corbyn and the party were so hostile to Donald Trump. And she had no answer. How could she, when Corbyn is happy to call terrorists his friends — but has no time for the democratically elected leader of the free world When Corbyn and his cronies offer support for Socialist catastrophes such as Venezuela. Or totalitarian dictatorships such as Cuba, where trade unionists and homosexuals are imprisoned.Under Corbyn Labour has become a party of educationally challenged, far-left, perpetual adolescents, hostile not only to all of Britain’s allies but to Britain itself. It no longer represents the working class it was set up to protect. If it represents anyone at all it is the affluent, virtue-signalling, metropolitan middle class. And even they are drting away from Labour, appalled by its rank anti-Semitism.This genuinely could be the end of Labour. Despite the worst Government in living memory, it still struggles to hold a lead in the polls. In the Euro elections it was beaten out of sight by the Lib Dems and lost ten seats. Unheard of for the official opposition party! It’s only a matter of time before the Greens overtake Labour.Labour dumped the working class because it thought it could rely on the host of tribes in the UK, some of whom consider themselves victims. Gays, transgender people, Muslims, feminists, black and ethnic minorities.But the trouble is, those supposed “victims” do not agree with each other, or wish to be portrayed as victims.Some radical feminists don’t like the transgender activists, some Muslims don’t have much time for the gays or the feminists. So the whole thing has fallen apart. And it has fallen apart because it is based on a fallacy.Some Labour MPs have already deserted the party to join the hilarious Change UK.They would have been better off joining the Lib Dems. Other decent Labour MPs — Kate Hoey, Frank Field, Caroline Flint — soldier on in the hope that Magic Grandpa will one day be gone. They’ve been hoping that for four years, but there’s no sign of it happening. The truth is, the party is lost to them.Many commentators have suggested that Brexit may see the end of the Tory Party.So it might. But more surely, it will see the end of the Labour Party. It is ideologically bankrupt. It has outlived its useful purpose.THE Brexit Party looks set to win today’s important by-election in Peterborough.People are rightly furious that the liberal establishment and the major parties have effectively thwarted the people’s will. They want to teach Labour and the Conservatives a lesson.I voted for Nigel Farage’s party in the Euro elections – but I wouldn’t dream of doing so in Peterborough.They have no policies, other than Brexit. And their candidate is making stuff up on the hoof. Champagne for everyone! This is utterly dishonest.The truth Nigel and Co are not telling voters is that the Brexit Party is deeply hostile to the working class.Farage has talked about privatising the NHS. He has no time for nationalising our energy companies, or decreasing the ide between rich and poor in our country.OK, I’m biased – as you can see from the above photo. Butyou are a Leave voter but care about social equality too, there’s only one candidate to vote for in Peterborough – Patrick O’Flynn of the SDP.CONGRATS to Peter Crouch and Abbey Clancy on the birth of their baby boy.Crouchie joked the kid would be called Divock Samrat, after the Liverpool striker Origi and his favourite curry house.Abbey’s not having it, though.So here’s a thought – what about Roderick  Nobody calls their kids Roderick any more.Actually, nobody ever did, apart from my mum and dad. And I was lucky, it was almost Sebastian.THE Conservative Party is dying on its feet. But there are still plenty of munchkins who fancy being its boss.There were a dozen candidates until Tuesday, when one bloke I’ve never heard of pulled out.Several more people nobody has heard of fancy a go. Boris Johnson is favourite, of course – but the Tories are weird people and rarely,ever, choose the front runner.If they’re sensible they’ll go for someone who is actually conservative – someone like Esther McVey.

He has described Judaism as a “gutter religion”.He has called Jewish people “bloodsuckers”. And he described Adolf Hitler as being a “great man.”So who would defend a piece of crap like this  Who would say of him: “Mr Farrakhan is not anti-Semitic and does not preach a message of racial hatred and antagonism” Step right up – Sadiq Khan, London’s mayor, and the man who has spent the last couple of years flinging insults at Donald Trump.You know where you are with the Labour Party, don’t you Always available to support Jew-haters or anyone who despises our culture and way of le.Always available to be contemptuous of our friends and allies.DID you see the face of that woman protesting about Donald Trump’s visit She is called Siobhan and screamed “Nazi!” at a bloke who was supporting the US President.It was a face contorted with hatred, full of rage and spite. Just because someone disagreed with her. Everyone who disagrees with her is a Nazi. Only she is right.Siobhan has since apologised, kind of. But it cuts no ice with me. Nor was I surprised she worked in the NHS.

Can Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party win this core Middle Britain seat Dficult, but it would be a heck of a result and could do to those insects in Westminster what a dose of Sarson’s does to the winged pests that erupt from house walls on hot days.EvenFarage does not pull off a cup upset in Peterborough, Westminster is starting to get jumpy. About time, too! Theresa May quits the Tory leadership tomorrow and the race to succeed her has begun with almost as many runners as the Grand National.Quite a few of them will end up in the glue factory.Prince Charles’s pro-EU pal Rory Stewart, the little-known International Development Secretary, has made a wonderful fool of himself by standing for the job. Stewart has filmed selfie videos presenting himself as man-of-the-masses, in places such as, er, genteel Kew Gardens.Deluded commentators in the Westminster village have praised his social-media “outreach”. It’s the political elite’s echo chamber at work again.On Tuesday evening Stewart stood on a box at Speaker’s Corner in London’s Hyde Park, to “speak to the people”. What a gumby. The only bystanders at Speaker’s Corner these days are tourists, ice-cream vendors and a few winos.If Stewart really wants to meet the people to see what they think of his plan to soften Brexit to the point of non-existence, he should haul himself off to somewhere like Asda in Walsall, in the West Midlands.Brummies would soon let him know exactly what they thought of his proposal to ignore the  referendum’s .million Leave voters.Meanwhile, the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock , polished his credentials to be Tory leader by releasing a video of himself playing office cricket with a few of his civil servants. I had to watch this stunt twice just to make sure it wasn’t a spoof from Armando Iannucci, one of the sharp comic brains behind Alan Partridge.Not that Hancock is the silliest of the bunch. Sam Gyimah, an obscure former junior minister, was last night persisting with his leadership campaign even though he did not have the declared support of a single MP .This was almost pathetic in the proper sense of the word — ie enough to make you feel sad for the bloke. But in the end I’m afraid my heart remained unmoved. Gyimah simply looked a prat.Labour’s comrades are at each other’s throats, the Lib Dems have their own leadership contestand the Change UK brigade, just a few weeks after their creation, are disintegrating like one of strongman Geoff Capes’s deckchairs. More than half of them quit, leaving a rump that will be led by spluttering Anna Soubry, as shouty as a Jack Russell snapping at a postie’s ankles.All this was happening while Hurricane Trump blew into town and gave half-pint London Mayor Sadiq Khan a few home truths. The President also showed Jeremy Corbyn to be two-faced, revealing that Corbyn — who happily joined a rally where Trump was slandered as a fascist — had begged him for a one-to-one meeting. The crawler.Looking at this turmoil, you might think: “That’s it, I’m emigrating to strong, stable Venezuela.” Don’t book your ticket to Caracas just yet.Call me a crazy optimist, but I think the mayhem in our politics is healthy — a sign that it’s finally sinking into Westminster’s blockheads that they need to start reflecting and stop blocking public opinion.Theresa May first. The PM’s departure was so often predicted that it is hard to believe she and husband Philip are finally emptying their smalls drawers at No.But after her tearful announcement two weeks ago in Downing Street, there is no way back for Madam Glumbucket. A nation mourns  Don’t let’s put it that strongly but nor should we gloat.Allow her a decent adieu. She occupied high office with dignity and seriousness and was not tacky, like some recent PMs. There was no Carole Caplin or Lord Levy in her coterie, thank goodness.If that was an example of politicians learning from their predecessors’ mistakes, might the same be happening with the EU crisis  Tory and Labour MPs have been terried by the rise of Farage’s Brexit Party.Peterborough was a swing seat won by Labour in  by now-disgraced Fiona Onasanya, jailed after trying to cheat a motoring offence.Whatever the result, the Peterborough campaign showed that neither of the two main parties can take Middle Britain for granted.That has made northern Labour MPs wary of seeking a second referendum. And it has caused a big change in the Tory leadership election campaign.Front-runner Boris Johnson and his main rivals Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt, Dominic Raab and Sajid Javid are all being much more ballsy about a No Deal Brexit.The three Remain candidates — Hancock, Stewart and Gyimah — are trailing badly. It is hard to say who will win but , as likely, it is Boris, Gove or Raab, the next PM should be much more in tune with public opinion.Meanwhile, the determinedly anti-Brexit Tory MP Phillip Lee looks doomed after a row with his activists in Bracknell. The people are revolting!With an opinion poll having now suggested that the Brexit Party may have a national lead, MPs on both sides of the Commons are finally clocking the possibility that they could lose their seats.Ouch. That’s the sting of vinegar in their eyes. It’s the only remedy for their arrogance. Folks, keep squirting. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I love you with all my heart. Have a good trip, dear Noa.Noa penned an award-winning autobiography, called Winning or Learning, detailing her struggles with mental health, which included attempted suicides.Explaining her decision to end her le to Dutch newspaper the Gelderland last year, Noa said: Out of fear and shame, I relive the fear, that pain every day. Always scared, always on my guard. And to this day my body still feels dirty.My house has been broken into, my body, that can never be undone.If you, or anyone you know, needs help dealing with mental health problems, the following organisations provide support:The day before she died, she posted a message to her followers on Instagram: “I deliberated for quite a while whether or not I should share this, but decided to do it anyway.“Maybe this comes as a surprise to some, given my posts about hospitalisation, but my plan has been there for a long time and is not impulsive.“I will get straight to the point: within a maximum of  days I will die. After years of battling and fighting, I am drained.”“I have quit eating and drinking for a while now, and after many discussions and evaluations, it was decided to let me go because my suffering is unbearable.”“I breathe, but I no longer live.”She then asked her friends not to “convince me that this is not good, this is my decision and it is final. Love is letting go, in this case.”Dutch minister Lisa Westerveld, who first made contact with Noa in December after her newspaper interview, visited the -year-old before she died.She said: It was nice to see her again. It is also very unreal. Noa was incredibly strong and very open. I will never forget her. We will continue her struggle.Hollands Health minister Hugo de Jonge today dismissed reports that the teen has died as a result of euthanasia.He said: We are in touch with her family, who have told us that, despite international media reports to the contrary, there is no question of euthanasia in this case.If you, or anyone you know, needs help dealing with mental health problems the Samaritans can be contacted on  , or visit Mind’s website Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

pinning down a fleeing human. An investigation is underway into exactly how they escaped but they are known to slip through gaps cut in fences by poachers or under fences when earth is washed away by

intelligence officials strongly suspect China of having orchestrated the attack, which targeted bank numbers, tax details, and academic records going back  years, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.Authorities have described the attack as “sophisticated”, indicating it was almost certainly the work of a government as opposed to a criminal or political group.China is one of the few countries thought to be capable of pulling off such a large hack, and officials are concerned that it intends to use the information to groom a new generation of spies.The Australian National Universityin Canberra, whose alumni include prime ministers, diplomats, and military leaders, revealed the attack on Tuesday.Vice chancellor Brian Schmidt said the university had detected an “unauthorised access to signicant amounts” of data.He added that the breach had begun late last year but had only been detected a fortnight ago, meaning the hackers had access to the data for at least five months.The breach comes after the Australian government’s elite spy agency last year helped the university improve its cyber defences.It is thought Chinese intelligence services could have developed tactics used during the Cold War by the Soviet Union, who succeeded in recruiting future informants while they were still students.The best known case is that of the Cambridge Five, a group of five British diplomats and spies who were found to being working for the Soviet Union having been recruited at the University of Cambridge.In , British civil servant John Vassall was blackmailed into becoming an informer for the KGB after a honey trap operation in Moscow produced photographic evidence that he was gay, still illegal in Britain at the time.A year later, a similar operation was conducted against American journalist Joseph Alsop, but instead of handing over information he wrote a piece detailing the incident and including a history of his sex le.This attack is the latest in a series on Australian public bodies in recent years.In February, MPs were told to reset their passwords amid fears of an attack on the parliamentary computing network, while  and  saw high-profile attacks on the government’s weather and statistics agencies.The revelations could raise concerns about the vulnerability of British universities to similar attacks.He added that China is very active in the world of cyber intelligence.But he also said that organisations like universities tend to have systems in place to guard against attacks of the sort seen in Australia.“Some universities are better than others at checking their networks regularly for unusual activity, he said. For a breach to go undiscovered for five months is very unusual today, because of the intrusion detection systems we have now that can raise a red flag.“I like to think British universities are some of the best in the world on this, but there’s no such thing as an unhackable system."},{"url":null,"title":"primary school tweets piers morgan fascist","story":"The shocking insult was tweeted from the official Twitter account of Gowerton Primary School in Swansea, Wales, at around pm yesterday.The Good Morning Britain host was sat alongside MPs Nicky Morgan, Anneliese Dodds, Drew Hendry and Alison Phillips from the Daily Mirror.Donald Trump and Brexit were among the topics debated on the BBC show.The school tweeted: I dont normally comment on twitter but watching Piers Morgan on Question Time.

It was very clearly just urine.There have been a number of stabbings in Mile End in recent months.On May , a -year-old man died after being kned in broad daylight the day before.A man and woman were injured in a doubled stabbing on April .And last December a teen was kned in the same park where Alastair’s attackers struck.Alastair said: “I did hesitate for a second because I thought maybe there are knives.“But it became clear they were not armed.

I mean ears. I, Nigel Farage, hereby declare victory in the Peterborough by-election that was called after its last MP was jailed for being a bit of a rotter. This was a glorious victory for the Brexit Party, an earthquake that has rocked the political Establishment to its core. I only wish Iaposd been standing for election myself, but unfortunately topping up the Brussels pension pot takes up too many seconds in the week. But I congratulate our candidate, Whatsisname, for so decisively proving that all the polling, experts, voters, milkshake purchasers and D-Day veterans are wrong, and that this country has clearly demanded that No Deal Brexit Iaposve been advocating. The mere possibility of this currency speculatorsapos wet dream actually manesting so terries the elites of this country that it has already contributed to the loss of , jobs in the car industry, which just goes to show that a Hard Brexit will get us all working, upskilling, innovating, and ing to a more traditional way of le in which our children must catch and skin rabbits to survive. Thataposs how we won the war, just ask the RAF. This was the first real test of the Brexit Partyaposs message, after the referendum, the general election, the constant opinion surveys, the  years of Tory infighting and all the Parliamentary rowing about exactly the same thing. And itaposs been definitively positive, in that we scored a totally unpredicted victory, coming first in a long list of runners-up. Westminster is running scared from a fledgling enterprise that has been able to do that only a few weeks after being incorporated at Companies House, raising six-figure sums from gullible members of the public at proto-fascist rallies, and massive donations from people whose foreign assets may well increase in valuethereaposs a crash in the pound. The fact the Labour Party technically got more votes is, to be honest, a shocking loss for Jeremy Corbyn who really needs to consider his position, in my view.  As you will see from the comments below this article, the fact that a corrupt electoral system counted bits of paper to decide the winner just proves how gross the stitch-up was. It was there in the leisure centre for all to see, and I was so disgusted by it that I was forced to leave before I had to answer questions about why there werenapost more bits of paper for us. The answer is obvious, isnapost it  I donapost need to say it. Jeremy Corbyn is in the pay of mysterious millionaires funding his luxury lestyle of allotments and old jumpers. I wouldnapost be surprised to find a Russian link,only my friends at the FBI would investigate him. Iaposll ask them about it next time they speak to me. The only reason that Labour can pretend to have won this vote is that its agents have clearly paid off the BBC, ITN, the Communists at Channel , several dozen council volunteers, , or so voters and the Peterboroughwhich, I understand, is staffed by a cabal of Marxists working to destroy this great British democracy. The Illuminati then used mind magic and psychic jiggery-pokery to convince the ing officer that they needed to use maths to work out who had won, when in fact all they needed to do was ask me. Itaposs perfectly clear, from all the entirely-biased people I speak to in those brief periods when Iaposm not making love to a TV camera, that I am the rightful Prime Minister.  I have been told by a source, you wouldnapost know him, he goes to another school, that this election was stolen by pencil manufacturers using time-limited lead in their products. Government scientists changed the radioactive signature of the lead so it decayed moments after being put inside a ballot box. Those who today have called this a victory for Corbynaposs policy of constructive ambiguity, or Labour votersapos widespread hope for a second referendum with a Remain outcome, have clearly not listened to everything I have said for the past  years about how Brexit is going to destroy Labour and Iaposll clean up in all its constituencies.Itaposs only because some of the voters decided to vote for other parties that our victory was not more obvious. If there hadnapost been , people who voted for the wrong guy in a blue rosette, andthe Liberal Demcorat Remoaners had sent their % swing our way, andturnout hadnapost been so big for a by-election, we would indisputably be forming a government by now. In fact, I think Iaposll form one anyway. I understand this is how things are done in Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Armenia, Hungary, the Congo and other well-recognised bastions of the democratic world, and Britain really should be learning from its potential international trading partners and let them lead the way in the post-Brexit moonscape that only I and that other bloke in the pub can deliver.  Predictably, there are those who will do anything to block the Brexit Partyaposs inexorable and righteous path to power. And to all those who voted for someone , I say this: youaposre just Peterbitter. Weaposre six points ahead nationally, which is where voting really matters. Who cares about Cambitchshire  Votes like this are very minor, I should know because Iaposve lost votes like this  times myself and that didnapost stop me being a winner.Iaposll come up with other nicknames for you in due course, but itaposs clear to me that youaposre just stone cold loser PETERBONEHEADS. Thataposs why, today, I have attended Downing Street to deliver a letter to Theresa May, telling her in person of our fantastic win and the thumping defeat of her woeful and, frankly, transparent attempts at forcing Britain to remain in the European Union. The fact the press call was planned when we were expecting to win, and wasnapost cancelled when we didnapost, is because it didnapost happen. Anyone who tells you otherwise is just fake news. YOUR MUM IS FAKE NEWS. Our by-election glory proves that I deserve a role in the Brexit negotiations weaposve already had, the EU wonapost reopen and I couldnapost possibly add anything useful to. A democracy needs the losersapos consent to govern, which is why we should ignore the .m people who voted Remain in  and hand the reins of power to the CEO of the Brexit Party whose greatest achievement so far is to get people to vote for more European representation. What these negotiations for a deal that I donapost want really need is some jingoistic sabre-rattling from an unpainted Pennywise at the head of a non-army of gay cure lunatics, IRA sympathisers and people who have no idea what war is like because the EU stopped them having to fight one.  I trust the Prime Minister will agree with me, the REAL Prime Minister, that democracy is all about doing what a shrinking minority wanted to do once ages ago, and that it is in Britainaposs best interests to end the uncertainty of relying on the ,-year-old Parliamentary system when,we just used the First Past Nigelaposs Post-Prandial Approval voting system, we could do what my paymasters want instead. We have the biggest democratic mandate of modern imagination, and I stand ready to serve. Please do not mention the fact that I appear to be shrinking before your very eyes, or you vill be shot.

She added: I am really sorryI hurt anyone, I never had any intention to do that. I engaged with some posts in error and I never had any intention to hurt anyone I will be reaching out to the Jewish community as soon as possible to try and explain and to learn.    Prominent Labour backbencher Jess Philips today said Ms Forbes election demonstrated that that anti-Semitism is becoming normal in the party.  Ms Phillips MP for Birmingham Yardley said that while she was glad the Brexit Party had been defeated in Peterborough I cannot begleeful or proud as Iaposd want to be because of how it shows that anti-Semitism is becoming normal in the party. She added: Lisa ignored and endorsed anti-Semitic things, Iaposll take her explanation and apology at face value and look forward to her proving, as others have, that actions, not excuses alone can heal. But with every case, the parties values chip away and our ability to stand up against hate erodes. Today the Jewish Labour movement demanded Ms Forbes go far further in her apology.    A spokesperson added: “This has encouraged a culture to develop where not only is it acceptable for someone who has shared racist material and rejected the internationally accepted IHRA definition of anti-semitism to be a member, but they can advance politically and gain public office. “Ms Forbes will have to go far, far further than her statement at the weekend to demonstrate to our members and the Jewish community that she isn’t racist against Jews. In a damning conclusion, they demanded that Ms Forbes should have the whip suspended immediately. Last week the Equality and Human Rights Commission said they were conducting an investigation into Labour over complaints of anti-semitism in the party. Labour pulled off the shock win by just  votes after a campaign which insiders praised as being a victory for shoe leather over showboating. Hundreds of party activists flooded the seat on Thursday to deliver the narrow win over Mr Farageaposs insurgent party. Today Mr Corbyn said the party won because it offered the politics of hope, not the politics of fear. He added: Everybody, all the experts wrote Lisa off. All the experts wrote Labour off yesterday. Write Labour off at your peril. He said the result would not change Labouraposs policy on a second Brexit referendum - yet. However, Labouraposs share of the vote was slashed to %, with Mr Farageaposs new outfit on %.    Mr Corbyn also doubled down on his partyaposs Brexit fudge. He told campaigners and journalist during a victory lap of the city: As our conference resolution was agreed last September, we would then be prepared to put that to a public vote. We’re not at that stage yet when where Parliament has actually voted on that and I think it would be much betterthere was a general election The result was disastrous for the Tories, who were shunted into third on just %. Today Nigel Farage didnapost take a moment to reflect on his partyaposs defeat, blaming Labouraposs superior political machinery for the defeat, instead of handing a letter into Downing Street to demand involvement in the Brexit negotiation process. The letter addressed to the Prime Minister and copied to all the Conservative leadership candidates, reads: The electorate have asked for us to come into the negotiating team and we are ready to do so immediately.

Elaine Malocco, boyfriend Peter Benham and their three dogs are being kicked out of a three-bed property in Birmingham. The pair have been renting their home privately for the past four years, paying £-a-month. However, due to ill health and struggling to find work, both Elaine and Peter fell behind with their rent, claiming they owed six monthsapos worth.They said a payment plan was set up with their landlord, Birmingham Live reports.   But, after complaining about the kitchen ceiling which was falling through and the soaking-wet carpets, Elaine and Peter say they were told they must leave. It was all fine up until I mentioned about the state of the house, said former nursery nurse Elaine, . Four weeks ago my kitchen ceiling came through. Thereaposs pipes exposed, wires hanging from the walls and water everywhere the carpets are wringing wet. The kitchenaposs a health hazard, itaposs full of black mould and stinks of stagnated water. I canapost even store food in there, I keep it all in the dining room. Carpets are all wet in the bedroom, itaposs damp and Iaposm suffering terribly. Iaposve got a skin condition called chronic urticaria idiopathic.    My skin puffs up and flares up around my eyes and mouth. It looks like Iaposve had a fight with Mike Tyson! Itaposs so bad. The house is literally falling down and, on countless occasions, Iaposve tried to help and have paid for paint and stuff to help spruce it up. It got to the point where we could no longer have visitors around. The water is brown, taps are wrong and my friendaposs son scalded himself. The whole house is a bodge job and itaposs been falling apart ever since we moved in back in . For £ a month over four years, itaposs absolutely disgraceful - especially when your landlord doesnapost want to do anything to it and just wants to take your money.    Iaposm that upset about it because I have put my absolute all into this house - and this is the thanks we get, kicking us out  The boiler leaks, radiators leak. Itaposs a state and I kept questioning the landlord to sort it but then he turned all of a sudden. Elaine and former factory worker Peter were hit with a possession order in early February and, on June , bailfs are due to evict them and clear the property. After both falling out of work in , the couple claim to have been living off less than £ a week and have struggled to keep up with bills. Weaposre going to be homeless this time next week and itaposs not fair, added Elaine, who has an American Bulldog, Staffordshire Bull Terrier and a Bulldog-Staff cross.    Weaposve got nowhere to go, no-one to go to. Iaposve got three rescue dogs and one is just  months old. The landlord just wants us out. Iaposve had the police out over threats and abuse directed at me in the street. Birmingham City Council havenapost helped me at all during what has been an incredibly upsetting time for me and my partner. I was told I could book in for an Environmental Health officer to inspect the property, only to be told officers do not come out to do such visits. Itaposs absolutely disgusting how I canapost go onto be registered on the Birmingham housing list because my landlord wants me out - yet itaposs acceptable to live like this  Iaposm being restricted to get on the housing register because the landlord wonapost accept my payment plan. Yet, he gets away with charging all that rent only for us to be treated like something off the bottom of his shoe  I just donapost know what to do, Iaposm going to be homeless. A Birmingham City Council spokesman said: Ms Malocco contacted the councilaposs private rented sector team on August ,  to report a number of issues at the property and we wrote to her landlord on the same day to request that the repairs were carried out within  days. We made several attempts to contact Ms Malocco the following month to check that the repairs had been carried out but received no response and so the case was closed.    Ms Malocco contacted the council again in November  to discuss concerns over rent arrears and was signposted to the StepChange debt charity for advice. Due to her rent arrears, Ms Malocco does not currently qualy to join the councilaposs housing list, but will qualy once this debt has been cleared in full or she is able to demonstrate that she is adhering to a payment plan to pay off the arrears. If she doesnapost have any alternative accommodation to go to once she has left her current accommodation, we advise her to attend our Newtown Housing Option Centre so that her needs can be assessed at a housing options interview and temporary accommodation providedrequired. The landlord was unavailable for comment.

When Rebecca Mountain first saw Paul Mason on a TV documentary about his dramatic weight loss she fell head over heels for the Ipswich man. At his heaviest the ex-postie had weighed  stone and was officially the fattest man in the world. Having shed a jaw-dropping  stone, Paul flew out to America and quickly became engaged to Rebecca. For years the couple were smitten with each other and enjoyed a great sex le until one day Rebecca came home to discover a loaf of bread - a clear breach of the diet they were supposed to be on together.    She told The Sun: “I came home and there was a big loaf of bread on the refrigerator. We had an agreement that we were not going to tempt each other. I felt he wasn’t taking my feelings into consideration. In the weeks after he went back to his old habits. He said he was getting bored with what we were eating, and his portion sizes more than doubled.  His bedroom was the living room and he was eating at night.”    Paul left the house they shared together in July before heading back to the UK for treatment on the NHS. His dramatic weight gain came after he shed more than two thirds of his body weight following a gastric band operation in .  During his peak he was wolfing down , calories a day, with six portions of chips for lunch and McDonaldaposs burgers for dinner. Sleeping in a reinforced bed in his bungalow, Paul was convinced he would never find himself in a romantic relationship. But when Rebecca saw how heaposd turned his le around on documentary aposEating To Death: The World’s Fattest Manapos she began to prove the -year-old wrong. Following a whirlwind romance she popped the question to Paul on US chat show The View, presented by TV legend Barbara Walters.    At the time he told the Mirror: “It’s really sweet. I have never felt like this before. Meeting Rebecca is the best thing that has ever happened in my le. “When you get the other side of  you start thinking le has passed you by. I was  in December and I did wondermarriage would ever happen for me. “I was speechless when she proposed - I wasn’t expecting it. My emotions just took over and all I wanted to do was give her a kiss. I was just so overwhelmed and a little tongue-tied. I kissed her in front of a live studio audience of  people in New York.” Rebecca said the attraction was instant from the moment she first met Paul in person.    The cat furniture business owner said: “Right from the beginning we both knew we had emotional chemistry which connected us very quickly. “A lot of very small things added up to the big things of how we are attracted to each other. People kept asking me: ‘Was Paul what you expected ’ But it was not like that. What happens is the chemistry that connects you emotionally drives the physical attraction which naturally follows.    I was instantly attracted to Paul’s personality. That is what drove our relationship. Paul continued his weight loss journey when he joined Rebecca in Massachusetts, adopting her diet of oatmeal for breakfast and pasta and salad for main meals. However, by  the extent of Paulaposs issues with food were made clear, leading to couple to mutually split and the Brit to move into a boarding house.    After two years of living alongside drug addicts Paul was asked back by Rebecca. They were happy for a while until she came home to discover he had broken the paleo diet they were on together. When he moved out last summer Paul found refuge with a morbidly obese close female friend who, Rebecca said, fed him sweets. Things took another downward turn for Paul when he was caught shoplting twice, with the second haul consisting of £ of fast food. His weight problems have also spiralled and he now weighs  stone. With an uncertain future ahead of him Paul has ed to the UK to find help for a catalogue of issues that include eight hernias in his stomach, severe knee pain and “crippling” arthritis. He will have to get painkillers and other drugs, which cost £, a month in the US, as well as the gastric band replacement, which costs £,.

Compass Pools describe the structure as the only building in the world to incorporate a -degree infinity pool.    The pool will be made from cast acrylic and will feature transparent sides and floors, so visitors below will be able to see swimmers splashing around above them. There are no permanent stairs for the pool - instead a spiral staircase that rotates and rises through the water to provide access. The designers envisage that the pool will sparkle like jewel-topped torch at night, with the building fitted with a collection of lights. Compass Poolaposs swimming pool designer and technical director Alex Kemsley said: We faced some quite major technical challenges to this building, the biggest one being how to actually get into the pool. The solution is based on the door of a submarine, coupled with a rotating spiral staircase which rises from the pool floor when someone wants to get in or out - the absolute cutting edge of swimming pool and building design and a little bit James Bond to boot.    He added: “Architects often come to us to design roof top infinity pools, but rarely do we get a say in the building design because the pool is usually an afterthought. “But on this project, we actually started with the pool design and essentially said, ‘how do we put a building underneath this ’ “When we designed the pool, we wanted an uninterrupted view, both above and below the water. The pool will be fitted with a built-in anemometer to monitor wind speed, and will be linked to a computer-controlled building management system that will regulate the poolaposs temperature and ensure water doesnapost spill onto the streets below. The water will be heated using waste energy from the buildingaposs air conditioning system. The designers also plan for a five-star hotel to sit underneath the pool in the top stories of the skyscraper Construction of the pool could begin in partners and contractors are confirmed. The designers do not mention how they plan to get , litres of water to the top of a -storey building which is one of many complex technical challenges the structure will face.

The -month-old toddler suffered serious injuries in the attack, which left her with fractures to her skull, bruises and a bite mark on her arm. Thomas Dunn, , carried out the sickening abuse at his flat in Arbroath, Scotland, on January  last year. He took her to hospital when he found she was unresponsive. Following a five-day trial at Dundee Sherf Court, a jury found Dunn guilty of endangering the childaposs le by repeatedly striking her on the head and body and striking her against an unknown object or objects.  He was also found guilty of culpable and reckless conduct over an earlier incident that saw him place the girl in a tumble dryer at his home, in the presence of the childaposs mother. Giving evidence during the trial, she said she heard a thud and turned around to see her in the machine with the door closed. Referring to the later assault, Sherf Alastair Brown told Dunn he must have hit that little girl extremely hard at least twice in order to inflict what were potentially le-threatening injuries.  He said it was only by her good fortune and perhaps yours that Dunn was not tried at the High Court of Justiciary on a charge of murder. The Sherf said he did not feel his sentencing powers were adequate to punish the monstrous assault and the tumble dryer charge, and the case would be referred to the High Court. The Crown earlier dropped two further charges of assault, one on the girl and another on a young boy.

Describing her family’s predicament, Miss Edeson said: “We are all in one room at this BB and it’s too small. My three-year-old is sleeping on an airbed and my one-year-old is in a travel cot. “My children aren’t sleeping properly – my youngest is waking up in tears because he’s petried of the slightest little bang and he doesn’t want to leave my side. “It is affecting my partner because he has mental health issues and suffers with anxiety.” Miss Edeson says she has viewed six properties since her eviction but is yet to secure a new home. She says she cannot afford to stump up the deposit for a privately rented house and she fears she may end up on the streets and separated from her children. She said: “We’ve searched for private properties but they are expensive and most need a guarantor. “The council said they would pay for this BB because it’s emergency accommodation but we are really worried about homelessness.    “I’m constantly crying and I’m worried that my family members are going to have end up looking after my kids until I can find somewhere for us to live. “I’m so scared I will end up losing them but we are really struggling to find somewhere and it’s just a nightmare.” East Riding Council has said it needs clients looking for homes to engage with their services but Miss Edeson is adamant she has been cooperating with the authority’s requests to attend meetings and court hearings. Miss Edeson has looked into the possibility of moving her family to Hull with Mr Brocklehurst, who is adamant he will support his partner and children until they find themselves a home. She said: “Lee doesn’t want to leave me and the kids on the street. He said he would rather be in a hostel or a BB and be with us, and he wants to prove that he can look after his family. “He feels like he is letting us down and it’s affecting him. “It would mean a hell of a lot to us to find a home. It would be a weight off our shoulders I would be somewhere more comfortable with my children beside me and I would get to keep them with me. “I don’t want to miss my children growing up. They are my kids and I need to be the one bringing them up and raising them.” A spokeswoman for East Riding Council said the authority is aware of Miss Edeson’s situation and is working to help resolve her housing issues. However, she reiterated the council need users to engage with services in order to resolve their problems. The spokeswoman said: “We can confirm that we are aware of this case.  Evictions only progress after due legal process has been followed and a court has granted the authority possession. “We only evict in extreme cases where there has been a long history of arrears.

Mark Goodram, , and Jon-Ross Watson, , went on a four-day bender in London after landing their victory. They posed for photos with fistfuls of £ notes and magnums of bubbly. But Camelot suspects the scratchcard was bought with a stolen bank card and is withholding the winnings while an investigation is carried out. Neither of the pair is believed to have a bank account - making it impossible for them to own a debit card. Goodram has  convictions and was jailed for eight months in last year for stealing from a garage. When arrested he had someone ’s bank card.    Meanwhile Watson was once jailed for  weeks for bank card fraud in Darwen, Lancs. The winning scratchcard was bought in Waitrose in Clapham, south London. Watson and Goodram deny any wrongdoing and insist their win is legitimate. The duo have now hired barrister Henry Hedron to fight for their money. He gave Camelot until Tuesday to pay up - but the money never arrived. The lawyer told The Sun : My clients have been very open and upfront about their upbringing in care homes and hard struggles in le, including previous substance misuse problems, which both have tried really hard to overcome.    “Camelot is in effect holding my clients ransom to their past. “My clients consider Camelot are behaving in a culturally racist way by subjecting them to a level of scrutiny, checking and vetting, they would not otherwise dothe person who claimed the prize spoke in a posh accent. Camelot said: Security procedures form a key part of the process of validating a winning ticket to ensure we maintain the integrity of The National Lottery. Should there be any doubt surrounding the validity of a claim, we would undertake a thorough investigation to ensure we pay out the rightful ticketholder.

Several tourists staying at the Grand Bahia Principe Hotel in Tulum claim staff and holiday reps failed to inform them that a male employee had been shot as children played nearby in the sea and sand. One dad-of-two from Essex, who has been at the hotel since May , alleged he was even lied to when he confronted staff over the terrying ordeal. He says they denied bullets had been fired until a letter eventually came through his door confirming the incident, which has left his son too afraid to leave the hotel room. Did you stay at the hotel  Email webnews@mirror    We heard there was commotion and panic. But it was covered up, even the day after, he told . The drama unfolded on Sunday morning at am when a street vendor selling jewellery and a leguard had a heated discussion which turned violent at the popular holiday spot. The vendor reportedly pulled out a gun and opened fire hitting the hotel employee in his right knee. A picture from the scene shows the leguard - named by local media as Carlos Manuel N - lying on a stretcher being attended to by paramedics. He was taken to hospital and is believed to be in a non le-threatening condition. The gunman fled and is still on the loose.  Now holidaymakers have expressed their concern over not being informed for several hours about the shooting, which according to those who claim they witnessed it, left youngsters aposvomiting and having panic attacks.apos The dad from Essex - who does not want to be named - paid £, for the two-week trip with his partner and two children. He told : I didnapost see much itaposs a very big resort. We were not where the shooting was. We heard there was commotion and panic. But it was covered up, even the day after. Staff and a Thomas Cook rep were denying there had been a shooting. It was only confirmed when we got the letter. In the letter sent by Thomas Cook to customers, it reads: You may hear reports that an employee of the Bahia Principe in Tulum was shot in the leg yesterday whilst at work in the hotel.  We didnapost want you to hear this information from another source and would like to update you of the facts as we know them. We have been assured that the incident was targeting one inidual only. Neither the hotel or customers were involved in the incident and all Thomas Cook customers are safe and well. Understandably some guests are distressed by the incident, and we want to assure you that weaposre taking the matter extremely serious. The letter continues that a small number of customers have asked to be moved to another hotel, and they were reviewing security, as well as providing extra support But the dad added: So many people were not even aware of it though. One couple whose apartment is near where it happened didnapost even receive a letter. Itaposs alarming. Speaking over whether he has fears for his safety, he said: Myself Iaposm ok about it, but Iaposm here with my partner and two children. My youngest is  months and we are not taking him to the beach any more.  My -year-old doesnapost want to leave the room. Heaposs in WhatsApp groups and his friends have been messaging him about it as theyaposve seen it in the news. A fellow holidaymaker added to the : I didn’t see what happened. However only heard about it today. There is now a police presence on the beach, I’m with TUI and the reps had been a bit off yesterday. There had been a letter gone around about measles in the hotel but nothing about a shooting it’s been quite hidden to be honest. As we previously reported, Darren Bundell, , heard shots ring out while he and his family were in the complex, metres from the beach.  Since then he and his we Audrey, , and five-year-old daughter are staying inside the complex until theyhome today. It could easily happen again, it could happen at any time, he told the Sun Online . That bullet could have hit a child. Lina Levine said that five kids witnessed the attack. She added:kids had been having panic attacks and throwing up due to the incident and it seemed the staff didn’t quite understand what he was saying. Mr Bundell, who splashed out £, for the TUI package deal, said he was concerned about security at the hotel. He said: Theyaposve even stopped us from posting anything about the shooting on their  Facebook  page, saying itaposs apostoo negativeapos.  Richard McManus, who was there during the shooting, tweeted: Just arrived back in UK, happened as we were checking out. Everyone running from beach after hearing gun fire. Heard the leguard was shot. We left the hotel quickly as armed police arrived at hotel. Some guests also took to TripAdvisor with concerns. One man wrote: This must have been very traumatic, not just for the leguard but for the witnesses as well. I’m sure that a lot of people are rethinking their future vacation plans. Another said: What is distressing is that itaposs the family section of the beach, Iaposm sure any kids who witnessed it were traumatised.

Two-year-old Courtney Ntimane was following his father back to their bungalow when the predator launched at him from the darkness. Dad Isaiah, , had already gone inside but heard his terried son’s screams and rushed back to find his son gripped in the big cat’s jaws. The leopard ran back to the perimeter fence surrounding the bungalow with Courtney hanging limp in her mouth.    Eventually the animal dropped the child and jumped back into a tree it had used to enter the property. Courtney was rushed to hospital but was pronounced dead on arrival. One photograph shows Courtney posing on a rock for his proud parents while a second shows him holidaying in Mozambique with his family.  Kruger National Park has arranged counselling for the family and will help with the funeral. Press spokesman Ike Phaahla said: On hearing of the incident two of our rangers went out to search for the animal and it was shot dead to remove the danger of another falling victim. There is interaction between animals and visitors to the KNP and this may result in species like a leopard getting habituated to people and losing their fear of them. The change in natural behaviour can then lead to unfortunate incidents such as this. A post mortem on the killer leopard after it was shot dead revealed it was in very good condition with good teeth and no obvious injuries before its death. Courtney’s funeral will be on Sunday at Mkhulu and will be attended by many rangers.

boss in April after just  games in charge. He paid the price for a disastrous - Euro  qualying campaign loss to Kazakhstan.Having resurrected Kilmarnock Steve Clarke was drafted in as replacement on a three-year contract and will lead the Scots against Cyprus tomorrow and Belgium on Tuesday.McLeish handed McKenna his Scotland debut and the Dons centre-back won more caps than any other player during his second tenure as Scotland manager.Having retained his position in the Scotland squad, and likely his starting spot, under Clarke the -year-old is determined to impress the new manager.McKenna said: “Alex McLeish was the man who gave me my first Scotland call-up and my first cap so I was gutted to see him leave.“Every game I was in the squad I managed to get on the park so I am thankful to Alex for that.“I was disappointed when he left but now it is up to me to try to prove myself to the new Scotland manager that I am good enough.”McKenna started in the disastrous loss in Kazakhstan that delivered a major dent to qualication hopes and fatally holed McLeish’s position as manager.The SFA waited almost a month from the - defeat of San Marino to axe McLeish and then took their time to appoint his successor.Clarke was the outstanding candidate having collected the PFA Scotland and the Scottish Football Writers’ Association manager of the year accolades.When Clarke arrived at Kilmarnock in October  they were bottom of the Premiership.When he left for Scotland at the end of the recent season he had led them to a third place finish and European qualication.It was the first time Killie had finished in the top three since .On the SFA appointing Clarke, McKenna said: “I was delighted. We had all seen what he did with Kilmarnock and we hope he can bring that to us.“Kilmarnock punched above their weight and hopefully we can do that, too.“Kilmarnock were always hard to break down.“Obviously keeping clean sheets is a great  to try to do well in campaigns and with that implemented hopefully we can do that in the games coming up.”Former Aberdeen captain Graeme Shinnie is also in the Scotland squad.

A bruised and battered face caused alarm on first viewing which gave way to quite a lot of laughter and bold comment.But what a delightful party, laid on by our warden Sheena Stewart and ladies and saw we all had tea, coffee, and home baking, including shortbread and sconesand presents of wine and malt whiskey. What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

The weather was a challenge in itself due to the bitter cold, but the young people rose to the challenge and coped admirably.The climax of the weekend was the presentation of six Gold Chief Scout Awards to group members who have been working hard for four years to gain the highest achievement possible for a Scout. All six Scouts who gained the award have now started their careers in the Explorer section of the group.In late March members of the Scout and Explorer section joined with the Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation to undertake an Earth Hour Camp. During the camp the group discussed how the unit could reduce its impact on the environment and how these changes could be implemented. Plans are now afoot for a further event in May to create an installation that looks at the impact of plastic on the countryside.Most recently three of the leaders, David Smart, Anne Smart and John McCartan took the chance to abseil  feet off the Falkirk Wheel. This event had been organised by Scout Scotland and gave a chance to meet up with other participants from all over Scotland.Looking to the future the group has exciting plans for the summer. The Beavers will be attending a district fun day in May and the Cubs will be participating in a district trophy event in June.The Scouts are heading to a national Scout adventure camp in May and the Explorers are organising an adventurous activities camp in June.Scout leader David Smart said: #In late June th Argyll Scout Group is expecting to host two Norwegian Scout visitors and in July,  members of the group will be heading off for international adventures.

There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert.

development projects in the area.At the end of July, the group set off to host a development camp for young Malawian males to build confidence and leadership skills.Activities will include construction work to restore an elderly womanrsquos home damaged by recent floods.And the group will also take time to hike up Mount Mulanje to reach the highest peak in Malawi.After planning the expedition last summer, the group has need to raise over pound each for the project.Denis Robson, Graham Little, Thea Panter, John Little and Sophie Wilson will team up with five Malawian leaders to host the pilot programme.Through the Rotary Young Leadersprogramme, the Scottish Borders group was able to link up with the Rotary Club of Limbe, to plan the project.Travelling to Zomba, in Malawi, the objective is to develop leadership skills for both the --year olds taking part and the young Borderers involved.Innerleithens Denis Robson, the group leader, has been involved in making connections with the Zomba district for many years.Denis told us: ldquoOur focus is on creating a sustainable model for educating people to become young leaders.ldquoRYLA is a worldwide programme offered by the Rotary to improve the leadership skills of young men and women.ldquoWe are delighted to be taking part in the pilot RYLA Malawi programme and hope to encourage the local rotary clubs to adopt the model in future years and make it sustainable.ldquoWe have an amazing set of Border Exploration Group leaders and graduates who will be able to help share their skills and confidence to the Malawian youths.ldquoAnd I hope they develop a great international understanding that they can have throughout their lives.As part of the development project, the group will work with local skilled people to rebuild a storm damaged home in Liwonde.Malawi often is hit by extreme weather conditions and the recent Cyclone Idai was no exception.Additionally, the programme will include a Climate Mitigation project on the Zomba plateau.Working alongside the Forestry Department the team will prepare a site to plant  trees in October.And educate the community living in the forest to preserve the highly valued resource.It is hoped that these daily activities, together with evening workshops, will develop skills in teamwork, collaboration, problem solving, critical thinking, communication and leadership.A self- assessment questionnaire will be completed before and after the event covering self-confidence, communication skills, practical and leadership ability and general happiness.A presentation to parents s will be given by the young Malawians on the final day explaining what benefit the camp has had for them and how they can apply the experience for the benefit of the community.President-Elect Bernard at the Rotary Club of Limbe:ldquoThe RYLA-Malawi Program will offer an opportunity for Malawian youth to nurture and grow their leadership skills and potential, through boot camp interaction with their Scottish counterparts.Although the team from Scotland will pay their own travel costs, they are still fundraising to meet the expenses of running the RYLA development camp.Sponsorship is needed to cover the cost of all food, accommodation, transport and building materials for the construction projects.For one Malawian youth to attend the camp it costs pound, and the volunteering group hopes to seek sponsors for all .Denis added: ldquoWe are seeking sponsors for the  Malawian youths at pound each.ldquoAnd I would like to thank the Rotary clubs of Selkirk, Melrose, Biggar, Innerleithen and Peebles for all their support.Anyone interested in sponsoring the project should contact Denis Robson on  or

interval the choir embarked on a monumental performance of A German Requiem Op.  by Johannes Brahms, joined by the two South African pianists, Ben Schoeman and Tessa Uys, who played the alternative version prepared by Brahms as a piano duet for four hands on one keyboard, on this occasion the Melrose Music Societyrsquos Petrov piano.They gave a performance of scintillating musicality and power,

After midnight maps were issued and from these, we saw we were scheduled to lsquotouch downrsquo at Lion-Sur-Mer about three miles west of Ouistreham.About . on June  we could see faintly the coast of Normandy on the horizon, all around us were battleships, cruisers and destroyers firing at the enemy, while overhead there was a continual stream of bombers and fighters. As we drew nearer the shore, we could see LCAs, DUKWs, etc ferrying stores from larger ships to shore.At . we were ordered to lsquostand byrsquo to disembark. Each man carried his normal equipment and personal weapon plus to extra bandoliers of ammunition, two -hour ration packs and an airborne bicycle. We had expected a wet landing but when we touched down, dead on time at ., we stepped off the LCI on to the shore. The Navy had certainly put up a terric show and now it was up to us.It took only a few minutes for the Battalion to disembark and then we moved off to our Assembly area north of Hermanville-Sur-Mer , this move was carried out without incident except for a few heavy shells from the coastal guns at Le Havre.At . the Battalion were ordered to move to St Aubin drsquoArquenay and ordered to lsquodig inrsquo. At . we witnessed what must be one of the most spectacular sights of the war - the landing of the Reserve Brigade of the th Airborne Division. It was certainly heartening for us, as up to then we had the feeling that we were all alone on the continent. Several prisoners were brought in during the night.Early on June  we prepared to attack the village of Gazelle. We moved on bicycles through Periers-Sur-le-Dan preparatory to the attack. At midday patrols reported Gazelle clear of the enemy and led by lsquoCrsquo Companythe Battalion moved through Gazelle to the woods north of Le Mesnil.We stayed until the morning of the th when we were relieved by the S Lancs while the Royal Ulster Rlesattacked Cambes Wood. At . the Battalion was ordered to pass through the RUR who had reached their objectives but were pinned down by heavy machine Gun, and Mortar Fire. The Battalion attacked after passing through the RUR and were met by machine gun fire and heavy mortar fire, but all Coys successfully reached their objectives. The Battalion suffered several casualties mainly from mortar fire.From June  to  the Battalion remained in Cambes Wood, where we were continually shelled and mortared and suffered fairly heavy casualties.Enemy mortar and artillery was very active ndash Battalion HQ receiving most attention. lsquoArsquo Coy HQ unfortunately came in for a very heavy lsquostonkrsquo and lost five killed and seven wounded. The end of the month saw the Battalion back in Cambes Wood once more, when we took over the right half of the line from the nd Lincs.During the month of June the Battalion sustained the following casualties two officers and  other ranks killed, eight officers and  other ranks wounded, and four other ranks missing.The Battalion remained in Cambes Wood till July . We continued to probe the enemy defences at night by patrolling. Sgt Grant carried out a very successful  hour patrol in the area of Galmanche. A lot of very valuable information was gained from this patrol. On the evening of July , Lt Robertson lsquoBrsquo Company carried out a very successful patrol and succeeded in bringing back identication of  SS Div ndash this information had been urgently required by higher command in view of the forthcoming attack.The Battalion were relieved by a Battalion of South Staffs and moved by march route to the area of Benouville in preparation for the attack on Caen. On the evening of July  the Battalion took over the nd Kings Shropshire Light Infantry in the area of Le Homme. A large formation of Allied bombers raided Caen in the early evening.On July  the Battalion again moved forward, this time to the area of Lebissey. There was some enemy mortar and artillery fire, but few casualties were suffered.On July  in conjunction with the RUR and Canadians, the Battalion attacked Caen. The Battalion was ordered to attack from the West with the RUR on our right. The Battalion moved to the Forming Up Pointon the outskirts of Caen. We were continually shelled from the Eastern side of the River Orne. It was a very unpleasant approach march to the FUP as the ground was completely open and overlooked from the high ground on the far side of the river. Led by lsquoCrsquo and lsquoDrsquo Coys the Battalion advanced into Caen and proceeded to winkle out the enemy. This proved a very slow job, the town had been heavily bombed and the roads crated or blocked by rubble, giving ideal cover from snipers and Spandau posts. By early evening all companies had reached their objectives, patrols established on the canal, and contact established with the RUR. The civilians gave everyone a terric welcome and produced wine, fruit and bouquets of flowers.On July  the Battalion continued to lsquomop uprsquo the town. There was slight enemy shelling during the day.On the morning of July , the Battalion were relieved by Canadians and moved to a rest area at Plumeto where the time was spent cleaning up, kit inspections and parades. Football games were organised and there was a generous allotment for film shows, swimming, etc. The Pipe Band played Retreat for the first time since landing, on the evening of the th. Officers and Other Rank reinforcements joined the Battalion and on the th we moved off at full strength to the area of Ranville, east of the Orne river, in preparation for operation lsquoGoodwoodrsquo, our objective in this operation was the important road centre of Troarn.On the morning of July , the Battalion moved off via Herouvillette, Touffreville to Sannerville. This was the worst approach march the Battalion had ever experienced. It was a hot summerrsquos day and having to follow the same route as an armoured Div and we were completely overlooked by the enemy. Enemy shells and mortaring was heavy and we experienced for the first time the enemyrsquos multi-barrelled mortarndash several casualties were suffered by the Battalion, including the CO, Lt. Col G.D. Renny. He was wounded in the face and arm but refused to be evacuated.On passing through the RUR at Sannerville lsquoDrsquo and lsquoBrsquo Coys pushed forward and encountered enemy machine guns. The enemy shelling continued throughout the whole advance. After lsquoBrsquo Coy had successfully put in an attack, the Battalion occupied an orchard about  yards west of Troarn where consolidation was carried out. During the night enemy shelling continued and enemy patrols encountered. On the th, the Battalion attack towards Troarn was continued, lsquoCrsquo Coy left ndash lsquoArsquo Coy right. Both Coys advanced, but were met with heavy machine gun fire, and although supported by tanks, were forced to withdraw with heavy casualties.The Battalion took up its former positions and spent a most unpleasant day of enemy mortar and shell fire.The C.O. was ordered to be evacuated by the Brigadier and Major T.G. Coverdale took over command of the Battalion. Casualties in the Battalion in this action were  officers and  other Ranks. To make things more unpleasant we had  hours solid rain. Enemy shelling and mortaring continued but our own guns had moved up and they did some very good counter battery shoots.On July , two enemy Stretcher Bearersapproached lsquoBrsquo Coy position and asked that they and ourselves should bury our dead who were lying in lsquoNo manrsquos landrsquo. A party of SBs under our Padre, Capt Wilson, went out and did this job. As in Cambes Wood some very good patrolling was done, and several prisoners were taken mostly from  Fusilier Battalion and  Panzer Grenadiers.On July , Lt. Col. J.F.M. MacDonald took over command of the Battalion. A strong enemy patrol attempted to penetrate lsquoBrsquo Coy position but were beaten off by small arms and two-inch mortar fire. Several casualties were inflicted on the enemy in this short and sharp engagement.The Battalion remained in this area till July  when they were relieved to go back into Army Reserve.The total casualties for the month of July were five Officers and  other ranks killed,  officers and  other ranks wounded and one other rank missing.The Old Gala Club records show that the KOSB story of World War II did not end there, continuing from Caen to the far pagodas of Burma.In the words of an old soldier ldquowe didnae dae sae badly."},{"url":null,"title":"50-jobs-saved-as-wetherspoons-takes-borders-pubs-off-the-market","story":"MORE than  jobs have been saved after Wetherspoons decided to take two of its Borders pubs off the market.Earlier this year, the chain announced it was planning to sell the Cross Keys in Peebles and The Bourtree in Hawick.But this week the pub giant announced it had done a U-turn.At total of  members of staff are employed in Peebles, while  work at the Hawick bar.A spokesperson for Wetherspoon said: \"We are pleased to confirm that our pubs at Peebles and Hawick have been taken off the market.\"This follows discussions at head office.\"We know that our staff and customers will be very pleased with the decision.\"We look forward to future success at both pubs for many years to come.\""},{"url":null,"title":"work-to-begin-next-month-on-greenyards-3g-pitch","story":"MELROSE will have a new million pounds G pitch later this year.Scottish Borders Council has given the Greenyards plans, which includes new floodlights, the go-ahead.And work is expected to start as early as next month with a completion date being pencilled in for November.Council Convener David Parker, who has been heavily involved in negotiations to secure the new G pitch at Melrose, told the Border : ldquoI am delighted that we have been able to reach a point where we can invest in the next G pitch in the Scottish Borders in Melrose.ldquoThe council has a proud track record of delivering community synthetic pitches across the Scottish Borders and the Melrose proposal will make a signicant dference to sports clubs in the town.\"It will enhance football and rugby and give many generations of young people access to a first class sporting facility.ldquoThe pitch is owned by the Ormiston Trust, whose sole aim is to make sure that it provides important community facilities for all and this community investment in Melrose will certainly do that.\"We look forward to the project being delivered.The all year round playing surface will be open to all local sports clubs and schools.As well as a G pitch and floodlights, the approved plans also include a new spectator walkway.And the detailed plans, which are being supported by Scottish Rugby, will be on show during a drop-in session at the Greenyards on Tuesday, June  between pm and pm.Melrose RFC chairman Gordon Brown added: \"Melrose Rugby is delighted at this news.ldquoThis has been a long-standing ambition of the club since the launch of our Legacy project in .\"The new G pitch will allow the club to continue competing at the highest level as well as being an incredible asset that will enable other sporting activities and events.ldquoThe club would like to thank all our support partners in approving this exciting project.\"It will mark an exciting new chapter for us as we open our doors to the local community and others in the surrounding area.ldquoWe look forward to welcoming anyone interested in seeing the plans to the Greenyards on  June.Although contentious in footballing circles, G surfaces have been given the thumbs up from rugbys governing body.The SRUs director for Edinburgh, Borders and Lothian, David Drummond, told us: ldquoScottish Rugby believes this move to a G surface is a positive step at the Greenyards to help the rugby club and the wider sporting and local community enjoy access on a more regular basis, together with the subsequent health benefits that will bring.ldquoWe know pitches in Scotland come under signicant pressure throughout the season so the level of investment and commitment from Scottish Borders Council to improve this facility was something we wanted to support and contribute towards.ldquoWe are supporting new G pitch projects across Scotland and this opportunity in the Borders is another example of Scottish Rugby investing to help clubs become more sustainable and have high-quality facilities to engage existing and future players."},{"url":null,"title":"glendinning-pupils-are-chess-champs-of-the-borders","story":"PUPILS from Glendinning Primary School have been declared chess champs of the Borders.The budding grand masters from Galashiels saw off competition from across the region to claim the title in the Volunteer Hall last week.But Aidan Falconer, Kyle Anderson, Frank Rogerson and Shane Ross were made to work hard for the trophy in a thrilling move-for-move final with Earlston pupils.A total of  school teams took part -

He goes to bed with his T rex, plays with dinosaurs constantly and knows even the complicated names of lesser-known dinosaurs.However, we have tried very consciously to allow our kids to be who they are and resist the gender stereotyping that defines what a girl should be and what a boy should be.But here was my youngest daughter, at the age of five, clearly articulating the ision between girlsrsquo and boysrsquo toys.Her list was in line with the way toys are still marketed. Often there are two versions of the same thing, one for girls and one for boys.Even some story books are defined in this way, with images and colours which are used to reinforce the gender identity of the object evengender is not specically mentioned.Donrsquot get me wrong, I have no problem that my son loves dinosaurs.But I do have a problem with marketing directed at my children to force them into a narrow definition of what toys they should like based on a patriarchal version of gender.In truth, itrsquos not so much the toys themselves but the emotions and ways of being that are deliberately connected to them.Itrsquos the idea that boysrsquo stuff promotes bravery, toughness, being fierce and adventurous, while girlsrsquo stuff promotes cuteness, romance, beauty and love.It is changing and itrsquos much better than it used to be because there is so much more awareness and debate about this issue. Gender neutral marketing is more common now, mainly as a result of public pressure.But as the conversation with my daughter shows, we still have a way to go.But does it really matter  Is it just a politically correct obsession that is making a mountain from a molehill ldquoBoys will be boys, after all, and ldquogirls are all sugar and spice, and all things nice.It really matters, of course, and I think it matters just as much for my son as my daughters, perhaps even more so.That may be controversial, but I believe that as gender stereotyping is being challenged, it is often more dficult for boys to free themselves from the traditional definition of male identity than it is for a girl.I say this as a father of four girlsand one boy.Perhaps part of the reason for this is the fact that being male is still in many ways the privileged gender, and so there is an understandable focus on removing the restrictive definition of female roles which limit opportunities for women.But the struggle for gender equality has to be a two-way processit is to be ultimately successful.We must also unshackle our boys from the narrow definition of what it is to be male, a definition which still remains powerfully entrenched in our mindsets and the way society works.I personally suffered from this when at school. I was ldquosoft, sensitive, a daydreamer. I was often made to feel I was not a proper boy. There was no space for me to realise that the lsquoladdishrsquo way of being male was not the only way.Irsquom not advocating taking the dinosaurs away from my son and forcing him to play with a unicorn or Barbie doll. Even I loved dinosaurs when I was young. But it does mean allowing him, and yes encouraging him, to explore sides to his nature that society would still label as feminine: nurture, co-operation, make-up, dresses, dancing, looking after dolls and toys, and feeling vulnerable and being allowed to express it.The best way to encourage boys to express this part of who they are is through role modelling by other men, especially in the early years of childhood when a childrsquos brain is forming, and the childrsquos view of how the world works is being created.This includes how to treat others on a personal level.So nurture and care by male family members can be a crucial part of this. But one gender inequality we rarely hear about is the fact that men make up only two per cent of early years childcare workers. And this is an inequality not just for adults, but for our children.It conveys the message to young children that caring and nurture is not a manrsquos job or a male quality. So we grow up believing this is lsquonaturalrsquo.And this idea is so entrenched that there have even been examples of parents complaining that a man is working in a nursery!Looking after children is as much a manrsquos job as it is a womanrsquos. Or it should be, and seen to be. But itrsquos not just about work, or even childcare or parenthood. Itrsquos about ways of being and understanding that there are hundreds of ways to be a man or woman and we all have the right to make our own path.Thatrsquos why itrsquos important from the beginning to show that therersquos no such thing as boysrsquo toys or girlsrsquo toys: there are childrenrsquos toys.Or perhaps more accurately, to show the emotions and qualities traditionally associated with them are not gender specic.As always, children teach us. When we got home, Lewis put his T rex to bed. ldquoHersquos tired, he said, ldquoand hersquos a nice T rex.This was my lesson from my son: a T rex can be nice.He summed up the issue as only a child can."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-25-years-since-east-lothians-independence","story":"Twenty-five years ago this week, the Courier proclaimed the news with the headline: ldquoItrsquos independence for East Lothian.This week, East Lothian Council chief executive Angela Leitch said: ldquoThe Local GovernmentAct of  saw the abolishment of the two-tier Region and District Councils to be replaced with  unitary authorities across Scotland.\"I believe this has greatly benefited East Lothian communities, as responsibility for major services including education and social work were decentralised from Edinburgh and instead became the focus of political decisions at a more localised level.\"Over the years, our politicians have ensured ongoing investment in all of our towns and villages, providing facilities for local people, developing our infrastructure and continually working to improve the services we deliver. This has been recognised in a iety of inspection reports that have confirmed that East Lothian Council is a high performing council and has an ethos which recognises the importance of working closely with its residents and communities.\"Our elected members all live within the county, understand local issues and can ably represent the views of communities.\"Previously, some political decisions about our county were approved by people who had no real knowledge of East Lothian.\"Local government reorganisation has improved both local democracy and the ability of local people to hold the council accountable for the decisions it takes.Here, we take a look back at how we reported the news that the county had secured its place as a stand-alone local authority in the upcoming local government reorganisation:East Lothian has won the battle for independence.In a dramatic about face, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has given in to the majority wishes of the population and decided it can stand on its own two feet.From , the district will once again become master of its own house as an all-purpose local authority.It means East Lothian councillors will be responsible for running a full range of services ndash from education and social work to rubbish collection and recreation.The Local Government Bill which will end the -year lespan of Scotlandrsquos network of region, district and island authorities is currently going through its final stages in Parliament.And earlier this week, Mr Lang ndash supported by local Labour MP John Home Robertson ndash tabled an amendment to give East Lothian the go-it-alone status it wanted.It was the high point in a hard-fought campaign by angry locals which began last year when the Government announced its original intention to lump East Lothian in with Berwickshire.But their success in fighting off that idea was not the end of the battle ndash they still had to persuade Mr Lang and his local government minister Allan Stewart that East Lothian was NOT too small to become an authority in its own right.They had also to force them to give up alternative plans to create an East Lothian-Midlothian-West Lothian authority ndash and more recently a proposal to merge East and Midlothian.As councillors and senior staff celebrated the announcement with champagne, [district] council chairman George Wanless smiled and said: ldquoWe are absolutely delighted with the outcome.He said it was dficult to say what eventually changed the minds of ministers.ldquoBut I have no doubt that the campaign the district council fought had a lot to do with it.He added: ldquoIf I was being charitable, I would say it was a case where the Scottish Office actually listened to the people for a change...It was, however, a ldquogreat decision for the people of East Lothian, who had supported the campaign from the start.ldquoI would like to thank all those who came out on the streets and took part in demonstrations in the early days of the campaign ndash and all those who wrote to Ian Lang in support of the idea that East Lothian should be an all purpose authority.Councillor Wanless totally rejected the previously-held Government view that East Lothian was too small to stand on its own.ldquoWe currently have a population of something like , and growing.ldquoBy the year  we could have at least , and my colleagues and I along with our officials are confident we can handle all the services that the new council will be responsible for.And he insisted: ldquoWe will do so in the same economic and efficient way the electorate have been accustomed to over the years.MP John Home Robertson said the White Paper to reform local government could have been the ldquodeath knell for East Lothian.ldquoBut people all over East Lothian fought back in a massive local campaign and we have won a magnicent victory.He paid tribute to Councillor Wanless and others who took part in the campaign, saying: ldquoWe have shown that public pressure can move even this Government.ldquoHowever, we are not out of the woods yet.ldquoLocal government is all about providing important services to local communities and we must continue to fight to ensure that East Lothian is properly provided with the funds it requires through revenue support grants.The councilrsquos Conservative group leader, the Rev Dr David Whiteford, said: ldquoI am very pleased that the Scottish Office ministers have listened to the electorate.ldquoThe view of the electors all along has been consistent ndash that East Lothian could and should be an all-purpose authority.ldquoI believe East Lothian has the capacity and potential to become an authority on its own and its staff are well capable of serving very well the needs of all the people.He added: ldquoI am very pleased that that message has now been accepted by the Scottish Ministers and that they have departed almost entirely from their original plan.ldquoLarge is not always beautul and I think we can do better on our own.He believed the transition to a stand-alone East Lothian council would be fairly simple.ldquoThe staff structures are already on the ground and all you really need to do is build on that.ldquoI do not anticipate a great deal of dficulty.ldquoIt is a challenge.ldquoIt is something that we should think through.ldquoWe have a new council coming into being and we should try to run it in a new style way.ldquoI hope councillors will concentrate on the needs of East Lothian people and will try and make that their main concern.Said SNP councillor George Thomson: ldquoEast

My daughter was scared someone would come back and do it to my wersquos car and my nine-year-old son Angus has had dficulty getting a full nightrsquos sleep.ldquoIt is dficult to explain why people would do such a thing to someone rsquos property.

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9918363.jpg?type=article-full","title":"a-guide-to-some-of-scotlands-best-beer-gardens","story":"Relaxing with a cold drink and enjoying the sunrsquos rays is a rare but welcome treat for us Scots.

After gorse was taken away and sand imported from other parts of the site, the new th, known as lsquoHillhouse,rsquo replaces the former par- th hole.To create a better link between the th green and the former th fairway, Kimber has also built new teeing grounds near the th green to enable play towards the new th fairway from a completely dferent angle and achieve a right-to-left dogleg hugging the railway line.With the alterations ready for the start of the  season, the new th ndash which at  yards features an undulating green, pot bunkers around the green and a view to Arran looking back down the hole ndash has already proved popular with members and visitors.Bob Anderson, Greens Convenor at Kilmarnock , said: ldquoWe are absolutely delighted with the new th hole, it couldnrsquot have looked better. It is a well-designed signature par-, with a nice yardage and improves the enjoyment of playing Barassie without the walks.ldquoVisitors or potential members were previously coming to Barassie and it was too long, overall. Over the years we have tried to get the playability up but retain the enjoyment and the new hole has already proved tremendously popular with all the members.The total yardage for the par- course has reduced by eight yards to ,, while the standard scratch for all levels remains the same.Coupled with other initiatives such as rough reduction, the course changes have also helped Barassie to grow membership in these challenging times.The club, which was founded in  and the course finally laid as  holes in , now has a total membership of over ,.Claire Middleton, General Manager at Kilmarnock , added: ldquoWe are thrilled with the new par- th hole. Paul Kimber and his team managed not only to meet our budget and a tight schedule but, even more importantly, meet membersrsquo expectations.ldquoWe look forward to another great golfing season and our members and visitors enjoying the course changes.Barassie, which also boasts a -hole layout, counts former Amateur champion Gordon Sherry and fellow ex-Walker Cup winning players Jim Milligan and Jack McDonald among its current members.The club also offers improved facilities in the clubhouse and professionals shop, run by Gregor Howie.Visit the website to find out more.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lochranza CentreWelcome to Arranrsquos oldest and youngest tourist attraction.The Vikings called Arran the mysterious Island, sometimes there, sometimes not depending on the weather.

His field of expertise, known as ldquohereditarian science, was for decades shunned because of the appalling use to which theories of supposedly inherent racial dference had previously been put. To the ranks of disbelievers can probably now be added those cash-strapped parents who have sacriced holidays, cars and clothes to pay eye-watering fees for their kids.Until lately, environmental factors have been seen as the main factor in a personrsquos success or failure. However, Plomin persuasively argues that a childrsquos future is determined  per cent by their genes. Environment also accounts for  per cent, but according to his research, an inidualrsquos response to this is largely a product of their genetic heritage. In short, our parents have a lot to answer for.Yet while Plomin is adamant that itrsquos a pupilrsquos background that determines their exam results, he is also aware that choosing a private school is usually about much more than winning top grades. Fettes or Gordonstoun, Roedean or Harrow are seen as exclusive institutions where sons and daughters will meet the right class of people and ndash as importantly ndash not have to mingle with the wrong. Long after they have left the dorm and playing fields, these old chums will form a network whose efficacy in helping them up the greasy pole is affirmed by the front benches at Westminster.As Plomin writes of his conclusions, ldquoI hope it will help parents who cannot afford to pay for private schooling or move house to know that it doesnrsquot make much of a dference in childrenrsquos school achievement. Clearly he recognises the financial dilemma facing those, not in the first rank of wealth, who want their kids to have the best possible start in le and think itrsquos worth almost bankrupting themselves to put them through the elite system. If his evidence of the superiority of nature over nurture is right, then it rebuts the age-old belief that money solves every problem, and that those born on the cusp of an overdraft are on the back foot from day one.Read more: Rosemary Goring: Do not rush to judge Theresa May or any other leaderRaised as I was in a family of teachers convinced that the state sectorrsquos better-qualied staff offered a finer education, I was, you might say, indoctrinated about the deficiencies of fee-paying establishments from an early age. The opening pages of Evelyn Waughrsquos The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold merely confirmed that view, although in recent years Irsquove had to acknowledge that private education has improved considerably since I last dipped into an inkwell.Yet the most important message to take from Plominrsquos work is not that any school will serve its educational purpose. Rather, it is that responsibility for a childrsquos intellectual capabilities lies with parents, not teachers. Home is where the future lies. For years now, teachers, be they state sector or private, have increasingly been expected to take on the roles of nanny and counsellor, nutritionist, health advisor and social worker, not to mention become expert in conflict resolution. All this as well as their bread and butter task as educator.When a child does not excel, parents demand to know why. The blame for poor results or under-performance is too often laid at the teacherrsquos door, when mum and dad should instead be looking into a mirror. This is not to say that every teacher is above reproach. But it is to suggest that on balance, parents should ask not what school can do for their child but what they can do for their child ndash and have already done, through no virtue or neglect on their part.Money aside, on the question of state v private education, there now seems a simple distinction. Private institutions offer a one-stop shop, in which extracurricular activities are gathered under a single umbrella. In contrast, many pupils at ordinary schools are like popcorn in a microwave, bouncing from one out-of-hours ersion to another, be it football or ballet, violin or swimming lessons, Rainbow Club or Scouts.Thanks to these myriad options, the distinctiveness of fee-paying schools is being whittled away. In addition, children at after-class events are mingling with a far wider group than could be found in private establishments. As a result, the private sector is in more danger of appearing narrow and restrictive than elitist.That, of course, is a separate discussion. For the moment, Plominrsquos results should simply help calm the angst that blights so many parentsrsquo lives. If nothing , they offer a reason to relax a little, and allow nature to run its course."},{"url":null,"title":"fringe-offers-new-counselling-for-performers-in-biggest-festival-yet","story":"But appearing in the three week festival, especially for debut performers shouldering the cost and stress of performing in Edinburghrsquos world-famous event, can also be testing and, at times, overwhelming.This year, as the Fringe unveils its biggest- ever programme for the  festival, organisers have revealed a series of new measures to address the mental health of its performers at its base, Fringe Central.The daily health and well-being measures, including counselling services aim to help performers at a ldquostressful and pressured time, especially those in the  shows where performers are entering the three-week Fringe maelstrom for the first time.This yearrsquos Edinburgh Festival Fringe is once again even larger in size and scale than the year before: the  programme includes , shows, up from , in , and , performances, up from ,.The programme has a record  countries represented, and more than  free shows, with more than  lsquopay what you wantrsquo shows, an increase from  last year.In the  Fringe programme - more than  pages long - there are also  Scottish shows, with  being produced from Edinburgh.Shona McCarthy, the chief executive of the Fringe Society, said that the new measures for the well being of performers has been boosted from previous years.One-person shows, often with personal and confessional content, can be enervating for performers, the festival noted.The Fringe is also opening Respite Room, a dedicated space for performers who need help, and ldquoaway from the bustle of the Fringe.Ms McCarthy said: ldquoThere is exhaustion, it is a long run to do, especiallyyou are doing a one person show - you can be exhausted by the end of it. If your show isnrsquot doing as well as you hoped it would, it can be demoralising.ldquoWe have  new shows, first-timers, on the Fringe this year - and it can be daunting landscape for those of us who have been around for a long time, so for someone coming to it completely new, and not necessarily having the confidence to make networks or make connections, it is about creating that sense of community that established Fringe-goers feel strongly.ldquoWe are providing those services for people who are really struggling.Once again the Fringe, which will run from  to  August, will be a perhaps overwhelming festival of theatre, dance, circus, physical theatre, comedy, music, musicals and opera, cabaret and iety, childrenrsquos shows, spoken word, free shows, exhibitions and other events.The sheer scale of the festival is one again sure to continue to generate debate over the escalating size of the festival, and how it effects the capital in which it is based.Last year, the Fringe issued . million tickets, a record, % higher than , and is on course, at the current rate of growth, to sell or distribute m tickets.This year the Fringe Society, which runs the annual festival in August, has introduced a new feature, the Inspiration Machine, ldquoan interactive, arcade-style machine that will randomly display videos from Fringe artists at the push of a button.The street events will once againto the Royal Mile and the Mound Precinct, managed by the Fringe Society and sponsored by Virgin Money.There are some new venues for the Fringe this year, including two in Leith, Quality Yard, near the Shore, a street art exhibition space, while The Old Dr Bells Baths makes use of a newly renovated former swimming pool on Great Junction Street.Tynecastle Parkwill host A War of Two Halves, while on a smaller scale, the performers behind theatre show Arthur are creating their own venue, Your Home, asking audience members to open their doors and host the show.Fiona Hyslop, the culture secretary, said the Fringe is an ldquoeconomic powerhouse, generating pound million for the Edinburgh economy and pound million for Scotlandrsquos economy.Cllr Donald Wilson, culture convener for Edinburgh Council, said:I particularly welcome the Inspiration Machine as a means of boosting exposure of all that is on offer."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-john-swinneys-talks-pledge-rings-hollow","story":"Given that such \"active dialogue\" will be conducted with pupils and parents in highly deprived communities, many of whom will be struggling with the privations of Universal Credit, will be based on the educational experience and expectations of that demographic, and will be subject to budget constraints, resources and teacher shortage, one comes to the conclusion that what Mr Swinney is actually saying is, that in the present circumstances, they \"should be satisfied\" that theyre getting an education at all.Bearing in mind \"more socially advantaged parents\" Edinburgh University, Cristina Ianelli \"were better placed to ensure their children made the best decisions over what subjects to take\", whose expectations are equally based on experience, the reality of closing \"the attainment gap\" is made plain. What is described as \"flexibility over curriculum choices\"leads to what Mr Swinney cheerfully describes as a \"iety of models\", the outcome of which is surely a reinforcement of,not increasing, the already established attainment gap.May I congratulate Mr Swinney on this exercise in social engineering by the school gates and in the certain knowledge that, in the not too distant future, Scotland too, will be able to describe areas of the country as \"not having a university tradition\", as a justiable excuse for the dearth of social mobility.Maureen McGarry-OHanlon, Balloch.YOU carry a report of an exhibition of Ancient Egyptian artefacts currently touring Scotland . I am surprised that the SNP has not banned this most unwelcome rival for the fascinated devotion of young people who will visit it and, horror of horrors, possibly become so enamoured of Egyptology as to wish to dedicate their careers to it. After all, STEMsubjects are all the rage these days and those bright intellects among the secondary school population whose interests, temperament and professional aspirations could be triggered to pursue a very dferentdiscipline like Egyptology are seemingly to be quashed and indoctrinated into more economically productive fields. And not just Ancient Egypt, but the vast, wider ancient world with its perennial lure of countless specialisms like Roman Britain, Pompeii, Linear B, Flavian epic, Ciceronian rhetoric, Aristotelian philosophy, Assyriology, Semitic philology and Biblical criticism.The present controversy over contraction of subject options is well documented. What hope is there, then, for a potential distinguished Egyptologist, such as those nurtured in th century Scottish schools, when the necessary foundation of linguistic expertise in French, German, Latin and Greekis nowhere on offer  Not a single Scottish university boasts a venerable department of Egyptology such as is found in Liverpool, Birmingham, London, Oxford and Cambridge. Furthermore, such foreign language courses as are offered in schoolsare not just threatened by paucity of patrons but are ludicrous dumb-downs of the rigorous syllabuses required for Highers a generation ago.Mr. Swinney may trumpet his well-rehearsed responses to criticism of his impoverished Curriculum for Excellence and its basic, six-subject provision at National . But the real truth was expertly captured and pointedly portrayed bySteven Camley , who comically illustrated the Education Secretarys \"expanded choice\" to include \"History Rewritten\".So children: be very wary of any stirring urge to explore the wonders of Egyptology.

As a field of les work, consider it taboo.Stuart Mitchell, Glasgow G.IN response to Andrew Denholms front-page articleas Vice-Chair of Upstart Scotland, one of the charitable organisations involved in the campaign to bring to the publics attention our opposition to testing five-year-olds, I would like to stress that this campaign was never motivated by antipathy to any political party.The only reason that Upstart became involved was to highlight the inappropriateness of assessing our youngest pupils in this way and how detrimental it could be to the benefits of the pupils wellbeing and engagement with learning that a play-based approach is having for this age group. We are a relatively new organisation who are delighted by the spread of outdoor nurseries and the number of schools who are implementing play. Time and time again, we hear that the children are happy and want to come to school. Headteachers are advising others to \"be brave and go for it\" as they take the plunge and follow the advice of Curriculum for Excellence.Upstart Scotland was cheered when our Parliament voted against this assessment after a very knowledgeable debate from some of the participants but sadly disappointed that Mr Swinney chose to ignore this vote. Glasgow City Council has now voted to support its headteachersthey choose not to participate. Upstart Scotland is awaiting the results of Mr Swinneys independent evidence-led review of the tests for P which were due at the end of May. Why have they not been published We would rather be campaigning for a protected kindergarten stage for our younger pupils. I am asking our Government to let us do this.If anyone is interested in discussing the testing debate further from an informed viewpoint, Upstart is happy that they have been chosen as the pilot for a non-confrontational  where the discussion can continue with evidence being offered from both sides until the th June .

Let us consider health , justice , and education .All of this adverse publicity, which was measured and to the point, does little for the image of Scotland as a place to live in.

we will not say that until writers and authors and musicians are getting their visas.Mr Barley added: ldquoThe important point is that in the end, we were able to sort out visas that had been rejected - once, twice or in one case three times - but the amount of highly paid support we needed, the amount of tax payers money, frankly, that was lavished on the help we needed, was completely out of scale with what should be a simple process of allowing and enabling cultural dialogue.ldquoOur point is that this is not simply about the Edinburgh festivals -

What we owe you is to show ourselves worthy of the heritage of peace that you have left us.ldquoBeing worthy of the promise of Normandy means never forgetting that free people, when they join forces, can surmount any adversity, Macron went on.ldquoWe shall never cease to perpetuate the alliance of free peoples.ldquoThat is what the victorious sides did, when they created the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.

Scotland owes a great debt of gratitude to all those who served during the Second World War, especially to those who made the ultimate sacrice.ldquoIt is important that current andfuture generations continue to learn of the events that took place on this day  years ago, so that we can strive to ensure that such conflict is never repeated.ldquoIt is also important the generations to come understand and recognise that it is the actions of those who served that allow us to enjoy the freedoms we now take for granted.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the service was ldquobeautul and inclusive, in memory of those ldquowho died in Normandy and ultimately helped to defeat the scourge of fascism.The Prince of Wales said the day was ldquoprobably the last chance to pay everlasting respect to the ldquoremarkable D-Day veterans.He said: ldquoI remember the last time we were there, I will never forget the determination that they still exude by being there.

Wersquove also heard evidence questioning the effectiveness of the Scotland Office in Whitehall, so we are pressing for a review of the role of the Scotland Office and the Secretary of State for Scotland to ensure intergovernmental processes adapt to the changing nature of devolution.But a Government insider strongly denied relations had broken down and that, while there were policy dferences, they remained ldquobusinesslike and constructive.He stressed how, far from considering scrapping the Scotland Office, Scottish Conservatives were ldquolobbying leadership candidates to beef it up as part of plans to strengthen the Union.The source added: The Scotland Office does a highly effective job strengthening the Union, so its no surprise the SNP want to see it abolished.The MPsrsquo report also recommends:*in reviewing the role of the Scotland Office and the Secretary of State, consideration should be given to replacing them with ldquoterritorial offices of state within a single department responsible for managing constitutional affairs and intergovernmental relations, dubbed in the past by some as a Department for the Union*urgent reform of the Joint Ministerial Council to provide a forum which is robust enough to cope with dferent governments with ergent policy objectives*exploring the use of third-party mediation as part of a process for resolving disputes between the two governments as the current system is ldquonot fit for purpose*UK Government departments should publish devolution impact assessments outlining how policies could affect the devolved governments and*the UK Civil Service should provide more effective devolution training.The report says the ldquoloss of trust began in , when the SNP replaced the Labour Party in the Scottish Government and the polarised politics of the two governments became particularly evident during the  Scottish Independence referendum and again during the Brexit process.It notes: ldquoThe relationship between the UK and Scottish Governments has come under renewed strain at a time when co-operation and trust is needed most. The current system of intergovernmental relations is not able to cope with the pressure being placed on it.ldquoWhilst we recognise disagreement between the UK and Scottish Governments is inevitable and legitimate, we believe the frequency and nature of the disputes we have seen in recent years have been exacerbated by a fundamental - and avoidable - deficit of trust in the relationship.The Scottish Affairs Committee report follows a similar one by the Commons Constitutional Affairs Committee, which last July also said consideration should be given to scrapping the Scotland Office and the role of the Scottish Secretary in a review that looked at constitutional matters post-Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"plain-packaging-we-need-a-repackaging-of-our-attitudes-to-obesity-causes","story":"Or at least not until clear out time.

According to these three parties, the new power supply system — known as #cold ironing# — will reduce the overnight carbon footprint from the vessel’s diesel generators and engines. It is believed that this will lower the ferry#s fuel consumption by at least  tonnes a year and resulting in a signicant reduction in carbon dioxide. It is also hoped that this will make a contribution towards further reducing nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and noise.According to the organisations behind these plans, it will be £, cheaper to service MV Hamnavoe each year, as a result of the project. £, of funding was secured for the scheme from the European Regional Development Fund in August last year, with additional funding coming from OIC#s Miscellaneous Piers and Harbours fund and HITRANS.The scheme is expected to fully pay for itself in three years’ time through efficiencies and cost savings.Organisations behind the project say that other benefits will include the installation of an electric bus charger at the ferry terminal to open up opportunities for an electric vehicle to be used on the Stromness to Kirkwall route. There are also plans for the installation of electric vehicle charging points, as well as  electric bicycles for use by members of the public.For the full story, pick up a copy of The Orcadian, this Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But luckily Auchinleck Talbot won - to regain the trophy.Mark, from Mauchline, East Ayrshire, said he \"couldnt believe it\" when he had to miss his stag weekend.He said: \"They all went to Benidorm for my stag do but I couldnt go because of the cup final dates. I was really happy we got to the cup final but definitely a bit gutted I wouldnt get to go with the boys.\"Although the forward was a good sport and was happy they still got to enjoy the holiday, he couldnt help but feel a little jealous.He was forced to stay home and focus on the game missing out on all the fun but his friends were kind enough to send him plenty of pictures.Mark added: \"I tried not to keep up with them too much because I was jealous I didnt want to know about all the fun they were having without me.\"Im happy for them and they had a good time but I wish I had been there.\"We had booked the stag a couple of months ago, I had tried to hold it back as much as possible until we got the cup dates but it got too close so I just took a guess and got it one weekend too soon.\"I couldnt believe it when I realised. Someone went in my place so I never lost out on money for the holiday but it was still really disappointing I couldnt go with them.\"Auchinleck Talbot Football Club was formed in  and they have won the Scottish Junior Cup on  occasions.The annual football competition is organised by the Scottish Junior Football Association for its member clubs.Auchinleck Talbot are the current holders, after defeating Largs Thistle - on June  at New Douglas Park, Hamilton, to retain the cup.Mark, who came on as a substitute in the game, tried to push for a late third but was denied by the crossbar.He said: \"The game went fine.

I would have been guttedI missed that at the crucial stages of the game.\"After winning, we went back to Auchinleck to celebrate with the fans.\"My friends at the stag do were all chuffed for me. If we had lost that game I would have felt even worse especially considering I had missed my stag do.\"Mark isnt feeling too down as he looks forward to tying the knot in the next few weeks.He added: \"Im getting married on June , which I am really excited for.\"It will be brilliant.

Ruth Davidson has also called for a ‘Union unit’ to be created in Downing Street to ensure the concerns of the three devolved nations are at the heart of government.Relations between the UK Government and devolved administrations reached a low point over the future of powers in devolved areas held by the EU, which will be ed after Brexit.The Scottish and Welsh governments claimed that plans for Whitehall to keep control of a handful of powers in key areas like agriculture, fisheries and the environment represented a “power grab” that undermined the devolution settlement.Cardf eventually reached an agreement over how the disputed responsibilities would be ided, but the SNP administration in Edinburgh was taken to the Supreme Court after it attempted to push through legislation asserting its own authority over the powers.The rival Scottish legislation has been dropped after judges in London ruled it couldn’t become law because the EU Withdrawal Act had already been passed at Westminster.All three governments are now in negotiations about ‘common frameworks’ to manage the sharing of devolved powers, but these have yet to reach a conclusion.The committee said it was “alarmed” by evidence only a third of Whitehall civil servants report having a good knowledge of devolution and called for better training.All Whitehall departments should have to publish impact assessments for policies affecting the devolved nations.MPs also called for “urgent” reform of the Joint Ministerial Committee, the forum that brings together devolved and UK ministers, saying it was “predominantly controlled by the UK Government”. Meetings should be hosted on a rotating basis, their report says, with a new system for resolving disputes between governments.And on the Scotland Office, the committee found most interactions between the devolved and UK governments went through inidual Whitehall departments.“We have not heard any evidence to suggest that the Scotland Office’s representative role, or its handling of devolution matters, could not be dealt with by an altogether dferent model of devolved representation in Whitehall such as a single department responsible for devolution and constitutional affairs,” the report states.Pete Wishart, the Scottish Affairs Committee’s SNP chairman, said the state of relations between the devolved administrations and the UK Government was “far from ideal”, but “not beyond repair”.“It’s been  years since devolution and the political landscape of the UK is now totally unrecognisable the Scottish independence referendum, Brexit and the erging political views of the UK’s four governments have all placed strain on a delicate devolution system,” Mr Wishart said. “The relationship between the UK and Scottish governments has broken down and there is a palpable lack of trust between the two governments.” He added: “The Scotland Office is meant to ensure that Scottish interests are fully represented at the heart of the UK Government, but my committee heard that on a day-to-day basis it is Whitehall departments which maintain the relationship with the Scottish Government.“We are therefore calling for a review of the role of the Scotland Office and the Secretary of State for Scotland, which we argue should include an exploration of the option to combine the Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland Offices into one department responsible for intergovernmental relations and devolution.”A source in Scottish secretary David Mundell’s department hit back, claiming the report was the product of nationalist partisanship.“The Scotland Office does a highly effective job strengthening the Union, so it’s no surprise the SNP want to see it abolished,” the source said.The UK Government insisted it had no plans to get rid of the Scotland Office.©JPIMedia

Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us, saying that joy in this reunites us. He knew it was chance that saw us on one side or another of any nationalist driven war, and wanted to emphasise the need for healing and togetherness.It’s a concept of course that also is captured by Robert Burns ten years after Schiller in: For a’ that and a’ that, or Trotz alledem und alledem, as it also became in .

Napoleonic Wars were certainly consequential in the rationale behind the companies formation. Particularly the Peninsular war.It wasn’t of course ever a one way street. Garve, a contemporary of Schiller and Goethe, did a great to broadcast the gains of the Scottish Enlightenment by translating and accrediting the works of Smith, Hume, Ferguson, Hutcheson, Reid and others, to the extent that Goethe himself, though perhaps before his heyday, said there was nowhere in Europe that could hold a candle to what was happening in Scotland. It would be unreasonable to suggest Burns did not become familiar with the thoughts of Kant, Rousseau, Locke, and other European philosophers, directly or indirectly, in the salons of Edinburgh. It would similarly be a nonsense to suggest that Haldane had no exposure to all this. His inspiration cannot be orced from the earlier flourishing of inspirational ideas of brotherhood and equal worth that happily live on yet. Shetland, after the Napoleonic era, seems to have been quite a radical place to a degree, as the later broken-promise legal challenges possibly demonstrate. There was also a legal challenge related to a whale grounding in Sandwick which seemed fairly radical in intent. The underpinning ideas don’t appear to respect the random lines drawn on maps that seem to dominate some people’s thinking.Some lines are more equal than others eh Peter The modern Labour movement of course grew out of the earlier Liberals, with many older ideas and values broadly held in common. Opening the debate, crossbencher, Lord Lisvane saw a problem where Scotland and Northern Ireland, as two of four parts of the United Kingdom, backed Remain, yet could be dragged out of Europe against their will. He identied #a sort of imperial condescension from the centre—from Westminster and Whitehall# and sought #a devolution settlement properly owned by its participants# that would #include something perhaps missing from the present arrangements: the R word—respect.#Most Scots voted to continue their solidarity with Europe, whilst a signicantminority of English and Welsh voters would apparently risk sacricing their older union with Scotland in order to Leave. Schilleradvocated seeking broadminded and warmhearted company. Should the UK falter, will it be those who sought to continue to enjoy the benefits of the wider degree of solidarity who are really to blame I am so sorry, Peter Hamilton, Schiller died two hundred years ago.

Students have learnt about the aquacultures along the tidal zones of Skye and food practices that can support them.During the summer, three graduates of the course have been awarded a Climavore apprenticeship in restaurants across Skye and Raasay # Edinbane Lodge, Raasay House, and Scorrybreac Restaurant. Working in close collaboration with the chefs and kitchen teams, the apprentices will develop, prepare and serve Climavore dishes to support and develop alternative aquacultures that promote cleaner usage of the tidal zone.The programme will be launched with a celebratory meal on Saturday st June at the oyster table in Portree. Prepared in partnership with the pupils, diners will be treated to a lunch of scallop ceviche, oysters, seaweed soup and carrageen panna cotta, washed down with a Harris Gin and sea buckthorn cocktail.Events on Sunday nd June will include a walk to a rare native Skye oyster habitat, which will be followed by a screening of the recently-released film #Artishal# at the Aros Centre in Portree. Produced by Patagonia, #Artishal# is a film about people, rivers, and the fight for the future of wild fish and the environment that supports them. The film screening will be followed by a discussion led by environmentalist Corin Smith.Alon Schwabe of Cooking Sections explained why he believed this project was so vital. He said: #All across the Scottish isles, the United Kingdom and across the planet we are witnessing a tremendous loss of bioersity and extensive pollution of our air, land, and waterways. In the UK and all around the world, the environments we leave to future generations are in a fragile state.#Climavore questions how we eat as humans changes climate and develops programmes to provide tools to young residents of Skye to transform food practices, ecologies and environments to become better places for humans, plants and animals living along the tidal zone.#Atlas Arts producer Shona Cameron added: #Working with the students and teachers at Portree High School over the last year has been an exciting development for this project. The students have shown real enthusiasm to learn about the local ingredients and engage in conversations that question sustainability.#It has been brilliant to see restaurants across the islands continue to show enthusiasm towards the aims of Climavore and demonstrate a willingness to take on apprentices, working with them to bring Climavore dishes to their menus. It is our vision to expand the apprenticeships to more students and restaurants across the whole academic year, starting in September .#If you would like to attend these events or wish further information, you can visit atlasarts.org.uk, email shona@atlasarts.org.uk or phone  ."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/KEEP-TO-THE-LEFT-1-Copy.jpg","title":"tech giants urged to join keep left road","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineTech giants are being urged to provide an additional safety feature to stop foreign motorists from driving on the wrong side of the road.Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch MSP Kate Forbes has written to leading satellite navigation firms such as Apple and Google Maps to highlight the concern.Because some sat navs and smartphones give users a reminder of the speed limit, she hopes that a similar notice can be given so that tourists stay on the left-hand side.Ms. Forbes is supporting the #Keep Left# campaign, which was launched after Skye woman Sharon Anslow was injured in a collision with a tourist#s car last year.Ms Forbes said: #Nobody intentionally drives on the wrong side of the road, but clearly we#ve got to do more to remind visitors to drive on the left.#Having contacted all the car hire companies to raise awareness of this issue, I#ve started looking at other points of contact with tourists.#I#m sure that many will be using a navigation device, whether a GPS, SatNav, Google or Apple maps.#Already, these devices usually remind drivers not to touch it whilst driving and to keep to the speed limit.#I have contacted the tech companies to askthey could develop them further to remind drivers to drive on the left.#This could be done either verbally whilst driving or a warning sign before the start of a journey.

In  its final report included “proposed actions” for Ministers to adopt or pursue in order to lessen theeffects of households having to spend more than  per cent of their incomes onheat and light.Housing minister Kevin Stewart told the Free Press thetask force’s report and recommendations have “helped inform the development ofthe Fuel Poverty Bill and draft strategy”, alongside other signicantstakeholder engagement, including the first ever Islands Communities ImpactAssessment.He added: “Scotland is one of the few countries in theworld to define fuel poverty and set a goal towards eradicating it. By changingthe definition of fuel poverty so it’s more closely aligned to relative incomepoverty and taking steps to ensure it works for remote rural and islandcommunities, we are ensuring our support is focused on those who need it most.”A spokeswoman for Mr Stewart also said that “tacklingand prioritising extreme fuel poverty” – where households have to spend over per cent of their income on heat and light – was the first priority of the newBill. New definitions of both fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty arecurrently being worked on.She added: “Our proposals in the Fuel Poverty Billwill align fuel poverty more closely with low income. Scotland is among only ahandful of European countries to define fuel poverty, let alone set targets relatingto its eradication. Our proposal to use the Minimum Income Standard isimportant and innovative and more closely aligns fuel poverty with low income.The UK Minimum Income Standard, used in the new definition of fuel poverty inthe Fuel Poverty Bill, takes account of the additional costs associated withliving in remote and island communities by applying an uplt for remote ruralareas and remote small towns, and, separately for island areas.

The late Peter McCambridge won his Distinguished Conduct Medal on the Longest Day - but he had, in fact, dropped into Normandy in the late evening of June , .Anyone who has seen the film of The Longest Day will remember the scenes featuring Richard Todd and the Glider troops of the Oxs and Bucks Light Infantry attacking Pegasus Bridge.Mr. McCambridge, then an NCO with the thParachute Btn. of the th Airborne Division, was fighting only yards from this famous action in the nearby village of Le Port.In later years, Peter McCambridge was a familiar figure in Ballymena. He lived at Wilson Crescent and was a keen walker. Few,any, would have known that the tall, bespectacled figure who went about his civilian le so quietly and modestly was one of the heroes of D-Day.This is what his citation recorded about the action:-  Unit : B Company, th Parachute Battalion. Service No. : . Awards : Distinguished Conduct Medal‘This NCO was one of the parachute troops who landed behind the German lines in Normandy on the night th th June . During the fighting for Beacutenouville bridge on the th June, McCambridges platoon was responsible for holding the village of Le Port. At one period his section became detached from the platoon and the fighting, which went on for  hours almost without pause, was particularly fierce. McCambridge noticed that one house dominated the scene of the fighting. By skilful use of a smoke grenade and displaying the greatest dash he got his section across a road swept by Machine Gun fire and into the house. He used anti-tank grenades to smash open the garden gate and the door of the house. Once inside the house he was completely cut off from the rest of his company, who actually had withdrawn slightly, but he was in a dominating position and became the target for the enemy who greatly outnumbered his section and were surrounding him. So well did he dispose his men however and so splendid was his leadership that he held this isolated house until the seaborne troops eventually entered the village from the other end, several hours later. At times the enemy were close enough to try and beat down the door by beating it with their rle butts - McCambridge dealt with such attacks by having grenades dropped on them from the upper windows. There is no doubt that the holding of this dominating house seriously weakened the enemy attacks and greatly assisted the battalion to carry out its job of holding the bridge. On the th June at Bois de Bavent during a company attack Sgt McCambridge, together with another NCO, saved the le of his platoon commander, who had been wounded and whose phosphorus bomb was burning in his pouch. Between them they extracted the burning bomb and dragged the officer to cover despite heavy and accurate mortar and Machine Gun fire.McCambridge has shown himself throughout the three weeks continuous fighting to be a truly magnicent NCO. He is calm, cheerful and always reliable.

We put the club on a sound financial footing before I left in  – this was achieved from a less-than-zero position in .“Suffice to say, this is where I began as a football administrator and I have always been grateful to the club for that.”Commenting on the Amateurs’ exciting plans for a new pitch and clubrooms, Mr Martin said the future was looking bright for his old club. He brought the best wishes of the Irish FA and on their behalf presented a crystal bowl to Dromore chairman Russell Ward to mark the occasion.Indeed, Mr Ward was a busy man on the night.In addition to making two fine speeches himself, the Amateurs chairman was presented with a further two pieces of crystal from Mr Pateman and Mr Johnston. Both league officials made excellent speeches during which they brought the best wishes of their respective organisations and paid generous compliments to Dromore on reaching their th anniversary.AuctionA highlight of the evening was the auction of sporting memorabilia. Hospitality tickets for a Northern Ireland game, signed shirts from Ulster Rugby and Linfield FC, and signed footballs from Rangers FC and Manchester United, all sold for very respectable sums.However, a titanic bidding war took place over a signed Liverpool FC football and the atmosphere in the room was electric as the figure kept getting higher and higher.When the auctioneer, Mr Fullerton, eventually brought the hammer down and declared ‘sold’, it was Amateurs committee member and local businessman Darren McCauley who became the new owner of the prized football.He might have paid an eye-watering amount, but being a lelong Liverpool fan and a great Dromore clubman, Mr McCauley was delighted with his purchase – and with Liverpool having won the Champions League final at the weekend, it now looks like a clever investment.With the formalities over, it was time for the band to take to the stage, and five-piece Klass proved a big hit, packing the dancefloor until the finish.AwardsThe final act of the   season came on Saturday, May  with a charity match between current players and a team of Amateurs “legends”.An entertaining game was played in a friendly but competitive spirit at the Community Centre.The youthful legs of the current players proved too much for the wise old heads of the legends. However, a clever tactical decision to play the last  minutes with  players on the pitch helped the old boys finish the game with a respectable - defeat.It was wonderful to see so many former players come along, pull the boots on and attempt to relive past glories. Special mention goes to Malcolm Hanna, who celebrated his th birthday with a sterling display in midfield.A total of £ was raised for Diabetes UK, with the costs of the day kindly sponsored by Trevor Tate and Son Transport Ltd.Afterwards, the Amateurs held their end-of-season awards presentation in the clubrooms.Chairman Russell Ward expressed his sincere thanks to the coaching staff, players and committee for all their efforts throughout the season.First team player-manager Graeme Davis was praised for guiding the Amateurs to their highest place league finish in many years.Dromore ended the season in fth positionin the Intermediate B Division of the Mid Ulster Football League.Their record was as follows: P W D L Pts .Graeme can be proud of this achievement in his debut season in charge. The young manager has built up a formidable squad with a lot of potential and next season they’re sure to be targeting some silverware.Things were a lot tougher for reserve team manager Ned Walsh. The seconds finished eighthin Reserve Division Four.Their record was as follows: P W D L PtsDficult as the season proved, it was still a great learning experience for the younger players. Although there were many ups and downs over the year, the team stuck together and there was a great spirit in the changing room, right up until the last game.The award winners for both teams was dominated by young players – an encouraging sign for the future.The first teams gongs were a family affair, with the Reain brothers, Josh and Matthew, iding up the trophies between them. These two fantastic athletes will be the backbone of the first team for many years to come.Young player of the year was Matthew Briggs, who moved up from youth football and played the entire season in the first team - a tremendous achievement.In the seconds, top goalscorer Jonathan Rodgers only joined midway through the season but he is a great attacking player and is such an exciting prospect. And -year-old Nathan Thompson capped a wonderful season by taking home both the manager’s and players’ player of the year trophies. Nathan is a quiet young man – but on the pitch he makes his presence felt, and is a model defender who rarely makes a mistake.Clubman of the year was the popular Christopher Tate – a committee member and first team coach, Christopher puts his heart and soul into the club.Dromore Amateurs will hold their AGM in the clubrooms on Monday, June  at pm. Anyone with an interest in the club should come along and hear about the exciting plans for the future.  award winnersClubman of the year: Christopher TateClub young player of the year: Matthew BriggsFirst teamTop goalscorer: Matthew ReainPlayers’ player of the year: Josh ReainPlayer of the year: Matthew ReainReserve teamTop goalscorer: Jonathan RodgersPlayers’ player of the year: Nathan ThompsonPlayer of the year: Nathan Thompson"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic and","story":"Police in Craigavon are advising motorists that a road in the Gilford area is currently closed due to a fallen tree.

If we get Boris Johnson in as Prime Minister, God knows what’s going to happen because that man wants to bring in an amnesty. He will probably call a halt to legacy inquests, so we need to get people out on the streets at the weekend.”She continued: “The inquest won’t answer all of our questions, but at least we’re having it addressed. We had General Mike Jackson in the box who, when my brother and Mr Corr were being thrown into the back of an army vehicle, he stood round the corner saying they had engaged in two-three hour gun battle and had shot dead two gunmen. That has now been exposed – they were unarmed.“We’re  years down the line with our campaign. An inquest is something that every person is entitled to. The right to le is something that people should have in any country.”Mr Laverty’s niece, Mary-Kate Quinn, added: “The Stormont House Agreement was something that people were happy with, but all of the mechanisms are shelved. Sunday is about making sure there is a process for everybody to be involved in and asking for it to be implemented.“The Stormont House Agreement provides people with mechanisms that acknowledge their loved ones. There are people sitting who don’t even know that they have had loved ones murdered – they have no voice.We’re very lucky –you could say that – that we have a process and we’re miles ahead of everybody  because of the inquest.”She continued: “The Ballymurphy campaign and the inquest has given people hope. As a family we would like to think that it gives people hope. When the Bloody Sunday families got the outcome of their investigation it was victory for them, but it was a victory for all of us. I think this march is about hope and about demanding the rights that we’re entitled to.”The Time for Truth March will assemble at pm, Sunday th June at three points, walking to join at Belfast City Hall.

These lines of inquiry do not include the journalists, Mr Birney or Mr McCaffrey, as suspects in the investigation.“At all times, my officers have acted in good faith, within the law and followed due process. The warrant application was originally submitted to and approved by a county court judge. We do, however, accept and respect the decision of the High Court last week.“We plan to produce a final report to the Chief Constable of the PSNI outlining all of our findings.”In response PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton said: “In , PSNI became aware of an alleged theft and or unlawful leaking of sensitive documents relating to the Loughinisland investigation from the Office of the Police Ombudsman. To ensure independence and address any conflict of interest I asked Durham Constabulary to conduct the investigation.“I am grateful to Durham Constabulary and to Chief Constable Mike Barton for the work they have conducted on our behalf in this sensitive investigation. I have always accepted the autonomy of Chief Constable Barton’s inquiry and I fully concur with his decision not to progress the investigation into the two journalists Mr Birney and Mr McCaffrey.“Throughout the period of this investigation, the horror of what happened in Loughinisland has never been far from any of our thoughts. The perpetrators of that crime have never been brought to justice and that is a matter of huge regret for policing.“The police investigation into who murdered the six innocent men in the Heights Bar in  remains open but progress is dependent on new information. There are people out there who know what happened. I would appeal to them to come forward and make a statement that will help us finally bring justice to the families of the victims.“I am aware that the investigation over the last year has caused concern for families who have already suffered so much. That is something none of us would ever have wished to do.“However, as a police service, the suspected theft or unlawful leaking of any sensitive documents containing information that may endanger le is a serious matter which we are statutorily obliged to investigate.“Recognising the sensitivities, we asked an independent Police Service to conduct the investigation. The clarity provided by last week’s hearing has now brought a signicant part of that investigation to a conclusion.“I await the final report from Durham on this complex investigation.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tim and jake unveiled as feile comedy leads","story":"NORTH is set to meet West as Belfast’s comedy big hitters come together for Féile an Phobail’s annual comedy night.

Not after the referendum,\" he wrote. \"That is the one big lesson of Brexit: a referendum without a plan is stupid. \"So a referendum on unity must be set in a thoughtful inclusive process which sets out a programme of sustainable options. Including phases of transition.\"The Louth TD also used recent remarks by two prominent unionists to back his case. Baroness Eileen Paisley, widow of firebrand DUP founder Rev Ian Paisley, recently said of the partition of the island that \"perhaps that was a wrong ision\" and said she \"would like to think I could\" live in a united Ireland.He also cited former DUP leader and First Minister Peter Robinson, who last year suggested that preparations should be made for the possibility of a united Ireland, and he would accept a democratic vote for one, although unionists would want some \"protections\". Mr Adams wrote: \"This need for protections has long been recognised by republicans and nationalists. No one I know who wants a united Ireland believes that it should be any other than a warm house for unionism, built on a foundation of equality and inclusiveness. This is evident in the debate taking place on the unity issue.\"Mr Adams call comes after Sinn Fein lost half its local councillors in the Republic last week, as well as losing two of its three MEPs there.TUV leader Jim Allister poured scorn on Mr Adams border poll call. \"After its poor showing in the Republics elections, Sinn Fein has clearly decided to wheel out Adams to bang the unity drum again,\" he said.\"It is a matter of regret, though, that in his attempt to boost flagging republican morale, he was enabled to draw succour from the foolish comments of a DUP peer and from a former leader. It is for the DUP to answer for their own.\"In his blog post, the former west Belfast MP also cited unionist commentator Alex Kanes call for unionists to be prepared for a poll.Last night, Mr Kane said Mr Adams plea to Dublin \"may be an acknowledgement from Sinn Fein that this route - through the Irish government - could be the only way potentially forward for their Irish unity project\".\"Its also an admission that Sinn Feins dreadful results in last weeks local and European elections in the Republic are forcing them into a rethink, forcing them to acknowledge that they cannot by themselves persuade unionists - or the major parties in the Republic - of the value of their unity project,\" he said.A poll during the Euro elections in the Republic found that % of people agreed with a united Ireland. \"That was also the day Sinn Feins vote went down the drain,\" Mr Kane said.Ulster Unionist Party leader Robin Swann MLA said that as a TD in the Irish Republic \"and a lelong self-proclaimed Irish republican, Gerry Adams is perfectly entitled to call on the Dublin government to plan for unity one day\".

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

Were used to Americans coming over and flattering the Irish with faux praise about how their ancestors built their country. Trump is somewhat dferent, though.Sources say the US President told Taoiseach Leo Varadkar that he always thinks of the Republic as \"a huge country\" because of the impact its people have had. Varadkar happily told him the country has just five million people.It was one of the lighter moments in a meeting that briskly moved from serious topics to sport. Brexit, immigration and all featured, before conversation swayed to The Open. At one point the Irish side found itself explaining how, for some sports, the whole island plays as one team, while for others, there are Republic and Northern Ireland teams. The US President was fascinated. Insiders say the atmosphere was \"warm\", which probably matched the temperature in the makesht meeting room that was dressed up with a few net curtains and colourful flowers. On the American side, Trump had some big hitters, but they didnt throw any punches. There was his Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, National Security Advisor John Bolton and Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin. Varadkars back-up team included his Chief of Staff, Brian Murphy, main Brexit brain John Callinan, US envoy John Deasy and Ambassador Dan Mulhall. Even before the meeting began, it was obvious Trump was in a good mood. He allowed journalists to fire questions at him for eight minutes without trading any insults. He also denied being in Ireland to play golf and promote his hotel but struggled to show that he had done any actual preparation for the meeting. The Taoiseach was brave enough to publicly correct him when he tried to compare the Irish border situation with his plans to build a wall between the US and Mexico. \"His basic knowledge isnt great,\" a source admitted. However, Mr Varadkar insisted afterwards that the purpose of the meeting was to educate the US delegation.Soon, Trump and his we, Melania, were on board a chopper bound for Doonbeg. Irish officials were more than a little relieved. Mr Varadkar went on to defend the cost of providing , unormed and  specialist gardai for the trip. \"The good bilateral relationship between Ireland and America is worth a lot more than €m,\" he said. Trump is unlikely to have taken in much of what was said, but he didnt call anybody, including Michael D Higgins, a stone cold loser. No real damage done, then, which is the best they could have hoped for. There was no mention of wind turbines or fake news. \"I learn from my mistakes,\" the Taoiseach laughed as he left the post-match analysis session.  data-dfpadtargeting and First Lady Melania Trumpdisembark Air Force One upon arrival at Shannon Airport in Shannon, County Clare, Ireland on June , .

The complaint alleges the Brazilian international raped her in a Paris hotel room on May . A doctor gave a statement to Sao Paulo police on Thursday about his medical examination of the accuser.Neymar, who plays in the French capital for Paris St-Germain, denies any wrongdoing. After word of the woman’s allegation became known, he shared social media posts meant to show the accuser had sent him friendly messages after the alleged rape.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Neymar leaves the police station Neymar injured his ankle in a friendly against Qatar on Wednesday held as a warm-up for the Copa America tournament.The accuser, Najila Trindade, a -year-old model, made her first public comments about her charge this week, telling two Brazilian television stations that Neymar raped her and engaged in “aggression”, or physical violence.She told the SBT channel that Neymar became aggressive after she refused to have unprotected sex with him. She said the player had sex with her despite her refusal and hit her repeatedly.“I said ‘Stop it, stop it, stop it’. He did not communicate, he just acted,” Ms Trindade said.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Danilo Garcia de Andrade, lawyer for Najila Trindade Her lawyer, Danilo Garcia de Andrade, said Ms Trindade is suffering “threats, she is taking medicines, she has problems sleeping and of course she is scared”. He did not say what kind of threats she received or who they were coming from.A video emerged on social media on Thursday night that appears to show Neymar and his accuser in a physical altercation. It is unclear how or when the video was made.Neymar da Silva Santos, Neymar’s father and agent, said the new video is evidence that his son was set up by Ms Trindade.She denied that during her TV appearances, saying “I wouldn’t expose myself this way to take money from Neymar. There is no logic, there is no sense.”One of her lawyers said she will give evidence in Sao Paulo on Friday."},{"url":null,"title":"20m new build ardnashee school former foyle college site","story":"A £m new build school for Derry children with learning dficulties has experienced further delays which means construction work is now “unlikely” to commence before , it can be revealed.The Department of Educationconfirmed its intention to build a new school and college on the former Foyle College Junior School site on Northland Road last year, however, these plans have been blighted by setbacks ever since.Firstly, there were delays in the transfer of the site from the Foyle College to the Education Authority.Issues around ownership arose when the building was set alight by arsonists in July of last year which subsequently held up the demolition process.And having committed to work commencing in the financial year from April  to March , the DoH announced in January of this year that it would be pushed back until the latter half of .The Derry News has now learned that a revised business case has to be submitted by the department meaning the build is unlikely to commence before .Yesterday, a departmental spokesperson said: “The Stage submission for the Ardnashee School and College project has been approved by the Department however costs have escalated and a revised business case will now be required.“The preferred option remains to locate the new build school on the former Foyle College junior school site at Northland Road in Londonderry.

I believe we have achieved this outcome with the design incorporating the Mourne mountains, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoI am also pleased that dedicated motorhome bays have been provided in Castle Park and that the spaces are being well used.Cllr Clarke said it was important that the local authority works with motorhome owners as Newcastle and the wider region needed to be a welcoming place for

obesity epidemic  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council is aiming to help fight the growing obesity crisis across Northern Ireland.Local politicians are gearing up to declare war on the issue and implement a new policy that will result in high sugar items such as sweets, fizzy drinks and high fat snacks being banned from vending machines in council buildings across the district, including its leisure centres.The high sugar items will be replaced with healthy choice snacks and drinks with local politicians hoping that other organisations across the district, which have vending machines in their buildings, will follow suit.A number of local schools have already banned chocolates and crisps from their vending machines with politicians keen to lead from the front in encouraging people to eat more healthily and exercise regularly.Last year, the local authority launched a new app to make it easier for residents across the district to take part in sport and leisure activities and receive up-to-date information about the local authorityrsquos leisure facilities.Now it wants to go a step further to help improve peoplersquos health.The move to ban high fat and sugary items from vending machines across council buildings, which will be formally discussed later this month, comes after it emerged this week that sweets, crisps and fizzy drinks could soon be sold under cigarette-style plain packaging under plans by a number of leading brands to help combat the obesity epidemic.A recent Department of Health survey revealed that that % of people in Northern Ireland were overweight, with % classed as obese with councillors acutely aware that obesity continues to be one of the most important public health challenges.They recognise that being overweight or obese increases the risk of le threatening disease, with its costs extending far beyond the public sector, affecting iniduals, families, communities, the economy and society as a whole.At Monday nightrsquos monthly meeting of the local authority, politicians agreed to debate the possible ban and view the move as an important step towards tacking the obesity issue.They aim to encourage people to opt for healthier food choices and to change their diet as part of the drive to create an environment that supports and promotes a physically active lestyle and healthy diet.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke, who is spearheading the drive to ban sugary snacks and drinks from council vending machines, said he hopes it will empower people to make healthier choices and reduce the risk of overweight and obesity related diseases.He said tackling childhood obesity was already a public health priority and was keen for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to do all it could at a time when research suggested that one in four children across the island of Ireland carried excess weight.Cllr Clarke said that without action to reverse current trends, the next generation will be beset with signicant ill-health related issues linked to obesity, most of which are potentially preventable.ldquoI am keen for the local council to introduce a new policy to effectively ban high fat and sugary foods and drinks from vending machines across its facilities and replace them with healthy options, he explained.ldquoI also hope that the local authorityrsquos many partner organisations will follow suit. We do not want to see obesity becoming a social norm and I believe we can help make a dference by exercising greater control over what items are in vending machines in all council buildings.Cllr Clarke said he viewed a ban on sugary snacks and drinks as ldquojust the start of a concerted campaign to help tackle obesity and get people move towards healthier lestyles.ldquoI think it is important that the council takes the lead on an issue which everyone can support. It is essential people signicantly reduce their intake of unhealthy food and drinks, he said.The local councillor also suggested that the local authority should offer politicians healthy options when they arrive for their tea ahead of the monthly council meetings.ldquoHealthy options featuring salads, fruit and vegetables should also be on the menu at council-organised s so people can choose to eat healthily. While I want the council to take the lead on this issue, I hope many other bodies it works alongside will follow suit.ldquoWorking together we can make a dference and help people change their lives. The councilrsquos lead on this issue could have a ripple effect across the district beyond.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoThis is not about being a kill joy but encouraging people to be more health conscious when it comes to what they eat and drink and is the first step in a process..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Countdown to DownTime summer festival  ","story":"THE countdown is on for this monthrsquos spectacular DownTime summer festival which has something for everyone.Organisers of the four-day community event mdash which kicks off on June  mdash are promising a sparkling festival of fun which includes two daysrsquo of not-to-be-missed horse racing at the widely acclaimed Downpatrick track.Horse racing first took place at in Downpatrick in  and for almost  years the local track has been constantly improving, boasting great racing, modern facilities, themed race days and a rather unique atmosphere.DownTime summerfest has been organised by a dedicated local team from all sectors of the community whose aim is to get people out and about not just over the four-day festival, but across the summer.Now in its second year, the festival is supported by Newry, Mourne and Down Council and features over  events covering arts, heritage, music, food and, of course, sport.There will be street art, live music, theatre performances, free train rides, a living history Viking encampment at the St Patrick Centre and an artisan market mdash which will be open between am and .pm mdash cradled in the grounds of the Down County Museum.Locals and visitors alike will experience a haven of freshly produced food, bespoke crafts and relaxing surroundings.

Antrimrsquos expected fightback started immediately with the accurate Katie McAleese keeping her side in contention with five consecutive points, including three from play.There was only a point in it as the first half drew to a close, but Down broke free from their shackles and Mallon sent her side into the break with a - to - lead with a well-taken score.Antrim reduced the leeway to a single point at the start of the second half with a score from Bronagh Orchin, but a composed Down side replied with a brace from Mallon as the Mourne girls took a - to - lead after  minutes.McAleese and Paula OrsquoHagan swapped points before Down hit the jackpot when Sara Louise Carr found the back of the Antrim net for Downrsquos second goal and a six point lead with  minutes remaining.Full credit to Antrim, they refused to throw in the towel and three unanswered points from Maeve Kelly and McAleeseleft a puck of the ball between the sides.It was a hammer and tongs finish with both sides feeling the pressure, but it was Downrsquos Niamh Mallon who settled the issue with a converted free and give her side a deserved victory.Down captain Fionnuala Carr was delighted after her sidersquos victory and it marked a successful season on both the club and county front for her after she also lted the All-Ireland Intermediate Club Camogie title with Clonduff in March.ldquoThere are a few of us that played for Down for many years and couldnrsquot win an Ulster senior.

Apart from a host of blister complaints, the bulk of real casualties were a handful of people taken to Downe Hospital suffering from heat exhaustion.One woman suffering from exhaustion had to be taken by an RAF helicopter to the Red Cross mobile treatment room and a man, who was knocked unconscious when a small boulder struck him on the head, was also taken to hospital.Despite minor upsets, the whole day was a big success story. The chief organiser, Mr Paddy McAteer, said he was stunned by the huge turnout.ldquoThe walk was a tremendous success with a record number of starters and a high number of people who completed the trek, he said. ldquoThis walk is undoubtedly getting bigger and bigger and it is amazing to see people from all walks of le coming together.The walkers were supported by a range number of voluntary route marshals.

With winter over, during which time many elderly residents were effectively trapped in their homes after dark, the news may not be much consolation for residents.The committee also heard that their plea for a telephone kiosk at Cuan Beach had been refused and that an alternative site has been found for the Toye Kiosk at the New Line.ANNSBOROUGH mdash The youngsters of Annsborough have at last been able to use their new playing fields where a mix-up in the erection of a fence had kept them out for several months. Grazing cattle which have been using the field have been banished to the sidelines behind a new fence.The problem started when Enterprise Ulster erected only one fence at the new playground and forgot about s second fence to keep out nearby cattle. The mistake led to angry words at Down Council where officials were blamed for not supervising the work and inspecting the completed job.However, Enterprise Ulster workmen responded quickly to a council call and within days had put things right.SHRIGLEY mdash A new factory in Shrigley, which will manufacture plastic products and employ  people, is expected to open within the next few months.The factory is sited in premises vacated by the tannery at Shrigley and the man behind the venture is Mr Garfield Brown, who already owns the Killyleagh Rug Company.It is not exactly clear when the new firm will open, but itrsquos managing director, Mr Lance Walker, says he is optimistic that production will start in August.He said the factory will carry out plastic processing and will provide materials for the packaging industry. ldquoObviously we want to start as soon as possible, but at the moment machinery is being delivered and we are waiting for more to arrive. This makes it impossible to announce when production will start, he added.CROSSGAR mdash Mr Edward Cargo, from Crossgar, retired this week after  years of service to transport and received an inscribed gold watch from his colleagues to mark the occasion.Mr Cargo, who was based at Downpatrick bus station, received his gold watch from the station manager, Mr Ian Cunningham, at a specialheld in the Slaney Inn, Raholp.Mr Cunningham, who made the presentation on behalf of Mr Cargorsquos colleagues at the Downpatrick, Newcastle and Ballynahinch Ulsterbus depots, thanked him for his long and distinguished service in transport, starting with the old Northern Ireland Road Transport Authority and finally Ulsterbus.Mr Jim Prior, on behalf of the engineering department, wished Mr Cargo a long and happy retirement and thanked him for all the help and friendship he gave to all the men in the garage over the years.SAINTFIELD mdash Preparations for the th annual Saintfield and District Agricultural Show have been finalised and the organisers are hoping for good weather to ensure big crowds.Entries for the agricultural, home industry and poultry sections are very high.

He started out on his footballing journey as a fresh-faced teenager in the mid s alongside his brother Denis, the McClurgs and Pattersons at Kilmore United, and was an integral part of the embryo that was to become Kilmore Rec.Originally from Inch, just outside Downpatrick, Cyril followed Denis to Killyleagh YCin  and that was the start of a close link with the club that lasted the best part of  years.He spent a decade at The Showgrounds before moving to Drumaness Mills where he again endeared himself to all at Meadowvale with his goals and whole-hearted play.When he hung up his boots in the mid s he bided his time before taking up the role as manager at Drumaness with his pal Paul Gelston mdash he also had managerial spells at Ballynahinch Unitedand Kilmore Rec.However, in  he ed to The Showgrounds to team up with Dee Heron and together they set about building one of the best team sides to play in the Amateur League.They won everything there was to win with the exception of the Intermediate Cup.They lted the Steel  Sons, Border and Clarence Cup with regularity, as well as six Amateur League Premier Section titles in a row.In addition to his time at Killyleagh, Cyril was Heronrsquos assistant with the Amateur Leaguersquos representative team and also teamed up with Nortelrsquos Ricky Beggs as manager of the Amateur League U- youth team for three years.In more recent years Cyril, although he wasnrsquot attached to any club, still followed the highs and lows of all local outfits and loved nothing better than travelling to watch Northern Ireland.Sincere condolences are expressed to his we Betty, daughters Jenner, Pamela and Heather, and extended family circle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Walking along path of history on the Camino pilgrimage  ","story":"THE faint sound of a church bell ringing in the distance, a cockerel crowing under a leafy olive grove at sunrise or the thunderous crash of an Atlantic wave as it beats off a rocky shoreline in northern Portugal became a welcome replacement to the bustle of Downpatrick last month.For  days, my friend Shona and I ventured the -mile trek of the Camino Portuguese from the beautul and vibrant city of Porto to Santiago de Compostela in neighbouring Galicia, in northern Spain.Time stood still as we listened to the rhythmic crunch of sandy gravel underfoot and breathed in the soft pine-scented woodland pathways that led to an ever increasing number of pilgrims making their way up through the captivating beauty of the Camino da Costa mdash just one of many routes leading to the famous cathedral which is the final resting place of St James the Apostle.Our journey began after a seriously hearty breakfast in one of the many fabulous street-side cafes in Porto on Thursday, May . The traditional merchant city is situated on the lsquoRiver of Goldrsquo. It was here in the th century that Portugal took its name. Much of its fine architecture in the old medieval quarter and a mandatory wine tasting session of the world famous ruby-port wine warrant atrip in itself some day.Hugging the coastline, this first stage meanders along a low lying shoreline of boardwalks and sand dunes to Vila do Conde where we took lodging for the night in a guest house as the townrsquos albergue offered only mattresses in a hallway.Day two saw us slowly begin to adapt to the rigours and demands of the Camino. I secretly longed for the day to be over before it began and was relieved that not just a few of us were wondering the same thing. Yet,  miles later, with a one and a half stone weight packed inside our rucksacks and the unwelcome emergence of a cluster of painful blisters forming, we were singing with joy as we arrived at the popular surfing resort of Esposende in the Braga district later that afternoon.Day three began in much the same way, neither of us forgetting the miracle cure that can be derived from a good nightrsquos sleep. We crossed the Rio Nieve to the first of two  foot peaks leading to Viana do Castelo where the majestic Monte Santa Luzia stands atop of a steep hill overlooking yet another captivating beachside town.Half way between Esposende and Viana do Castelo is Igreja Santiago de Castelo do Neiva, where an altar inion relating to St James and dated  AD was found during the reconstruction of the church. This is the oldest consecration to the apostle to be found outside Spain and has put this relatively recent route firmly on the official routes map for pilgrims.Onwards we hiked to Caminha on day four, where more beach board walks, pebbled pathways and sand dunes morphed into woodland trails, offering welcoming shade from the midday sun. Another steady uphill climb helped us reach here before crossing the Spanish-Portuguese border the next day.Farmers still tend their crops by hand in this part of the world, which harks back to a bygone era, leaving it untouched by modern intensive farming methods and giving us a window on the past.The fth leg of our journey began by being ferried across the border in a row boat which had a small motor installed, leaving behind the harbour town of Caminha for the Spanish town of Garda a few short miles round the bay.Further up the coast we trekked, for -and a-half miles until we reached the quaint seaside hamlet of Oia and its famous Cistercian monastery, Real Monasterio de Oia, which dates back to .By this stage our trek was getting easier as we adapted to the distances we were hiking each day. By way of a measuring stick as to how far wersquod come, we got chatting to a couple from Kent who had made their way to a villa they had rented out for a short break.They had driven from Porto in a hired car up the motorway the day before and it took them  minutes. It had taken us five gruelling, but extraordinarily peaceful days to reach the same point and we laughed at how easy it could have been.Each day we handed over our pilgrim passport to be stamped by church sacristans, post office workers, tourist office clerks, cafe and hostel owners, each of them eager to put their mark on our pilgrim way as we followed another hand-painted yellow arrow or scallop shell, dutully painted and maintained by locals proud to be part of a , year-old Christian pilgrimage, which has exploded in popularity in recent years not only with Christians, but also with the unbeliever, the doubter, the atheist and the sceptic mdash all eager to take on its challenges in a bid to escape the rigours and stress of modern day le.Each day too locals seemed to appear out of the midsts, asby magic, beckoning us with a whistle or a car horn to prompt us to turn aroundwe had mistakenly taken a wrong route mdash for which we were very grateful because each step we took seemed to matter a great deal.On day six the town of Moughas gave way to the mountain village Baiona, from where we walked to Ramallosa, famed for its historic sites and narrow medieval streets.Day seven presented a continuous series of spectacular vistas, each imprinted upon our minds until the day we die, such was their beauty, until we reached the large city of Vigo.Between Ramallosa and Vigo we met with a retired local man out walking his dog along the seashore. Silently he studied the two of us slouched exhausted over a park bench at mid morning. We could almost hear the mechanisms at play within his mind.ldquoWhere are you from  he enquired in a fair attempt at English.ldquoNorthern Ireland, we both replied, knowing that he was going to say something witty.ldquoAh, Paddies, he said, aswaiting our next move in a chess game.Ah, you must be Pedro, we retorted, intending no harm.ldquoWhere are you walking to  he enquired.ldquoSantiago de Compostela in Galacia, we both said.It was a trigger. After telling us quite succinctly what, over the last several decades, he had slowly come to realise le was about and how it should be lived, he asked: ldquoWhy are you doing it Neither of us was prepared for his directness but I showed him my rosary beads nonetheless. ldquoItrsquos a sacrice, I said straight out. He paused before he shook his head and said: ldquoYoursquoll never make it.As he watched us stand up he was only too eager though to hold our rucksacks as we reached into them again after our short but thought provoking rest.After wishing us buen Camino, he asked us to remember him when we reached the tomb of St James.Day eight and the noise and bustle of Vigo soon gave way to  feet and a steady climb of mountainous terrain and shady woodland trekking until we reached the refreshingly rural town of Redondela.Quiet country lanes led to  miles of more pebbled rustic pathways and stony gravel lanes on day nine until we reached the city of Pontevedra. As good fortune would have it, Friday, May , was a public holiday across Galacia and every shop, except cafes and wine bars were closed. We did mange to explore the magnicent Roman town though in the evening, but our bank balance didnrsquot suffer too much.Pontevedra paved the way on day ten with more forest trails and waterfalls. Our first climb of the day was to Caldas de Reis, home of the famous volcanic foot spa where for centuries pilgrims have been dipping their sore and weary feet in water of  degrees.Our penultimate day saw us take on the dizzy heights of Mount Corgullion before reaching the famous city of Padron, where we sampled the world famous padron peppers with dinner in the evening.Padron is  miles south of Santiago and is the starting point of St Jamesrsquos ministry in Spain and to where his remains were brought following his martyrdom in Jerusalem. His remains were later taken to the cathedral in Santiago where they lie in a tomb.We gazed in awe at the great Jacobean treasure and the original stone mooring post of Padron, from which the town gets its name.On the twelfth day a final temptation presented itself in the form of a train station that was situated directly opposite our lodgings that evening. Fellow pilgrims laughed at the idea that a train would take us to Santiago in  pain-free minutes,we werenrsquot up to the final trek and the almost , feet climb.I wasnrsquot laughing. I seriously eyed up the possibility, going as far to check train times. It was a stroke of good luck when I learned there was no other half way stop between Padron and Santiago. After what we had endured over the last  days, not to walk the final few miles would have been an obvious regret.And so we reached Santiago on foot shortly after pm on May , overjoyed and in a state of euphoria. The city of Santiago was worth the hike. Itrsquos as beautul and charming as it is captivating.The camaraderie and craic shared among all us pilgrims who made it from Porto to Santiago that day was incomparable to anything I have encountered before. The memories will stay with me until the day I die..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17660577.musicians-ode-to-fermanagh-performed-live-at-ardhowen/resources/images/9945915.jpg","title":"line up of calves win over judges at calf fair","story":"Breed judges from throughout the UK and Ireland were unanimous in their praise for the Pedigree Calf Fair and Beef NI Expo, held at the Balmoral Showgrounds in Belfast on SaturdaySpeaking after the one-day show, which featured three show rings and  native and continental beef breeds, event organiser and Chairman, David Connolly said: ldquoItrsquos been another fantastic event, and we certainly exceeded our strap-line lsquoBigger and Betterrsquo.ldquoThe  show has surpassed last yearrsquos inaugural event, attracting hundreds of spectators and more than  trade exhibits.

The current delays are ridiculous.“Whilst the PSNI have an immediate role to play by adopting what would be a very common sense approach by allowing temporary exemptions, the reality is that the wider problem remains a Department for Infrastructure issue.”Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong said: “The department should have seen this coming. They should have access to figures showing the number of car sales, and at the end of the day they are the ones issuing the reminder letters so they should have known well in advance how many cars were due for an MOT.“It is very unfair that people who have done nothing wrong are being penalised.”The Department of Infrastructure said the DVA is now issuing reminder letters nine weeks in advance, and is advising customers to book an appointment as early as possible to avoid delays.try catch  TrendingMOT delays: PSNI in talks about relaxing rules for affected driversIncreasing concern for N.I. teen who has vanishedN.I.

The PSNI will not make such a decision in isolation.”Asked what advice police could give to motorists faced with long delays for an appointment, the PSNI said: “Keep checking the online booking portal for cancellations.

As the majority of freight is moved by road, inaction could dent the Northern Irish economy.“In previous periods of delay, Stormont has allowed exemptions to affected vehicles while the backlog is cleared. We hope that this can be repeated again while a long-term solution is sought.”Almost , more tests than normal were made in the first three months of this year.The Department of Infrastructure has said additional staff are being recruited and “urgent consideration” is being given to the possibility of opening testing centres on Sundays for a limited period of time in order to address the current backlog.try catch  TrendingMOT delays: PSNI in talks about relaxing rules for affected driversIncreasing concern for N.I. teen who has vanishedSinger Malachi Cush lsquostablersquo in RVH following road collisionN.I.

Mr Eastwood said Sinn Fein “have spent months attacking SDLP members” for their view that calling for a border poll with no plan or idea on how it would be delivered would be madness.Indeed, in February this year Sinn Fein posted an edited video on social media which suggested Mr Eastwood had received a standing ovation at the Fianna Fail conference for saying “there’s a special place in hell for people who call for a border poll on Irish unity”. The footage had been edited to cut the full line, which added “without a plan to win it.”Reacting to comments made by Mr Adams in his blog, which also included the claim that increasing numbers of unionists are now talking about the issue of Irish unity because of “the shambles that is Brexit”, Mr Eastwood said: “I’m glad to hear that Sinn Féin is moving to the position that I have been outlining for some time. Their initial reaction to my suggestion that calling for a border poll with no plan or idea on how it would be delivered would be madness was entirely negative. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog “It has taken time, as these things often do, but I’m glad that Sinn Féin leaders are now coming to the SDLP position.”Writing on his Léargasblog, Mr Adams said the Irish government has “a duty to plan for unity” by establishing a ‘Forum for Unity’ to “open up consultations” and a “process of dialogue” around the subject.“This needs planned now. Not after the referendum,” he said. “That is the one big lesson of Brexit. A referendum without a plan is stupid. So a referendum on unity must be set in a thoughtful inclusive process which sets out a programme of sustainable options. Including phases of transition.”Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín has also called for a “New Irish Forum on Irish Unity” and “practical planning to begin now to map out the process of economic and service convergence north and south.”Dismissing Mr Adams’ comments as “an attempt to boost flagging republican morale”, TUV leader Jim Allister said: “After its poor showing in the Republic’s elections, Sinn Fein has clearly decided to wheel out Adams to bang the unity drum again.”More unionists now talking about border poll due to Brexit shambles, claims Gerry Adams Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingMOT delays: PSNI in talks about relaxing rules for affected driversN.I.

Others will be converted to fit LED lights in line with the energy reduction strategy. This is better for the environment as LED lights produce less CO.ldquoIt is dficultnot impossible to find parts for the old Victorian lamp posts, so retention and refurbishment of the street lights is generally not an option.ldquoThe lantern design on the posts is also incompatible with a conversion to LED lighting and the switch forms part of the councilrsquos Street Lighting Energy Reduction Strategy.Ms Weightonrsquos pavilion exhibition, called lsquoAdre ndash Homersquo continues until May .The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them.

I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Renewed weakness was evident within services, retail and construction. All three of these sectors signalled a signicant decline in activity in April.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mannnn.jpg","title":"manufacturing is ni bucking the global slowdown","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Global manufacturing and industry stalwarts such as Germany are feeling the slowdown. So, why are Northern Ireland’s makers and engineers bucking the trend  John Mulgrew takes a look at our top performers and what may be skewing the figures If there’s been an industry yet to be tainted by the ill-effects of the run-up to Brexit that I, or other journalists haven’t written about, I’d be very surprised.The latest economic metrics and predictors have been tarred by the three years of uncertainty and political instability. But, according to the latest purchasing managers’ indexfrom Ulster Bank, manufacturing here has seen an uplt – unlike the other sectors.Globally, however, the growth of the manufacturing sector has slowed closer to stagnation, sitting at . in Januaryaccording to the JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI.“At the moment, exports are falling in German manufacturing,” Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank chief economist said. “Northern Ireland and the UK compare favourably to the German powerhouse, and countries such as France and Italy.”He says that nine out of the  nations which are recorded by PMIs show manufacturing is falling.For Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole, Brexit-related stock-piling is certainly a factor. Let’s say you’re a cross-border business and you could be burdened by World Trade Organizationtarfs on your exports to the Republic in the event of a hard exit. What do you do  You produce more, and warehouse in your export market.Graeme MacLaughlin, relationship director, Barclays in Northern Ireland, said the “underlying state of health of UK manufacturing continues to be obscured by stockpiling, albeit down from the last survey’s record high, as Brexit uncertainty still thwarts investment intentions”.Ulster Business has revealed in this magazine that one major manufacturer, which has its base here, had stockpiled more than £m in food stock for its market in the Republic amid border concerns – and is now left with huge levels of product in a warehouse, with the exit from the EU now not likely until Halloween.“Continuing increases in inventories of both inputs and finished goods have exacerbated the slowdown in growth of new orders and given the loss of momentum in exporting activity, with growing signs that overseas markets are looking to alternative suppliers, the sector needs some degree of clarity on the future relationship with the EU sooner rather than later,” Graeme MacLaughlin said.Looking at what organic factors and positive stories which are fuelling the increase in manufacturing, Richard Ramsey says the success stories and expansion of firms such as CDE Global and Terex could be among those contributing.“They seem to be in expansion mode. But they are firms which are more exposed to the US, which is growing strongly. I would imagine those focused on eurozone are maybe experiencing that fall in demand.”Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, told Ulster Business that “in the past year, our firms have been busy”.“The economic conditions have been right. A purple patch indeed. Admittedly Brexit stockpiling has driven demand for many and as that begins to wash through the system in the coming monthsand with slowing of international and domestic demand, then now is the time to ensure we have the right conditions to ensure that this success is sustained.“By value, our engineering sector remains our most important. The extraordinary growth of the export focused sector in Mid Ulster, South Derry and West Tyrone contributes huge levels or employment and wages but as labour and skills have become more dficult to secure, firms have begun to spread out. CDE’s investment in Monkstown and Terex’s announcement for the North West demonstrate their commitment to creating more jobs here instead of overseas.“There has been much speculation about the demise of our manufacturing over recent years but the sector continues to confound its detractors. Employment levels, despite high profile closures, are back to  levels with exports at record levels and orders at home remaining strong. Our sector is larger and more important than manufacturing in the rest of the UK. Through direct and supported jobs, one in four local families rely on a manufacturing wage with our rural economy and community depending on manufacturers to bring both wealth and work.“Our award-winning food firms feed families at home and abroad with a greater number securing supply contracts with the UKs and Ireland’s largest buyers. Indeed news that Dale Farm had secured a supply contract with Greggs is further evidence that there is more growth possible for this critical sub-sector of manufacturing.“Often overlooked is our strength in building products. From Specialist Joinery and Carella fitting out the best of corporate offices to Smyth Steel and Macrete making the bulk of the new Tottenham Hotspur stadium, regarded as the best in Europe, in factories here before shipping on barges to London.“We’re also leading the move in construction from site build to factory built homes, schools, hospitals and offices at the McAvoy Group and Fasthouse. We have even seen a beautul table made by Terry Design from Portadown in  Downing Street.“Whether it is a critical spring on the Mars rover, or a defibrillator in the Oval office or indeed the fact that one in  people on the planet this year benefiting from a Randox test, products made in Northern Ireland are making a dference and making a huge economic contribution.“It is therefore critical that we cherish and celebrate our great firms who are making great products with great people in every postcode area. We must create the conditions that allow them to be free to make a success of their business and their community.As for the current and future “disruptor”, Richard Ramsey says while Brexit is the largest, the impact of Trump on the global economy, could have an impact on business here. “The thing is, it’s to what extentthere is when there is a trade war. Trump is increasing tarfs on China, then he focuses on the EU – how does the EU retaliate ”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/kpm_1.jpg","title":"ni bosses searching new markets to boost exports","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Around % of Northern Ireland bosses are exploring emerging markets in order grow their exports, according to the latest survey from KPMG.

Of the Northern Ireland bosses surveyed, % said they want their employees to feel ‘empowered to innovate. On the issue of Brexit, around two thirds of business leaders see the UK’s exit from the EU as the greatest threat to growth. Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
