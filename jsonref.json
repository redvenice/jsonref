Miss David claims his father wanted her to have an abortion          Georgina says her ex-lover is refusing to contribute towards the upkeep of their eight-month-old son, Henry          Georgie, 34, a legal aide from London, began dating James, 37, who owns a polo club on his family’s Lincolnshire estateDespite being owner of Leadenham Polo Club and a schoolboy contemporary of Prince William, Reeve has been assessed as unable to pay child maintenance because of the ‘modest’ income he receives from his family.In a letter from a solicitor acting on his behalf, the Edinburgh University graduate, whose ancestor fought alongside the Duke of Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo, accuses Georgie of going back on her promise to terminate the unexpected pregnancy and of lying about taking the contraceptive pill.Georgie denies both claims, but the row has even caught the eye of senior Church of England clergy after it emerged that James’s mother, Henrietta, who also wants no contact with her grandson, was appointed a lay canon at Lincoln Cathedral just a month before Henry’s birth.Divorcee Mrs Reeve, 62, became the subject of a church investigation after Georgie’s priest, the Rector at St Luke’s in Chelsea, wrote to the Bishop of Lincoln saying she came under great pressure from the Reeve family — ‘Mrs Reeve in particular’ — to have an abortion.In a written response to that claim, the Bishop of Grantham said that while ‘Miss David came under great pressure’, there was no evidence that Mrs Reeve, who is also Deputy Lieutenant of Lincolnshire, was involved.A morally muddled saga then, and one which raises questions about sex, relationships and responsibility in this modern age of dating.Who, then, should be blamed for this sorry situation? And, above all, what does the future hold for the golden-haired, blue-eyed baby boy at the heart of it?Henry James Frederick David-Reeve, who shares both his parents’ surnames is, somewhat ironically, the spitting image of the handsome father he has never met.          James Reeve accuses Georgie of going back on her promise to terminate the unexpected pregnancy and of lying about taking the contraceptive pill          Divorcee Henrietta Reeve, 62, became the subject of a church investigation after Georgie’s priest, the Rector at St Luke’s in Chelsea, wrote to the Bishop of Lincoln saying she came under great pressure from the Reeve family — ‘Mrs Reeve in particular’ — to have an abortion‘It’s for Henry’s sake that I’m speaking out about this,’ says Georgie, cradling her son.‘He wasn’t planned, but the fact is that we have a beautiful baby boy and he deserves to have the best chance in life. I am struggling to cope financially, and I just want James to accept some responsibility for his son.’James Reeve sees things rather differently. A letter sent to Georgie by his solicitor says: ‘You entered a relationship with him which was meant to be entirely casual, with no commitment at all.’Meanwhile, Georgie has been receiving emotional support from a most unlikely quarter — James’s elder brother, William, who is heir to the family estate. He has not only been to visit his nephew but also became his godfather when Henry was christened in September.He hit the news himself this week after he collapsed in court as he launched a battle with his mother over the future of their family’s 230-year-old country estate.Old Etonian William, 38, says the future of the 18th-century Leadenham estate is at risk due to a bitter family row, not helped by the situation between James and Georgie.Meanwhile, Georgie remains hurt and angry at the way she has been treated. While she doesn’t deny the relationship was casual at first, she argues that she and James began to see each other regularly — at least every week — and their romance became more than just physical.‘We used to take my dog for walks together and go out for long lunches and dinners. Or I cooked for us here. Sometimes we used to get a takeaway and a bottle of wine and just lie in front of the television. He brought flowers. We became close. It started to feel more serious. We opened up to each other about our lives.’And what different lives they are.Georgie, the daughter of a Pakistani-born father and British mother, was raised in a terrace house in South-east London and attended an all-girls’ state school. She studied media at the University of Buckingham, but left before finishing her degree and worked as a VIP nightclub hostess at Chinawhite in Soho.In her early 20s, she began work as a secretary at a barristers’ chambers in central London, moved to Chelsea and joined a ladies’ shooting club in West London.James, meanwhile, is one of four children born to Peter and Henrietta Reeve, and grew up enjoying all the privileges that life in a family with a lineage stretching back to Edward III can offer — including 20-bedroom Grade II-listed Leadenham House on the family’s 3,000-acre estate. He attended Eton and after university, returned to the estate to pursue his love of polo.          Despite living at Leadenham House James Reeve has been assessed as unable to make child maintenance payments           Mr Reeve (pictured), the son of Lincoln Cathedral\u0027s lay Canon who is accused of encouraging Miss David to have an abortionAn un-brie-lievable new home: Former cheese factory on a...\u0027There\u0027s no excuse for what he did\u0027: Victim\u0027s verdict after...Female former USA gymnastics trainer who worked with...Pedophile doctor Larry Nassar is transferred to notorious...Share this articleGeorgie insists she is no gold-digger and had no idea just how wealthy James was when she met him. ‘He’s actually quite scruffy,’ she says. ‘I bought him socks on two occasions because his had holes in.’Claims that she tricked him into getting her pregnant are rebutted.‘The accusation that I lied about being on the Pill or that I deliberately didn’t take it is ridiculous. The only person who can possibly know if I took it is me, and I know I took it.’Nevertheless, in June 2017 a home test revealed she was pregnant. At first, she says, James took the news calmly. He travelled from Lincolnshire and the pair attended an NHS clinic in North London offering pregnancy counselling and abortion services.She admits that at this stage, she was ready to consider a termination. ‘I was only five weeks pregnant and it seemed the sensible thing to do,’ she explains. But before they had the chance to discuss it, medical events swiftly overtook them.This dramatically impacted her feelings about the pregnancy.First, a scan suggested Georgie was suffering from an ectopic pregnancy — a potentially fatal condition. She was sent to A\u0026ampE at the Royal Free Hospital, Hampstead, where she was monitored until it became clear the pregnancy was not ectopic and she was suffering from a harmless cyst in her fallopian tube.‘It was a very stressful situation because it could have impacted my future fertility,’ she says. ‘James was wonderful, perfect in every way. He cuddled me and reassured me.’When she was discharged three days later, she returned home to find he had cleaned her flat and put fresh flowers in a vase.Soon after, they returned to the pregnancy advice clinic, again planning to speak to a counsellor about the possibility of a termination, but after another scan, Georgie was told she had suffered a ‘missed miscarriage’ — where an embryo dies but is not immediately expelled by the body. Medical advice for women suffering the condition in the first three months of pregnancy is to allow nature to take its course.Given that both she and James believed the pregnancy was over, she says, there was no longer any need to discuss a termination. Instead, they went away for a weekend to help her get over the ordeal, staying at the Victoria Inn hotel in Holkham, Norfolk.‘He was really lovely to me at that time,’ she says.But at a check-up at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in August 2017, Georgie was given the jaw-dropping news that she hadn’t miscarried at all. She was 13 weeks pregnant with a healthy baby.‘It was the last thing I expected,’ she says. ‘I could see a heartbeat. I was overwhelmed that after everything that had happened, here was a perfect little baby.’She phoned James to break the news. ‘He was completely shocked,’ she says. ‘I asked if he wanted to see the scan photos and he said that he didn’t, that it was too much for him to take in. He said he needed to speak to his mother.‘I understood that he was overwhelmed.’She claims she then had a call from Mrs Reeve. ‘During the conversation, she said James wouldn’t stand by me. She said that I should be aware that he wouldn’t be inheriting anything. There was no reasoning with her. She upset me so much that I hung up.’After that, she says, she and James maintained contact by phone but relations between them were ‘not the same as before. He wanted me to have an abortion but after everything that had happened and then seeing the scan, I felt very differently. I felt very pressurised by him and his family’The last time she saw James was at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. Georgie says it became clear he still expected her to terminate the pregnancy.‘He kept coming in and out of the room on his phone and then he just disappeared and didn’t come back. That was the last time I saw him. It was such a brutal way to be left.’When Georgie wrote to James, telling him she had to ‘decide what’s best for our baby’, she received an email from his solicitor telling her: ‘He does not wish to have any contact with you now or in the future. However, he remains willing to support you financially with the previous plan to have a termination. Any financial payment would need to be through me.’Further strongly worded legal letters followed. One sent in October 2017 reads: ‘Frankly, our client feels that he was entrapped by you . . . Our client has only ever wanted to have children in the context of a loving, stable and long-term relationship and clearly that was not the nature of the relationship he had with you. Our client has no intention of having any involvement with your child.’    James Reeve has claimed he is a victim of \u0027entrapment\u0027 who is not paid enough to make child maintenance payments Extraordinarily, a solicitor’s letter was even sent to Georgie’s widowed mother stating: ‘Reports through third parties have led our client to be concerned for Georgie’s mental state.’It continued: ‘He felt that it was necessary to put on record his own position so that you know how best to help her.’ Henry was born on March 5, 2018 and Georgie texted James to say he was welcome to visit at the hospital, but she received no response. Requests to meet via a legal mediation service were also rejected.After she turned to the Government’s Child Maintenance Service, James complied with instructions to pay her £407.71. According to his solicitor, a further review by the CMS showed ‘he lacked a current salary and was only in receipt of a modest income from his family’. The CMS does not consider assets, but the Department for Work and Pensions, which oversees the service, is monitoring the case.And it is clear that Georgie is not going to go away quietly. When the Rector of St Luke’s wrote to the Bishop of Lincoln in August, he asked for an investigation into the ‘pastorally unacceptable situation which has clear safeguarding implications’.Writing back a month later, the Bishop of Grantham said an investigation had concluded ‘this is not a safeguarding matter’.

Miss David claims she was made pregnant by James Reeve - polo-playing Old Etonian son of Lincoln Cathedral\u0027s lay Canon          Miss David met Mr Reeve in 2017 and the pair quickly began dating but she fell pregnant In the letter, copies of which were sent to both Georgie and Mrs Reeve, he added that: ‘Mrs Reeve does not deny the existence of Henry, though she has no relationship with him and does not want one,’ and said discussions had been held with Mrs Reeve ‘about how she might pray for Henry and perhaps in some future time be able to relate to him in some way that honours Mr Reeve and him.’Georgie says she would like the Reeve family to be involved in Henry’s life. For now, the only member of the Reeve family to have met the baby is his uncle William.‘He’s a really sweet chap and I worry about his future because this is absolutely no way to begin life,’ William told the Mail. ‘Everyone needs to focus on putting this behind them.’William’s support for Georgie may have been influenced by a furious row within the Reeve family itself about the future of its estate. Leadenham has been passed down through generations since the 18th century, but was partitioned after Mrs Reeve orced Peter in 2011.If his uncle is successful, the future for baby Henry may yet prove to be rosy.Georgie insists: ‘I never expected — or wanted — James to marry me.’ She adds: ‘I just want him to do the right thing by Henry. What’s happened has happened, and I’m sure James would be amazing at fatherhood if he just gave it a chance.’Mrs Reeve and James both refused to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"Remains ancient Egyptian priest oversaw embalming pharaohs discovered","story":"    Mostafa Waziri, Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities explained that after removing 300 meters of debris the mission uncovered the tomb of a priest and his wife from the 13th century B.C          Egyptian archaeologists work on restoring a wall with painted murals inside the newly discovered tomb at al-Assassif Necropolis          A child mummy lies inside the newly discovered burial at al-Assassif Necropolis, in Luxor, Egypt November 24, 2018.

They don\u0027t won\u0027t to be implicated when the warrants start to arrive, and they will arrive,\u0027 he said.For its part, Lloyds has rejected the basis of Mr Edmonds\u0027 claim.A Lloyds spokesman said: \u0027We are still waiting for Mr Edmonds to file his legal claim. If he does file his claim, it will be contested.\u0027Mr Coad, of Keystone Law, said: \u0027I have never been involved in a case where so much meticulous effort has been invested by so many to professionals to prepare a claim.\u0027In this case we have had first to unpick a sophisticated fraud, and then piece it together using primarily documentary evidence, but also some key evidence from witnesses to what was going on at the time.\u0027          Mr Edmonds admits his motivation to go into the Jungle is to hit Lloyds and he insists he\u0027ll win          Mark Dobson, 56, helped to ert funds from two high-risk clients to Mills\u0027 bogus businesses in return for £30,000 and lavish hospitality.He had to chase the fraudster repeatedly before receiving a suspicious bundle of documents that contained \u0027no evidence of appropriate sanctioning\u0027 in January 2007.A month later HBOS carried out a review of 38 struggling businesses that had received irregular loans from IA and together owed the bank £375million.The conclusion was damning: the bank stood to lose up to £288million from companies that had engaged QCS under Scourfield\u0027s supervision.Mr Angus confronted the conman with the findings at the bank\u0027s Bishopsgate office on 8 March 2007 - but within hours he went off sick with \u0027work-related stress\u0027 and never returned.HBOS suspended Scourfield for gross misconduct and he resigned in April 2007.The former banking giant carried out two further investigations but neither one uncovered the \u0027true nature\u0027 of Scourfield\u0027s corrupt relationship with Mills.Prosecutor Brian O\u0027Neill QC said: \u0027Some other employees of the Bank do not emerge well from the investigation, most particularly Paul Burnett, who was Scourfield\u0027s immediate line manager.\u0027There is little doubt that his apparent lack of oversight was partly responsible for Scourfield\u0027s ability to act in the way that he did and for as long as he did.\u0027He continued: \u0027Had Burnett and others paid closer attention to the crib sheet figures, Scourfield\u0027s activities may have been identified sooner..\u0027Burnett lost his position at the Bank as a result of his failures as a manager.\u0027Jurors were told \u0027systems and processes undoubtedly contributed to Scourfield\u0027s ability to behave dishonestly\u0027 as he began \u0027exploiting systemic and personnel weaknesses which he knew to exist\u0027.But Mr O\u0027Neill insisted there is \u0027no evidence\u0027 Mr Burnett or any other HBOS employees were complicit in the conspiracy, and said the bank wasn\u0027t \u0027knowingly turning a blind eye\u0027 to the con.THE FINANCIAL CRASHHBOS, once the UK\u0027s biggest mortgage lender, suffered a devastating collapse during the credit crunch - and taxpayers were left to foot the £20.5billion bill.The banking giant was formed by the 2001 merger of Halifax and The Bank of Scotland and loaned £435billion within seven years as it pursued an aggressive expansion plan.But it lost £10.8billion in 2008 as profits plunged by 70 per cent when the credit crunch hit.Gordon Brown\u0027s Labour government quickly issued a £20.5billion bailout package to fix HBOS\u0027s massive funding gap and avoid a \u0027banking meltdown\u0027.The Banking Standards Commission later slammed HBOS bosses for \u0027catastrophic failings\u0027 and a \u0027colossal failure of management\u0027.Former CEO James Crosby, the \u0027architect\u0027 of HBOS\u0027s failed strategy, forfeited the knighthood he was granted for \u0027services to the finance industry\u0027 after leaving the bank for a senior FSA role in 2006.Mr Crosby, thought to draw more than £400,000 a year from his HBOS pension, said he was \u0027deeply sorry\u0027 for the disaster.In 2012 HBOS senior executive Peter Cummings was fined £500,000 and banned from banking for life by the FSA for his part in the bank\u0027s near-collapse.Mr Cummings retired in 2009 with a £352,000 a year pension after making his name by lending to high-profile clients including Top Shop founder Philip Green.Lloyds Bank acquired HBOS in January 2009 as part of the rescue package.Amid the chaos, Lloyds instructed Deloitte to investigate Scourfield\u0027s activity after the Financial Services Authority (now the Financial Conduct Authority) issued a requirement notice.The criminal investigation didn\u0027t begin until after the report, dubbed Project Windsor, was completed in 2010.THE VICTIMSThe 2010 report revealed that of the £250million written off by HBOS\u0027s IA ision, £245million related to customers under Scourfield\u0027s management.Nearly all of them had engaged QCS\u0027s \u0027consultancy services\u0027.Businesses that fell prey to the criminal plot include golf equipment firm Seoul Nassau, fishing tackle company Sharpe\u0027s Holdings, aviation group Corporate Jet Services (who owned Club 328 and Euromanx), textile business Magenta, restaurant and nightclub operator the Mezzanine Group, and Remnant Media, a company setup to buy porn mags including Asian Babes.HBOS began legal action against some of the clients, including couple Paul and Nikki Turner, who ran Cambridge-based music publisher Zenith before it was destroyed by Scourfield\u0027s scam.The bank took the Turners to court more than 15 times in an unsuccessful attempt to evict them after Scourfield devastated their business.Oxfordshire farmer Justin Riggs, 57, said his livelihood was \u0027annihilated\u0027 when Scourfield authorised a £375,000 loan and advised him to sell land and chicken coops in 2004.The farmer was forced to remortgage his house when his loan rose by £7,000 after he had paid £231,000 in interest and fees.Mr Riggs\u0027 plight was discussed in parliament in 2009 as MP Ed Vaizey noted: \u0027There is a pattern in the way that Mr Scourfield engaged numerous people.\u0027He has taken businesses and loaded them with loans, charges and consultancy fees.

History professor and researcher Dr. Gary Mormino described the tunnels to DailyMail.com as, \u0027nothing too remarkable to look at,\u0027 flat on the bottom, and wide, making them unsuitable as a sewage system, and all the more interesting to those wondering why they exist\u0027At this point, I\u0027m looking at ruling things out,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m asking myself, What were the tunnels not used for?\u0027While some are quick to guess they may have been used to transport bootlegged alcohol during the 1920s and early 1930s, Mormino said that doesn\u0027t make any sense, either.\u0027I interviewed a lot of people in the 1970s and \u002780s who would have been involved in bootlegging of \u002720s and \u002730s and they\u0027ve all said the only people who feared the police were those who weren\u0027t involved in the rackets\u0027 he said. \u0027If you paid off the police, you were fine.\u0027     University of Southern Florida - St. Petersburg professor Emeritus of history Dr. Gary Mormino told DailyMail.com the tunnels (pictured) were likely part of a criminal network, and that Ybor City officials would have had to be in on the constructionMormino shared a story about one of his interview subjects named Sam, who said his father was an Italian bootlegger, who would receive a call once each month from the police telling him he had to come in and be arrested and pay his fines.Once there, Sam said the police would ask his father what name he wanted to be arrested under \u0027this time,\u0027 and the next day the front page of the newspaper would read, \u0027Seven Italian bootleggers arrested,\u0027 as part of a ruse intended to appease the public.In fact, Mormino said Sam also told him he used to deliver crates of bootlegged alcohol to shops and when the police were they, they would open the door and help him carry the boxes in, praising him for being such an enterprising young man. So, Mormino has determined, the tunnels probably weren\u0027t used for bootlegging. Instead, he said, it\u0027s far more likely they were used for \u0027white slavery related to bringing women across interstate lines for immoral purposes,\u0027 along with smuggling in Chinese laborers and Chinese-Cuban prostitutes.Mormino said Ybor City has had a large Chinese-Cuban population dating back to 1886.   \u0027Chinese people were brought to Cuba after slavery ended in late 19th century to replace slaves and work in the sugar industry,\u0027 Mormino said.The professor guessed that around that time, city of Tampa officials may have been in on creating the tunnels which would have otherwise been a massive and expensive undertaking for a criminal enterprise.          While some are quick to guess they may have been used to transport bootlegged alcohol during the 1920s and early 1930s, Mormino said that doesn\u0027t make any sense, because police were so \u0027in on it\u0027 that tunnels wouldn\u0027t have been necessary In this undated photo federal authorities are shown unearthing a buried whiskey cache in the backyard of a Ybor City homeMormino believes that local leaders may have extending the passages down to the port\u0027Basically, corrupt politics likely allowed the criminal elements to use those tunnels as part of a vast, interconnected network,\u0027 he said.  Man accused of killing his friend on Thanksgiving Day tells...AWOL California National Guardsman \u0027tried to smuggle three...Share this articleBut, Mormino made sure to mention, that while it\u0027s fun to guess about what may have gone on in those hidden passageways all those years ago, anything anyone has come up with is just a guess. \u0027I don\u0027t know if we\u0027ll ever know the truth, to be honest,\u0027 Mormino said. \u0027It\u0027s a rather elusive story now.

I simply cannot allow myself to be scared by — let alone believe in — the supernatural.But this isn’t the first time Rosalyn has spooked me. When she was 18 months old, I remember how she pointed to an outside cellar door and was adamant she could see sheep. I dismissed it at the time, but she kept shouting: ‘Look, Mummy, sheep, sheep!’ A few weeks later, we walked past again and she announced with a sad face: ‘Sheep gone now, Mummy.’Although aware our house is built on the site of old sheep farming cottages, I put it to the back of my mind. After all, Rosalyn was just grappling with the rudiments of speech she could have meant anything.          Rosalyn outside her home in north Devon where she claims to have seen ghostsBut now she’s three, and much more articulate and focused. And she continues to tell me about Tilly and Alex. No wonder I have started to feel unsettled in our home of three years. Although I don’t believe in ghosts, I would be lying if I said the idea of them didn’t scare me. There is so much in life we don’t understand, so much we don’t know, and there are so many accounts of people saying they’ve seen things they cannot rationally explain.I decided to do some digging, in an effort to convince myself that there is nothing to Rosalyn’s imaginings.I wish I hadn’t.Census records for 1861 show there was a ten-year-old boy called Alexander Turner living here. And records for 30 years later, in 1891, list a Matilda Oke, aged 20. Records are patchy from this time, so it’s very likely that Matilda was living here when she was much younger.Although I am struggling to convince myself that Alex, Tilly and the visiting flock of sheep are nothing more than the creation of a toddler’s vivid imagination, a recent study reveals that one in five Britons claims to have experienced the presence of a ghost.I did some research and discovered that there are many rational parents in the same position as me — with children like the little boy, played by Haley Joel Osment, in the film The Sixth Sense — who say they ‘see dead people’.Take mother-of-six Katie Jones, 33, a carer from Canterbury, Kent. She has an 11-year-old daughter Alice, who, from the age of two, has spoken of seeing people who are no longer here. Katie, who is married to landlord Gareth, 47, explains: ‘When Alice was two, she started to cry a lot, saying there were two men in her room staring and shouting at her, and she didn’t like it.‘She then started to say that a girl called Sheila sat at the bottom of her bed crying for her mummy. I looked in old newspaper cuttings and found that there was a girl of that name murdered here. It chilled me to the core.‘Alice then told me that my grandmother, also named Alice, who died a year before my daughter was born, was coming into her bedroom. She said that Nanna had told the girl and the men to go away, and they had.’Katie says Alice would accurately describe the clothes her grandmother wore, something she couldn’t have known.‘When Alice was three, a family member had a stillborn baby. Alice told me that Nanna had been to see her with a baby in her arms. She said the baby was named Max. There is no way she could’ve known this. We hadn’t told her about the baby or his name — she was too little to understand.‘As the years have passed, she still says Max and Nanna are there. She even told me it was Max’s fourth birthday and, when I checked, she was right. She had the correct day and age.’Katie continues: ‘When she was four, I remember her telling me that she had to give our next-door neighbour a message. Her husband had just died of cancer and she wanted to tell her to stop crying as he had told her he was fine.‘When she first started saying things, I brushed it off as the chatter of a little girl, but the more it happened the more I came to realise she was telling the truth. Now I have no doubt she has a gift.‘She has always felt comforted by her Nanna, but there have been some bad experiences. In our old house, she kept saying she saw a boy and she’d refuse to go upstairs. She’d stand there screaming, saying the boy wouldn’t let her go past. It used to really scare me.’Now aged 11, Alice says that she’s seeing things less and less, but can clearly remember seeing her great-grandmother. ‘I always felt safe with my Nanna there, and I remember seeing the baby, too. I also remember it being his birthday.‘I only feel scared when it’s someone I don’t know, but I see them less now. To any other children who see things like this, I would say you don’t have to be scared, as they are just looking out for you and trying to protect you.’          Tricia Jordan pictured with her son Luca, sevenDr Stephen Westgarth, a member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, a consultant child psychiatrist and medical director of Child Psychiatry UK, says such behaviour is normal for a young child.‘Children’s imaginative worlds are limitless, and don’t contain the same social and physical rules of the adult world.‘As a parent, I wouldn’t be worried about a child experiencing these episodes and, in some ways, it can be viewed as very positive, because it shows that they have a vivid and well-defined imagination.‘The normal situation would be that, as the child grows and the brain develops, they begin to rationalise what they are experiencing and so the episodes will begin to wane.’He says he has dealt with families who say their children are talking to ‘the beyond’, but says these tended to be spiritualists and strong believers in the afterlife, so there was a culture there already.Yet, like me, mother-of-two Tricia Jordan is not clairvoyant, but she is in no doubt that her son talks to the dead.The 32-year-old medical secretary says her seven-year-old son, Luca, has been ‘seeing’ her dead grandmother since he was a baby, which used to scare her, but she now feels comforted by it.Tricia, from Newport, Gwent, who is married to postman Stuart, 37, and also has a four-year-old son, Bobby, says: ‘My grandmother passed away when Luca was 18 months old. He had just started to speak, and the first thing he told me was how Granny would tuck him up in bed. I found it really strange. It used to scare me, and I’d change the subject.‘One of the eeriest things was him singing The Big Ship Sails On The Ally-Ally-O, which she always sang to me. He would sing it over and over, and tell me how Granny was there. I had never sung it to him. There is no way he could have known this song.‘As time went on, I realised he wasn’t scared so it was all right.’She describes another encounter when he was four: ‘One day, we passed a house near our home. He told me it was Martin’s house but he wasn’t there because he died in a fire. I checked the names on a census and a Martin had lived there. This really scared me.’Luca hasn’t had any spooky sightings for some years, and today he has no memory of seeing his dead grandmother.Tricia says that, while she has always believed in an afterlife, what she has experienced with her son has left her utterly convinced that the dead walk among us.She says: ‘I have always believed a little bit, but what I have seen with Luca blew my mind. It made me believe completely.’          Six-year-old Riley has talked to people his mother Hollie could not seeHollie Smith from New Addington, South London, also shares this conviction. She is certain her six-year-old son, Riley, has seen ghosts. The 32-year-old, who runs a party business with husband Colin, 40, says he has experienced too many things to leave her in any doubt as to their validity.She says: ‘When he was two, we were out walking when he started pointing and waving, saying, “Look, Mummy, there’s a soldier, he’s waving at us.” There was no one there. He was so excited and animated. He then looked so disappointed when he told me the soldier had gone. I believed him. He was too little to make something like that up.‘Surprisingly, I didn’t feel scared. I almost felt like it was a precious experience that someone from another life wanted to say hello.’Hollie also recalls another instance when Riley was around 18 months old. ‘I walked into his bedroom and he was having a conversation with someone. His language was limited, but he was talking and answering and gesturing with someone who wasn’t there.‘I asked him who it was. He said it was Humpty. He kept on telling me for days afterwards that Humpty was there. At the time, our neighbour had just died, a man who was very overweight. I had never sung this nursery rhyme to Riley. Maybe he’d picked it up elsewhere, but I think he was talking to our neighbour.’Riley also had an imaginary friend at pre-school called George, who was so real to him that he was the only child he played with. She adds: ‘Yes, it could be nothing more than an imaginary friend, but in the context of these other things, I’m not so sure.Celebrity psychic Honor Broxap believes such sightings should not be dismissed. ‘We are all born with a sixth sense,’ she says. ‘Yet we stop using it as we get older. Children are much more believing, less questioning or cynical. They have not yet been conditioned to think that it’s all just nonsense.          Alice, 11, said she has seen a number of ghosts from the age of three‘You have to be careful that you don’t over-exaggerate it. Yes, children do have a vivid imagination, but more often than not, there is some truth in it.’Clairvoyant medium and psychic artist Jackie Dennison agrees: ‘Children have imaginary friends. Maybe, it is just that, but perhaps it is sometimes more. They are very open to spirits and are unfazed by them. They take things in their stride. I believe we can also see layers of time, memories and echoes of what was once there.’Jackie says that this might explain the sheep in my cellar, and, with regards to Tilly and Alex, she tells me not to worry about them: ‘I think the fact that they’re in your home is quite amazing. They are obviously happy that you’re living there as a family.’Although I don’t share this sense of wonderment, I’m starting to feel a touch more at ease as to whatever is going on in my home. Rosalyn is happy, and also very young. I’m sure, like Luca and Riley, these stories will start to tail off as her real world expands, and she won’t remember much of what she tells me now.Yet, although I’ve tried to dismiss it and laugh it off, there is a growing part of me that is no longer fully convinced that we’re entirely alone in our home."},{"url":null,"title":"Teachers given wellbeing days Christmas shopping","story":"Boy, 13, who has cancer is forced to sit alone in class...Cleaning lady is jailed for ten years in Greece for claiming...Share this article‘This is a way for me to say thank you to staff for going above and beyond what is asked of them day in, day out, such as spending a weekend away on a residential trip or staying at school to help run a movie night for the children to enjoy.’ He personally covers the teachers on their days off, with other non-teaching roles also covered internally within the school.‘As a result, no teaching time is lost for any child and there is no disruption to the day-to-day running of the school,’ Mr Hulme said. The move has drawn support online from dozens of teachers, many of whom say other schools have adopted the policy.Primary school teacher Stephanie Brown said: ‘What a wonderful gesture. I know of a few schools who do this and the staff are so thankful for this day.’While another teacher Sarah Wilson said: ‘We get a half day – it’s much appreciated. For all teachers and teaching assistants.’Teacher Naomi Takeda said: ‘We have a wellbeing week in December which culminates in a day off on the Friday for all staff and students to reconnect with family and friends.’ A teacher at Langshott Primary School in Horley, Surrey, also said they get a half day for Christmas shopping – but later deleted the comment.However, Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, believes the initiative is an ‘indulgence that schools cannot afford to do’.The measure was ‘another example of staff setting a poor example’ at a time when ‘we’re fining parents who take their children out during term time on holiday,’ the former head said.More than 9,000 parents in Kent have been fined for taking their children out of school during term over the last four years – one of the highest rates in the country.Mr McGovern added: ‘It sets a terrible example to people and I’m afraid it means that teachers are going to be “de-professionalised” and no one is going to take them seriously if this is what they’re doing. They should be putting the education of children first.‘If teachers want to be respected, they need to set an example by turning up for the job and doing it well.

Miss David claims his father wanted her to have an abortion          Georgina says her ex-lover is refusing to contribute towards the upkeep of their eight-month-old son, Henry          Georgie, 34, a legal aide from London, began dating James, 37, who owns a polo club on his family’s Lincolnshire estateDespite being owner of Leadenham Polo Club and a schoolboy contemporary of Prince William, Reeve has been assessed as unable to pay child maintenance because of the ‘modest’ income he receives from his family.In a letter from a solicitor acting on his behalf, the Edinburgh University graduate, whose ancestor fought alongside the Duke of Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo, accuses Georgie of going back on her promise to terminate the unexpected pregnancy and of lying about taking the contraceptive pill.Georgie denies both claims, but the row has even caught the eye of senior Church of England clergy after it emerged that James’s mother, Henrietta, who also wants no contact with her grandson, was appointed a lay canon at Lincoln Cathedral just a month before Henry’s birth.Divorcee Mrs Reeve, 62, became the subject of a church investigation after Georgie’s priest, the Rector at St Luke’s in Chelsea, wrote to the Bishop of Lincoln saying she came under great pressure from the Reeve family — ‘Mrs Reeve in particular’ — to have an abortion.In a written response to that claim, the Bishop of Grantham said that while ‘Miss David came under great pressure’, there was no evidence that Mrs Reeve, who is also Deputy Lieutenant of Lincolnshire, was involved.A morally muddled saga then, and one which raises questions about sex, relationships and responsibility in this modern age of dating.Who, then, should be blamed for this sorry situation? And, above all, what does the future hold for the golden-haired, blue-eyed baby boy at the heart of it?Henry James Frederick David-Reeve, who shares both his parents’ surnames is, somewhat ironically, the spitting image of the handsome father he has never met.          James Reeve accuses Georgie of going back on her promise to terminate the unexpected pregnancy and of lying about taking the contraceptive pill          Divorcee Henrietta Reeve, 62, became the subject of a church investigation after Georgie’s priest, the Rector at St Luke’s in Chelsea, wrote to the Bishop of Lincoln saying she came under great pressure from the Reeve family — ‘Mrs Reeve in particular’ — to have an abortion‘It’s for Henry’s sake that I’m speaking out about this,’ says Georgie, cradling her son.‘He wasn’t planned, but the fact is that we have a beautiful baby boy and he deserves to have the best chance in life. I am struggling to cope financially, and I just want James to accept some responsibility for his son.’James Reeve sees things rather differently. A letter sent to Georgie by his solicitor says: ‘You entered a relationship with him which was meant to be entirely casual, with no commitment at all.’Meanwhile, Georgie has been receiving emotional support from a most unlikely quarter — James’s elder brother, William, who is heir to the family estate. He has not only been to visit his nephew but also became his godfather when Henry was christened in September.He hit the news himself this week after he collapsed in court as he launched a battle with his mother over the future of their family’s 230-year-old country estate.Old Etonian William, 38, says the future of the 18th-century Leadenham estate is at risk due to a bitter family row, not helped by the situation between James and Georgie.Meanwhile, Georgie remains hurt and angry at the way she has been treated. While she doesn’t deny the relationship was casual at first, she argues that she and James began to see each other regularly — at least every week — and their romance became more than just physical.‘We used to take my dog for walks together and go out for long lunches and dinners. Or I cooked for us here. Sometimes we used to get a takeaway and a bottle of wine and just lie in front of the television. He brought flowers. We became close. It started to feel more serious. We opened up to each other about our lives.’And what different lives they are.Georgie, the daughter of a Pakistani-born father and British mother, was raised in a terrace house in South-east London and attended an all-girls’ state school. She studied media at the University of Buckingham, but left before finishing her degree and worked as a VIP nightclub hostess at Chinawhite in Soho.In her early 20s, she began work as a secretary at a barristers’ chambers in central London, moved to Chelsea and joined a ladies’ shooting club in West London.James, meanwhile, is one of four children born to Peter and Henrietta Reeve, and grew up enjoying all the privileges that life in a family with a lineage stretching back to Edward III can offer — including 20-bedroom Grade II-listed Leadenham House on the family’s 3,000-acre estate. He attended Eton and after university, returned to the estate to pursue his love of polo.

The only person who can possibly know if I took it is me, and I know I took it.’Nevertheless, in June 2017 a home test revealed she was pregnant. At first, she says, James took the news calmly. He travelled from Lincolnshire and the pair attended an NHS clinic in North London offering pregnancy counselling and abortion services.She admits that at this stage, she was ready to consider a termination. ‘I was only five weeks pregnant and it seemed the sensible thing to do,’ she explains. But before they had the chance to discuss it, medical events swiftly overtook them.This dramatically impacted her feelings about the pregnancy.First, a scan suggested Georgie was suffering from an ectopic pregnancy — a potentially fatal condition. She was sent to A\u0026ampE at the Royal Free Hospital, Hampstead, where she was monitored until it became clear the pregnancy was not ectopic and she was suffering from a harmless cyst in her fallopian tube.‘It was a very stressful situation because it could have impacted my future fertility,’ she says. ‘James was wonderful, perfect in every way. He cuddled me and reassured me.’When she was discharged three days later, she returned home to find he had cleaned her flat and put fresh flowers in a vase.Soon after, they returned to the pregnancy advice clinic, again planning to speak to a counsellor about the possibility of a termination, but after another scan, Georgie was told she had suffered a ‘missed miscarriage’ — where an embryo dies but is not immediately expelled by the body. Medical advice for women suffering the condition in the first three months of pregnancy is to allow nature to take its course.Given that both she and James believed the pregnancy was over, she says, there was no longer any need to discuss a termination. Instead, they went away for a weekend to help her get over the ordeal, staying at the Victoria Inn hotel in Holkham, Norfolk.‘He was really lovely to me at that time,’ she says.But at a check-up at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in August 2017, Georgie was given the jaw-dropping news that she hadn’t miscarried at all. She was 13 weeks pregnant with a healthy baby.‘It was the last thing I expected,’ she says. ‘I could see a heartbeat. I was overwhelmed that after everything that had happened, here was a perfect little baby.’She phoned James to break the news. ‘He was completely shocked,’ she says. ‘I asked if he wanted to see the scan photos and he said that he didn’t, that it was too much for him to take in. He said he needed to speak to his mother.‘I understood that he was overwhelmed.’She claims she then had a call from Mrs Reeve. ‘During the conversation, she said James wouldn’t stand by me. She said that I should be aware that he wouldn’t be inheriting anything. There was no reasoning with her. She upset me so much that I hung up.’After that, she says, she and James maintained contact by phone but relations between them were ‘not the same as before. He wanted me to have an abortion but after everything that had happened and then seeing the scan, I felt very differently. I felt very pressurised by him and his family’The last time she saw James was at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. Georgie says it became clear he still expected her to terminate the pregnancy.‘He kept coming in and out of the room on his phone and then he just disappeared and didn’t come back. That was the last time I saw him. It was such a brutal way to be left.’When Georgie wrote to James, telling him she had to ‘decide what’s best for our baby’, she received an email from his solicitor telling her: ‘He does not wish to have any contact with you now or in the future. However, he remains willing to support you financially with the previous plan to have a termination. Any financial payment would need to be through me.’Further strongly worded legal letters followed. One sent in October 2017 reads: ‘Frankly, our client feels that he was entrapped by you . . . Our client has only ever wanted to have children in the context of a loving, stable and long-term relationship and clearly that was not the nature of the relationship he had with you. Our client has no intention of having any involvement with your child.’    James Reeve has claimed he is a victim of \u0027entrapment\u0027 who is not paid enough to make child maintenance payments Extraordinarily, a solicitor’s letter was even sent to Georgie’s widowed mother stating: ‘Reports through third parties have led our client to be concerned for Georgie’s mental state.’It continued: ‘He felt that it was necessary to put on record his own position so that you know how best to help her.’ Henry was born on March 5, 2018 and Georgie texted James to say he was welcome to visit at the hospital, but she received no response. Requests to meet via a legal mediation service were also rejected.After she turned to the Government’s Child Maintenance Service, James complied with instructions to pay her £407.71. According to his solicitor, a further review by the CMS showed ‘he lacked a current salary and was only in receipt of a modest income from his family’. The CMS does not consider assets, but the Department for Work and Pensions, which oversees the service, is monitoring the case.And it is clear that Georgie is not going to go away quietly. When the Rector of St Luke’s wrote to the Bishop of Lincoln in August, he asked for an investigation into the ‘pastorally unacceptable situation which has clear safeguarding implications’.Writing back a month later, the Bishop of Grantham said an investigation had concluded ‘this is not a safeguarding matter’.

Miss David claims she was made pregnant by James Reeve - polo-playing Old Etonian son of Lincoln Cathedral\u0027s lay Canon          Miss David met Mr Reeve in 2017 and the pair quickly began dating but she fell pregnant In the letter, copies of which were sent to both Georgie and Mrs Reeve, he added that: ‘Mrs Reeve does not deny the existence of Henry, though she has no relationship with him and does not want one,’ and said discussions had been held with Mrs Reeve ‘about how she might pray for Henry and perhaps in some future time be able to relate to him in some way that honours Mr Reeve and him.’Georgie says she would like the Reeve family to be involved in Henry’s life. For now, the only member of the Reeve family to have met the baby is his uncle William.‘He’s a really sweet chap and I worry about his future because this is absolutely no way to begin life,’ William told the Mail. ‘Everyone needs to focus on putting this behind them.’William’s support for Georgie may have been influenced by a furious row within the Reeve family itself about the future of its estate. Leadenham has been passed down through generations since the 18th century, but was partitioned after Mrs Reeve orced Peter in 2011.If his uncle is successful, the future for baby Henry may yet prove to be rosy.Georgie insists: ‘I never expected — or wanted — James to marry me.’ She adds: ‘I just want him to do the right thing by Henry. What’s happened has happened, and I’m sure James would be amazing at fatherhood if he just gave it a chance.’Mrs Reeve and James both refused to comment."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/24/12/0B1F9F3D000005DC-6423361-image-m-20_1543061389343.jpg","title":"Sick mythical looking Harry Potter creature revealed raccoon","story":"    This unusual hairless creature found in Florida on Friday was revealed to be a severely ill raccoon that passed away on Wednesday          What a raccoon looks like with all of its hair.

Gulp!At least 80 Tory MPs are openly hostile and could vote against the deal. So too could Ulster’s Democratic Unionist Party MPs, who are supposedly in alliance with the Government to provide the Tories with a Commons majority.In other words, the arithmetic looks dire. It seems almost certain that MPs will snub Mrs May, and her Brexit package will crash and burn.What happens then?Anyone who thinks they know is a fool. However, it is possible to set out some of the possible scenarios.First, assuming that Mrs May loses the vote, she could risk all by resigning her government.Banksy paintings worth £13million seized by Belgian police...Black Friday bargain hunters FIGHT for the best deals on the...Share this articleThis would mean the Queen would ask Jeremy Corbyn, as leader of the Opposition, to try to form a government himself. If he failed to command a Commons majority — the most likely outcome — a General Election would have to be held.True, Mrs May has rejected the idea of a third General Election in as many years — undoubtedly a wise move after her miscal-culation of going to country in June last year.Alternatively, Mrs May could simply resign as Tory leader — and hang on forlornly as a lame duck Prime Minister while her party elects a replacement.Contemptuously, hardline Brexiteers claim it doesn’t matter either way whether Mrs May stays or goes. They say that if she loses next month’s Commons vote, then Britain would automatically leave the EU regardless, and without a deal, on March 29 next year.          The Prime Minister is not out of jail yet as she still needs to get the deal through parliamentRemainer MPs disagree. Optimistically, they believe that MPs from all the main parties will come together to prevent a no-deal exit from the EU.Under this scenario, it would mean Downing Street — whether Mrs May is Prime Minister or not — losing control of events.A swaggeringly self-confident Parliament would take over decision-making.It is important to note that more than 70 per cent of MPs are believed to have voted Remain in the EU referendum and that, crucially, the Commons has a fervently pro-EU Speaker in the shape of John Bercow.          Jacob Rees-Mogg has made his thoughts on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plan clear after he handed in a letter of no confidence in the Prime MinisterMake no mistake: Bercow will try to manipulate events in a pro-European direction.Meanwhile, as Westminster descended into chaos, it would be only a matter of time before political uncertainly translated into financial and economic chaos.There would be a huge risk of a recession with the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.It should not be forgotten that while MPs are playing their political games, the livelihoods of the British people are at risk.This sobering thought leads me to believe that Mrs May’s position is much stronger than it looks.Most decent folk think she is doing her best in desperately difficult circumstances. They feel disgust at what they see — rightly or wrongly — as cynical manoeuvring by devious and calculating politicians only interested in furthering their own Westminster careers.That is why Mrs May was surely right this week to appeal over the heads of Parliament to the British people in a series of TV appearances and radio interviews.Thus far, this strategy is working, with polls showing that the PM is much more popular than any rivals for her job.The fact is that Houdini May has survived numerous desperate scrapes.Repeatedly, her enemies and even some colleagues have plotted to destroy her. Ill-informed commentators have forecast her downfall. Yet each time she’s survived.Up until now, I have been one of the few to predict her survival. But now, I can’t confidently forecast that Mrs May and her deal will make it through the next few tempestuous weeks.But, as a betting man, I do still believe she’s favourite to make it.Of course, her EU exit deal isn’t perfect. But it’s the best available. No one has yet come up with a better idea — at any rate not one which would work.Meanwhile, her allies are making it clear to hardcore Brexiteers, on one side, that the alternative to her strategy is Britain remaining in the EU.On the other hand, to Europhiles, they claim the alternative is a no-deal Brexit and all the perils that would entail.This is a clever two-pronged weapon and so far it’s worked.What’s more, Mrs May has successfully employed a tactic of which, quite frankly, I had not considered her capable.She’s split the Brexiteers.There have been Cabinet resignations — by Boris Johnson, David Davis, Dominic Raab and Esther McVey — but their erstwhile Brexiteer colleagues including Andrea Leadsom, Michael Gove and Penny Mordaunt have stayed onboard.          Boris Johnson is one of the most high profile Cabinet ministers to have resigned over BrexitThe repercussions of what happens over the coming weeks are much more significant for Britain than those after the Suez Crisis of 1956, when prime minister Anthony Eden resigned. They are much, much more crucial.At heart, the Suez Crisis was about Britain coming to terms with the loss of empire.Brexit is about how we survive as an independent nation in a hostile world outside a powerful bloc of European countries.The poet Hilaire Belloc warned a century ago in his Cautionary Verses For Children: ‘Always keep a-hold of nurse — For fear of finding something worse!’As Theresa May leads us out of the EU, his advice is more vital than ever.  Tory blunder on our precious voting systemThe Electoral Commission is an independent body whose duty it is to ‘oversee elections and regulate political finance’.In view of this responsibility, it worries me that Tory peer Lord Gilbert has been appointed a board member.In the past, I have highlighted Stephen Gilbert’s controversial role as a Tory party campaign chief at a time when disturbing evidence came to light that the Tories had disregarded electoral law by overspending, during a series of by-elections in 2014 when they feared losing to Ukip. Following a brilliant investigation by Channel 4’s Michael Crick, there were even fears that officials compounded the offence by submitting at the very least misleading election returns to returning officers — a criminal offence punishable by jail.I repeatedly tried to approach Lord Gilbert for an explanation of apparent discrepancies in Tory spending. He never came back to me.

Shopping centres have taken the worst hit, with a drop of 9.1 per cent.            Shoppers in Birmingham browse the deals as a survey finds that almost one in five millennials admit to \u0027ghost buying\u0027 on Black Friday, whereby they visit shops in the city centre to view a product before purchasing it onlineFollowing from the launch of its Black Friday deals , Currys PC World has seen three orders per second, with the Nintendo Switch and Samsung Galaxy Tab A its best-selling items.The firm said it had seen a 623 per cent increase in computing sales on 2017\u0027s figures, and 61 per cent of their online purchases were made via mobile devices.Carphone Warehouse said it received 14 orders per minute on its site, with the Samsung Galaxy S9 and Apple iPhone XR being the most popular items.          Bargain-hungry Brits have ditched the high street (such as Manchester, pictured) for online shopping this morning as Black Friday deals saw customers splurge millions of pounds on the internetJohn Lewis said it received the bulk of its traffic between 6am and 7am, with shoppers keen to get their hands on reduced goods such as the Apple Airpods and the Applewatch series 3. This is while an investigation by consumer group Which? found nine out of 10 Black Friday deals they investigated could be purchased for the same, or a cheaper price, at different times of the year.Committed bargain hunters flocked to the technology aisle of Tesco on Friday morning  to snap up Xboxes - but had to battle because only six were left.          Crowds finally begin to pack out the Bullring shopping centre in Birmingham this afternoon, following a slow start to proceedings as many shoppers decided to go online to find a dealShoppers queued up at 5am outside the store in Kingston Park, Newcastle, to get the best Black Friday deals.Other offers throughout the store did not receive the same frenzied treatment and aisles filled with deals on items such as luggage were left largely empty.Bargain hunters seemed to be able to browse and place items such as televisions in their trolleys with relative ease - a different scene from previous Black Fridays which have seen shoppers come to blows.          Shoppers (such as those pictured on Oxford Street, London) will splurge somewhere in the region of £2.5billion today, on what is the biggest day of the year for most retailersOne onlooker said: \u0027Almost all of the people bypassed the flagged up deals and headed straight for the Xbox section. There was some frantic grabbing for the Xbox deals.\u0027Overall though, everyone was quite polite, there was no scrapping and people were milling around looking at the other offers.\u0027Some of the best deals had already sold out before much of the UK had even woken up this morning, with retailers starting their offers overnight.       \u0027To bag a bargain, do your research and don\u0027t get carried away by the hype when shopping in the upcoming sales.\u0027Early indications suggested that Black Friday spending would dip for the first time this year since its arrival in the UK.Consumers will spend £2.4billion on deals in stores and online, down from last year\u0027s £2.6billion, according to the predictions from the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) and VoucherCodes.co.uk.          Shoppers are taking advantage of the annual Black Friday sales early this morning, with this couple pictured walking out of the Tesco Extra store in Gorton, ManchesterAnalyst Springboard has also said footfall and spending activity over this year\u0027s Black Friday period is likely to be affected by economic pressures such as high debt levels and significant living costs, compounded by the event taking place a week earlier this year - before many consumers are paid for the month.According to KPMG\u0027s study, the promotional period is favoured by younger consumers, with 75 per cent of shoppers aged 18 to 24 saying they will be taking advantage of deals compared to 36 per cent of 45 to 54 year olds, and just 24 per cent of over 55s.Mr Martin added: \u0027Many shoppers are likely to recall how the slashed pricing in store resulted in stampedes, which is just not what mature consumers seek out.          Thousands braved the near-freezing conditions overnight to queue outside stores up and down the country, including Tesco in Newcastle, to beat other shoppers to the biggest discounts\u0027Since Black Friday was adopted by Britons back in 2013, retailers have increasingly moved offers online, and that coincidentally is where a higher proportion of younger consumers can be found.\u0027Meanwhile, an investigation by consumer group Which? found nine out of 10 Black Friday deals they investigated could be purchased for the same, or a cheaper price, at different times of the year. Cyber security chiefs at GCHQ have also advised shoppers to be wary of risks and to take precautions when buying online, such as using the guest checkout and having a separate \u0027super-protected\u0027 password for your email account.

Tributes have now poured in for the director (pictured on the set of Cold Heaven in 1992), who worked on films including The Man Who Fell to Earth, Walkabout, Don\u0027t Look Now, and The WitchesThe film was delayed for two years, but was eventually released in 1970, by which time Mr Roeg was working on his first solo direction - Walkabout.His biggest success came with Don\u0027t Look Now in 1973, which achieved notoriety with a controversial sex scene between stars Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland.Its intimacy not only caused problems with censors, but sparked rumours Sutherland and Christie had actually been having sex.But the supernatural tale based on a Daphne du Maurier short story is now widely recognised as a key work of horror cinema, with film director Danny Boyle citing Roeg as a key influence to his own work.          Mr Roeg also directed the 1990 film The Witches, which starred Jasen Fisher and Anjelica HustonThe late David Bowie starred in Roeg\u0027s 1976 cult classic The Man Who Fell To Earth as an alien who crashes on Earth seeking a way to save his home planet from extinction.It was Bowie\u0027s first major film role and is one of Roeg\u0027s most celebrated works.His 1980 psychological thriller Bad Timing - starring Art Garfunkel, Harvey Keitel and Roeg\u0027s second wife Theresa Russell - caused considerable controversy, with an executive of its own British distributor The Rank Organisation famously branding it \u0027a sick film made by sick people for sick people.\u0027Mr Roeg directed the 1990 screen adaptation of Roald Dahl\u0027s The Witches, working with Muppet-maestro Jim Henson.

When Scrooge repents in A Christmas Carol, it is an outsize, prizewinning turkey that he sends over to Bob Cratchit’s home as a generous symbol of atonement.But the author’s love of the seasonal bird was not confined to his fiction: it was central to his idea of family festivity in the real world, too. Previously unseen domestic notes, tableware and household letters reveal that Dickens lavished time and attention on the “astonishing capabilities” of his turkeys, planning lengthy roasting times and boasting of how another had produced several meals.A new exhibition, Food Glorious Food: Dinner with Dickens, which opens on 28 November at the museum in Dickens’ former London house, will revel in the Victorian writer’s love of food and entertaining. “People will be struck, I think, by how much genuine enthusiasm Dickens had for hospitality. And a lot of the correspondence at Christmas time concerned the turkey,” said the Doughty Street museum’s curator, Louisa Price, who has put together the exhibition with Pen Vogler, author of Dinner with Dickens.One of the more revealing of Dickens’s private letters on show is an invitation written to his old friend Thomas Beard in December 1836, in which he describes how a late night out has dampened his anticipation of Christmas fun, but not of the turkey. It includes an emphasis on allowing the bird enough time in the oven – still a recognisable problem today.He writes: “My Dear Beard. We propose giving the Turkey until 4 tomorrow, in order that he may be well done. Be punctual and don’t place too much reliance on our excellent friend Warburton. I arrived home at one o’clock this morning dead drunk, and was put to bed by my loving missis. We are just going to Chapman’s sisters’ quadrille party, for which you may imagine I feel remarkably disposed.”Punctuality is another big theme in the famous author’s dinner invitations. Meals were generally served in the late afternoon or early evening and, with the standardisation of public clocks prompted by the introduction of railway timetables, the significance of being on time acquired a modern urgency.“Although Dickens satirises dinner parties in several of his novels, he really needed these social events to fuel his imagination,” said Price. “His appreciation of good food comes from his childhood experience of hunger. At 12 years old, he had to look after himself in London, working during the day in a blacking factory. He often uses food in the novels to show the differences between the classes.”Several of the “thank-you” notes in the exhibition show how often Dickens was given a turkey as a Christmas present. Gifts of luxury meat, fruit or preserves were common among the upper and middle classes.Writing to thank his publishers for such a gift on 2 January 1840, Dickens’s account of how many meals the bird contributed to is also familiar today: “My Dear Sirs. I determined not to thank you for the Turkey until it was quite gone, in order that you might have a becoming idea of its astonishing capabilities. The last remnant of that blessed bird made its appearance at breakfast yesterday – I repeat it, yesterday – the other portions having furnished forth seven grills, one boil, and a cold lunch or two.”In other letters, not in the museum’s collection, Dickens is known to have thanked Angela Burdett Coutts for a turkey he compares jokingly to a small baby. Occasionally, he even procured one for himself, but, as Price points out, this did not always run smoothly. “One year Dickens ordered a bird to be sent into London by train, but there was a fire in the railway carriage and the bird was burnt and pieces of the barbecued meat were handed out near the scene of the fire,” she said. “Before Dickens heard about the incident, he wrote an angry note in capital letters simply saying: ‘WHERE IS MY TURKEY?’”The rival, smaller Christmas bird, the goose, was also a favourite at the time, appearing in A Christmas Carol when the ghost of Christmas present takes Scrooge to see the impoverished Cratchits eking out a small meal so that with “apple-sauce and mashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family”.Geese had been established as Christmas fare since the time of Elizabeth I, and poorer families saved for them by joining a goose club, like the one featured in the Sherlock Holmes story The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle. The Cratchits’ goose would have been cooked at a baker’s, since few working-class households had ovens.But turkey also had a long association with Christmas. Introduced to Europe in the 16th century, the birds were reared outside the capital in Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridge and walked in to town over weeks, their feet bound in rags or coated with tar. This is why Dickens jokes the bird Scrooge bought for the Cratchits “never could have stood upon his legs”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d97f60e6741792f1e12430b6a27eb8e7c046bb89/0_21_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7fc8313ddfc97bb0746b919c13b5d63","title":"jo brand made in benenden","story":"Behind the cricket green, church and vicarage, the comedian recalls the darker side of the chocolate box Kent villageAfter moving out of London at the age of four I spent most of my childhood in a village called Benenden in Kent, notable because of its private girls’ school, which Princess Anne attended. We plebs were allowed up there in the summer holidays to use the pool in the grounds and seeing the lacrosse pitches always put me in mind of Malory Towers by Enid Blyton, which I loved at the age of eight before I became a class warrior.Benenden was an archetypal village with a green on which cricket was played and on its border lay the church, village school, church hall, vicarage and village shop. My best friend’s dad was the local vicar and I became a bellringer.However, under the facade of the cliched chocolate box scene, there was rural poverty and the dawning realisation that not all adults were good people. The headmaster of the primary school was terrifying and on occasions violent and his wife controlled classes with bitter, humiliating sarcasm. I was pretty well behaved but that didn’t stop her occasionally singling me out as a focus for comic mortification. I have always admired writers such as William Trevor who uncover the dark undercurrents running through areas of our seemingly respectable society.I like to think my writing style is spare and hilarious, but I’m sure it isn’t a lot of the time. I try to have two books on the go at once, a thriller that washes my brain with a low level of gore and a non-fiction makes-your-brain-hurt sort of book. I think that was because my mum and dad very much controlled my reading material. I also love poetry, from AE Housman’s A Shropshire Lad to contemporary funny female poets such as Wendy Cope and Hollie McNish.I am torn between populist writing and spare prose using beautiful words. I realise I have ended up writing in the former style that’s the comic in me wanting to connect with people of similar experience and humour, rather than join the small sanctified gang of respected, quasi-academic novelists. Besides, I have never deluded myself that I could even get anywhere near writing in a beautiful style!Since childhood I have been really cheered by nature, so geese flying overhead honking, or a wood full of bluebells make me happy. One of my favourite authors is Susan Hill whose descriptions of countryside life, particularly in In the Springtime of the Year, are so evocative of my childhood. I spent hours playing in the woods with my brothers, fighting, falling in streams, climbing trees, poking wasps nests – most of it full of humour, teasing and baiting each other, and I suppose it was the birth of a comedy sensibility.• Born Lippy: How to Do Female by Jo Brand (John Murray Publishers, £20).

Last week the acclaimed novelist and, to many, human embodiment of white male privilege published his 10 rules for aspiring novelists and, as tends to happen any time Franzen dares to open his mouth, he was thanked for his trouble with derision.Small sidenote here, but I really don’t get the Franzen loathing. Sure, he could lighten up on the constant talk about birdwatching, but otherwise the things Franzen is hated for are either not really hateworthy or not actually his fault. This all began in ye olden times of 2001 with the famous, nay, legendary saga of Oprah Winfrey choosing Franzen’s novel, The Corrections, for her book club and him saying he’d rather not, thanks. Winfrey’s book choices were often, he said, not incorrectly, “schmaltzy”. It was the snub heard around the world and Franzen was for ever cast as an elitist snob, his every pronouncement since (he hates social media! He likes nature!) taken as further evidence of his hatefulness, even though surely most people would love to live a nice, Twitter-free, nature-based life in California, as Franzen does.A more credible argument against him, made by the novelist Jodi Picoult and others, is that he gets the kind of critical adulation denied to female writers, but I’m not really sure what Franzen is supposed to do about that. Increasingly, it feels like Franzen is a scapegoat for white guilt, a white liberal even other white liberals can hate, so they feel less bad about themselves. He would have had to have been invented if he didn’t exist. Fortunately, he does exist, but no one seems very grateful for it.So, predictably, people hated Franzen’s rules for writing, which mixed the benignly helpful (avoid the internet and fancy verbs) with the unexpectedly koan-esque (“You have to love before you can be relentless.”) Interestingly, most of the hatred came from other writers, such as novelist Tessa Dare, who tweeted, “In which Jonathan Franzen reveals himself to be that guy who mentions Ayn Rand in his Tinder profile.” But as writing rules go, I’ve read a lot worse, and so I think we can conclude that the anger here isn’t really about the rules, but about Franzen, and even that isn’t really about Franzen, either.I read writers’ writing tips all the time, not because I think they’ll magically make me into as good a writer as, say, Tolstoy (“The best thoughts most often come in the morning after waking while still in bed”) or Hemingway (“Always stop while you are going good and don’t worry about it until you start to write the next day”), but because I’m nosy and these tips invariably say a lot more about the author than they do about writing (Tolstoy knew the value of staying in bed Hemingway was a machismo-riddled bolter who left writing sessions as casually as he left wives).The popularity of writing tips suggests a lot of people see fiction as a hobby anyone could knock off if they just knew the right tricks, as opposed to a job and a skill, and one requiring a serious amount of unique talent (although if Franzen said this, I honestly think he’d be pushed out into the Pacific Ocean on an ice floe).Teachers and plumbers aren’t asked for their top 10 tips on how to do their job. Even acting – the only profession seen as more self-indulgent than writing – doesn’t sell this fallacy no one’s asking Meryl Streep for her tips on how to play a bereaved mother, or Robert De Niro for his top 10 techniques for playing a mafia boss. The idea that any of us could write as well as Franzen, Goldman, or whoever, by literally writing like them is as absurd as suggesting that buying the same handbag as Kate Moss will make you look like the supermodel.But given that everyone seems to be giving writing tips these days, here are mine, which precisely no one asked for:2. Wonder why so many people want tips on how to do something that brings you only self-loathing.4.

Now she’s paid three times more than CEO of AppleIf Denise Coates’s record-breaking £265m pay packet was stacked up in new £50 notes it would form a tower almost twice as high as the Shard skyscraper in London.The enormous pay package, paid to the founder and chief executive of Bet365, the online gambling business based in Stoke-on-Trent, was more than three times greater than Tim Cook earned (£80m) running Apple, the most valuable company in the world. It was 25 times more than Bob Dudley received for running BP and 55 times more than the £4.9m that Dave Lewis, the chief executive of Tesco, has to rub along on.For Coates, the best paid female executive in the world, it was not even a one-off. A year earlier, she handed herself £217m from the profits of what remains a private family owned business, albeit one worth billions.All the numbers associated with Bet365 are big: gamblers wagered £52.5bn with the company last year, a sum that outstrips the annual economic output of Croatia and Uruguay.As eye-catching as Bet365’s financial performance is, it garnered far less attention than the £220m salary and £45m in idends pocketed by Coates, who owns more than half the company. Vince Cable, the former business minister and Liberal Democrat leader, called Coates’s pay package “irresponsible and excessive”, while the High Pay Centre said it was “obscene”.If Bet365 were listed on the stock exchange, such payouts would probably fall at the first hurdle of shareholder distaste, as seen in the revolt against the £100m bonus deal handed to the chief executive of the housebuilder Persimmon. Jeff Fairburn eventually offered to hand back £25m and make a donation to charity – but the embarrassment heaped on the company led to his departure this month.Bet365 is the personal fiefdom of the Coates family, a business dynasty worth £5.8bn, more than Sir Richard Branson’s empire. The story of how they built their empire from a Portakabin in Stoke-on-Trent is the stuff of industry legend.Coates’s father, Peter, the 80-year-old son of a miner, became a successful local businessman and owned a string of betting shops. But it was Coates, an econometrics graduate who, at around the turn of the millennium, became aware of the jackpot opportunity that lay online.She bought the Bet365 domain name from eBay for $25,000 and borrowed against the bricks-and-mortar stores to develop sports-betting technology that left slow-moving rivals in the dust.When the likes of Ladbrokes and William Hill were buying the systems they needed from third parties, Bet365 already had them and was deploying them at great speed.Under Coates’s stewardship, the firm married its tech advantage with shrewd marketing – the actor Ray Winstone fronts their TV campaigns tied to live sports and virtually orders viewers to make a wager: “Bet in play – now!” he growls.But Bet365 is not just about taking a punt on the Premier League from the comfort of a sofa. Fancy a bet on the correct score in the AS Oued Ellil match against AS Marsa in Tunisia’s League 2? Or a wager on Irish club hurling, Austrian cross-country skiing, Australian political elections, Italy’s X Factor, on Vegas games or at a live online casino? Bet365 claims to have 35 million customers, which would make it the world’s biggest online gambling business.Now the company looks poised to break into the US, via a $50m (£39m) deal with a New York casino operator designed to take advantage of the huge growth potential in the country since the supreme court repealed a decades-old ban on sports betting.Bet365 is fast becoming Stoke’s most successful export. Its tech-based success story looms large in a city once dominated by its potteries, such as Wedgwood, Spode and Royal Doulton.It owns the Stoke City Football Club, while many of its 4,000-member workforce are based at its sprawling headquarters near Hanley, Stoke’s de facto city centre.Bet365 does not seem keen on media scrutiny and rarely answers inquiries, choosing to disclose only what it must in regulated filings with Companies House.It has not, for instance, addressed any criticism of Coates’s pay deal, which some have found jarring in a week when new figures showed an alarming rise in the number of child problem gamblers.Charles and Liz Ritchie, who founded the Gambling With Lives charity after their son, Jack, killed himself after a gambling addiction, said they found Coates’s payout “particularly upsetting” in the circumstances.While Coates gives much of her cash to good causes, such as the Douglas Macmillan Hospice and Alzheimer’s Research UK, her foundation’s page on the Charity Commission website offers no indication of whether any of it goes to problem gambling treatment.Her largesse is also partly funded by a relatively low UK corporation tax rate, and the company’s £78m tax contribution last year was rather less than one might expect, thanks in part to subsidiaries in jurisdictions such as Gibraltar, a haven for gambling firms.Bet365 has also been coy about where its customers are based. A  investigation in 2014 found that punters in China – where betting is banned in all but a few tightly controlled arenas – were jailed after apparently placing bets on the Bet365 website.The company said it was not breaking any laws but would not confirm whether or not it accepted stakes.In this week’s accounts Bet365 said disclosing any more about its regional income “would be severely prejudicial to the interests of the group”. A recruitment page reveals the company is looking for “Chinese language customer account advisors”, though it could be targeting Chinese speakers in the UK or elsewhere.Unless Bet365 volunteers more information, it will remain one of Britain’s most opaque companies – but also one of its most successful."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b06d2c510048cf9e536d1d10244d7844989747fe/4_37_2830_1697/master/2830.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb3b256678ec7bc85a4670fec6763f0b","title":"taylor swift blow fellow artists streaming revenues soar universal spotify","story":"Taylor Swift further burnished her image as the saviour of underpaid artists last week when Universal Music Group (UMG) confirmed that as part of her new record deal, it would share proceeds from the eventual sale of its $1bn stake in Spotify with its musicians.Saint Taylor, as one industry observer wryly calls the 28-year-old, was quick to tell her 113 million Instagram followers that the promised windfall for fellow artists was her central demand in negotiations.Swift’s victory appears to relate to the terms of the distribution of the proceeds, because UMG had already announced an intention to share out the Spotify money back in March – two years after rivals Sony and Warner had made similar moves. Swift’s social media post makes a vague reference to Universal’s payout being on “much better terms” than that offered by rivals. But with Universal’s French parent company, Vivendi, readying a sale of up to half of the $30bn UMG, a repetition of the pledge, as part of a deal for one of the world’s biggest artists, is likely to impress potential investors.And the deal allows the business-savvy Swift to leverage leaving the firm that has been her musical home since she was 14 – Nashville-based Big Machine Records – to extract lucrative terms from the contest to sign her up.Spotify aside, the deal strikes another blow for artist power – albeit just for Swift. She has clawed back the rights to own and exploit the master recordings of any music she makes from now on. If she keeps churning out the hits, the earnings potential from that is huge: Swift’s previous six albums have sold 40 million copies worldwide.“It is a rare deal, uncommon for a really big artist at the peak of their career to be able to take control,” says Mark Mulligan, analyst at MIDiA Research, adding that Swift was “setting a precedent for other major-label artists at the peak of their career”. As he points out, “the record label would always prefer to own those rights.”The rise of streaming via Spotify, Apple and Amazon has put a music industry once racked by plummeting CD sales back in rude health. That transformation has been seized on by Swift, who has led the fight for artists to get a better share of revenues in the age of the digital giants.Last year, she finally returned to Spotify, ending a three-year boycott over the tiny royalties per song played that artists receive. She has also previously attacked the Apple Music streaming service for not paying artists during users’ free three-month trial period, provoking the company to change its policy.However, Mulligan says that while the streaming numbers look huge, the economic benefits for artists are harder to come by. Gross royalty rates are only about a penny, or cent, per stream and all sorts of cuts then come out for record labels, rights organisations and the like before an artist gets anything.It can take more than a million streams of a song to earn as little as £2,000. And that’s for the very few signed artists who have “recouped” – paid back the advances from labels to fund their careers. “Most artists are like indentured labour,” says Mulligan.For independent or unsigned artists, it is even tougher to make money from streaming. “For independent artists, streaming provides the lowest form of income we receive,” says Serkan Dervis, who manages independent artists in London. “What streaming means for some of my acts is that there is a PR element to it, but you’d still be lucky to even get on a playlist. But at least it can give unknown acts at least a little form of exposure. But the main money maker is still live performances.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b39a5ae462ce5084edecc63658ff743d68da14e5/0_342_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1f03a303ce0600fb77a32248a384089","title":"a glimpse of daily life in pyongyang in pictures","story":"North Korea’s capital is a carefully managed showcase for its dictatorship.

Arlene Foster had been able to boost her personal authority (which had been damaged in the 2017 Northern Ireland assembly election when, for the first time, unionists lost their overall majority) by emphasising the “real power” that accompanied the “hugely significant” deal between the Democratic Unionist party and Conservatives. She earned thunderous applause at her party conference when she boasted, “The union is secure.”Today, that confidence and supply agreement – in which the DUP props up Theresa May’s minority government – is, at best, wobbly and the DUP is accusing May of a “gross betrayal” that threatens to “undermine our precious union”. Tory leadership hopeful Boris Johnson will provide high-profile knockabout at this year’s conference for a grassroots audience that needs cheering up, but the DUP leadership would have preferred a prime minister who had faced down the European Union and stood shoulder to shoulder with Foster.It has been a bad year for the DUP. Vociferous objections from some of their key players to the prospect of an Irish Language Act killed off rising hopes of a new power-sharing deal with Sinn Féin in February, meaning that Northern Ireland is just about to reach 700 days without an assembly. A long-running public inquiry into how a DUP-run department made one monumental and expensive blunder after another has exposed a party at war with itself and operating almost entirely by its own rules. And now May, their supposed ace in the hole, has stared them down with a withdrawal agreement that includes options she knew would have been unacceptable to the DUP. All in all, not the easiest background for an annual conference.The DUP’s primary difficulty with the withdrawal agreement is that it leaves open the possibility that Northern Ireland’s relationship with the EU could, after December 2020, be different to the relationship between the EU and Great Britain. And it’s that difference which raises difficulties for the DUP – and unionism generally – about the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. May argues that there is no threat to the integrity of the union, because the longstanding constitutional guarantee (that Northern Ireland remains in the UK until a referendum in the region decides otherwise) remains in place. But the DUP counters that claim with the argument that treating Northern Ireland so differently in such a specific and momentous circumstance would undermine the union and, consequently, embolden those – on both sides of the border – who want a referendum on Irish unity.The DUP is in a very difficult position. Yes, it could withdraw from the confidence and supply agreement, but that means wandering on to pyrrhic victory territory. There is no guarantee that pulling out would kill off the withdrawal agreement or topple May or that any replacement for her would come up with something better for Northern Ireland.Ironically, the DUP and Theresa May are in similar positions when it comes to power. I don’t think she ever expected to be prime minister: but now that she is, she will hold on for as long as possible. The DUP never expected to sign a confidence and supply deal that put them at the heart of government: but now that they have, they will keep it going for as long as they can.Ending that deal would be a very public admission that the party had been wrong to put so much faith in the Conservatives and it would also raise awkward questions about the relationship between Ulster unionism and UK national interests. The DUP likes the profile and clout it now has (which has also been useful when it comes to government Northern Ireland policy) and it won’t be keen on a crash and burn response to the present problem.So, is there wriggle room? The DUP needs clarity and reassurance on what happens post-2020. Its position since June 2016 has been consistent: as long as the final Brexit deal ensures that the entire UK is treated the same way, it can live with it. It may not like it, but at least there would be no existential threat to the union. The DUP cannot shift without that certainty, but it is in its interests to hang on for as long as it can. When it comes to negotiations it is a canny operator, as anyone who has dealt with it knows.The final decision, of course, rests with the prime minister. Forcing Northern Ireland to be treated differently would lead to serious problems and destabilise the peace process maybe even end it. It would also raise questions in Scotland: “If Northern Ireland can have special arrangements, then why not us?” Crucially, though, May probably does not want to go down in history as the prime minister who began the unravelling of the United Kingdom. The DUP and Theresa May still have mutual interests and goals – at this point. • Alex Kane is a former director of communications for the Ulster Unionist party"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1c8ddf8e71962970354e8f10822cfec583a3198/0_13_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0618a1f1ec0e2c97045a3281dd76e3ac","title":"easter island statue britain museum","story":"If the spiritual importance of the artefact matters to its owners, why deny them? This is a political issue, not an aesthetic oneBe prepared. The great museums of Europe are about to see an invasion of former colonies demanding the return of their stuff. This week the governor of Easter Island, Tarita Alarcón Rapu, tearfully pleaded with the British Museum to have back her ancestor, immortally embodied in a statue in its possession. “You have our soul,” she said. Her audience must have cringed.For Rapu’s people the statue, one of many, carries with it the spirit of her island. For Britain it is just a statue, stolen by a British frigate as a bauble for Queen Victoria in 1868. But then Britons can be equally dotty about the Stone of Scone and the crown jewels.The figure joins a lengthening list of items now in contention. Egypt wants back the Rosetta Stone. Nigeria wants the Benin Bronzes. Ethiopia wants the Maqdala crown, and a sacred lock of its emperor’s hair. Various places on the Indian subcontinent claim the Koh-i-Noor diamond, embedded in a UK’s royal crown. There is also the matter of the Parthenon Marbles, which never goes away. This is the thin end of a sizeable wedge.Most rows over “cultural appropriation” come from the wilder shores of identity lunacy. This appropriation is different. The fact that British and other museums are so frantic to hold on to their objects shows the power such things exert over nation states. To the British Museum, the Parthenon Marbles are like fragments of the true cross.The first response to demands for restitution is simple. Concede to them. We have tons of other stuff in basements and attics. To be fair, this is starting to happen. France’s President Emmanuel Macron is legislating to “return Africa’s heritage to Africa”. The British Museum itself returns objects under permanent loan. The Benin bronzes are going to Nigeria and it has indicated a readiness to talk with Easter Island.A deeper worry is what restitution will mean to the purpose of world museums. They really are the heirs to empire. Their apologists incant the curatorial shtick, that they are global custodians, a scholarly resource, a place that gives context to art. If context really matters, why not put the Lewis Chessmen or the Lindisfarne Gospels or the Parthenon Marbles back where they were meant to be enjoyed? The only real argument museums have, if pressed, is that possession is nine-tenths of the law.The reality is that in the age of mass travel and digital reproduction, the convenience of a tiny group of scholars, or even a larger group of tourists, cannot seriously override the looming politics of national self-confidence. A museum, as French art historian André Malraux noted, has always been an artificial concept, a wrenching of objects not into context but out of it. The tossing together of disparate artefacts – most of them never displayed – is like burying them in a mausoleum. It suggests the museum is not about art or beauty but about acquisition, ownership and status.Next week, the most exhilarating room in any London museum is to reopen, the cast court at the Victoria and Albert. Everything in it is fake – majestic, glorious fake – from Trajan’s Column to Michelangelo’s David, from Ghiberti’s Gates of Paradise to the Nymph of Fontainebleau. It is a hugely enjoyable satire on what modern museology has become.What we are not told is that the V\u0026ampA’s copies survived only because its staff, during the “battle of the casts” in the 1920s, did not imitate museums across Britain and America in smashing all replicas as “unauthentic”. This was demanded by the trustees in deference to rich donors, who did not want their gifts appearing near “fakes”. Across America, thousands of perfect replicas of Europe’s greatest art works were simply removed and hammered to dust, leaving galleries empty. Americans were told to revere not what they could see, but what it was worth.Museum objects can now be immaculately reproduced, in photography, film, hologram and cast. The ruins of Palmyra and Nineveh can be restored with 3D printing and carving, even using the original stone and sand. It may not be the same as the original, any more than gothic Chartres or medieval Bodiam are “the same”. The ancient obelisk that forms the focus of the British Library’s current Anglo-Saxon exhibition is made of polystyrene. I doubt if it worries anyone, any more than Venetian tourists dislike the horses of San Marco for being copies. Of course material antiquity can affect the aura of a work, influencing its rarity and thus its price, but not necessarily its intrinsic beauty.The word most beloved of museums is authenticity. I accept that the British Museum’s ice-age exhibition in 2013 was moving because we were looking at objects carved 12 millennia ago. But that was exceptional. I do not despise a Nash terrace or a Rodin statue because it is a replica of an original. The glory of a Robert Adam ceiling lies in its design, not its execution. Enjoyment lies in the genius of what we see, not the age of its materials.There is no reason why the Easter Island statue cannot be perfectly reproduced. If its spiritual content matters so much to the Easter Islanders, why on earth deny them the original? The issue is one of politics, not aesthetics. I fear that unlike art, politics never ages."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ba6450d2db3b65e13c77a791f3204405e94e8ed/0_214_3204_1922/master/3204.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6268b33f927060453e896752e06d020","title":"brazil records worst annual deforestation for a decade","story":"Nearly 8,000sq kms lost in the year to July amid alarm new president Jair Bolsonaro will make situation worseThe news was met by dismay from environmentalists who warned deforestation was likely to become more acute when Bolsonaro becomes president on 1 January.“It is a lot of destroyed forest,” said Marcio Astrini, Greenpeace Brasil’s public policy coordinator. “The situation is very worrying… what is bad will get worse.”The environment ministry said the increase came despite an increase in its budget and in operations carried out by its environment agency Ibama.“We need to increase the mobilisation at all levels of government, of society, and of the productive sector to combat illicit environmental activities,” environment minister Edson Duarte said in a statement.But the government appears to be heading in the other direction.After falling for several years, deforestation began rising again in 2013, the year after leftist president Dilma Rousseff approved a new forest code which gave an amnesty to those deforesting on small properties. Deforestation has risen in four of the six years since then, including in 2016, the year Rousseff was impeached and replaced by her former vice-president Michel Temer.Temer has made further concessions to powerful agribusiness interests in return for support from its congressional representatives – including approving a measure that legalised land that had been squatted in the Amazon, a common deforestation driver. Last year Temer backed down on measures to reduce protection to a national forest called Jamanxim and a protected area called Renca after protests from environmentalists, supermodel Gisele Bündchen and even singer Alicia Keys at the Rock in Rio music festival.Moves like these signalled the Brazilian congress was no longer concerned about deforestation, said Astrini, encouraging deforestation.“We feel in our field work that these deforestation gangs are very confident they will get amnesty or that they are covered,” he said. As more and more of the Amazon is cut down, the world’s greatest forest is now getting close to the “tipping point” – after which experts fear it could disappear.It also expects deforestation to worsen once Jair Bolsonaro’s new government begins. He has frequently attacked what he calls the “fines industry” of agencies such as Ibama, and wants to allow mining in protected indigenous reserves – some of the Amazon’s least-destroyed forests – and even considered making the environment ministry part of the agriculture ministry.Bolsonaro has enjoyed support from agribusiness and his minister of agriculture will be headed up by Tereza Cristina, head of its Congress lobby.His foreign minister, Ernesto Araújo, has argued that global warming is a Marxist plot. On Friday, his vice-president elect, General Hamilton Mourão, while admitting global warming did exist, told the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper: “Environmentalism is used as an instrument of domination by big economies.”Bolsonaro only backed down on plans to withdraw Brazil from the Paris climate deal because agricultural producers argued the move risked boycotts from European consumers, local media reported.“If the problem is in politics and politicians and their power of decision, they need to be pressured,” Astrini said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d876cf0adf5d63586d948b5d234aa8f6bb3b87e/0_428_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52fb16c1347d81fddb66f6d9bb40e02c","title":"london schools tackle pollution with face masks and air purifiers","story":"Schools introduce walk-to-school initiatives and stock up on asthma medicineSchools across the UK are taking ever more drastic steps in an effort to mitigate the effects of air pollution on their pupils’ health.Amid growing concern about the long-term implications of toxic air on young people’s development, the  has found one London school is raising money for face masks for its pupils, while a growing number are installing air purifiers in classrooms and thousands more are trying to deter parents from using their cars on the school run.The measures follow a flurry of new studies that show the extent of the damage being done to young people’s health from respiratory problems such as asthma.Dr Ian Mudway, air pollution expert at Kings College London, said there was an urgent need to improve air quality, especially in congested cities, to protect the wellbeing of future generations.“As the evidence base grows demonstrating that air pollution impacts on the health of children born and growing up in our cities, so the justification for decisive action increases,” he said.Rotherhithe primary school in south-east London has launched a fundraising campaign to address air pollution which includes buying face masks for pupils.The campaign was launched by Kellie Ansell, the deputy head, who has noticed how poor air quality is affecting the children.“We have a cupboard full of children’s asthma medicines,” she said. has found that at least 10 other schools have installed – or are planning to install – air purifiers and thousands more are taking measures to tackle pollution.Some are installing green walls while others are closing roads and setting up “park and stride” schemes or walk-to-school initiatives.Kathryn Shaw from charity Living Streets, which aims to encourage walking and cycling, said schools were on the frontline in fight against pollution.But she said face masks were not the answer. “Children resorting to wearing air pollution masks is a sign that when it comes to cleaning up our air, we are falling woefully short,” she said. “Resigning ourselves to these adaptations rather than tackling the source of air pollution solves very little and is a great disservice to future generations.”Dr Ben Barratt from King’s College London agreed that masks were not the answer.He said that they could filter out some particulate pollution if they were “good quality” and very well fitted, but added: “If they don’t fit properly, they’re useless, and most do not filter out harmful gases such as nitrogen dioxide.”“It is not a solution or even a good sticking plaster,” Barratt said. “Increasing the physical activity of kids is extremely important and anything that hinders that may do more harm than good … we must rapidly and effectively remove the source of air pollution, not punish those who are not responsible for creating it.”Ansell said her school was also looking at other ways of tackling pollution, but added that she believes the masks were necessary to give pupils immediate access to clean air as measures to tackle pollution would not be effective immediately.“We are hoping to do more, such as closing off the street to traffic at the beginning and end of the school day and to plant more greenery in the playground, but pupils still have to walk home along busy roads.“The masks will be a real physical and visible response to air pollution. As well as giving children clean air to breathe, they will also raise awareness about the issue of air pollution, which we are studying as part of the curriculum.”Earlier this year the  revealed how children were being forced to breathe dangerous levels of toxic air as they make their way to and from school – and even once they are inside their classrooms.One school in London found it had levels of dangerous particulate pollution exceeding World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines in every classroom – and two were more than three times over the limit.Now one company that makes air purifiers, Blueair of Sweden, says it has tested air quality at 10 schools in London and found that in each it was worse inside the classroom than in the playground or the street – sometimes by a staggering amount.Sara Alsen from Blueair said: “The scale of the problem of air pollution in London schools is acute … some classrooms have pollution levels 20-40 times the levels recommended by WHO.”She said this was because Victorian schools buildings often lack proper ventilation, meaning the harmful airborne particles get trapped inside classrooms.“It is clear that awareness about indoor air pollution is increasing in the UK. Every day we get calls from parents worrying about the health of their children and we are currently working with some 10 London schools,” she said.A stylish mask that claims to protects against “all PMs” – the fine particles from air pollution that damage health – by a triple-layer filter system. It comes in styles that all relate to famous and fictional Brits: the Austen comes in a patchwork pattern and the Sherlock is adorned with cutesy pipes and moustaches. If you’re worried about young family members breathing in fumes, these masks will be by far the easiest to get them to wear. cambridgemaskThese are the masks you see Beijing residents wearing on the street and raise the question: how much air pollution does a surgeon really have to combat in a sterilised hospital? The main issue is if they don’t fit well around the face, then they offer almost zero protection from pollution. If they do fit well, then they are difficult to breathe through. Available on AmazonRespro produces a series of masks you have to be either supremely confident or very concerned to wear. Despite its ugliness, the Ultralight mask was by far and away the most comfortable. There is a PM2.5 filter for heavily polluted areas and, after a quick cycle to work (easy to breathe), there was indeed a thin film of grey dirt on the filter. It comes with a heavy-duty nose clip, and is made from a technical fabric “that lets the skin breathe”. Even after wearing it for a cycle, it doesn’t feel clammy, and it comes in four sizes, so the small size could fit a child’s face. resproThese masks are rated N99 (the best protection you can get) and have received approval from the Chinese and Korean health ministries. They come with single and double valves to breathe through, and are made from soft material that goes easy on the skin. The filters are non-replaceable, so consider that you will need to buy a new mask every few months if you live in a city with high pollution levels.  vogmask"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f388956aec7b28c29da174623026a95626b7a68/525_140_6039_3623/master/6039.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d36ed5877e2a2de20eb527ec9db8494","title":"want better deal talking brexit fishing trawler","story":"Twenty miles off the coast of Cornwall lies one of the most fiercely contested Brexit battlelines. Do UK fishermen still want out? by  Sam Wollaston Photography by  Antonio OlmosOut of an apocalyptic yellow sky a salvo of white missiles rains down, plummeting into an angry black sea. Gannets, here for a free lunch. It’s hauling time on Crystal Sea, and for any young gurnard or whiting small and determined enough to wriggle free at this stage, just before the net is lifted from the water, liberty is short-lived. The escapee is snatched, underwater, then launched rudely up into the sky where it quickly disappears, headfirst, into a seabird, accompanied by a triumphant squawk. This is not a good place to be a fish.The birds are joined by dolphins, in from the flank, five or six of them, leaping joyfully from the face of a wave. They like the company, the skipper Dave Stevens likes to think, and he likes theirs it’s reassuring. They’re not here for a meal, though – they’re here for the show. And what a spectacle it is, all that colour and splashing and e-bombing. It’s beautiful and thrilling, horrific and terrifying, all at the same time. What a racket, too: the avian screeching, the grinding of the trawler’s main power winch, the metallic clanking of chain and trawl doors, the howl of a south-westerly force 7. There’s a bit of human yelling, too, men trying to be heard above the elements.In the wheelhouse, Dave turns the boat through 90 degrees, so that the net moves from the back to the side. Operating the smaller winch, Latvian fisherman Girts Kraulis hoists the dripping trawl up out of the sea, a huge teardrop of fish, some with their heads poking through the holes, as if taking one last look at the world they’re leaving.Braced on the pitching deck, Girts’s countryman Robert Vimba helps to manoeuvre the net into the bag hatch. Girts lowers it to the fish deck below, where Robert’s twin brother Edgar unties the bottom of the cod end and the catch spills out into the fish hopper. No cod today, but plenty of other fish: haddock and John Dory, plaice, sole, squid and cuttlefish (the ink from which has squirted over some of the others). The dead and the dying nearly reach the top of Edgar’s boots. A crab makes a vain dash for it, a dogfish writhes, the last pulses of life travel along the fins of the flatfish. A big monkfish yawns, opening up a vast and ancient cavern full of stalagmites and stalactites. Soon it will have its head hacked off (monkfish go to market without their heads: too ugly). Heads you lose, tails you also lose – or win, if you’re the fishermen: they like monkfish, and John Dory, which fetch a good price.Now Girts, Robert and Edgar stand in a line at a conveyor belt with their knives, gutting, sorting, discarding, chopping the wings off the rays, which will be skate when they get to the fishmonger. Dave joins them, keeping an eye on the screen which shows where they are at sea, and if there are any other vessels they are in danger of colliding with. There’s not much banter, very little chat even they just get on with it.The fish is washed, sorted and sized, lowered further down into the refrigerated hold, where it is packed with ice in boxes and stacked. By which time the nets will have already been out again for a couple of hours, ready to haul again in another three. It’s relentless, working on a trawler.Crystal Sea is a 20-metre twin-rig stern trawler, one of the bigger boats operating out of Newlyn in Cornwall. Twin rig means she drags two nets, side by side. She catches a mix of fish, up to 30 different species, operating anywhere between six and 120 miles from home. In the four days I am on board – to get a Brexit perspective from 49° 48’N, 5° 48’W and thereabouts, as well as to get some idea of what this very tough job involves – we are mainly between 10 and 20 miles from shore.At 10 years old, she is also one of the newer and better-equipped boats operating out of Newlyn. As well as all the mechanical gear a modern trawler has – winches and cranes, conveyor belts and ice-makers, the navigational equipment, GPS and radar – there’s a washing machine. The galley has a cooker, fridge, toaster and a deep-fat fryer. There’s a telly, on, loud, all the time – Homes Under The Hammer, Bargain Hunt, Scotland-Fiji in the rugby – even though there’s no time to watch. There’s even wifi, via a satellite.If I’m making it sound comfortable, it isn’t. Crystal Sea is a working fishing boat, damp and cramped. The cabin is especially hellish, down a ladder into a hot dark smelly hole below the waterline where you have to fumble to find your bunk. At the same level but forward of here, through a bulkhead, the fish sleep on ice.Dave Stevens’ family, from St Ives, have been fishing for generations, Dave has been doing it for 29 years, since he was 15. Now he works the boat with his brother Alec, and they do alternate weeks. It gets harder as you get older, Dave says. A big bear of a man – all the men are big – he’s unflustered, traditional, thoughtful and softly spoken, with a gentle Cornish accent.Girts, aged 47, and the Vimba brothers, 32 (it’s hard to tell them apart when they’re in their oilskins and you can’t see Edgar’s tattoos) are from the port of Ventspils on the Baltic. They commute from Latvia to Cornwall: two months on, one off, leaving friends and family behind. Girts’s daughter joined him for a bit, got a job in a crab factory, but now she’s back home studying law. On the boat, Girts’s mood is directly proportional to both the weather and how the fishing is going. The men, including Dave, are paid on a share-of-catch basis on a good week, they can net a grand each.Edgar doesn’t have a family, but Robert has a wife and two kids with another on the way. She would like to come over he’s not sure about it. He’s at sea, there’s no family to support her here – and if she went back to work, it would probably be to a crab factory, whereas in Latvia she’s got a nice office job for a fuel company. None of them know how their lives will be affected by Brexit.As a member (just) of the EU, Britain is signed up to the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), which means we do not control our own waters. All the rules – about catches, quotas, discards – come from the European Commission. Fish are seen as a common resource waters are shared you fish in mine, I’ll fish in yours. Voulez-vous pêcher avec moi, ce soir? It sounds like the very spirit of European unity and collaboration, but if you speak to Dave, or any other British fisherman or fisherwoman (a rare species in British waters), they’ll tell you it simply isn’t fair. Britain has some of the best fishing grounds in Europe suddenly, after 1973, we had to share them. So we’re free to fish in their waters, too? So what, we’re not bothered – the fishing’s fine at home.Inevitably, fishing played its part in the referendum campaign. Remember Nigel Farage coming up the Thames on a fishing boat, throwing a few haddock around, trading insults with Bob Geldof on the good ship Remain?As well as the injustice of having to share fishing waters, Dave’s other big beef with the EU is all the top-down micromanagement. We speak while he is on watch, sitting in one of the surprisingly comfy chairs in the wheelhouse. “Most companies and organisations I know listen to their workforces, and that feedback works up through the chain, not the other way round. The CFP is trying to manage on such a large scale, it just won’t work. Fishing is different in many areas around EU waters.”On quotas, for example, Dave thinks they’re not always getting it right. Sometimes the people who decide how much of one stock can be fished are working from data that is a few years old. “You need a more flexible approach. So if you’re catching too much of one species, it’s more abundant on the ground than the science would suggest – you should be able to take that species.”By take, he means keep, as opposed to discarding. On this trip he’s been discarding haddock, because he’s catching many more than he has a quota for. To see a beautiful freshly caught haddock going down the chute with the offal, dead, into the sea is a sickening sight, unless you’re a lazy gannet.Dave says his leave vote wasn’t purely based on fishing he made up his mind while visiting the EU headquarters in Brussels. He was there to make a presentation to a roundtable meeting about a filter that would allow smaller fish to escape the net, after which he went to meet his MEP, Julie Girling, in the chamber. The floor started to fill up, hundreds of people. “So I asked Julie, ‘Who are all these people? They can’t all be MEPs.’ And she said, ‘No, most are lobbyists, working for either NGOs or big chemical companies and the like.’ I was kind of taken aback. I’m not naive, I know that lobbying goes on – but it was the enormous scale of it. There must have been four or five lobbyists for every MEP.” He asked her how often she met her constituents, and she said it was quite rare for them to come to Brussels. “And I said, ‘That’s it, I’m out.’” When Dave talks about the hordes of circling lobbyists, it’s hard not to think of gannets.As we talk in the wheelhouse, he’s keeping an eye on what’s going on, outside, and on the panel of screens in front of him. One shows where we are, and who else is around (there are no other fishing boats) another shows the topography of the seafloor a third shows the F1 Grand Prix from Brazil (we have Sky Sports, too). A big white splodge on the radar is an approaching squall. They generally seem to hit at hauling time.Gale warning issued: 09.50 on Mon 12 Nov 2018 UTC. South-westerly gale force 8 expected soon. Wind: westerly or south-westerly 5-7, occasionally gale 8 in north. Sea state: rough or very rough. Weather: thundery showers. Visibility: mainly good.Today there are no high-pressure systems coming from the south, bringing fair or settled weather. The conditions are “poor”, as Dave says, with characteristic understatement, for the whole trip. Strong winds, big seas, five-metre waves this is about the worst weather they go out in, and why we’re at sea for just four days, instead of the usual six.But even storm clouds have silver linings. Being one of the bigger boats in the fleet means Crystal Sea is one of the few that will be out in these conditions. One of the larger beam trawlers from Newlyn had to be towed home by a sister ship due to engine trouble in the night. But we’re still catching fish – a lot of fish, and good fish: plenty of John Dory and monkfish. And because rough weather means fewer fish coming in, the price tends to go up as the Beaufort scale does.But the crew’s mood doesn’t get a similar bounce. “When it’s like this, shitty weather, it’s not great,” Girts says. I don’t think I’d want to be around Girts when the weather and the fishing were bad. “It’s not the best job in the world, it’s not the worst.”Robert says it’s not so bad. Until recently he was on a crabbing boat, and that was more physical, with more lifting. But trawling is more dangerous, with all the heavy gear and cables and everything thrashing around in the big seas. “Every job is as dangerous as you make it, but we really are exposed,” Dave admits. He had an accident when he was 20, working on his dad’s boat north of Scilly. “A big piece of equipment came down, pinned me to the deck and crushed my leg. I was taken to shore by the lifeboat, I was lucky – then to Truro by air ambulance, where they patched me up.” Dave, not one to exaggerate, reckons that without the helicopter he probably wouldn’t have made it.From where I’m standing – or trying to stand – it looks both dangerous and bloody hard work. There is the sheer constant physicality of it – handling heavy warps and chains, pulling, tying, lifting – and the absolute relentlessness of it: haul, shoot the nets again, process, pack, store, grab a couple of hours’ sleep if you can, on watch, haul again, 247. Plus cooking, one proper meal a day, burgers and chips, stew, rice, no fish (I’m not surprised, I don’t feel like fish). Meanwhile everything and everywhere – your workplace, kitchen, bedroom, toilet – is bucking around like a bronco.Of course there is a bloody great blue whale in the cabin here. Are the Latvian crew – Girts, Robert and Edgar – aware of the irony? Has the leave skipper not noticed that his workforce comes from another EU member state? Girts, whose English is the best of the three, tells me he’s concerned about the prospect of a hard Brexit, and what that would mean when it came to his right to live and work in Britain. Dave doesn’t think it will be an issue, even with a hard Brexit. “I don’t see them stopping people moving around Europe,” he says. “We believe in fair play,” he adds, old-fashionedly.It has been hard to recruit locally. “It’s the fault of our industry, and the reputation our industry has,” Dave says. “People see it as a dangerous, dead-end job. All the talk in the media is that there are no fish left in the sea, we’re not sustainable, it’s all our fault – and it really is not like that.” He continues to look forward to having a mix of crew, from Latvia, the UK, wherever, just “the best guys to go to sea with”.But Brexit isn’t just about unfair quotas, and recruitment issues it’s also about trade, and what happens next. If Britain is no longer signed up to the CFP, then surely the EU will just close down its market, which is where a lot of Britain’s fish goes? Dave says they don’t want to ban foreign boats completely, to pull up the drawbridge. He expects to see EU boats in British waters after March next year, but under a licensing system – as there is in Norway and Iceland. “We fully expect there to be mutual benefits. We just want a better deal, because at the moment we have a very, very poor deal,” he says. (This is damning from a man who describes a force 7 with five-metre waves as merely “poor”.)Dave is not even worried about European markets being closed to us. “We do £1bn worth of fish trade with the EU, they do similar trade with us, trade for trade it’s pretty equal,” he says. “But the EU has been a declining market for fish products from the UK for over 20 years now. We are looking at the Middle East, China. It is a truly global market and we’ve been selling into those markets for the last 10, 15 years. They’re growing all the time.”A bigger worry for Dave is that the transition period, throughout which the UK will still be tied to the CFP, will drag on for years – more negotiations, new rules being drawn up, new quotas, new rights of access. Or that they will be betrayed again, as they were in 1973 – the government (whoever it is) trading access to British waters in order to secure more favourable terms in other, more profitable sectors. And it won’t just be a few haddock, it’ll be the entire UK fishing industry going down that offal chute to be fed to the gannets.Right now though, there’s a boat to be unloaded. After four days out, Crystal Sea chugs slowly back in to Newlyn once there’s enough water to get in on the rising tide. Conditions aside, it has been a decent four days. In the hold there are 230 boxes of fish – monkfish, bream, ray wings, dover sole, sand sole, lemon sole, Cornish sole, all the soles, squid, cuttlefish, crab, conger eel, hake, lobster, plaice, gurnard, haddock, John Dory, octopus, red mullet, sea bass, lesser-spotted dogfish, smoothhounds, tope, turbot and whiting. 9,288kg in total. We’ve also brought back a tonne of rubbish, dragged up from the bottom of the sea – discarded crab and lobster pots rusty old oil drums a few trainers (there are usually trainers: they come from a container that fell off a ship 20 years ago, and are still being fished up) the vertebra of a large whale.Dave’s dad, David Sr, 68, who doesn’t go to sea any more but is still very much involved, is on the quay to help unload and operate the crane. The boxes are lifted from the boat on to the waiting lorry, which leaves for Plymouth, where the fish will be sold in the morning. Most will go to the UK market – wholesalers, fishmongers. Some will probably go to Europe, still. Some might even go to the Middle East, or China.Dave gets a week ashore, just in time to scrutinise Theresa May’s draft deal. He’ll be concerned about possible links between access to waters and trade. And about the transition period getting drawn out. But at least, during that time, he gets to keep his crew.Edgar, Robert and Girts will sleep on the boat tonight, but it won’t be pitching about and they won’t have to get up through the night, pull on oilskins and boots. Tomorrow they’ll be off to sea again. This time the forecast isn’t so bad.• Commenting on this piece?

Panellists said it had baked apple and elderflower flavours while one likened the aroma of the fizz to lychees. It also scooped one of three coveted ‘Best Buy’ awards.Which? asked supermarkets to nominate their choice of a vintage or non-vintage (NV) champagne alternative for its pre-Christmas taste test. Entries had to be either own-label or exclusive, dry (brut), white, from any grape or blend and priced between £7.50 and £20.The sparkling wine panel experts blind-tasted nine champagne alternatives, working their way through a total of 240 glasses.“For those looking for a change from prosecco this Christmas, our Best Buy English fizz is an excellent option” said Harry Rose, editor of Which? magazine. “The quality and choice on offer this year is good news for lovers of sparkling wine. Whether you’re keen to try something different or you’re a die-hard prosecco fan, our experts have found some great supermarket offerings.”Morrisons’ wine expert, Clive Donaldson, said: “This bubbly offers customers the best of English wine making and will make a splash at any Christmas party.”The second Which? Best Buy – notching up a score of 76 – went to a French sparkling wine. Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference Crémant (£11) was praised by the experts as “simple and refreshing” with “attractive herbal and pear notes”.A well-kept secret and alternative to prosecco was the fashionable Italian fizz franciacorta, Which? said. It is made from grapes from the region in Lombardy. Drier than prosecco, it is described as fruitier and softer than champagne, with distinctive lemony notes.The Tesco Finest Franciacorta DOCG Brut (£15) was scored at 75, after judges hailed the “clean, fresh” sparkling wine as a good choice for those who like “gently frothy” bubbles. They said it had a “fine, almost shy mousse”.Asda served up the highest-scoring prosecco. Its Extra Special Prosecco Asolo Brut DOCG – priced at £8 – edged ahead of strong competition from Lidl, Aldi and the Co-op to be awarded 71 by the panel. Describing it as “fun and frothy”, the experts detected “notes of peach and pear.”The consumer group’s wine experts recently also tasted 15 champagnes – all brut (dry) and costing £35 or less. It found that the Co-op’s own-brand champagne was as good as GH Mumm Cordon Rouge, better than Moët \u0026amp Chandon and the best value Christmas bubbly.The British drank 34.4m gallons of sparkling wine last year, but the growth in sales of prosecco has slowed markedly, with drinkers switching to £10 bottles of crémant as a cheap alternative to champagne.The triumph of the homegrown fizz crowns another strong year for the sector. The fall in sterling has handed a Brexit bonus to English sparkling wines, with many considered to match premium French champagnes in quality but now priced the same or less.In a further boost for English producers, the Ridgeview estate in Sussex was this week awarded the coveted trophy of the world’s best winemaker in the International Wine \u0026amp Spirit Competition 2018. This is the first time in the IWSC’s 49-year history that the award has been presented to an English producer.Miles Beale, the chief executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, said: “2018 is proving to be a corking year for English wine. The increased number of vineyards, heatwave and warm autumn have resulted in a bumper harvest for our wine producers, who are delighted with the quality of the grapes.“On top of this, Ridgeview has been crowned the world’s best winemaker, which is a ‘first’ and a sensational achievement. English wine has well and truly earned a world-class reputation for excellence.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f429c4d9e233343edd8ce54b0750e13489924a9/1084_360_5685_3412/master/5685.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26299a1b5537e24f4773678eff159c2d","title":"tamal ray clementine lemon syrup cake recipe","story":"Delicate, tender caramelised citrus meets the satisfying crunch of nutty bulgur wheat soaked in sticky syrupI see this sort of cake as the antidote to those towering sponge-beasts, slathered in buttercream, that you see in bakery windows.

Set the zest aside in a small bowl.With a sharp knife, slice the remaining clementines and lemon as thinly as you can: you will only be able to get about three slices from each clementine save the rest for juicing later. I find they start to fall apart after you’ve got about three slices from one, so once you’re finding it difficult to slice evenly, set the remainder of the clementine aside and move on to another. Put the slices in a small saucepan and pour in enough hot water to just cover them (roughly 100-150ml). Put a lid on the pan and set it to simmer gently for 10-15 minutes, by which point the peel should be soft and translucent, but still holding their shape.Heat the oven to 150C (140C fan)325Fgas 3 and line the base of a 20cm cake tin with greaseproof paper, then brush the base and sides with melted butter. Scatter with 30g sugar, then carefully remove the slices of peel from the saucepan with a slotted spoon and arrange over the base. Scatter over another 30g sugar.To make the cake batter, beat together the butter and caster sugar with an electric whisk until pale and fluffy. Stir in the eggs, cream, citrus zest, bulgur wheat, ground almonds and baking powder. Carefully spread the batter into the cake tin, taking care not to disturb your tessellation of citrus. Bake for 30-35 minutes – a skewer poked into the centre should emerge clean with no batter on.Meanwhile, prepare the citrus syrup: add the juice from the remaining fruit to the saucepan of poaching water, along with 100g sugar. Bring to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes, until reduced and thickened slightly.Once the cake is ready, poke holes all over with a skewer and pour over three-quarters of the syrup. Leave to absorb the syrup, then and it from the sides of the tin by running a knife along its edge. Put a large plate over the cake then, holding the plate tightly to the top of the tin, flip the whole thing over on to a plate. Remove the cake tin and brush the revealed citrus top with the rest of the syrup."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d97b1908c5b9e6e22721d3c5e4e0bfabada3658/533_0_2686_1612/master/2686.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aae5abe740b76bcffffbad701eb6c64e","title":"fulham southampton premier league match report","story":"It is early days in the miracle stakes, but a first win in three months, a slide arrested, evidence of team character and a comeback all in one lurching 90 minutes surely amounts to a revelation in Fulham.The benefit of having a managerial career lasting 32 years is that Claudio Ranieri had seen and been through enough footballing scenarios to transmit a veneer of calm as Fulham scampered through the last exchanges of a helter-skelter game knowing the chance of an accident, a scramble, was well within reason. He kept his cool and offered a controlled round of applause at the end of it all.As any good Italian man of football should, Ranieri quickly turned his attention to the bare facts of Fulham’s goals against column. His newly inherited team did let in two, but the good news to offset that is that a group who also have been goal shy recently scored three – and very neatly worked goals they were too, of the sort that brought them to the Premier League with a reputation for aesthetic football.That familiar feeling of a goal sloppily conceded was averted early on when Sergio Rico pulled off an impressive double save to repel Stuart Armstrong and Manolo Gabbiadini. Southampton pressed and pushed, evidently keen to target the vulnerabilities that have dogged Fulham’s defence on the assumption that there was only so much Ranieri could achieve trying to fix it over a matter of days.Southampton’s hunger to pounce on any Fulham uncertainty delivered the lead. Nathan Redmond chased down the ball and hooked it back into the danger area. When Maxime Le Marchand only half-cleared, the energetic Armstrong surged on to steer the ball past Rico. It helped that Charlie Austin bumped Jean Michaël Seri out the way – a sign in a way of how the goal crystalised how Southampton’s players began with much heartier levels of determination than their hosts.“If we want better results, we must battle hard,” Ranieri noted in his opening programme notes. They did. Fulham needed a spark of inspiration, needed to show they believed in themselves. Ryan Sessegnon took the initative with a long range dipping shot. Then they took collective responsibility to lift themselves as a team, with a sweet passing move, sweeping the ball via seven different players taking the scenic route to goal. They eased their way encouragingly through midfield and the move took off as the ball zipped from Sessegnon to Cairney to Le Marchand. The Frenchman’s cross landed invitingly for Aleksandar Mitrovic to score by guiding his header into the far corner of the net. Craven Cottage erupted.Sessegnon’s influence grew, and he demonstrated an excellent mix of technique and efficiency to carve Southampton open and help Fulham to take the lead. He zipped his way past Cédric Soares and angled a pass for André Schürrle to gobble up the chance with delight.When referee Michael Oliver blew the half-time whistle it signalled the first time Fulham had led a match since 1 September. They threatened to improve their lot early in the second half on the counter-attack, only for McCarthy to keep out Mitrovic. It was one of those moments on which a game’s pendulum swings. The next meaningful attack fell to Southampton. The most alert person on the pitch when Soares tried an intuitive backheel was Armstrong, who had time to sprint onto the ball and lash an equaliser past Rico.With the wind sucked out of their sails, how much character could Fulham muster? The answer was delivered with a sudden gust in the form of another well-worked goal. Christie’s floated cross was glanced on by Sessegnon for Mitrovic to wallop the ball past McCarthy.Southampton rallied. Rico beat away from Pierre Emile Højbjerg and kept out a stoppage-time effort from Michael Obafemi. The loss piled pressure on Mark Hughes, and Southampton’s fans sang about getting sacked in the morning to their own man in the dugout. New manager bounce can be a wonderful thing. The evidence, in the shape of Ranieri here, was unmistakable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ee75fe28ca7a2c9ebdc5f78e19da458ffee2ef7/0_73_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a1c274f5a8b50e8e4ce2cf0f2d424c8","title":"west ham manchester city premier league report","story":"If you were looking for a contest that reflected well on the competitiveness of the Premier League, this was not it, as Manchester City comprehensively defeated a timid West Ham in less than 40 minutes.Goals from David Silva, Raheem Sterling and two from Leroy Sané, the second coming in second-half injury time, came easily for the visitors. The hosts, who lest we forget spent £100m in the summer to challenge in the top half of the table and recruited a former City boss to help them do it, looked visibly intimidated, and only came to life when the rubber was well and truly dead.The first goal came from an apparently innocuous situation, if there is such a thing with City. Felipe Anderson surrendered possession outside City’s box, trying to run the ball through a crowd of defenders in the 11th minute. Sané picked the Brazilian’s pocket, and Kyle Walker pushed possession upfield before playing wide to Sterling. From there it was two on four, but City’s little movements were too much for the hosts. Sterling bent a cross behind the back line, Silva darted beyond it. His finish was a tidy reverse clip which left Lukasz Fabianski in a heap. He wasn’t the last Hammers player to find himself in that situation.Nine minutes later the lead was doubled, Sterling tucking home at the back post after Sané had bewildered Pablo Zabaleta on the right. It was astonishingly easy, and the way Sterling deserted Arthur Masuaku at the crucial moment raised questions as to why the offensively-focussed wing-back had been selected ahead of the more defensively capable Aaron Cresswell.West Ham decided to make a brief fist of it and they had two chances in the following couple of minutes. First Marko Arnautovic was teed up in the box by Michail Antonio, but with the ball trailing slightly behind him the Austrian couldn’t find the right power and Walker slid in to block. For the second opportunity Antonio set himself up, but his fearsome shot was straight at Ederson.The third goal came 10 minutes before half-time, and was just as simply achieved as the others. With City in prolonged possession, Fernandinho looped a pass over the heads of the West Ham defence and into the path of Sterling. The England man volleyed his cross first time, Sané claimed it on the penalty spot, sent Fabián Balbuena sprawling with a half-turn and passed the ball beyond Fabianski.There was no booing from the home fans as the players trooped off for the interval, and they may have seen worse since the club moved to the London Stadium last year. But this was still a performance that was both confusing and enervating. In Manuel Pellegrini’s first encounter against the team he once led to a league title he had picked a side that seemed ill-suited to disrupting City’s possession. Perhaps the aim was to open up on the counter, but without the ball even that was impossible. To make matters worse, the hosts were happy to play at City’s tempo, which was walking pace.Cresswell came on for Masuaku at half-time ,and Javier Hernández replaced Grady Diangana to make it a 4-4-2 shortly afterwards. By this point City could have had four, Fabianski making a sliding tackle to stop Sterling, but the changes did give the hosts a bit more vigour.They should have scored themselves just before the hour mark after Pedro Obiang did something that had been notable by its absence and won a tackle in the middle of the park. The ball broke free to Hernández, who had the presence of mind and the calmness of touch to spring a pass through the advanced City defence. Antonio raced on to it and bore down on goal, but while he was able to bend his shot around an onrushing Ederson he could not steer it inside the post and it bounced out for a goal kick.There were a couple more half chances for the hosts, Balbuena hoisting a decent header over the bar, but there was never anything approaching a comeback. As the game approached added time Arnautovic limped off the pitch and left West Ham to play with 10 men. They couldn’t hold out for two extra minutes however, and Sané volleyed home at the far post with the last kick of the match."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e7f4aff6a4552a161df9c8b14f0897f6ac8d27d/0_21_4134_2481/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d13a98164763140d93b0179a1838407","title":"tottenham v chelsea premier league live","story":"4 min Aurier’s excellent cross is headed towards his own goal by Azpilicueta, under all sorts of pressure from Kane, and Kepa makes a comfortable save.3 min Davies, near the halfway line, curves a dangerous pass behind the defence that Kepa claims just in front of Alli. 3 min It’s been a very fast start from Spurs, who have already won the ball high up the pitch on two or three occasions.2 min Spurs have two corners inside the first minute.

Thank you for reading. And Amy Lawrence was at Craven Cottage. Paul Doyle was at Watford. Paul Wilson was at Goodison. Jamie Jackson was at Old Trafford. A bad point. When the objective is to close the gap on the top four, and when you start the period of eight matches in December it is not good. I give them credit, they were defending very well, they were always waiting. They played well. In the first half, I would say we needed a bit more aggression. We found the space their tactical shape gives. We were not ambitious. In the second half of the game we needed to score the best chances, credit to Hennessey. I think once more we waste time. We allowed the game to do without chasing it since the first moment.Paul MacInnes was at the London Stadium. I am very pleased. A first game, a first victory, a little step but an important step. We made very good solutions, and we made some very good mistakes. It could have been more for us, and more for them and I am happy. I thought our breakout play was good. I am sure Jose will have been worried. We came here last year and lost 4-0, and could it could have been seven or eight. We were chance-less but I don’t think we were chance-less today. I thought it was a very even game. NPM is back for more: “I’d be interested to know which table James Tilley thinks United are worthy of being ranked as mid-table in, because it’s not the Premier League.”The Copestake Curse is back: “Genius by me, I mean Klopp, not substituting Hendo when on a yellow and baiting the ref before the inevitable. Out for two games! Win-win.”In the Championship, Leeds have climbed up to second, having beaten Bristol City. In League One, Portsmouth extended their lead by winning at Scunny with Sunderland on their tails after that rescue job at Walsall. Good win for AFC Wimbledon after a long losing streak gives them a chance of safety in League One. Lincoln are top of League Two, as MK Dons falter. Macc Town are now seven points from safety. In the National League, Leyton Orient are top, with Salford three points off them.James Tilley emails in: “It’s actually been a thoroughly entertaining game at Old Trafford.

Niall Mullen emails in: “You’re welcome Liverpool fans. You are welcome.”The Copestake curse worked in opposite effect. The Sol Campbell effect has taken hold as Macclesfield Town celebrate their second win of the season, beating Yeovil 1-0.

Jamie Vardy came off the bench to equalise, and Leicester will be happy with a point after James Maddison’s sending off. Fulham clung on, but will Mark Hughes? The Theatre of Gloom rings with boos. They were getting nervous but Liverpool saw this one out with some comfort. A game won in the first half, awesome from the champions. Another goal for Sane, another sharp finish. The leaders cruising. Ten-men Sunderland roar back to make it 2-2 with Walsall. Jack Ross is doing a great job for the former Rokerites. Been a good day for the ten men teams. Southampton piling it on at Fulham, where Leswyn Hughes is running out of time and excuses. But they are in injury time, which is running out fast.

QPR have equalised against Stoke, with Angel Rangel getting two, a collector’s item for him. Jordan Henderson dismissed for two bookable offences in the 82nd minute. It seems harsh for his foul on Capoue. The ten men equalise, and Jamie Vardy, who came off the bench, got it from the spot. Corrections corner from Danny Michaux: “Just to set the record straight: Luka Milivojević was the victim of a foul from Fellaini should have resulted in a red card for the Manchester United player.”Neil Warnock apoplectic with rage shocker - Cardiff have had a penalty turned down at Everton. Wherever Sol Campbell is, he has inspired Macclesfield Town, who have scored against Yeovil through Michael Rose. Liverpool did not falter. Trent has scored a first goal since Boxing Day with a pearler of a free-kick. Roy Hodgson has his face on as Andros Townsend misses a sitter for Crystal Palace, having found himself through on goal. Leeds were piling on the pressure against Bristol City and finally have their goal.The word from Old Trafford is not positive. Alexis Sanchez has come on for Paul Pogba, while Luka Milivojević might have been sent off for a nasty foul. Joe Allen has scored for Stoke, putting them 2-1 up against QPR. Mane’s run and Salah’s shot grabs the lead for Liverpool, with Ben Foster unsighted. They were getting nervous. Norwich now 4-1 up on Swansea, with Teemu Pukki on the mark. Cyrus “the virus” Christie’s run sets up Ryan Sessegnon’s flick and a volley from Mitrovic. Nobody can rule out 3-3 soon, though. Our man at Fulham pinpoints that continuing problem for the Cottagers. The Iceman gets his seventh of the season, having been quickest to the rebound after Theo Walcott had a shot saved. Another goal chalked off at Old Trafford! Ashley Young had the ball in the net, but Lukaku was offside. It was Sakho offside for the previous offside and Victor Lindeloff’s OG. Penalty claim at Watford. Will Hughes was felled, and it looked a plum claim. Liverpool got very lucky indeed.Stuart Armstrong gets a second goal, with a fine finish. Fulham cannot stop conceding.

I know he’s happy and healthy.”Nishi is six, and was diagnosed with a dairy allergy as a baby. Reena was already vegetarian, and had felt uneasy about eating animal products for some time. Because her baby son was now more or less vegan by default, she joined him – and today the pair are strictly plant-based. Her older son, Aarush, is eight, and, like his dad, vegetarian but considering veganism. (Both boys are currently obsessed with creating an online vegan sweetshop.)For many parents, the idea of raising children on nothing but plants is hard to fathom. Anyone who has ever struggled to make a child eat something as inoffensive as peas will probably balk at barring fish fingers (protein) and yoghurt (calcium). But the number of vegan children is on the rise in the UK. No one knows exactly how many there are the Vegan Society’s most recent figures state that there are about 600,000 vegans in the country, twice the number there were two years ago – but this figure accounts only for people aged over 15. It’s a social shift driven by health, environmental and animal welfare concerns, as well as high-profile campaigns such as Veganuary, which saw nearly 168,500 people around the world give up meat, fish, eggs, dairy and honey for four weeks last January. Since nearly half of all British vegans are aged 15-34, the Vegan Society assumes the number of vegan children must also be increasing sharply. How do their families do it?Tamar Nussbacher-Lawrence’s rather choosy three-year-old son hasn’t put her, or her husband Rob, off their newly adopted veganism. “He only wants to eat toast, rice, pasta, chips and fruit,” she says. “I do worry about it, but I try not to be a crazy food pusher – I always make sure I offer him what we have. Maybe he will eat when he’s 18,” she smiles. The couple, who run Inkwa Tattoo studio in London (Tamar is also a reflexologist), have been vegan for 18 months, partly inspired by Rob’s Rastafarianism (it’s up to the inidual, but many Rastafarians adopt an “ital” diet and don’t eat animal products). After giving up red meat for a trial period, they quickly cut out chicken, fish and dairy, and then all animal products. “We just felt better, physically and mentally. And the better we felt, the easier it was to do,” says Rob.Another powerful motivator was that, soon after, Tamar became pregnant. “We had a hard journey towards having kids,” she says. “I’m not saying, ‘Go vegan and you’ll get pregnant.’ But I specialise in fertility and maternity reflexology, and I tell my clients that, even if you improve the quality of the meat you buy and eat less of it, it will make a difference to your system.”Tamar has two stepchildren who eat meat outside the home, but not when staying over, and an eight-month-old daughter who they are weaning as a vegan. “It started when I bought some meat for my son and the next morning it was still in date but completely brown. It made me think, what am I putting down his throat?”The change startled the couple’s friends and family. “We really liked meat, and we ate and cooked a lot of it – a lot of barbecues,” says Tamar. “A few people said, ‘You’ll be back in a week’, because every meal I had, it had to have meat,” adds Rob. “My dad used to run a pop-up Jamaican restaurant in the 1990s: jerk chicken, stew pork, curry goat – every kind of animal you can think of, from cow’s foot to pig’s trotter to oxtail. So when I snapped out of that, it shocked a lot of people.”His older boys are 13 and nine, and for them there was a period of adjustment. “My kids said, ‘Can I still eat meat?’ And they can,” says Rob. “But they know there are no meat products in our house. None to come in, none to go in our microwave, or our oven or our fridge. When they step out, they can make their own choices. I don’t want them to feel shackled by my decision. I can only try and guide them through what I think is right.”“We try to make things for them that aren’t too adventurous, like spaghetti bolognese, fajitas,” says Tamar. “And curries, rice, stew peas, all the things they’re used to, but with the meat taken out,” adds Rob. “With a lot of Caribbean food, you can just extract the meat and use other ingredients. ”They have explained their choice to their boys, including the three-year-old. “I tell him we don’t eat animals, and that animals are our friends. I don’t think he’s old enough to understand on any other level. Or care, to be honest,” says Tamar.As for their eight-month-old daughter, the couple are following a baby-led weaning approach, meaning they simply give her a bit of the vegan food they are eating. “She’s still breastfed, and until she’s one, she’ll get most of her nutrition from that,” says Tamar. “I make sure she has things like almond butter, tahini and avocado. I’m doing research and getting ideas about what to feed her. With my three-year-old, we weren’t vegan, and I did all the pureeing and freezing. I’m finding this easier. I just give her a bit of toast with peanut butter and she’s happy.”Erin Marrs lives in Kirkcaldy with her husband Paul, a professional hockey player, and their two sons, Oliver, who is five, and Charles, who is 18 months old. All four are vegan the children have been “vegan since conception”, says Erin. She converted her husband, having initially given up dairy to treat her adult acne. “He was not at all eager,” she says, “but what I tell everyone to do is pick a favourite meal and then veganise that. I learned to cook because there needed to be no reason he could say, ‘I’m missing out on something.’”The more Marrs learned about animal welfare, the more it underlined her choice. “I considered myself an animal lover, but I began to learn about factory farms, about how our consumption of animals has gone crazy. Once you see it, you can’t unlearn it. Watching the documentary Forks Over Knives was very powerful, and then Earthlings, which is horrible.” Would she consider herself an activist? “I’m more of a pacifist vegan. People ask if it’s for health or for animals, and I say both.”Although both sets of grandparents are very supportive, Marrs has had some difficult conversations with friends. “I’ve definitely had some judgment. I have one girlfriend who thinks it’s too extreme. She thinks I’m not indulging enough, when I have only one life to live – like it’s a massive diet that I’m on. She will ask, ‘When is this vegan thing going to be over?’ but I just laugh it off. That kind of judgment often comes from the people who are most interested or conflicted themselves.”Marrs’ Instagram feed is full of tempting bowls of multicoloured raw vegetables and falafel, or soups bursting with carrots and greens – all of it being grabbed by tiny, pudgy toddler hands. She wrangles a series of what sound like minor miracles every day. “In the morning, they usually go for fruit, first. We make a smoothie bowl or have overnight oats. We often do leftovers for lunch, or a wrap with hummus and veggies, or a chickpea salad sandwich. And then some sort of big dinner, like a big buddha bowl with a brown rice base, tons of veggies and a sauce.”It hasn’t always been straightforward. “My eldest went through a phase where he was very picky, around two or three. If you’re feeding them a vegan diet and they’re not eating any vegetables, you panic. He would only eat fruit – an entire pineapple, or bananas all day.” Marrs worried less than she might have done, as, in common with many vegan mothers, she extended breastfeeding until Oliver was three – partly to avoid having to find a suitable alternative drink. He stopped when Marrs became pregnant again.So far, Oliver has never veered off the vegan path. “If someone gives him peanut butter on toast, he’ll ask if the bread is vegan. He’s very vocal about it and very firm in his stance. I don’t think I’ve pushed it on to him, other than explaining to him why we eat this way.“Once he was old enough to know that people ate different things, he started to ask what they were eating and we told him: that’s a cow or a chicken. If we pass the meat counter in the supermarket, he’ll say, ‘That’s a dead chicken.’ He’s been around my family for turkey dinners. He knows it was once a living animal, and he has no interest in eating one.” At another child’s birthday party, he didn’t seem to mind not eating the cake. “I just said, it’s not vegan, and he said, OK. There was a trampoline, so he couldn’t have cared less about sitting down to eat.”It’s important to Marrs that her children do get treats. “People have suggested that when he turns 16 he’s just going to go to McDonald’s and gorge. But he won’t if he doesn’t feel like he’s missing out. If he wants a vegan doughnut, we go get one.” Like Patel, Marrs receives occasional comments about her eldest’s size. “My youngest is massive, but my older son is an average height, and some people ask if he’s a little bit small. I don’t know if they think that, because he’s vegan, he’s not going to grow big and strong.”“We explained from an early age why we were vegan,” she says. “When Emily was about 10, old enough not to be upset by it, we took her to see Vegucated at a community screening.” The 2011 documentary follows three New Yorkers who go vegan while learning about intensive animal farming. “The film explains why people might be vegan in a nice, positive way, but does go into some details,” Liddle says. “While they don’t show a lot, they do show some aspects of the meat industry, like the separation of parts of animals. I remember it was so sterile – turning animals into products, picking off the legs and dealing with the corpses. It was strange and macabre.”Although on occasion, Emily has rebelled – “we find the occasional wrapper of something containing dairy, but it’s no big deal” – she has avoided non-vegan food since she was very small. “At nursery, if she was offered a sweet that wasn’t vegan, she just wouldn’t have it.”The family’s choice is motivated by a number of factors. “For me, it’s about doing the right thing. Being vegan is an important part of intersectionalism. As well as animals, health and the environment, I care about humans. If we stop being violent towards animals, maybe we will understand how to make ourselves less violent towards people.” She says she was also affected by the experience of dairy cows. “The calf is separated from the mother almost immediately. That mother doesn’t have any rights.”Today, Emily attends secondary school in the Scottish Borders, where Liddle has met with the catering staff. “We explained how, if you change just one ingredient, instead of being vegetarian it will be vegan – but everyone can still have it. Things like not putting milk in soup, or doing lentil curry instead of chicken. There are lots of other options for non-vegan kids on any given day. It just needs a tiny tweak.”For Reena Patel, her children’s school in London has been the least complicated factor in her son’s veganism. “A couple of his friends are also vegan, so he’s not the odd one out.” At home, the family all eat the same food, with small adaptations to make a meal half-vegan and half-vegetarian. “So if we’re making pizza, half will be made with non-dairy cheese.”Until he was three, Nishi was untroubled about not being able to eat at other people’s houses. “But as he’s gone to more playdates and birthday parties, he’s felt quite left out. I have to send a list of things that he can’t eat and I offer to bring food for him, but mostly people are really accommodating. I’m always so grateful – it’s not something that I expect at all.”Because of Nishi’s allergies, the family were offered support from consultants and dietitians. “I was expecting a fight, going in saying: ‘He has all these allergies and we’re vegetarian, so he’s now vegan.’ On the whole, they’ve been brilliant. Just once, a dietitian likened it to child abuse: she said ‘He has so many allergies and he’s quite small, so it’s a form of neglect.’ I had to get up and walk out. I later found out she’d been asked to leave because she was so aggressive and judgmental.”Recently, Patel discovered she was more concerned about her youngest son’s size than the professionals. “I worried he was too small, but his allergy specialist sat me down and said, ‘Stop worrying, you’re petite and the chances are he’s just naturally small. He eats well – he’s absolutely fine.’ It was hugely reassuring.”“As a parent, veganism has to be a well-informed choice. But it’s absurd we feel the need to question parents who are vegan when I see so many kids on the way home from school eating chips, sweets and fizzy drinks. People are more antsy about veganism than junk food.”Anyone raising a vegan child in the UK who wants support should get it from their GP, and if necessary, a dietitian, says Rosie Saunt, a registered NHS dietitian and co-founder of the Rooted Project, which tries to counter nutritional myths in the media. “A GP will check that a parent or  is covering the bases. But then if they are still struggling they would be referred to a dietitian, particularly if there are any red flags, like their child isn’t thriving or growing as they should be.” She has no qualms about young children being vegan as long as parents focus on “lots of variety and give it some careful thought”. In 2017, the British Dietetic Association, Britain’s professional body for dietitians, reaffirmed its 2014 agreement with the Vegan Society, stating that a well-planned vegan diet can be healthy for people of any age.“General studies of vegan diets show they are definitely healthy,” says Saunt. “There are multiple health benefits, such as lowered risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. It’s difficult to find studies to back up whether they are good for general health in children, infants and adolescents. This is for a few reasons: studies on children haven’t necessarily been done, as ethically it can be difficult, and the existing data on adults can be skewed by confounding factors. Adults who follow a vegan diet tend to be of higher socioeconomic status, they tend to exercise more, and not to smoke. So it’s hard to unpick if it’s the vegan diet alone leading to these benefits in adults.”Because the vegan diet is relatively restricted, in comparison with most UK diets (the average Briton is thought to eat nearly 80 kilos of meat a year and drink 82 litres of milk), vegan adults and children need to make sure they are getting enough of certain critical nutrients. “Calcium, iron, protein, vitamin D, B12, iodine and omega 3 fatty acids” are the important ones, says Saunt. “We are lucky in the UK, as there are loads of options in the supermarkets, so it is possible for children and infants to get all the nutrition they need from a plant-based diet.”She emphasises that it’s important for children to eat a wide range of vegan foods, including nuts, seeds, beans, pulses and soya products such as tofu. “Different foods contain nutrients which all work together in a complex synergy. Since energy and nutrient requirements are higher during growth, infants and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to deficiencies. They need enough energy to grow and be active, to ensure they remain healthy, fight infection, and learn.”Some health professionals have sounded a much more cautious note. Last year Mary Fewtrell, professor of paediatric nutrition at University College London, released a strongly worded statement voicing concern that parents of vegan infants were not following advice when it came to supplements, especially of vitamin B12. As chair of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition committee, Fewtrell wrote, “It is difficult to ensure a healthy and balanced vegan diet in young infants, and parents should understand the serious consequences of failing to follow advice regarding supplementation of the diet. The risks of getting it wrong can include irreversible cognitive damage and, in the extreme, death. Our advice is that if parents pursue a vegan diet for their child, they must seek and strictly follow medical and dietary advice.” (The Vegan Society responded at the time, stating, “Nutrient deficiencies are not an exclusively vegan problem and it is unfair to paint them as such.”)Jones has two vegan siblings. “Sixteen years ago my brother, who is now in his late 20s, went vegan – if he went out, all he could eat was bean burgers from Nando’s, on repeat. My mum and dad found it very difficult, as it was so rare. But us kids have had an upwards effect on my parents. Over the years we’ve informed them and given them books, and let them know that we are going to be OK. My mum is now almost completely vegan and my dad eats steak about once a year.” Raising a vegan child is perhaps trickiest in families where no one else is even vegetarian. Jen Stanbrook, an interiors blogger based in Nottingham, has two daughters. The eldest, 14, is a strict vegan on moral and ethical grounds she doesn’t wear wool or leather and uses only cruelty-free skincare brands. “I don’t ever cook a family meal now,” Stanbrook says. “When Ella was vegetarian it was easier to add the meat or extra ingredients, but the vegan diet makes this pretty impossible. We sit down together but mostly I cook at least two, if not three, different meals. My younger daughter won’t eat anything labelled vegan, although Ella batch cooks about three quarters of her own meals now.”Some friends, colleagues and family members fail to understand why Stanbrook is so accommodating. “The initial reaction is the usual: surely that can’t be healthy, how does she get enough protein? Other people, parents usually, just say we should force her to eat meat, that she’s too young to make that kind of decision and they would never allow it in their house. But she’s passionate about her way of life. And I’m sure she has a much better, more balanced diet than a lot of her peers.”She admits she found Ella’s veganism hard at first. “It took a lot of effort from us all to make it work. I do feel sad that our family meals out are more restricted, but I am proud of Ella. She is very knowledgeable about food and nutrition. She follows her principles and wants to make a difference. It’s inspiring.”Mac and ’shews “Cheese” made with vegetables and raw cashew nuts, pureed, then baked.

Plant-based sources include wholewheat and rye, but aren’t likely to provide enough. It is found in seaweed, but the amount of iodine varies hugely in sea vegetables. It is recommended that vegans consider an iodine supplement.Vitamin B12 Children may show signs of B12 deficiency more rapidly than adults. Symptoms include low energy or appetite, or failure to thrive long-term it can lead to more permanent damage. The Vegan Society recommends that children aged one to five have a supplement or get it from fortified foods, because it is found almost exclusively in animal products. Other good sources are nutritional yeast, some dairy-free spreads and yeast extract.Omega 3 fats These are important for heart health and brain development. They are found in plants as well as animal sources, but the plant source provides a type of fatty acid which the body has to convert very slowly into the one we need. You can find it in rapeseed oil, flax seeds, hemp, chia and walnuts. There is a supplement containing the form we need, made from micro-algae but as yet, there’s not enough research about whether these supplements work.Vitamin D It is recommended that everyone in the UK takes a vitamin D supplement in winter months, whether vegan or not, because of the lack of sun. But Vitamin D3 is often made from sheep’s wool, and so isn’t vegan. You can get a version made from lichen, or choose vitamin D2.• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3557e125ba3e772f7c63aa4adb245ac97945302b/0_0_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01b2790b34fb571bbe1a2b3abf6a2d06","title":"quiz what kind of a sharer are you","story":"From crisps to feelings, sharing feels good.

Could the answer be to put ourselves out there more? We challenged standup Tessa Coates to find outWhen asked if I’d take on a week of challenges designed to help me open up my life to others, I saw “throw a dinner party” on the list of activities and said yes without reading the fine print. That, friends, is how I found myself running with a gang of overly enthusiastic joggers to an allotment on a dark Monday night, weeding a vegetable patch, and then running back.I wanted to learn something about myself during my week of sharing challenges. Reader, I learned that, while I am too often a cynical husk of a woman, I can be rehabilitated. And if I can, you can.Challenge one was at the Castle Canteen at the Crossway Christian Centre in Elephant and Castle, where volunteers make a free lunch once a week for anyone who wants it, from donated surplus food. Unquestionably a wonderful project, I was absolutely dreading it my catering experience starts and ends at being told off for eating the canapés and being sent home for backchat, while my volunteering experience starts and ends at being told off for not listening during the safety talk – and then being sent home for backchat. I had a heavy heart.To my delight, the Castle Canteen is run by a brilliant lady named Emily, who’s a professional chef. Nobody sent me home and everyone said I did a good job chopping the mange tout. When our lunch guests started to file in, my unsociable side wanted to stay at my chopping board. If I wasn’t there as part of a challenge, I might well have. But I forced myself to go out and find a seat, wondering how to find common ground.“Hello lovely lady, you’re new, what’s your name?” was the immediate greeting. A fantastic woman called Stella had me laughing in minutes, introducing me to a teacher, a musician and an ex-jockey. Conversation flowed, everybody had a story. It pulled at my heartstrings to see people light up with someone to talk to.That evening, I met a group of 30, all running with the social fitness group GoodGym, to help out with a gardening project. You meet for a run, do half an hour’s work, and then run back. The cynic in me was wearing away, fast. Who was I to make sassy comments when there are people out there trying to do something genuinely good?Next, I put a note under my neighbours’ door asking if they’d like to come round for some wine. Not the ones downstairs – we’d had an altercation over a plant pot 18 months ago and no one’s gotten over it – but the ones above. I explained the challenge, which made things less awkward, and next minute they were all round, new baby in tow. Suddenly we’re all laughing at the kitchen table, as if we lived in some kind of Mediterranean utopia.The dinner party, to which I was supposed to invite people from different parts of my life, made me very anxious. I rarely mix friends because I am not a natural hostess, and get so nervous that people won’t have a nice time that I inevitably ensure they don’t. But I swallowed down my whirlwind of nerves, invited friends who’d never met each other, gave them a glass of wine, and listened to them talking while I tried not to burn myself in the kitchen. “Why have we never met before?” they kept shouting at me. Honestly, I don’t know.I’ve realised that it’s easier to roll your eyes at the back than it is to get involved, but not nearly as fun. If we dig deeper, there’s probably something in there about fearing rejection. Regardless, I’m officially taking off my big cynical hat. The neighbours are coming for dinner next week and I might even join GoodGym permanently – you get a free red T-shirt and everything.1 Learn a new skillExpand your horizons by signing up for local night and weekend classes – a quick way to find like-minded people keen to embrace a new challenge.2 Try a supper clubSharing home-cooked food and maybe a bottle of wine with strangers at a dinner party in a secret location is always going to be an interesting experience.

As a family, we’d eat around a little table in a room that I now cannot stand up in, heated by a peat-fired Rayburn and served next door by a composting toilet.My parents were often concerned for my nutrition, and did exceptionally considering their busy working lives. They’d manage to keep the cupboards stocked and cook warming classics from scratch – mince, steak pie, myriad brownish stews. They’d be served with potatoes, often from the garden, and at least one floppy green vegetable.My grandmother lived next door, and as well as secretly plying me with confectionery, from time to time she’d put on a roast. I still have a soft spot for vivid-green broccoli that Gran would boil with bicarbonate of soda until disintegration. Good for soaking up gravy, as well as for dentures.Since leaving the howling winds and isolation of the north for a story of my own, life still revolves around food. It has the amazing capacity to bring people together. Until very recently I was a junior doctor, and I’d unashamedly butter up my hospital colleagues with pastry. The theatre coffee room was always alight with talk of Bake Off and Masterchef, and filled with homemade cakes. It was the pressure from my wife, friends and colleagues who enjoyed my food that forced me into applying to Bake Off. We actually all watched it together, but they felt that it should be me who applied.Since Bake Off, there’s been a significant level of expectation on me when it comes to pudding. I sometimes feel like my wife and I compete in a dinner party league, in which we take turns to host friends in a disingenuous performance of informality.Not that I’d ever reveal the planning that goes into our apparently effortless cooking. But our extensive overthinking hides true incompetence. The construction of a wood-fired pizza oven in the garden over the course of a weekend was one such example. There was the obsession over the type of bricks and granite to use and the clay, which cracked and mildly exploded as soon as I lit the expensive seasoned wood I’d sourced and stacked inside. The result was, at least, only mildly ash-covered pizza.The gathering to eat transcends food, and the drink. I’ll admit that I remember flavours and smells better than I remember sounds or words or even people, but better than all is a feeling of being at ease and in the company of people you like. Following the peak of the pudding, the wine continues to flow. Colleagues and associates leave as new friends and, maybe, with a scrawled recipe or two. Scrunched in a pocket and tossed with receipts, it isn’t the recipe that matters.Makes enough to serve four very hungry Scottish peopleSalted or unsalted butter, for greasingFresh rhubarb, 600g Caster sugar, 150g1 bramley appleDried breadcrumbs, 50gFor the spongeSalted butter, 50gCaster sugar, 50g1 egg, mediumSelf-raising flour, 150g Baking powder, ½ tsp Milk, to loosenTinned custard, to serveI vividly remember standing on a stool to watch as Gran made perfect pastry with her worn hands.Baking was the intergenerational bond that we had between us, and those hours spent in her kitchen dusted in flour are still the memories that define my childhood. This charlotte recipe was one that Gran made to use up any leftovers – and the version I’ve given you here is foolproof baking.Her version wasn’t traditional – we didn’t use sliced bread to line the base and sides. We combined a simple sponge with stewed fruit and it was heaven – especially when warm. This version came about when there was too much pie filling (in retrospect, there’s no such thing as too much pie filling), or we’d overdone it on the sponge mix. It was easy to pick and stew some rhubarb, stick it in a dish and top with the leftover sponge.Gran was a big fan of stewing the rhubarb to oblivion, but this both adds an extra step and loads of washing up. I prefer slicing it thinly, and building it up layer by layer, sprinkling generously with sugar.Start by preheating your oven to 180C160C fangas mark 4. Use an ovenproof dish that isn’t going to leak. Those trendy blue and white ones are perfect. Give your dish a rub with loads of butter, all the way up the sides.Prepare your rhubarb – get rid of any leaves and the white bits towards the base of the stalk. Slice rather thinly – less than a centimetre, anyway. This helps them break down without stewing, and helps in the layering with the sugar. You can also peel and core your bramley apple, before slicing it thinly, too.\u0026nbspCover your greased dish with a layer of apple, first of all, to help absorb some of the moisture lost by the rhubarb. Sprinkle this with a thin coating of sugar, then layer up with rhubarb. Cover with more sugar, and then continue to layer until you’ve no fruit left. Finally, coat with a thin topping of breadcrumbs: this grabs any remaining moisture to stop the sponge going soggy. Set this fruity construction aside.Now, make the sponge. Into a mixing bowl, place your butter. If it isn’t already really soft, stick it in the microwave until it’s just-about-melted-but-not-quite. If you’re snobbish enough not to own a\u0026nbspmicrowave, stick the bowl of butter over a bowl of hot-not-boiling water.Once the butter is very soft, add in your sugar and give them a quick stir together with a wooden spoon. Don’t bother creaming them. Once combined, add in your egg and give the mix a beat until it’s smooth. Add in your flour (no need to sieve) and baking powder, and give the whole thing a gentle mix until there are no lumps visible. You should have a fairly gorgeous, smooth mix that ribbons as your spoon glides through it – if not, splash in a tablespoon or two of milk to loosen.Scoop the mix on top of your prepared rhubarb and carefully smooth it out with the back of your spoon. Once nearly at the edge all the way around, stick the whole thing in the oven and bake for about 30-35 minutes, or until the sponge is a deep golden brown and you can see signs of bubbling rhubarb escaping around the sides. Don’t stick a skewer in, but check the sponge’s doneness by pressing lightly with a finger. It should bounce back at you. If you leave a ot, give it another 5 minutes. It won’t be any worse for it.Best paired with …With its crisp, fresh flavours, white fruit aromas and delicate stream of bubbles, a glass of perfectly chilled Cava Brut Reserva makes an ideal accompaniment to the sharply-sweet flavours of rhubarb charlotte.Made for sharingSharing is in the vines at Campo Viejo.

However, I had not worked with foreign correspondents such as Tom Phillips and Bethan McKernan, whose takes on the election of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil and the war in Yemen combined excellent analysis with powerful and emotional stories from the ground.The format has also allowed us to be experimental, whether that means interviews with external figures such as the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, or spending a day racing around Westminster to give a behind-the-scenes feel on a huge day for news.My co-presenter, India Rakusen, has done powerful episodes: one on poverty in Britain and another on the legacy of the Iraq war, for which Peter Beaumont was able to record for the podcast on the ground.The fact that not many others are producing similar content in the UK means that Today in Focus is inevitably a work in progress in every respect, from the subjects we choose and people we interview to the workflow we follow to get the product completed each day.The overall hope is to bring  stories, told by its reporters alongside their writing, to a wider, younger and more erse audience. And our position, at the centre of a values-based organisation whose global voice has been amplified in the face of political shocks such as the elections of Donald Trump and Brexit, make that something I believe we can achieve.Being based in the  means we can be more credible than many of the websites cheerleading for their favoured politicians, but far more spiky than the BBC. Where the Today programme tries to give you headlines, we want to give you heart.We hope to offer a mix of immediate news stories, looked at from fresh angles, alongside deep es into major, rolling stories. Then there is an opinion section, where we will hear from  and Observer regulars as well as other voices from outside the building.For me, it’s a bit of a dream job, isn’t it? I get to sit in a studio day after day, discussing really interesting topics with the best journalists in the world, and working alongside some of the best young producers in the country to find new ways to present them. So far, in pilots and for real episodes, I’ve been discussing everything you can imagine, from Trump to Theresa May, the refugee crisis to Brexit, plastics to cocaine.And I’ve already experienced how differently you get to engage with your audience through a podcast. Along with Heather, I’ve been presenting Politics Weekly for the past two years, and I’ve always loved hearing from listeners who say they feel closer to my reporting when presented in that way.Today in Focus is going to be a bit experimental as we try things out with format, style and tone. In time, we will find the voice that we believe works best for us and as a platform for the . So please: come, try and (I hope) enjoy what we have to offer, but do also pile in with feedback and ideas.If you give us just 20 minutes of your time, we promise you will learn something relevant, interesting and new every day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e7352fe81fe8b94ef38c981dc64f9d36009a868/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8d39c669e8b33d811017273d213f959","title":"iceland to india global community map support guardian","story":"Our interactive map shows the countries where  supporters are, and why some decided to help fund our workSince 2015, the number of  supporters has grown to include readers, listeners and viewers from across the world.Thanks to their financial support, we have been able to keep our quality, independent journalism open to everyone, free of charge, wherever they are.Our deep investigative reporting of the Panama Papers and Cambridge Analytica scandals inspired readers to support us.

Drawing its power from Simon’s use of the unnamed man’s egotism to take him down a peg, it became a celebrated breakup song.Simon has said the actor Warren Beatty was one inspiration of three – the other two men remain unnamed. In contrast, in this year’s most popular breakup song, Thank U, Next, we know exactly whom Ariana Grande is singing about. Also singing about more than one ex, she identifies them in the opening lyrics. Unlike Simon, her motive is to praise, not condemn.The song discusses the rapper Big Sean, the dancer Ricky Alvarez, the Saturday Night Live cast member Pete Davidson and the rapper Malcolm McCormick, better known as Mac Miller, who died in September after accidentally overdosing on fentanyl, cocaine and alcohol.Considering those miserable circumstances, Grande sounds surprisingly composed.“I’m so fuckin’ grateful for my ex, thank you, next,” she trills on the chorus. It’s a proclamation that forgiveness is cool and growth is a flauntable quality, perhaps unexpected in an era in which dating apps and hook-up culture have made relationships feel especially disposable.In some ways, Grande embodies that swipe-on attitude – she sings the lines “One taught me love  One taught me patience  And one taught me pain  Now, I’m so amazing” with the ease of a hair flip.But the track is more complicated than that. It has a sliver of the dismissiveness of Nancy Sinatra’s These Boots Are Made for Walkin’ or Alanis Morissette’s You Oughta Know, but none of the vengeance. It has the tender sincerity of Carole King’s It’s Too Late but is without that kind of mourning. It is in the spirit of fun female empowerment songs like Gloria Gaynor’s I Will Survive or Cher’s Believe, but with no hint of lingering resentment.Grande praises her exes for the “love”, “patience” and “pain” that helped make her the “amazing” person she is today. In the middle, she teases “I met someone else”, then reveals that someone is herself. The song has a level of resolution and clarity that most people only achieve after a lifetime.Grande lives a life of wealth and public exposure to which few in her age group can relate. In 2017, after a concert at the Manchester Arena, a suicide bomber detonated a bomb. Twenty-three people were killed, 139 wounded. In a statement posted to Twitter a few days later, Grande expressed her heartbreak, writing: “We won’t let hate win.”This September, as she prepared to marry Davidson, news broke of Miller’s death. As thousands mourned the rapper on social media, some blamed Grande for breaking up with him. On 14 September, she posted a tribute on Instagram, writing: “i adored you from the day i met you when i was nineteen and i always will. i can’t believe you aren’t here anymore.”Grande has also faced very public instances of misogyny and sexism, most notably when she was touched inappropriately by the bishop at the funeral of Aretha Franklin. In every instance, the singer has responded with grace, making positivity an essential part of not only her social media personality, but her brand.When Grande offers words of support, encouragement or gratitude, they do not feel like platitudes born of celebrity-class naivete. Perhaps it’s that consistent earnestness that has made Thank U, Next feel like a powerful cultural moment.Joy and gratitude isn’t always relatable, but from the moment Grande surprise-released the song, the public seemed to identify with her position, streaming the track 55.5m times in the first five days and earning Grande her first No 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Despite trends towards songs that are kind of a bummer, it seems audiences are hungry for a tune about boundless, unapologetic positivity. Only an artist like Grande could have pulled it off."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e90719fbbbc5f53a1d21f515b688e14b06158827/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5e4ec00ab99b62501e3e859838ea197","title":"heloise letissier christine and the queens review hammersmith apollo five stars","story":"French auteur Héloïse Letissier revels in joyous reinvention as she morphs from gamine femininity to shrugging muscularity in this superlative live show“I’m still very much trying to be free,” confides Héloïse Letissier, a few songs into the second night of her all too brief London residency. Over two albums, the French singer, musician, producer and choreographer has soundtracked a long pupation, a process that comes ever closer to pure joyous flight.Letissier’s previous tour, diffusing her debut album, Chaleur Humaine, may have involved near-levitation – a bit of stagecraft so good, it was nicked by Madonna for her 2015 Grammy performance. This tour, supporting her second album, Chris, not only reaffirms Letissier’s position as one of the greatest audio-visual pop auteurs of recent years it also seems even freer, with vivid ensemble pieces giving life to ever funkier songs and unbridled physicality. Wearing a billowing red shirt over a black bra, she leads her corpus of six dancers like a horny, six-packed revolutionary. There is a recurring fluttering and rising hand movement in the show, suggesting wings.Those who have followed one of the more satisfying narratives in pop this year will know that Letissier has given her alter ego an alter ego: “Christine” – the nom de guerre she adopted in London, following the example of some inspirational drag queens – has now become “Chris”.“I’m a man now,” she boasted playfully on iT, a song from Chaleur Humaine reprised fabulously tonight. But Letissier really came into a kind of tomboyish transcendence on her second record. Tonight, she flexes like never before, mashing together gamine femininity, shrugging muscularity, 80s body-popping, confrontation and lustfulness. Dancers grapple with one another, and with her, fighting, frottaging, sometimes – as on The Stranger, the baroque synth-pop album closer – in exquisite slow motion.She can even get away with the most cheesy literalism. At one point, between Feel So Good – one of the most dramatic moments of this superlative show – and Tilted – one of the finest pop songs of the last decade – Letissier squeezes in between her static dancers, trying to find a comfortable gap. No music is playing, so the interlude has a mime-like theatricality. Letissier fails to insert herself, then addresses the audience: “I’ve been trying to fit in, and it was exhausting,” Chris laughs. “I stopped trying. That feels much better now.”Although right and proper, the focus on Letissier’s interrogation of gender, and her pansexuality, tends to distract from some pretty mighty basics. All of those are front and centre tonight. Letissier can really sing: she holds notes like a West End star, she trills like an American R\u0026ampB songbird, she raps, she sings Nuit 17 à 52 a cappella and never – even at her sweatiest – hits a bum note. For What’s-her-face, Letissier is becalmed and spotlit, intensely reliving a playground incident that, although never specified, clearly kicked off Letissier’s hunt for an identity. The subject of the song never remembers Letissier’s name in French, it’s even worse: “Machin-chose”, she gets called, or “thingummy”.She can dance, and not like an arena performer who conserves energy by truncating the moves everyone else is making: Letissier properly throws herself about. It’s hard to tell which Jackson she loves more: Michael or Janet. The snappy formation-dancing videos of the 80s are a source of inspiration throughout this performance, and we get a snippet of each Jackson in turn: Janet’s Nasty, tacked on to the end of a rivetingly funky Damn (What Must a Woman Do), one of the most faithful period pieces on Chris, and a snippet of Michael’s Man in the Mirror. Christine and the Queens’ songs might be idiosyncratic, being sung in French and English, but they are ferociously catchy, and show a lifetime’s love of American pop: though she will quip things like “never underestimate the power of a sad French song”, sonically, Letissier is way more American than she is French.It is worth repeating that Letissier writes her own tunes, produced Chris herself, played many of the instruments on the record and – collaboratively with her dancers, (La) Horde – has choreographed nearly two hours of constantly evolving stagecraft. Also worth remembering is all her songs exist in both French and English, and there is a master’s degree to be gained, interpreting the differences between her English and French lyrics. Just one example: on Tilted, she sings about “doing her face with magic marker”, emphasising, playfully, the absurdity of doing your face at all. In the French version, Christine does her make-up with “mercurochrome” like iodine, it’s a coloured tincture most often used on wounds. “Woundedness” is a recurrent theme in Christine and the Queens songs, which perhaps gets more airtime in French. Tonight, though, Letissier talks explicitly about how those London drag queens taught her to make something beautiful out of her injuries. She introduces a Chris song, The Walker, explaining that it is about walking a little further, even though you are bloodied.The stage setting is, once again, classy as hell. A Romantic oil painting of a mountain valley, like Scotland in February, forms the back wall. The band are on wheeled platforms and get pushed around as the show goes on. Scotland falls away to reveal a much bigger tableau of a stormy sea, strafed by lightning, which later falls away to reveal only blackness. And suddenly we are in the realm of shadowplay and chiaroscuro, and, for Goya Soda, the first of a series of health and safety nightmares: artificial snow, falling heavily on the ground, into which the dancers dramatically slide to create gashes on the floor. Letissier and one of her Horde enact a fraught seduction the dancer is so hot that smoke comes out of her jacket. Later, shafts of light pierce the space vertically golden sand falls, piling up on top of the snow.Most powerfully of all, during Here, Chris – now shirtless – has her back to the crowd. The spotlight plays on her pale skin, contrasting with the black of her trousers, the dark crop of hair, black bra-strap and inky mise-en-scène: the muscular gyrations of her back, shoulders and hips become the entire show for a while. It’s a disembodied torso, sensually corporeal, but free of all the tiresome baggage that comes with assumptions, limbs and a face."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3247e33359eda7227ba5c8fb7b64d0f5eb6111f6/336_1099_4969_2982/master/4969.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b30f9a29e9a083238642ea08bdea8b92","title":"rita ora answers your questions phoenix","story":"How to curb your phone addiction?

I see some things and I’m like, ‘That is totally not me.’ You just have to be open minded you’re talking to someone you don’t know, so don’t have any expectations because you don’t really know who you’re speaking to. I wouldn’t recommend lying because if it follows through and you have a serious thing you’re gonna have to deal with it later. I have not done Tinder I just think it might be a bit difficult for me. If I did, my biog would probably be: ‘If you like food as much as I do, let’s go out.’”I want to be teetotal but I fear my mates will think I’m boring. Should I care about what they think? Cheska, 18, Twickenham“Absolutely not! Be true to yourself always. I know it might sound a bit preachy, but it’s the truth. Good friends will support your decisions regardless. Plus, if you show them you can still have fun with them on a night out, they’ll get over it. I’ve done it and it’s worth it for that next day when you wake up with a clear mind and you don’t feel like you’re wasting the day. I’m not good at tackling hangovers, so that’s why I don’t mix work with pleasure.”My housemate urinates in the shower, so now I wear sliders when I use it. How do I tell him to stop doing it without making things awkward? CJ, 24, Kettering“First of all, how do you know that? How do you know they’re pissing? It’ll be awkward for a minute, but bring it up on a drunken night out: ‘Stop pissing in the shower!’ I haven’t had a housemate in a while. My housemate was my sister, so it wasn’t that bad we were really open.”I am worried about the environment but I’m scared that if I go vegan I’ll not know what to cook. Any culinary tips? Pat, 17, Derby“It’s called Google. There is so much out there that’s available to you. There are chefs dedicated to vegan food, there are cookbooks, substitute restaurants and recipes. Being a vegan today, according to everyone I know who’s vegan, is much more understood.”I am addicted to my phone. I need dopamine. Is there something else I should replace it with? Denise, 39, Bracknell“Listen to music. Go to the gym. Music always gives me the best vibe. Time away from my phone is when I’m able to be the most creative and write more. With my new album, I really wasn’t on my phone that much. The process was so liberating and refreshing. It was almost like I was getting to know myself. You don’t know how much of an effect your phone has on you.”Is having a high ponytail as painful as Ariana Grande makes out? Viv, 19, Trim“She hasn’t talked about it to me personally, but it can be. My advice would be to try and give your hair as much of a break as you can. Look after it, try not to make it too tight, put some treatment in it. When I used to clip my hair back I’d put numbing spray on my scalp. When I was shooting The Voice I had four buns in a row and it was so painful. It was unbearable.”Does having a food allergy in 2018 make one more interesting? Gail, 30, Wrexham“It’s a conversation-starter.

Damien, 16, King’s Lynn“Oooh. Be comfortable and confident with who you are. If you are a shy person, embrace it. There is beauty in being who you truly are. Don’t try and be anyone else apart from yourself. I really try and be myself as much as possible.”I want to ghost someone. Any tips? Gabz, 25, Haywards Heath“Ha ha! I’ve been on both sides of the spectrum. It’s very difficult. I’ve never had it done really badly to me before, but you can imagine how awful it would feel. It’s just really heartless. If that’s what you have to do, then it was never meant to be, was it? Five years ago, it was just called ‘ignoring’. Honesty is the best policy.”Sainsbury’s are selling vibrators now. Do you think this is the end of uptight British society? Fiona, 66, Barrow-in-Furness“I don’t think I would say that Britain is uptight, but I do think it’s great that we have a choice. If you want that from Sainsbury’s, at least you now know you have the option! The last thing I picked up from Sainsbury’s was probably a quick lunch.”I still live with my parents. I say it’s because I’m saving to buy a house but I just spend, spend, spend! Any tips on saving money? Mischa, 32, Colchester“What are you spending money on?! What do you want more: the house, or whatever you’re buying? Stop shopping, vaping and drinking. I’m pretty responsible in that department, I’m not gonna lie. If there’s something that’s one in a million, that’s the kind of thing I’ll consider. I saw a beautiful Cy Twombly art piece that was the size of my hand and I was completely overwhelmed. Art is a new thing for me but I bought that. It was worth it.”I didn’t get Glastonbury tickets. What should I do instead, apart from cry loads? Baz, 31, Horsham“You can always wait until next year. Or watch it on TV. Glastonbury was one of the highlights of my life. Being on the Pyramid stage, I felt fearless and comfortable in my skin. It was such an achievement for me. I don’t think I can explain it with words. Is it better than Coachella? Because I’m a Brit, I’m gonna say yes.”My girlfriend wants us to experiment in the bedroom, but I’m allergic to PVC and have a low pain threshold. I don’t want to be a square, but how do I break it to her? Bex, 26, Hemel Hempstead“This is so funny. Not liking stuff doesn’t make you square. Who makes those rules up? If she’s the one, she’ll understand.”Our workplace Secret Santa has a £5 limit. What should I buy Dave from accounts Mischa, 47, Dewsbury“Hand sanitiser, so you can always stay safe. And ... what does everyone use? Lip balm! There we go. I love a product.”I used to love Kanye but now I can’t listen to his music due to his political beliefs. Can we ever separate the art from the artist? Rich, 42, Llandudno“Ooh, we’re talking about Kanye. Look: people are able to believe what they want to believe. What Kanye believes in is his choice. You can’t separate the two, but everyone is free to make their own choices and decisions in the world.”And finally Rita, the Guide would like to know what problem you might like some help with? “How do I sleep on the spot? Like, when you know you have two hours in the day to have a nap but your brain is going 100 miles an hour. How do you disconnect and have a nap? That’s what I want to know.”We don’t have the answer but thanks for being a wonderful agony aunt, Rita!“Ah, thank you so much! I’m here all week.

Sufjan Stevens. When I first saw Regina Spektor I couldn’t write a song for two months after. Our music is nothing like Nick Cave’s, but I always had great respect for him. I don’t think he likes James at all. I pretended to be a journalist in 1986 and interviewed him when he was using drugs really heavily. We nearly got in a fight, and it was hilarious – he was so strung out he couldn’t fight anyone. Then he found out who I was, and he slagged us off! But I still love him, he’s one of the great songwriters.You’re a good writer. Would you write an autobiography?A lovely gentleman tried to persuade me last year but my wife says: “If you write one, everyone will see how mad you are.” I don’t see how I gain from that. I have written a novel about a fucked-up singer in a band who sees ghosts. It’s a ghost love story. But I hit a wall after 350 pages.And would you ever do a heritage album tour?No. I think it’s death.

As part of a major new series, called the new populism, the ’s Paul Lewis describes how his reporting gave him a front-row view of Bannon’s operation in Europe. He tells Anushka Asthana how he followed Bannon on a journey from city to city as he attempted to sign up far-right and populist parties to a common cause in a project he calls the Movement. But European politics are fractured and complex, electoral laws are different across borders and Bannon’s goal of achieving a surge in next year’s European parliamentary elections is proving more difficult than he might have expected.

Ukni is in large part to be ruled by Brussels.”Johnson sought to steel DUP resistance to the deal and to parry Downing Street’s attempt to woo the party’s 10 Westminster MPs, who could determine the fate of the deal in a vote next month.“We need to junk the backstop,” he said, in a speech which heaped praise on his hosts as s of British identity.The Brexiter’s visit to Belfast piled additional pressure on May. The prime minister travelled to Brussels for talks with the presidents of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the European council, Donald Tusk, before a summit of EU leaders on Sunday.The speech, filled with eclectic references ranging from bendy buses, Star Wars, Van Morrison, Hugo Chavez and the Titanic, plus a repeated call to build a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland, earned a standing ovation from hundreds of DUP members.“He’s a very interesting man, though he talks very quickly,” said Sylvia Johnston, 82, a retired farmer. The Brexiter’s visit would stiffen DUP resolve, said Margaret Lang, 74. “The party is fighting hard. The deal is not right.”In the keynote address the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, said the prime minister was “genuine” in not wanting to harm the union but reiterated the DUP’s opposition to the deal. “We could not support proposals that would open the possibility of ergence in either customs or regulatory measures between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.”Her deputy, Nigel Dodds, struck a harder tone in calling the deal “pitiful and pathetic” and said it was not too late for May to stand up to what he termed Brussels bullying. “It is still not too late for the prime minister to change course,” said Dodds, who leads the DUP in Westminster. “It requires strong leadership to stand up to Brussels bullying.”The deal, which the House of Commons is due to vote on next month, would undermine Northern Ireland’s position in the United Kingdom by imposing a border down the Irish Sea and leaving Northern Ireland subject to EU laws, he said.The uncompromising language was a rebuke to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who tried to sell the deal to DUP leaders in a gathering in Belfast on Friday night.Hammond argued that the backstop, an insurance policy, would not be used and that rejecting the deal would inflict severe economic pain and possibly lead to an election and a Labour government with Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister, according to one source who attended the gathering.Downing Street’s strategy, or hope, seem to rest on the possibility that Hammond’s arguments did make an impression, that maybe the DUP’s public fulminations concealed flexibility and that maybe, should May extract a sop from the EU, the party’s 10 MPs will abstain rather than vote against the deal, giving it a sliver of hope of passing.The DUP is under pressure on several fronts.Most Northern Ireland voters voted to remain in the EU. Farming and business groups back the deal and warn of calamity if there is no deal.The collapse of power-sharing in Stormont, now heading towards 700 days of paralysis, plus a so-called cash-for-ash scandal, have badly dented the DUP’s image and raised doubts about Foster’s future as leader.Foster apologised for the party’s role in the scandal. “As a party we are deeply, deeply sorry for the mistakes we made, and for the things we got wrong during that period.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ce91d9b5f56144fa2ca8600b23bf2aeaffec667/0_33_2506_1503/master/2506.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e008ef74c45d55e5447a6168ab68da57","title":"eu wont miss britain after brexit","story":"On 24 June 2016, the day after Britain voted to leave the European Union, Jean-Claude Juncker, Donald Tusk and Martin Schulz issued the EU’s first formal response to a decision they described in a joint statement as “regrettable”, but said they respected.The bloc stood united, the presidents of the European commission, council and parliament said. Defence of its stability and interests was its priority, so any Brexit agreement with the UK would be “balanced … in terms of rights and obligations”.In the days that followed, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and François Hollande, then France’s president, put meat on the bones of that anodyne little phrase. “There can be,” Merkel told the Bundestag – adopting a term destined to become famous – “no cherry-picking.” There must, she stressed, be “a palpable difference between countries who are members of the European family, and those who are not.”Hollande was even plainer: an “à la carte” EU was not on the menu, he said. Being in the single market “has advantages. The UK must face the consequences of its decision”.Two-and-a-half years on, the withdrawal agreement and political declaration are all but complete, and the first phase of the process is finally over – at least for the EU27.A lot on the continent has changed since. Regret remains, but a page has turned.Schulz has sunk without trace in Germany Hollande is no longer president of France Merkel will not stand again. Populist, far-right and Eurosceptic parties have risen (or returned) to power in Italy, Austria and Hungary and made record gains in Sweden.However, in a famously fractious bloc which is often unable to agree on anything much, the common understanding on Brexit reached, very rapidly, by 27 different capitals in early summer 2016 has not just survived but intensified into an unlikely unity of purpose that, ultimately, made the orce talks’ outcome inevitable.Each inidual EU member state may be facing different consequences and costs from Brexit, and each – as well as the bloc’s central institutions – necessarily has a different experience of the talks. But ask for their top Brexit takeaway so far, and the most common response is: EU solidarity matters, and it works. That, and some surprise at the UK’s ineptitude. “It was clear to most Europeans that the Brexiters’ promises were empty,” says Anna-Lena Högenauer of Luxembourg’s Institute of Political Sciences. “Most, though, thought it was just politics, that there was some kind of plan behind the rhetoric.”The discovery that there was not, Högenauer said, was something of a shock. “The UK basically jumped into the ocean blindfold, and started paddling round in circles. It was almost like it expected the EU not just to say what Brexit should look like, but to devise a version of it that would suit Britain.”Europe’s unity was far from a given at the outset, said Fabian Zuleeg of the European Policy Centre, a leading Brussels thinktank. “There was real regret, of course, but also huge uncertainty, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum,” Zuleeg said. “Real concern, if not fear, of what might come next, and of how the process might unfold.“But it led to a quite remarkable coming together of the EU. The key red lines, and the sequencing, were set very early.”Meanwhile the EU, uncharacteristically, was moving purposefully on. “It was an existential moment,” said Salvador Llaudes, of the Universidad Autónoma of Madrid. “A moment of truth. There was an understanding that a partner was leaving – not just any partner – and that how the EU responded would decide its future.”The foundations of Michel Barnier’s mandate as the European Union’s chief negotiator – no negotiation before article 50 no cherry-picking benefits of the single market without accepting all its obligations no trade talks before Brexit – were laid at an EU summit held less than a week after the referendum. And they have not budged significantly since.“That political mandate was established very early, and Barnier has executed it faithfully,” said Guntram Wolff of the European thinktank Bruegel.“He travelled to all the capitals, took on board every view. It’s proved a highly efficient mechanism, one voice speaking for all.”It helped, Wolff said, that most member states were “only too happy not to have to worry about the day-to-day details of such a complicated and painful procedure. They have a lot of other stuff on their plates. For many, Brexit very quickly became a second-tier, even a third-tier, issue.”The mooted extension to the transition period is a new idea being put forward by the EU to help Theresa May square the circle created by the written agreement last December and the draft withdrawal agreement in March.\u0026nbspThat committed the UK and the EU to ensuring there was no ergence between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026nbspBut it also, after an intervention by the Democratic Unionist party, committed the UK (not the EU) not to have any trading differences between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.\u0026nbspThe problem is that these are two irreconcilable agreements. They also impinge on the legally binding Good Friday agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland and in some senses pooled sovereignty of Northern Ireland giving people a birthright to be Irish or British or both.\u0026nbspIf the UK leaves the EU along with the customs union and the single market then the border in Ireland becomes the only land border between the UK and the EU forcing customs, tax and regulatory controls.\u0026nbspThe backstop is one of three options agreed by the EU and the UK in December and would only come into play if option A (overall agreement) or option B (a tailor-made solution) cannot be agreed by the end of transition. The Irish have likened it to an insurance policy.\u0026nbspThe new EU idea is to extend the transition period to allow time to get to option A or B.\u0026nbspBut an extension is problematic for Brexiters and leave voters, who want the UK to get out of the EU as soon as possible.\u0026nbspThe Irish and the EU will also still need the backstop in the withdrawal agreement, which must be signed before the business of the trade deal can get under way. Otherwise it is\u0026nbsp a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspExtending the transition into 2021 would mean another year of paying into the EU budget. Britain would have to negotiate this but it has been estimated at anywhere between £10bn and £17bn.\u0026nbspStaying in the EU for another year would also mean continued freedom of movement and being under the\u0026nbspEuropean court of justice, which Brexiters would oppose.\u0026nbsp“We are so dependent on an open economy and trade that we started work almost immediately on minimising Brexit’s impact,” De Lange said. “We’ve put in a lot of hard work, really a lot, to ensure a smooth transition, no matter what the Brexit outcome is. We’re prepared.”For Germany, said Ulrich Speck of the German Marshall Fund, economic issues, while real, were largely outweighed by broader geopolitical concerns: “Where will Britain stand on the global stage can it remain an outward-looking country and not be utterly consumed by Brexit?”But Berlin’s overriding priority, Speck said, was “to protect our common European space. If we open it up, it will unravel.“Even in countries with governments sometimes highly critical of the EU, what mattered was not to rock the boat. This has not been about punishing Britain, but about protecting the EU.”And German business, with its formidable car industry, was never going to push Merkel for a soft deal for Britain, as Brexiters fondly imagined, Speck added. “It’s quite simple: German companies care a lot more about the single market than about the British market. Germany’s national interests lie with the EU.”“Britain’s strategic error was to threaten the integrity of the single market” by suggesting that full access and frictionless trade were possible outside it, said Lequesne. “For France and Germany in particular, that’s the EU’s soul.”However, Brexit has also had an impact on the continent’s Eurosceptics, he added. “It’s striking. Before and right after the referendum, the talk was Frexit, Nexit, Czexit. It all stopped very quickly. In France, Marine Le Pen wanted to leave the EU, then the euro, now she wants to leave neither. No one wants to.”In Poland, said Natasza Styczyńska of Jagiellonian university – co-author of a revealing report by the UK in a Changing EU thinktank on EU attitudes to Brexit – the key concerns were the rights of the 1 million-plus Polish citizens in the UK, and the UK’s EU budget contribution.Spain was worried about its corporate interests and citizens in the UK, and for the 300,000-plus Brits in Spain. It “deeply regretted” Brexit, wanted a strong future relationship with the UK – but always saw EU solidarity, and the single market, as greater priorities, Llaudes said.Luxembourg’s key concern was for an orderly Brexit, particularly in arrangements for the financial sector, said Högenauer – but like most EU27 members, the duchy was taken aback by the events that unfolded across the Channel.If the early setting of the EU27’s red lines made it “very hard indeed for the UK to get a grip on any part of the process”, Zuleeg said, Britain really did not help itself: “Normally in negotiations you reach a compromise position, then present it to the other side. Britain couldn’t get to the compromise.”So the government kept postponing any internal decision on its Brexit position. “It could not really use its civil service,” Zuleeg said. “It could not – a huge disadvantage in a negotiation – do any drafting of its own, only try to amend what the EU had already drafted. It could not, actually, negotiate.” So the process so far has been determined by two key factors: the EU’s unity, and Britain’s fundamental, and insoluble, dilemma. “The EU forced it to choose between breaking the political promises made by Brexiters,” said Zuleeg, “or incurring significant economic harm. It couldn’t.”It is a view echoed in several capitals. In Berlin, said Speck, there was “irritation and surprise at the chaos” across the Channel. “Everyone reads the UK papers here. We saw it all, every comment, every contradiction ... People were laughing – rolling their eyes – at some of the most extreme, the most arrogant, stuff.”If the unpleasant rhetoric was amusing, the sheer length of time the UK took to publish its Brexit white paper was frustrating, and the ultimatums (“my plan or no plan”) and clumsy diplomatic attempts at ide-and-rule were annoying.But it was the UK’s many and persistent delusions – on “frictionless trade” as a third country on a special cake-and-eat-it deal on avoiding a hard Irish border while leaving the single market and maintaining territorial integrity on viewing the EU as a political arrangement, not a legal order – that have ultimately proved fatal.With the deal sealed on the EU side, Zuleeg said he now expects it to pass through the House of Commons, possibly on a second vote. “We now have to negotiate the worst trade deal in history – the only one that’s a reduction on what we have,” he said. “All the big issues: fisheries, Gibraltar, will come back with a vengeance, with the backstop hanging over us. It’s not over yet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7317967230c885b5db9baf04e23b53ea5b930947/379_145_4989_2994/master/4989.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d72c8187907bced12fdb8a69a8ab8eb5","title":"giveaway budget leaves low paid women worse off ippr study","story":"Millions of women in low-paid, part-time work will be among the main losers from tax and benefit changes that will come into effect in April, despite repeated government promises to help them, a new study of the chancellor’s recent budget has shown.Philip Hammond used his third budget to bring forward by a year a Conservative manifesto pledge to increase the tax-free personal allowance to £12,500 and raise the higher-rate tax threshold to £50,000.Last week the women and equalities minister, Penny Mordaunt, said the government was committed to helping low-paid women. “We need to broaden out our work beyond the FTSE 350, beyond London, beyond women executives and big business,” she said. “We need to focus on small business, part-time work, women from all parts of the UK, low-paid women, women with multiple barriers to meeting their full potential.”Many of these are part-time workers, a section of the workforce where median pay is £10,000 a year, and so below the new personal tax threshold of £12,500.Clare McNeil, associate director of the IPPR, said: “While those on middle and higher incomes are receiving a tax cut and some public sector workers are finally receiving long-overdue pay increases, the lowest paid are not only missing out on this easing of austerity but are actively being made poorer each year by the benefits freeze. The majority of these will be women doing part-time work.“Our analysis shows that the policy of increasing the personal tax allowance to help the lowest paid ran out of steam some years ago. To actually support the lowest paid, the £16.9bn in foregone tax revenue from this policy could instead have prevented the need for draconian cuts to the benefits system or such severe cuts to public services.“In the short term, the government should reverse the benefits freeze, which can no longer be defended. Over the longer term, personal income taxes should be reformed to improve work incentives for low earners, as IPPR’s commission on economic justice has proposed.”The IPPR’s findings will embolden MPs from all parties who have questioned the government’s claims to be ending austerity and helping those in work but struggling to make ends meet.Jess Phillips, chair of the women’s group of Labour MPs, said: “The government is not only failing to help the many women in work but is actually pushing those on low pay deeper into poverty. There should be proper impact assessments carried out which prevent them introducing policies which have such a devastating effect on so many, often single working women, and their children.”A group of senior Tory MPs including five former Conservative cabinet ministers – David Davis, Justine Greening, Nicky Morgan, David Willetts and Iain Duncan Smith – are among those arguing that the benefit freeze is causing undue hardship. Morgan, now chair of the all-party treasury select committee, said: “There are now increases in public sector pay and there should be a link between benefits and wages. We always have to be wary as a party of being seen to know the cost of everything and the value of nothing.”From the start of her premiership Theresa May has stressed her personal commitment to formulating tax and wider economic policies so they help low earners, and to reducing earnings inequalities between male and female workers.On the day she entered Downing Street in July 2016, May said: “When it comes to taxes we will prioritise not the wealthy, but you. When it comes to opportunity we won’t entrench the advantages of the fortunate few, we will do everything we can to help anybody, whatever your background, to go as far as your talents will take you.” She also stressed the need to help reduce the pay gap between men and women."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47abade6e5e2bb107d206d503019614bec2d3fae/0_288_4320_2591/master/4320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4208576fa7d594403618e8a0314fd482","title":"pro brexit adviser admits uk would be better off staying in eu","story":"Shanker Singham is ‘frustrated’ by PM’s failure to pursue an independent trade policyThe man relied on by Brexit supporters to underpin the economic arguments for leaving the EU has said the UK would be better off staying in the club rather than accepting the prime minister’s Brexit plan.Shanker Singham admitted “there’s no point leaving the EU” because the opportunities he had envisaged will have been lost. “The upside and the opportunity … disappears, and you’re left only with a damage limitation exercise,” he said.His remarks, made in an interview before the prime minister announced her proposed EU deal, echo those made by the former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, who on Friday told the BBC’s Today programme that May’s proposal was inferior to EU membership. They follow statements from other senior Brexit-supporting MPs including Iain Duncan Smith and Boris Johnson conceding the same point.“I’m not going to advocate staying in the EU but if you just presented me terms, this deal or EU membership – we’d effectively be bound by the same rules without a control or voice over them – yes, I think this would be even worse than that,” Raab said.Singham repeated his concerns in an email on Friday. “From a trade policy perspective this is a worse situation than being in the EU,” he wrote.Singham was also invited to a committee of experts on trade by international trade secretary Liam Fox — he later resigned to join the lobbying firm Grayling - and controversially held multiple unminuted meetings with former DExEU minister and anti-EU campaigner Steve Baker.However, his views have been rubbished by other experts and his credentials have been under scrutiny. Singham agreed to be interviewed after the  challenged him over what appeared to be exaggerated descriptions of his academic and professional record.He has been widely described as an economist though he does not have an academic degree in the subject. A Facebook profile says he studied law and economics at Oxford. However, his degree there was in chemistry and he completed postgraduate law courses at other institutions. Singham said he did create the profile but had not used it for many years.A biography of Singham distributed by a former employer in the US described his work as “assisting governments in the early privatisations during the Thatcher administration …” and Singham has mentioned his work on privatisations in the 1980s in a public speech.However, Singham’s career did not begin until 1992, two years after Thatcher left power. Singham denied that this could be misinterpreted and said the privatisation was ongoing in nature. He added that he worked on UK privatisation issues, including relating to water and gas, from 1993 to 1995. He said he had not signed off the former employer’s biography.“I have worked hard over the last 25 years to build up a career in trade and competition policy that is second to none,” he said.He said he was “deeply frustrated” by the prime minister’s decision to effectively ignore his proposals. “I see there are huge opportunities and I also see them just disappearing,” he said.He argued that failure to pursue an independent trade policy for the UK defeated the purpose of leaving the EU. “I think the prime minister genuinely believes that her proposals preserve an independent trade and regulatory policy, and I think she’s wrong,” he said.Singham also criticised the government for suggesting Brexit would be painless and without disruption to the UK’s existing relationships. Similar suggestions have been made by pro-Brexit campaigners.Singham is currently director of international trade and competition policy at the Institute of Economic Affairs, a free market thinktank that has attracted controversy for refusing to identify its financial backers.Earlier this year, Unearthed, an investigations unit set up by Greenpeace, covertly recorded footage which appeared to show the IEA’s chief executive Mark Littlewood offering to arrange meetings with cabinet ministers to potential US donors.According to the footage, Singham arranged for a businessman and a lobbyist to meet Baker when he was Brexit minister at the IEA’s offices. They also met Jacob Rees-Mogg with Singham at a meeting in parliament of the European Research Group of anti-EU MPs. The IEA says it observes all fundraising rules for charities and has denied any wrongdoing.Before joining the IEA, Singham worked at another thinktank, the Legatum Institute. He departed after the charity commission required the institute to take down one of his reports on Brexit, which it deemed to have crossed a line into political campaigning.Singham and the IEA both fiercely deny that their work constitutes lobbying. “If I wanted to just lobby for client interests, then I would have stayed being a partner in a law firm,” Singham said.While he has many supporters, Singham has critics who say he does not grasp how tough trade negotiations really are. David Henig, a civil servant who worked for seven years until recently as a trade expert for the British government and as an intermediary between the EU and the US, said he thought Singham’s proposals contained “a bit of knowledge and an awful lot of bluster, lots of technical language that doesn’t add up to anything particularly”.Singham reluctantly voted remain because he thought the disruption caused by departure would be too great. The result of the referendum was, however, “a massive global event”, providing an opportunity to kickstart stalled global free trade talks.Privately educated at St Paul’s School in London before studying at Balliol College in Oxford, Singham left university with a third class degree in chemistry. His true passion was athletics. “That literally was all I cared about,” he says. “I think if I’d done any subject it would have been the same.” After rupturing both achilles tendons (“my body was not designed to run as fast as I was trying to make it run”) he was forced to rethink his future and alighted on a career in the law.His main preoccupation is removing regulations that he says are used as barriers to trade, such as some of the EU rules on food safety, chemicals and pharmaceuticals licensing, and caps on financial services. Trade justice campaigners such as Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now, have described his proposals as “pure shock doctrine”, outlining a neoliberal agenda to break rules designed to protect the public, privatise welfare services including the NHS and remove post-crash curbs on finance.Singham sees it differently, arguing that liberalised markets create opportunity and that free trade can restore faith in liberal democracy. “If we can’t say to people ‘we can protect you from competition that is unfair’,” he says, “they will choose a protectionist, populist leader to protect them from everything. That is why they elected Donald Trump, I think. That is why populism in Europe is so strong. And arguably you could say that is part of the reason for the Brexit vote.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55c1dd1d575f8dee0c717debee4e1a95eec49fdc/0_241_3643_2185/master/3643.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27555ed06367f50a3ff3e1c6bd8b1e87","title":"denisovan neanderthal hybrid denny dna finder project","story":"After the unearthing of a Neanderthal-Denisovan fossil, UK scientists are using groundbreaking techniques to learn more of the species’ complex bonds with humansOf all the ancient peoples that have been studied by scientists, none has set puzzles quite so profound as those left behind by the Denisovans. Only a few tiny pieces of bone and teeth have ever been found of this long extinct species – fragmentary remains that would all fit snugly inside a cigarette packet.At present, researchers have few answers to these questions, such is the paucity of the Denisovan fossil record. But a new project, Finder – Fossil Fingerprinting and Identification of New Denisovan Remains from Pleistocene Asia – which has been just been launched with backing from the European Research Council, aims to put that right and transform our knowledge of the Denisovans and their relations with both Homo sapiens and the Neanderthals. All three species interbred, we now know, and a key aim of the study is to help understand these complex bondings: Denisovans will be a special focus, however.“We aim to find out where they lived, when they came into contact with modern humans – and why they went extinct,” says project leader Katerina Douka, of the Max Planck Institute in Jena, Germany and a visitor at Oxford University.Denisovan research faces a basic problem, however – paucity of fossils. Denisova Cave in Siberia – where their eponymous remains were first found in 2010 – is our sole source, and only a handful of fossils have ever been dug up there (along with several Neanderthal pieces).“It is a wonderful site,” says Tom Higham, deputy director of Oxford University’s Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit and an adviser to Finder. “It is cool inside, so DNA in bones does not disintegrate too badly. However, nearly all the bones there have been chewed up by hyenas and other carnivores.” As a result, Denisova’s cave floor is littered with tiny, unidentifiable bone fragments.“You cannot tell whether a piece comes from a mammoth or a sheep – or a man or woman,” adds Higham. “Only a very few will be human, though they are certainly worth finding – they could tell us so much.”Current techniques for identifying bone fragments involve the time-consuming process of extracting and sequencing DNA. “That takes far too long to be practical,” says Higham. “There are tens of thousands of bits of bones here.”However, Douka and Higham will use a new technology called Zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry – ZooMs. Developed by Mike Buckley, at Manchester University, the technique, which is derived from food science research, exploits the fact that collagen, a protein fibre found in bone, can survive for hundreds of thousands of years. Every major mammal group has a distinctive type of collagen, and ZooMs can read its structure like a molecular barcode, identifying which animal was the originator of a particular bone. This makes it ideal for differentiating human and animal remains.“We asked Anatoly Derevyanko and Mikhail Shunkov, who direct the cave’s excavations, for samples – and they gave us a big bag full of bits of bones. All the fragments were considered to be unidentifiable,” says Douka.The team began to prepare the bones. A 20mg slice was cut from each and placed in a test tube and given an identification code. After three months, 150 samples had been prepared. “That was nowhere near enough,” says Higham.So Douka and Higham asked their postgraduate students for a volunteer to work on the project. “No one came forward,” says Higham. “A week went by, then a fortnight. I was beginning to get worried. Then an Australian student, Samantha Brown, knocked on my door and volunteered to work the bones as part of her master’s dissertation. She saved the day.”Over the next few weeks, Brown undertook the laborious task of cutting and labelling tiny slices from each bone fragment. “I eventually prepared about 700 samples,” she recalls. These were then taken to Manchester for analysis in Buckley’s laboratory. “The results showed we had a lot of cow bones, a few other animals but no humans,” says Brown. “It was very disappointing.”At that point, Brown could have left the project with honour. But she chose to go on. “Thank God she did,” says Higham. A further 1,500 Denisova bone samples were prepared by her and then taken to Manchester. This time, the results were spectacularly different. One bone, number 1,227, was identified as being from a human species.“We could not believe that it had actually worked. It was wonderful,” says Douka. Brown was also overjoyed. “It was unbelievably exciting. We had not only shown the technique works but we had found a hominin. And I had been prepared for the worst.”It was tremendous news for the team. But their discovery lacked a key piece of information. Yes, they had found a human of some kind, but which species? ZooMs can tell only if a bone comes from a member of the hominidae family, which includes great apes and humans, including Homo sapiens, Neanderthals and Denisovans. It cannot differentiate within this group. “There have never been great apes around Denisova so that meant we had to have found a piece of a human,” says Higham. “But which species?”To find out, the sample was taken to Svante Pääbo at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, whose team had sequenced the first Denisovan genome in 2010. Initial analysis showed that the bone was more than 50,000 years old and from a person who had been 13 or older when they died.Then the Leipzig team – led by Pääbo’s student Viviane Slon – began more detailed genetic analysis and made a startling discovery. Exactly half the sample consisted of Neanderthal DNA. The other half was made up of Denisovan DNA. At first, the researchers assumed that the sample was contaminated. “I thought they must have screwed up something,” says Pääbo.But re-testing confirmed the finding: the Oxford team had discovered the 90,000-year-old remains of a hybrid daughter of a Neanderthal mother and a Denisovan father. She was nicknamed Denny. “If you had asked me beforehand, I would have said we will never find this, it is like finding a needle in a haystack,” Pääbo told Nature.To discover a first-generation person of mixed ancestry was extraordinary. But there were more revelations to come. Further detailed studies of the genes of Denny’s Denisovan father were found to contain fragments of Neanderthal DNA. These indicated that interbreeding between the two species had also occurred at an earlier time.At first sight, Denny’s remarkable ancestry suggests that Neanderthals and Denisovans must have mated with each other regularly. But Douka counsels caution. “The DNA of Neanderthals and Denisovans are distinct. We can easily tell them apart. That argues against frequent interbreeding. Otherwise they would have ended up with the same DNA.”Past studies have provided clear evidence that Denisovans and modern humans interbred, and also that Neanderthals and modern humans mated with each. Now, thanks to ZooMs – which has since been used to pinpoint other ancient human remains – there is dramatic evidence of Denisovan and Neanderthal intermingling. But why at Denisova?One suggestion is that the cave represents a border outpost for both species, one that was situated at the very eastern edge of the range of the Neanderthals, who were primarily a European species, and at the very western tip of the homelands of the Denisovans, who were an eastern species. Occasionally members from both groups would have reached the cave at the same time – with amorous consequences.It is an idea borne out by detailed studies of Denny’s Neanderthal mother. Her genes show a particularly close affinity with Neanderthals who lived in Croatia, suggesting that the immediate predecessors of Denny’s mother may have been part of a group who slowly migrated east from Europe towards Denisova – where she encountered Denny’s father at the outer edges of each other’s homelands.It is an intriguing picture, though much more information is required to confirm it. Scientists have no direct evidence that the Denisovans’ homeland range was primarily to the east of the cave, although the fact that their genes have been detected in the DNA of populations in Australia, New Guinea and other parts of Oceania, provides support for this idea and suggests future searches for sites should be focused on eastern Russia, China and south-east Asia.A great deal more needs to be learned about the Denisovans, says Higham: “What was their distribution? What is the earliest evidence for their emergence from the common ancestor they shared with Neanderthals 500,000 years ago? If we could get a bone or two from other sites, that would be tremendously helpful.” One possible source of fossils could include remains of ancient humans that were placed in museums in Asia decades ago. These could be wrongly labelled, and could be Denisovans, researchers suggest. Unfortunately, it has proved difficult to get hold of these specimens for sampling.For their part, Douka and Higham are planning on a number of approaches. One of these will be to collaborate with researchers in Chinese laboratories, teaching them how to use ZooMs, and how to use the technology to uncover more Denisovan sites.“ZooMs is going to be crucial to this project,” says Douka. “We have shown that it is a powerful tool for pinpointing human fossils. That makes it ideal for tracking down Denisovans.”Knowledge of the Denisovan people emerged from studies of ancient genomes, which began 20 years ago when scientists first developed techniques for extracting DNA from fossils and for creating copies of that genetic material which allowed them to study it.Scientists at the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig were studying bones and teeth found in Denisova cave in the Altai Mountains in Siberia, where Neanderthal fossils had been found. One bone and one tooth, they discovered, belonged to a previously unknown species of ancient human.These few fossils proved to be spectacularly rich in genetic material, allowing scientists to sequence entire genomes. It is this detailed information about the Denisovan genome that has demonstrated they interbred with modern humans. Descendants of these unions, carrying small amounts of Denisovan DNA, went on to settle in Melanesia and Australia thousands of years ago.In this way, we can see Denisovan DNA in that of modern humans, though we have no idea what the Denisovans looked like or where, exactly, they lived."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23d5b7aa902c09d127be4b19e856e5698c06b3f1/0_137_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f81db1d43cd675bc3656c51831bfadf","title":"major tim peak reveals what ground control wants in an astronaut","story":"The British space pioneer on what it takes to pass the toughest job interviewThe astronaut selection process at the European Space Agency is unforgiving from the start. On day one, candidates assemble in Hamburg for six rounds of tests that run back to back, with 10-minute breaks in between. All are designed to expose weaknesses in people’s “hard skills”: their mental arithmetic, visual perception, working memory, pattern recognition, concentration, and more. Most are abilities that cannot be taught.“On the first day of testing you are so exposed. There is no hiding place,” says Tim Peake, an army major and former helicopter test-pilot who became Britain’s first ESA astronaut in 2009. “They are analysing your brain and you’ve either got it or you haven’t. I was more nervous about that stage than anything else.”1. You are in a lunar vehicle and have to get back to base. The trip normally takes 9 hours at 72kmh, but you must get there sooner. How long will the trip take if you travel 8kmh faster? You have one minute and cannot use a calculator.2. You are facing a cube that has a spot on the bottom. In your mind, roll the cube forward, right, right, forward, left, backwards, left. Where is the dot now?3. In a group, rank these 10 words from the most common to the least common: of, be, and, a, that, have, the, to, in, and I.4. Another crew member is on the cycle machine when you are scheduled to use the equipment. Do you:a) Go for a run on the treadmill instead?b) Speak with mission control to reschedule your activities?c) Interrupt the other crew member’s exercise session to discuss the matter?d) Get on with something else until the cycle machine is free?5. How many points of intersection do five straight lines have at the most in one plane?6. Astronauts are taught a six-stage process for decision making.

A quick chat with your crewmate will clarify the situation immediately 5. C 6. FORDEC: Facts, Options, Risks, Decide, Execute, Check“People think it is going to be really tough later on down the road and don’t appreciate that the toughest part of the selection is that form,” says Peake. “Some of my friends, who are equally qualified test-pilots, did not pass the application form and I think it was a lack of care and attention at that early stage.”Ever since the first men – and it was only men – were chosen for the Apollo programme 50 years ago, the astronaut selection process has been regarded as the toughest job interview on the planet. It has also been shrouded in mystery. Now, with the European Space Agency eyeing another call for astronauts in 2020, Peake has written a guide to the process. For many, The Astronaut Selection Test Book: Do You Have What It Takes for Space? will be a prime example of Betteridge’s law. The journalistic adage states that any headline that ends in a question mark can confidently be answered: “No”.Some of the most crucial questions on the application form are disarmingly simple. One asks applicants to explain in 750 words why they want to be an astronaut. Quoted in the book, Gerhard Thiele, a former head of ESA’s astronaut ision in Cologne, tells Peake: “We’ve had people who write five pages.” Attention to detail matters, says Peake. In space you need to sweat the small stuff.Another asks if applicants are happy to move to Cologne, home to ESA’s astronaut training centre. The agency is looking for more than a yes. Asking how the agency will support them in their move, and help with any family, shows responsibility and the confidence to question authority, Peake says.Having to plough through puzzles fast ramps up the pressure on test days. One question has a student running 100m in 15 seconds, and asks what time they will record if they run 2kmhour faster. Is it 13, 13.6, 13.8 or 14.2 seconds? The maths is straightforward but there is no time to write out the full calculation: a mental shortcut helps.Beyond basic arithmetic tests are puzzles that assess how well, and how fast, people can rotate 3D shapes in their minds pull critical information from messy situations discern increasingly complex patterns and repeat strings of numbers backwards after hearing them through headphones.“You have to be a jack of all trades, and hopefully a master of some,” says Peake. “You don’t have to be a genius, but you do have to be high average in everything. They are looking for a spectrum of skills across the board.”There is a psychological element even to the mathematics tests. With too little time to answer all the questions, candidates have to make a call: should they finish but get some answers wrong, or fail to finish but give only correct answers? Here, the agency is looking for a balance.“They tend to pick people who go through the entire test skipping the harder questions and going back to them. It means they can prioritise their work.”Soft skills are just as important. No one wants an astronaut who can work out in seconds how swiftly a fire will consume the International Space Station’s air supply if they cannot agree with the crew what to do about it.These are skills that have become more important since the Apollo era. In time, the International Space Station will be handed over to private companies. The European Space Agency, along with the agencies of other nations, will focus on a station that orbits the moon ahead of a new era of lunar exploration. In the more distant future, Mars is, as ever, on the horizon. On deep space missions, you cannot radio Earth for help in an emergency: the signals can take 20 minutes to travel each way.“At the end of the day, somebody is potentially going to have to make some very difficult decisions on a journey to Mars without the benefit of liaising with ground and the rest of the crew is going to have to respect that decision,” says Peake. “Team skills are going to be absolutely essential.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ffc1b03a8d78017847e966f50a989fc1885b11c/0_719_3330_1997/master/3330.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4fde63b5cc03c0ee080511146063a8b","title":"sperm donor man who fathered 200 children","story":"Worried he’d never have a family, Louis became a prolific sperm donor, hoping that his children would one day track him down. And then they didLouis used to cycle to the sperm bank, his deposit in a bag. He needed to make it in good time to preserve the contents of each specimen jar, which he placed in a warmed cabinet when he arrived. In the evenings, when men arrived after work, there would sometimes be social events at the sperm bank, with tea and cake. Other sperm banks – he was a regular donor at three – were more perfunctory, with small rooms for donations and the usual magazines.Like most of the donors, Louis preferred not to linger, but to pedal back to his modest flat in northern Holland and a life he felt was so ordinary that it almost blurred into the background. He was in his early 30s and lived alone, working as a bank clerk. He had no girlfriend, nor any close friends or family.But Louis was on a secret mission, motivated by a deep anxiety that had built as he drifted through early adulthood. Profound questions of mortality were keeping him awake at night. “I had started to think, ‘Who will remember me when I’m gone? Who will talk about me? Who will be my heir?’” he says. “I think our biggest fear in life is not to die, but to be forgotten.”So Louis made an audacious plan. If he wasn’t going to have children of his own in the normal way, maybe he could donate sperm in such quantity that – eventually – a child might try to find him. To pull it off, Louis would need to play a biological numbers game. “If I had 10 children this way, there would be a very slim chance of success,” he says. “But what if I had 100… or even more?”Talking publicly for the first time via a video call, Louis, now 68, wears a denim shirt and occasionally waves his arms at the screen, which is propped up on a pile of books. “Louis” is an alias he has asked to use because, among the other consequences of his actions, he has been threatened. Speaking deliberately, with the fluency of a man who has had a lot of explaining to do, he describes how his mission has transformed hundreds of lives, but also raised questions about family secrecy, identity and the ethics of artificial insemination.Louis was born in the Netherlands but spent his earliest years in Suriname in South America, where his father, a doctor, was born. Louis barely saw him and he and his mother, a Dutch missionary nurse, returned to Holland when Louis was six. His father later also settled there.Louis and his father were largely estranged, but the boy felt a pressure to seize opportunities his Surinamese family never had in the former Dutch colony. Even so, he struggled at school and dropped out of university. “When I was 21, I got a job at the bank and I sat behind a typewriter, which then became a computer, for 39 years,” he recalls. “My father was never able to understand that. He felt like he had given me a chance and I hadn’t taken it.”A broken home turned Louis against the idea of marriage. Had his parents been happy, he wonders if he might now have siblings and closer ties to his extended family. Perhaps he would have a family of his own. He also believes he has a form of autism, which has made relationships and emotions difficult. He says he doesn’t feel things like other people. Romances have died on the vine. He was happy in his own company, but an existential angst still consumed him – until he decided on his unique mission.Regulation of Dutch sperm banks was lax in the early 80s, but Louis knew that donating at the level he needed would be discouraged. (Laws still vary. In Britain today, the same donor sperm may be used in no more than 10 families. In Holland, the limit is now 25. Any more, and the risk of accidental incest is thought too great.) To avoid raising suspicion, Louis used three sperm banks, the farthest one a short train ride away, logging his donations in a notebook he still keeps on a shelf.For 20 years, from 1982, Louis donated as often as three times a week, generally before work. He says the banks must have known he was visiting too often, but demand for reliable donors was high: Louis was an asset. The clinic he cycled to, it would later transpire, had also exaggerated his credentials in the anonymous profile for prospective mothers. “It said I was university-educated, that I was a boss at a bank and that I had no interest in being contacted by future children,” he says. It also failed to mention his ethnicity Louis describes his father as “black and white – we descend from African slaves and their owners”.While the sperm banks turned a blind eye, Louis never lost sight of his goal. He describes it as a train that was hard to stop. Eventually, in 2002, he felt as if he had done enough. By then, Louis was in his 50s and his oldest children – wherever they were – would be adults. He returned to his quiet life and waited.As she grew up, Joyce Curiere, now 34, became aware that she did not look much like her blond, blue-eyed father. She has freckles and thick brown, curly hair. “My parents would say things like, ‘Well, you look just like your grandad’s grandad,’” says the former nurse, who now works in sales in Amsterdam. When a grandparent let slip the truth – that her parents used donor sperm – Joyce, then 16, confronted them. They refused to admit it. She wanted to know more, but had no idea where to begin.“She was a nurse, too, and had curly, brown hair and the same voice as me,” Joyce says. “They showed pictures of her as a baby and I was like, ‘Well, that’s me. Those are my pictures.’” Amanda even wore similar earrings, and had a tattoo on the same shoulder. Two weeks later, Joyce sent off a DNA sample to a Dutch foundation that helps unite donor families. “I was pregnant with twins when I found I had 15 siblings and that my father was not my father,” she says.Those 15 people had already started their searches, and submitted samples. So had Louis. The children matched each other – and him – and the number quickly grew. Louis has calculated his donations have resulted in 200 births, “give or take a dozen”. He doubts another estimate, which he says came from the foundation, that he may have as many as 1,000 children. Confidentiality and use of unlicensed donors means records are hard to keep, but a figure anywhere near this high would make Louis one of the world’s most prolific fathers.For Joyce, the revelation was overwhelming. Yet her parents refused to accept the DNA evidence. “Their doctor said never to tell their child she’s from a donor because it would get them in trouble,” Joyce says. She is now estranged from them. After a difficult pregnancy, followed by postnatal depression, she did not have the time or emotional strength to meet her biological father. Not yet.Four years before Joyce’s discovery, Louis happened to see a TV show called Wie Is Mijn Vader? (Who Is My Father?). “They had a couple of twins and a sister, and at first I didn’t react,” he says. “Then they said the names of the boys who wanted to meet their father. They were Maaike and Matthijs. I thought, ‘Shit, those two are mine! It is really happening.’”These names had meant something to Louis since the autumn of 1989, when he had spotted a document he should not have seen at one of the sperm banks. It had the names of two children – Maaike and Matthijs – and some basic information about their donor: dark hair, dark eyes, A+ blood type. “I thought, that’s me, those must be my children,” Louis says. He made a note of the names. “I call it ine intervention that made me look at the right place at the right time,” he adds. “Just as it was in 2011, when I watched that TV programme.”On the show, the twins talked about hoping to meet their father one day. “I looked more closely, and they looked like me,” Louis says. “I don’t feel feelings, but I can say that this was like an explosion.” He contacted the TV company, and submitted a DNA sample. He got a call to say eight children were, at that stage, looking for the same father. The first meeting came later in 2011, when Louis arranged, through the foundation, to see a brother and sister. “There was no crying, but they did find it very intense,” Louis says. “It was difficult, because I thought they would want to know everything about me, so I gave them everything, and it was a lot. I had to learn to listen. But they were mine. They really existed.”In the seven years since, Louis has met more than 40 of the 57 children to whom he has now been matched. Joyce emails me a list of their dates of birth and initials. Joyce is among the oldest, and was born in March 1984. The frequency of the dates suggests a village school, rather than a family. Children known as I, B, M, K, H and G were also born in 1984. H and J arrive in 1985, and six more in 1986.A few months after her own twins were born, Joyce decided to meet up with Louis. She remembers being struck by how alike they looked. Louis talked and talked. “All the things I had wanted to know about myself – all the answers I had been searching for since I was 16 – he gave me in 90 minutes,” she says, sitting next to Louis (he has travelled to her home for the interview). He had a dark sense of humour she immediately recognised as her own: “Sometimes I still sit with a cup of tea and ask, ‘How did this happen?’” she says.She also got to meet Amanda, the sister with the same tattoo she’d seen on TV. All the siblings describe an instant, reassuring recognition when they first met – an immediate ease a shared sense of humour. This is captured in a striking clip from a documentary they contributed to in 2015. When Joyce answers her door to Amanda, they are wearing very similar floral dresses. They have the same stature, hair, eyes. They head to the park and toast each other with a glass of wine. “To being sisters and finding each other because the universe wants it that way,” Joyce says. “It’s as if we’ve known each other for years.”With each documentary and news report about Louis’ children, awareness of his story has grown. So have the Facebook and WhatsApp groups the siblings use to communicate. The web got more tangled still when one mother was angered to learn her donor was mixed race. She talked to a Belgian newspaper and, Joyce says, a neo-Nazi group threatened to “come for Louis”. Some siblings were against even an anonymous interview, partly out of concern for his safety: “But I think he should tell his story now,” Joyce says, “and not just be talked about.”Louis is matter-of-fact about the ethics of his endeavour. He feels no remorse, but for some the experience has been fraught. Each child arrives with their own story – and questions. Ivo van Halen, 34, learned only recently that his parents had been preparing to tell him the truth about his parentage, until his mother died in a car crash. Ivo was 11, and his father lost the courage he couldn’t risk losing his sons. They had his hair colour and never suspected he was not their father (Ivo’s brother is from another donor). But five years ago, Ivo’s father called his sons together and told them. “We said it changed nothing,” says Ivo, who works in IT. “I felt sad for him, that he’d had so much difficulty with it.”Ivo felt little need to find his biological father until he, too, saw a documentary featuring some of Louis’ children. The story had now become part of a bigger scandal in Holland, after it was revealed that the doctor who ran one sperm bank Louis used had secretly donated his own sperm, and mixed it with other donations to increase the chances of conception (the doctor has since died). Watching it, Ivo says, “I thought, ‘Wow, these people even move like me. OK, now I want to know.’” He did a DNA test, and joined the Facebook group.Ivo has not yet met Louis, though they have exchanged emails. He struggles to explain the delay he appreciates knowing the truth about his identity, and has enjoyed meeting his siblings, but not for the same reasons as Louis: he has young children now, and wants to protect the next generation from the risk of romantic meetings with distant relatives. “What if they all go and party in the same city centre?” he asks. “I want to prevent accidents from happening.”“There are bigger threats in this world,” Louis says in an email when I press him on these risks. “But if Ivo’s concerns bring new sheep to the flock, who am I to protest?” There is some ego in his mission. He is only half joking, during the video call, when he reaches to ancient Egypt for a metaphor. “The pharaohs built pyramids,” he says. “These children are my pyramids.”Louis, whose own parents died in 1988 and 1990, is close to only a handful of the children he has discovered so far. On the day I talk to Ivo, the group of siblings receives a message from Jordy Willekens, who is 28 and has been a member for three years. He has news to share: he has decided to make Louis his legal father. Jordy always knew he had a father out there, because he grew up with two mothers. He thinks their honesty partly explains why he felt little need to find his father. He also assumed it would be too much effort. “If I had realised it would be this easy, I would have done it 10 years ago,” he says.Three years ago, Jordy’s then girlfriend alerted him to a documentary about the group of siblings. “It was madness to think I could deny it,” he says of the physical likeness he saw in them. He got the test, joined the group and, in 2016, met Louis in a restaurant. “He stared at me for 10 minutes,” Jordy recalls. “But it wasn’t awkward. It felt like I had found half of me.”Jordy, who also works in IT, grew fond of Louis. He gets him. “We’re all afraid eventually to turn up alone without anyone to love us,” he says. “I wouldn’t go to those lengths, but he never had anyone to tell him it wasn’t ethical or that he wasn’t alone.”Six months ago, in the shower, he decided to make the legal change. The paperwork came through last week. As we talk, Jordy gets an email from Louis asking if he has shared the news with the group. “He has addressed it to ‘My dear son’,” Jordy says, laughing a little.Louis says Joyce and Maaike, the other two children to whom he has grown closest, are also now in his will. He is not a rich man, but says he always hated the idea that strangers would one day come to clear out his apartment and arrange his funeral. “Now I have three heirs,” he says after Jordy’s news breaks. “Perhaps there will be others. Mission accomplished.”If Jordy now sees Louis as a father, for some it’s not quite as clear. Joyce, who sees him only occasionally (they live in different cities), describes him more as a good friend she can phone for advice. She has lost contact with the father who raised her, but says she isn’t looking for a replacement.Seventeen of the siblings are members of the WhatsApp group. They talk about work and share memes in the usual way. “You can discuss sperm only so much,” Jordy says. “But there’s always a buzz when new blood is added to the mix.” Not that everyone wants to be part of this strange new family. For some, the shock of discovery is too much. “When I met one daughter, it was as if all the energy in the room blew away,” Louis says. “I didn’t know what to say, she didn’t know what to say, and later she told me she didn’t want to meet again.”Jordy’s biological mother, who separated from her partner years ago, had no idea who had helped her have a child, or why. She was initially concerned about her son’s search, but approved once he reassured her it could never change their relationship. Last summer, she and Jordy met Louis together. “I was walking behind them at one point and I was like, is this really happening?” Jordy recalls. He sees Louis as a real father now – just not a straightforward one. What did his mother think of Louis? “She liked him,” he says. “She said to him, ‘We created something really nice.’ And he agreed with her.”• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92e98d54f3d411d57d0cf377abec2a4e3cccb742/0_230_6894_4136/master/6894.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28989466dcc5fb6a68b0d47795909c03","title":"tell us do you work in a food bank share your stories","story":"If you work in a food bank in the UK, we’d like to hear from you.

A sixth successive victory over Australia and a record-equalling 37 points against the Wallabies here meant their most testing year under Eddie Jones ended on something of a high. They were too powerful and direct for an Australian team that equalled their highest number of victories in one year, nine.England have gone back to basics after a five-match losing run earlier this year. Their scrum was a source of penalties and points, their lineout was bountiful and the foundation allowed their back row to dominate and brought into play the ball-carrying power of Kyle Sinckler.Australia clung on in the opening period and felt they should have had another penalty try at the end of it after another no-arms tackle from Owen Farrell, but three years on from their World Cup exploits here, the Wallabies were drained of belief.The Wallabies have lost their bounce, their various calamities summed up in the try they conceded after two minutes.First, Dane Hayley-Petty, operating at scrum-half at a ruck, aimed his box-kick at Ben Youngs and duly struck the scrum-half. Australia were forced to concede a five-metre scrum on a ground where in the past they have suffered a succession of indignities in the set piece.They were pushed back here, forcing Jack Dempsey to remain bound on the blindside so that when England’s No 8 Mark Wilson picked up and ran to the shortside, he was confronted by space. He found Youngs in scrum-half and England had so much time that the scrum-half could put his pass slightly behind Jonny May and there was still no stopping the wing.Australia’s ball retention throughout failed to rise above the careless. There was a slapdash element to their game that turned tackle-breaking forays into attacking opportunities for England and they struggled to cope with the home side’s rush defence with even Matt Toomua struggling to get the ball wide.Toomua’s 40-metre penalty, awarded against Maro Itoje at a maul, was a quick response to May’s try but Farrell hit the post before restoring England’s sevens-point lead after 14 minutes. England found a variety of ways of getting over the gainline through Ben Te’o and Sinckler and although not the most subtle of strategies, it suited a team that is far from synchronised.The first half summed up where the two teams have been this year, a far remove from the contest between Ireland and New Zealand the previous week. There were moments of inidual inspiration, Elliot Daly’s step away from Toomua, Kerevi’s break that led to a try for Haylett-Petty that was ruled out because of a forward pass and Israel Folau’s try after Farrell’s second penalty, surging through Farrell’s challenge and stepping away from Youngs despite a stumble before leaving Daly to pose as a statue.England’s lead, which had looked so comfortable, was wiped out with the last play of the first half.Australia again created space to leave the second-row Izack Rodda with a 10m run to the line and only Farrell in front of him. The two clashed, shoulder to shoulder, and it was the second row, rather than the fly-half, who collapsed in a heap, emblematic of the flimsy nature of his team. The referee Jaco Peyper opted not to review the incident and simply penalised Farrell for the no-arms challenge, ruling that both players had led with their shoulders, but Australia felt it should have been at least a penalty try.Toomua took the three points under the posts to leave England with much to reflect on at the interval after another period in which they played in patches. Their response was another early try, Farrell’s dummy allowing Daly to cut infield and away from a disorganised defence. The try followed another scrum penalty conceded by Australia who were struggling to generate prime attacking possession from the lineout.England started to make their power game tell. Sinckler kept getting over the gainline and after Mark Wilson covered 30 metres, England moved the ball left where Joe Cokanasiga, virtually standing still, left the hapless Haylett-Petty looking for a hole too fall into after Haylett went one way and Petty the other. The wing was denied a second try five minutes later when Michael Hooper somehow thwarted him at the end of a 40-metre run that left three tacklers on the ground.The game looked beyond Australia but Farrell made sure with his third penalty and the Wallabies’ taxed defence was treated to Manu Tuilagi for the final 12 minutes. The Leicester centre was making his first Test appearance for 32 months and a team that for the early part of Eddie Jones’s reign lacked muscle in the three-quarter line had Te’o, Cokanasiga and Tuilagi – perhaps not quite what the head coach meant when he said he was overseeing a uniquely English way of playing.Australia had the final word when Folau scored his second try after Haylett-Petty’s long, weaving run, but they are a team only in the loosest sense of the world, a collection of iniduals. The second half was as impressive as England have been this year, but their next match, Ireland in the Six Nations in Dublin, will reveal whether that had more do do with them or their opponents."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fc09298ffc5e16a2e3b329b543be969b9e3e2bf/0_191_5276_3167/master/5276.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d5d9cc7dd5cba2b52a9b8b0301e45d3","title":"england v australia rugby union international twickenham live","story":"Here’s our report from Twickenham, which bring an end to this live blog after a great win for England. Look out for more analysis and reaction being launched on the site very soon.We have more international rugby union action, join James Piercy for updates as Wales close out their autumn against the Springboks:The Australia skipper is pressed three times on the Farrell hit just before the break: “Look, I think it was a good contest out there today. That’s all I’m saying.”“It’s simple the way we play, it’s direct and we took it to them and things seemed to go our way from there.”80 mins Haylett-Petty makes a stunning solo break from his own half and looks set to score before being dragged down five metres short. The Wallabies do get their try though as they work quick ball out to the left and Folau crosses for a consolation. No extras so that’s it, 37-18 is the full-time score as the conversion is missed.76 mins The pressure tells for England as they burst clear down the right flank before working the ball left. A dummy run from Tuilagi creates space for Farrell and he scampers in and then gets up to convert too.74 mins England trundle towards the Wallaby line again with a catch and drive from a lineout but cough up the ball under the posts. They get some respite but not for long and England are soon back in possession.70 mins Big cheers as Manu Tuilagi rejoins the international fold. Australia are taking risks with the game going away from them but can’t get out of their half at the moment. England have been excellent since the break.67 mins Jonny May looks to have scored an incredible breakaway try after England intercepted inside their own 10 metre line and kicked the length of the field, but one of those kicks hit the touchline and we’re coming back for a lineout.Elsewhere, Sean Maitland has scored the only try as Scotland ground out a win over Argentina. Read Stuart Bathgate’s report here: 67 mins England are forced to do some defending after Haylett-Petty sells a wonderful step and bursts into the England 22. Itoje concedes a penalty and the Aussies kick for the corner. Just beforehand Sinckler’s day came to an end with Harry Williams coming on.65 mins Straightforward kick for the co-captain and England are 17 points up. 63 mins Farrell attempts a cross kick at May safe in the knowledge that they have a penalty in hand after the Aussies collapsed the scrum. Haylett-Petty eventually recovers but we’re coming back for Farrell to kick at goal.60 mins Cokanasiga with a great take and another bulldozing run, he looks set for another score but Hooper gets back to make try-saving tackle. Arguably the wing should have offloaded but England again in scoring position with a five metre scrum after being held up at the line.55 mins Wilson with fabulous work out of the scrum as he rumbles a good 15 metres and has Twickenham on it feet. England work the ball left with Sinckler showing some nice hands before Haylett-Petty is trucked by Cokanasiga allowing the big wing to dash over the line. Simple conversion for Farrell and England are turning the screw.49 mins It’s a scrum deep in Wallaby territory but Australia have the put-in as Polata-Nau trots on to replace Lafu at Hooker. The visitors clear comfortably enough and we’re locked in midfield.44 mins Daly was clearly watching Folau closely in the first half as he runs in a wonderful solo try of his own! The full-back sees Farrell tracking cross field and darts at the number 10’s hip to pick up the offload. A broken field and two men to beat proves little problem for Daly and England are back on top. Farrell is accurate with the kick.43 mins It’s been a good start to the second half for England as they win and dominate an early scrum. Sinckler sparks Australia ire with his enjoyment of that success and there’s some handbags.41 mins Toomua kicks off the second half with Naivalu on as a half-time change for the Wallabies.Pleased to see Peyper not showing cards to Rodda for turning Daly or Farrell for the shoulder. You can argue for both but it makes for a better game with no cards. Though whether World Rugby will agree is interesting, because weren’t they calling for more strictness with cards?Personally, I thought Farrell was very lucky and it’s not the first time he’s been afforded leniency by the referees this autumn, he could have been pinged late on against South Africa too. Rodda’s was probably the correct call.40 mins We’re all square at the half and England have squandered the ascendancy at Twickenham. Having dominated most of the half and been the better side, a moment inidual brilliance from Folau and drop in concentration from England will see the second half start all square.40 mins England are under pressure as the clock ticks over 40 and Australia and Farrell is very lucky not to concede a penalty try with what looked a clear shoulder charge right in front of the posts. The Wallabies do get a penalty though, offside.36 mins Israel Folau stuns Twickenham with a beautiful try that really came from nowhere. England looked well set in defence but the full-back picked a beautiful line and side-stepped two tackles with grace that looks beyond a man of his size to go over under the posts. That is some score and the conversion is routine.34 mins No mistake from England’s number 10. The lead is 10 points.32 mins Rodda concedes a silly penalty as he picks up Daly in the tackle. Not only will Farrell have a straightforward kick at goal but the lock put himself at risk of a card there as dropped Daly back to the turf.26 mins Genia intercepts and you fear for England try line as the impish scum half breaks at pace but his pass is poor and England clear. From the resulting possession Australia looked to have got over with Haylett-Petty in the corner but a very obvious forward pass is finally spotted by the TMO as Toomua lines up the conversion. We’re coming back for an England scrum after getting the right decision... eventually.24 mins Daly gets under his kick and appears to take more tee than ball and sees his effort fall well short.22 mins Australia get shoved back in the scrum again and England win the penalty. Daly can have a go from here, looks like he will.20 mins After a end-to-end stuff to open the game the two sides have been battling out in midfield for the last five minutes. For the first time Australia look a bit more cohesive but as I type that a long, wayward pass intended for Hooper is deemed forward and England have the ball back with the scrum put-in.14 mins Normal service is resumed as England scoop up the Wallaby clearance and force another infringement. From a friendlier angle this time Farrell gets the job done. This scoreline flatters Australia who look shell-shocked. It has been all England.11 mins What a take from May! The wings dashes through the bodies and leaps gracefully to claim a hanging Genia box kick. That momentum allows England to pin Folau inside his 22 and the wing gets pinged for holding on. Farrell, somewhat shockingly, bangs the kick straight into the upright. Missed chance.9 mins Sinckler picks a lovely line and makes a big break into the Wallabies’ 22 but Youngs attempt to gather ball is fairly disrupted and the what looked a promising situation for England disappears.6 mins Itoje concedes a soft penalty just inside the English half and Australia can immediately cut the deficit. Matt Toomua doesn’t waste the opportunity. Very careless from England.3 min England get the shove on from the scrum at the second attempt and Wilson’s quick hands release the ball quickly to Youngs, one more pass on to the right and May dots down in the corner. Perfect start for England and worrying signs for Australia at the set-piece. Farrell slots home the extras.2 min Foley’s kick is partially charged down and although the centre recovers he’s dragged down behind his own line. England have the put-in five metres out!1 min Farrell hoists a high kick deep into the Australian half and the visitors are under early pressure. We’re about to get the teams on the pitch at Twickenham, quick rendition of the anthems and Twickenham’s final autumn international of 2018 will be underway.The Wallabies emerge past the Cook Cup in some garish ‘Indigenous’ jersey. In 10 years time Aussie hipsters will undoubtedly hail it a classic. It’s not.“If there’s something wrong you simply point it out rather than make a West End production of it. ‘He’s struggling a bit today’ is much better than ‘he’s having an absolute howler’. You don’t gain anything from being an assassin.”BBC’s voice of rugby will call it a day after today’s game at Twickenham. Read Andy Bull’s interview with Ian Robertson as the 73-year-old looks back on his 47-year career behind the microphone.Eddie Jones with a nice little breakdown of what England are expecting to face from Australia today:Before news of Australia turmoil came to light, head coach Michael Cheika was in a typically bullish mood.He offered a little dig at his host’s tactics against his side in recent years and what he sees as the way England “consistently target” Australia’s half-backs with late tackles because “they think they can get us rattled”. Although he did at least concede: “They have had a few wins the last couple of years, so it is probably working for them. We have got to make sure we get on top of that.”My  colleague Robert Kitson’s fair assessment is that England are one win short of a good autumn and given the largely self-imposed problems that Australia have inflicted upon themselves in the run-up to this game Eddie Jones could well be satisfied man by the final whistle.Kurtley Beale and Adam Ashley-Cooper are not available for selection for disciplinary reasons, with it having come to light that the pair allowed three women back to their hotel in Newport after the defeat by Wales two weeks ago, one of which was Ashley-Cooper’s sister-in-law. Coach Michael Cheika was informed of the breach of team rules, which state no guests are allowed in players’ rooms, by the Wallabies’ senior leadership group, which includes the captain Michael Hooper. To lose that pair of probable starters was bad, but the news broke just just hours after David Pocock was ruled out through injury. For England, Jamie George has been picked at hooker in preference to a fit Dylan Hartley for the first time in a major Twickenham Test against a leading nation. In another boost for Jones, Manu Tuilagi is finally ready to rejoin the international fray off the bench for the first time since 2016.All of that does mean that expectation has been ramped up on England. But, after an impressive autumn showing, Jones is happy with how the team are shaping up for next year’s World Cup.“You’ve got to have failure to have growth,” he said in the pre-match build-up. “This team is growing, growing in depth, growing in leadership density, growing in the interaction between the players. “What we’ve seen since the South Africa tour is the fighting spirit within this side and that is only going to get better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/162d8a86a1f928bb4c281184f308365460cda86f/315_302_4635_2781/master/4635.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfe2ca5313cf576f51fbdc5a309a6046","title":"magnus carlsen v fabiano caruana world chess championship game 11 live","story":"A few more moves, happening more quickly now: 47. ...

The action is petering out toward a draw. “I’ll take a short break because nothing is happening and nothing is going to happen,” Russian grandmaster Alexander Grischuk says.No real progress after the last few moves: 32. Kd4 g6 33. g3 Be2 34. Bf8 Kc6 35. b3 Bd1 36. Kd3. Carlsen is still up a pawn and trying to convert it, but Caruana is holding strong. Here’s what we’re looking at. Another rush of moves sees Caruana surrender a pawn: 27. a3 Kf8 28. Bc7 b5 29. Bd6+ Ke8 30. Bxc5 h5 31. Ke3 Kd7. The Sesse evaluation engine, running Stockfish, gives Carlsen a slight advantage, though Caruana should be able to hold for a draw. Says Judit Polgar in the commentary booth: “When we talk about the fact that it’s a dead draw, it’s a dead draw if you know how to do it. So you still have to be careful if you’re not familiar with these kind of theoretical positions in principle.”Another rook exchange as Game 11 trudges toward a peaceful result: 25. ... Rxd2 26. Kxd2 a6 27. a3. Caruana has spent 12 minutes (and counting) pondering his response. While all signs point toward a draw, white is slightly better due to black’s exposed pawns on the queenside indeed, the Norwegian supercomputer Sesse indicates a number of endings where white has an extra pawn. So Caruana, with more than an hour to make 14 moves before the time control, is correct to take his time and make sure he gets it right. Another rush of moves including a rook exchange: 21. Rxd6 Rxd6 22. Bxd6 Rd8 23. Rd2 Bxc4 24. Kc1 b6 25. Bf4. We’re heading toward an opposite-colored bishop endgame. Only an hour and a half into the match and the end appears near.The position simplifies after a quick flurry of moves: 15. ... Rfe8 16. Ng6 Ng4 17. Nxe7+ Rxe7 18. Re2 Ne5 19. Bf4 Nxd3 20. Rxd3 Rd7. “Another miserable preparation by Magnus with white,” Russian grandmaster Alexander Grischuk says.Carlsen plays 15. Nh4. He’s more than a half hour behind on time right now.Caruana plays 14. ... h6, which prevents Ng6 and stunts the position even further. Carlsen has spent more than 10 minutes considering his response and Caruana has stepped away from the board. Disappointing how fast this line fizzled out. Barring any inaccuracies a draw should be forthcoming. Carlsen offers up a queen exchange with 13. c4 and the ladies are off the board (13. ... Qxd2 14. Bxd2)! Oh boy. “It’s clear without queens black is fine,” says Sergey Karjakin, who pushed Carlsen to the limit in the world title match two years ago, from the commentary booth. “I think it’s going to be a draw. At the same time it’s not like Magnus was playing for the draw, but it just happened because he did not expect Fabiano would play this line.”Carlsen plays 12. Kb1 after 12 minutes and Caruana quickly responds with 12. ... Qa5. The champion has spent 23 minutes on his last two moves. He’s about 25 minutes down on time already. A few more moves: 8. Qd2 Nd7 9. O-O-O Nf6 10. Bd3 c5 11. Rhe1 Be6. A promising double-edged position takes shape. Caruana moving with incredible pace, clearly still in his preparation, with nearly four more minutes than what he started with. Here’s what we’re looking at. The parallel lines extend for Carlsen’s first seven moves (3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. Nc3 Nxc3 6. dxc3 Be7 7. Be3). Caruana is first to deviate from their Sinquefield Cup game, playing 7. O-O instead of Nc6.We have 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 and another Petroff! They’re blitzing out the opening and so far it’s identical to their August meeting at the Sinquefield Cup. It was former world title challenger Sergey Karjakin who made the ceremonial first move with b4, which Carlsen left on the board for a tantalizingly long time before going with e4.We’ve written heaps about today’s Game 11, Monday’s Game 12 and the prospect of a tie-breaker. But what comes next? Our Leonard Barden looks past the world title match in his latest column.When the match does finally end, the winner will receive the plaudits, the traditional laurel wreath from the new Fide president Arkady Dvorkovich, prize money of €600,000 or €550,000 (depending on whether it goes to tie-breaks), and a guaranteed minimum two-year reign until the next challenger arrives in 2020. But what about the loser?For Caruana, it will not be so bad. Having got extremely close and proving himself Carlsen’s equal at match play, he has every incentive to aim for another title shot in 2020 when he will be only 28 years old. His 2832 rating is virtually equal to Carlsen’s 2835, he can realistically plan to capture the No 1 global rating soon. Carlsen has been top dog in the ratings for seven years and has said that he values No 1 almost as much as the official crown.Caruana will also have plenty to look forward to in his home city of St Louis and for the US team, which will aim to capture the world team championship and regain the Olympiad gold medals from China in 2020. America’s billionaire benefactor Rex Sinquefield, who has made St Louis a global capital for international chess, is always looking for new ideas. Would Carlsen and Fide agree to a Carlsen v Caruana rematch in St Louis in 2019? Giving the champion the right to accept a challenge from the No 1 in the rankings is at least an arguable concept.It will be much more traumatic if Carlsen loses his crown. While the US has other elite grandmasters and rising talents, Norway’s chess boom is based on Carlsen, whose laconic down to earth personality has made him a national hero.NRK makes it a spectator sport. The live show has audience participation, a meter to show the computer odds and a light approach, plus a resident grandmaster. In the last resort it works because Carlsen wins the matches at the end. But if he loses, and has no further chance for at least two years, the chess boom will probably falter, as it did in Britain and the US in the 1970s when Fischer refused to meet Anatoly Karpov.Carlsen would have to cope with his own form crisis. Asked to name their chess hero, Caruana answered “Fischer” while Carlsen replied “myself, four or five years ago”. Some of his sharpness and accuracy has diminished and he has become like Mikhail Botvinnik after the 1940s, primus inter pares rather than supremely dominant. He might struggle to win the 2020 candidates ahead of the Azeri world No 3 Shak Mamedyarov and China’s’s No 4 Ding Liren. Much is at stake. Game 11 on Saturday, game 12 on Monday, and tie-breaks if needed on Wednesday are the dates for your diary.Hello and welcome to today’s 11th game of the world chess championship between Norway’s Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana of the United States. Play resumes today after with the best-of-12-games match deadlocked at 5-all following 10 draws in as many games, no closer to a verdict than when we started. We have, however, borne witness to a bit of history: the longest streak of games to open a match without a decisive result in the recognized 132-year history of world championship matches.Carlsen, 27, has been ranked No 1 for eight straight years and was considered the world’s best player even before he defeated Viswanathan Anand for the title in 2013. Caruana, 26, is ranked No 2, having earned his place at the table by winning the candidates tournament in March. No American-born player has won or even competed for the world title since Bobby Fischer in 1972.\u0026nbspIt marks the first title match between the world\u0027s top two players since 1990, when Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov faced off for a fifth and final time.\u0026nbspThe match will consist of 12 classical games with each player awarded one point for a win and a half-point for a draw. Whoever reaches six and a half points first will be declared the champion.The time control for each game is 100 minutes for the first 40 moves, 50 minutes for the next 20 moves and then 15 minutes for the rest of the game plus an additional 30 seconds per move starting from move 1. Players cannot agree to a draw before Black\u0027s 30th move.\u0026nbspIf the match is tied after 12 games, tie-breaks will be played on the final day in the following order:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp• Best of four rapid games with 25 minutes for each player with an increment of 10 seconds after each move.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp• If still tied, they will play up to five mini-matches of two blitz games (five minutes for each player with a three-second increment).\u0026nbsp• If all five mini-matches are drawn, one sudden-death \u0027Armegeddon\u0027 match will be played where White receives five minutes and Black receives four minutes. Both players will receive a three-second increment after the 60th move. In the case of a draw, Black will be declared the winner.Thu 8 Nov – Opening ceremony Fri 9 Nov – Game 1\u0026nbspSat 10 Nov – Game 2 Sun 11 Nov – Rest day Mon 12 Nov – Game 3 Tue 13 Nov – Game 4 Wed 14 Nov – Rest day Thu 15 Nov – Game 5 Fri 16 Nov – Game 6 Sat 17 Nov – Rest day Sun 18 Nov – Game 7 Mon 19 Nov –\u0026nbspGame 8 Tue 20 Nov –\u0026nbspRest day Wed 21 Nov – Game 9 Thu 22 Nov –\u0026nbspGame 10 Fri 23 Nov –\u0026nbspRest day Sat 24 Nov – Game 11 Sun 25 Nov – Rest day Mon 26 Nov – Game 12 Tue 27 Nov – Rest day Wed 28 Nov – Tie-break gamesAwards and closingThe games commence each day at 3pm in London.A brief refresher on how we got here: Game 1 was a grueling seven-hour, 115-move staredown, where Carlsen nearly become the first defending champion to win the opening game of a world championship with the black pieces in 37 years. The next four contests – Game 2, Game 3, Game 4 and Game 5 – were mostly safer, straightforward affairs where Caruana was able to get his teeth in the match. The tension ramped up in Game 6 when Carlsen was outplayed by Caruana in the middlegame and pushed to the limit before saving a draw with incredibly precise defending. They played to another draw in Sunday’s Game 7, a result that left the champion lamenting his gun-shy play as white. In Monday’s Game 8, Carlsen found himself down nearly an hour on the clock facing a dangerous position as black, until one false step by the American allowed him to hold. It was Caruana’s turn to suffer in Game 9 until he was bailed out by a Carlsen inaccuracy. Then came Thursday’s Game 10, where Caruana found himself on the brink once more until Carlsen overextended himself and was made to “grovel” for a draw.Ten games. Ten draws. Will today be the day that first blood is finally drawn? We’ll soon find out when Carlsen makes the first move as white at the top of the hour.Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here’s his report from Thursday’s Game 10.The 27-year-old champion from Norway, playing with the black pieces, weathered Caruana’s novel deviation from the Sveshnikov Sicilian (12. b4) and responded with a bold attacking surprise (21. … b5!) to go for broke on the kingside and briefly take advantages in position and time over the American challenger.But one false step (44. ... Kd4) while trying to squeeze victory from a seemingly drawish position left the champion on the back foot, where he admitted he was “fortunate” to salvage a half-point after five hours and 19 minutes.“I felt that it was very close to mate,” Carlsen, the world No 1, said of his kingside attack. “The problem is if I don’t mate I’m losing. So I was trying to find some middle ground and my time was running out. I don’t know. I was just so nervous, I couldn’t make it happen. It ended up just being nothing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31d92454bbb5cd3ec0fd42677f16339f7ace333a/0_226_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9bceb65d15852e83cd9ac5b4456177a","title":"wales v south africa rugby union international match live","story":"11 min: Early replacement for South Africa with Eden Etzebeth on for Snyman. Unsure if that’s injury or tactical. Ross Moriarty is off for a head assessment following that big hit in the build-up to the try. A double hit by Mostert and Kolisi sent Moriarty back 10m but Wales recovered and were patient in their execution. After North was held up, a lovely dummy from Jenkins bamboozled Marx and opened up some space inside 5m and then his offload finds a mulleted Tomas Francis for his first ever Wales try. Anscombe converts from right in front of the posts. 8 min: A solid South Africa scrum on their 22, following a Wales knock-on, gives them some good ball with Pollard kicking to Adams in the Wales half. Anscombe has been kicking a lot and big garryowen has the hosts on the march via AW Jones. 6 min: Moriarty with a good drive off the back of a scrum gets Wales some territory and gets them through some much-needed phases. Anscombe then plants a fine cross-kick towards North whose touch back just evades Moriarty. An open game so far. 5 min: Pressure initially relieved as RG Snyman takes out Tipuric in the lineout and Wales have the penalty but Anscombe can’t find touch and the ball is back with Kolbe who looks very dangerous already. Ball on halfway. 4 min: Kolbe has been heavily involved early on with some sharp feet down the right, ing inside four Welsh tacklers. The ball is worked out to the left flank and then, almost too easily, PS Du Toit bends his run to find space around the defence and touch down but his foot was just in touch and Wales have a lineout 10m from their own line. Some team news that went overlooked, Cheslin Kolbe is starting on the wing (wearing No 23) for South Africa ahead of Sbu Nkosi. I can only assume something must have happened in the warm-up. 2 min: Papier with quick ball into Kriel whose grubber runs out of touch just inside the Wales 22. The hosts are nice and comfortable with the lineout and Gareth Davies box kicks gets the ball back into the South Africa half. 1 min: Handre Polland kicks off to his right, gathered by Moriarty and into Anscombe who kicks into touch. For those who missed England’s win over Australia a little earlier, here is a first take with Paul Rees’s more considered report to follow. In other news, Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau is being pumped out at the Principality. Glorious stuff. The players are out on the pitch, the pyrotechnics are pumping out (just as Jean De Villiers discusses “fireworks on the pitch”, nice work Jean) ... kick-off is just over five minutes awayInteresting statistic via the BBC, this is the first Test match for eight years that Wales haven’t started with Leigh Halfpenny or Dan Biggar in their starting XV. Warren Gatland has been speaking on the decision behind starting Anscombe(It’s just about) giving him that opportunity, we felt the players who performed against Australia deserved the chance. There were a few knocks on the door from the players who missed out but we’re in a good place in terms of having competition for places in the team. In terms of head-to-head record, Wales have only beaten South Africa at home four times from 20 meetings but, as a measure of their consistency and the Sprinboks’ own demise pre-Erasmus, three have been in the last four years. Prior to that victory in 2014, they had gone 15 years without beating them.It’s a big day for Gareth Anscombe, starting at fly-half. It’s a position Wales have always been rich in resources but with Dan Biggar and Rhys Patchell for competition, Warren Gatland has some envious options in the position. With Leigh Halfpenny out with concussion, Anscombe has goalkicking duties which appears something of a test from his head coach with 2019 in mind. Biggar is Mr. Consistency at the pivot and his credentials are well-established, Patchell the more expansive and a nice option off the bench for now, at least. Anscombe a combination of both and if he can prove consistent from the tee it *might* just edge him to the front of the queue for the Six Nations. And, as full-time blows at Twickenham with England beating Australia 37-18 (report to follow), time for some Ian Robertson-related appreciation on what has been his final game of commentary... Here’s some recommended pre-match reading by Paul Rees...Just on Alun Wyn Jones, he’s now within nine games of Gethin Jenkin’s record. Which, by my calculations, barring injury, will be matched in their final World Cup warm-up against Ireland on September 7 and then beaten in the tournament opener against Georgia. Here’s the top 10..Scotland have bounced back from their defeat to South Africa last weekend, claiming a victory over Argentina at Murrayfield. Stuart Bathgate was there...So, the updated teams for you...Wales are without Leigh Halfpenny with Liam Williams switching to full-back. Alun Wyn Jones is winning his 120th cap. The Springboks’ starting XV is unchanged from Murrayfield which means scrum-half Embrose Papier earns a second start. The returning Eben Etzebeth, who was injured against England but has been declared fit, is on the bench. If you want to keep up to speed with what’s happening at Twickenham, my colleague Tom Bassam has you covered...As feared, Wales flanker Dan Lydiate has been ruled out with an elbow injury which means Ellis Jenkins wins his 11th cap in what will be his fifth start for his country. 21-year-old Aaron Wainwright moves onto the bench. Apologies to Welsh rugby fans for this sort of chat but at around 7pm, with the right result, we should be calling this for what it is – namely that Warren Gatland’s side shouldn’t be considered “dangerous dark horses” and instead are full-blown World Cup contenders. Having quietly crept up to No 3 in the world (7th at the start of the year), Wales have recorded eight-straight victories (in a year talismanic captain and all-round titan of rugby Sam Warburton announced his retirement, no less) and a ninth today against the Springboks would be the first time they’ve achieved such a winning run since 1999. Factor in the ever-dependable and ever-settled presence of Gatland, a defined style of play and identity, no matter what tweaks he makes to his starting XV, a very winnable group and the sort of competition for places usually only reserved by England and New Zealand. Wales appear the real deal. That’s not to add any extra significance to this game (I’m sure you’ll be watching anyway), and of course a dodgy Six Nations campaign could flip all this on its head, but beating South Africa sends a serious message about where they are right now and where they could go. That equation is as much to do with the strength of the opposition they face today as having kicked their way past Australia in a ground ‘n pound last weekend they take on the southern hemisphere’s second-best team, whose threat is certainly more multi-faceted that that of the Wallabies. Rassie Erasmus’ Boks have been a lot of fun so far on their autumn tour, which is, with respect, very un-South Africa. So often the example of professional, attritional, winning rugby, this team have that with their absolutely brutally tough pack but also possess a backline that can do this. That said, there’s been a fair helping of the not-so good for Erasmus to mull over as they were all over England in their opening international against Twickenham only to fall away in the second half, punished for a lack of execution in the red zone (plus that Owen Farrell decision, but let’s not go there). At Murrayfield last Saturday, the execution was there this time but then there were some alarming gaps in midfield and a lack of concentration in keys areas, such as the lineout. In short: they remain a work in progress but after two years in the international doldrums are back at the top table and are a team to be feared.

But for the first time, state-approved vans give licence to roam Cuba’s mountains, beaches and townsOur campervan passes through Manicaragua, a tobacco-growing (once sugar-growing) town in the centre of Cuba. Manicaragua’s leaves are used for the dense core of Habanos cigars premium leaves from Pinar del Río form the outer layer.This is a true backwater but in the 1940s and 1950s, before the bottom dropped out of sugar, it had money: there are cinemas and rundown hospitals. We pass by the pitched tin roofs of tobacco-drying houses, and see workers in high straw campesino hats hoeing the red earth.One farm is so picturesque I feel an urge to go in. So we do – and have the kind of heartwarming interlude you’d never have on an organised tour. The farmer, Mayorilio Lopez, likes it that we’ve barged in on his day. Born in 1929, he was in the revolutionary Camilo Cienfuegos’ column in the Escambray mountains. He keeps a rolled puro – a pure Cuban cigar – in his breast pocket but not to smoke he likes to chew on it while he thinks. His son lives in … what’s that place all the Cubans go? Miami, I suggest. Yes, there. He forgets things now. When we leave he turns to me and places his hand on his heart.“Have a beautiful life,” he says. “Fight for your life. Try to come back before I die.”I’m exploring the island’s countryside in a Fiat Ducato 3000 van with my Cuban friend Alejo, thanks to a new government initiative under which campervans can be rented for the first time (well, since a failed venture in the 1990s). We pick up the van in Havana and over seven days drive 800 miles on a round trip to Trinidad, the 500-year-old honeypot on the south coast, taking in Santa Clara – a destination for worshippers at the mausoleum of Che Guevara – and a few lesser-visited gems.The camper is an unwieldy beast: it’s a bit like driving around in an Ikea wardrobe but we get used to it. There’s a small kitchenette and fridge, a table that folds out into a double bed and two cavities for up to four extra people. It would be a cosy squeeze for four adults and a child – but it would work brilliantly for a family.At 20 camping spots around the western and central part of the island – from Viñales in the west to Cayo Coco on the central northern coast (but not further east, yet) – campers can hook up to electricity to run aircon (a battery, won’t last all night) and to eliminate waste. An alternative is to ask nice people along the way (or pay them a little) to use their power and bathroom. In essence, no one is tied to any particular place, and wild camping is allowed, though life is easier using the official sites (we’re given a map). Having the camper means we get to see less obvious things than we would on a bus tour. Plus, the $180-a-day cost translates to the equivalent of Cuba’s exorbitant car hire and a bog-standard hotel.One such place is Embalse Hanabanilla, a glimmering reservoir in the northern foothills of the Sierra Escambray, Embalse Hanabanilla, which was created by flooding a valley in the 1960s. It’s not on anyone’s must-see list – unless you’re a hydro-electricity geek or a freshwater fishing fan with a penchant for largemouth bass (it has the world’s largest population), but it’s pretty, with slopes carpeted with thick forest and royal palms along the water’s edge.Near the Hanabanilla hotel – a hulk of pure, Soviet-style ugliness, with a pool that juts into the lake – we find a boatman to take us out around that lake. We climb up through tropical rainforest to a lookout where we gaze, with the vultures, upon its beauty.There is no one on the water apart from the ludicrously well-built Cuban canoeing team, who look bionic. The boatman takes us to a clapboard cottage-cum-restaurant on a tiny island, where we eat a rustic meal of smoked pork and salad surrounded by cavorting puppies. It’s Sunday, and when we get back to our camper, we notice a group of locals having a car-washing party. They’ve driven their Ladas into the water and are cleaning them, swimming, and drinking Cristal, the local beer.We spend the night in Topes de Collantes, the village of the eponymous national park. There’s no charging point, so we stop on the outskirts, chat up some locals, eat some pasta we prepared on the electric hob earlier, and crack open the Havana Club. The air is fresh – you don’t need aircon here.The next morning, back on the road, we pass modest memorials to soldiers of the civil war: for five years following the 1959 revolution, US-backed counter-revolutionaries launched guerrilla strikes, which resulted in quite a few deaths.The sierra and Gran Parque Natural Topes de Collantes, where you’ll find the Caburní waterfall, are a popular day trip from Trinidad, though most people head to Parque el Cubano, which borders Trinidad. But having the van means we can go to the Nengoa waterfall in Guanayara park. The camper doesn’t make it up one particular road – it’s not a four-wheel drive – so we walk the last few miles. Our route takes us through woods of mamey, bitter orange, coffee and banana, shaded by avocado and the royal palm, past ferns and flittering butterflies. Weather-beaten limestone cliffs rise up to a bell-shaped opening of birch trees where the waterfall thunders. We are encircled. We are alone.Heading towards Trinidad, we stop at a rustic paladar (private restaurant) for an early dinner. El Manantial has a veranda filled with hammocks, ferns and goatskin chairs. We eat tasty tilapia from its pond and then it’s a drive downhill, glimpsing the hazy, late-afternoon blue wash of the horizon and the unspoiled forested slopes of the southern foothills.Trinidad is one of the most touristy town in Cuba. But justifiably so: nowhere else showcases Cuban history so gorgeously – from the last 500 years to a thriving (in the case of this town, anyway) present. Casa particulares (private rentals that predate Airbnb but are almost all now on its website) abound, as well as paladares, arts and craft stalls, dance schools and everything in between.I have been to Trinidad many times, so I ask Alian Rojas, a guide I know, to take us somewhere different. We go to a private, magnificent colonial house, turned into a temple to Yemayá, the Afro-Cuban goddess of the sea. There’s a pumpkin in the window (pumpkins are sacred to Yemayá, and to her followers, this is a no-go food) and the Babalaô-orisha, or high priest, is rocking in a chair on the patio, dressed in crisp white linen trousers and guayabera shirt and nursing a cigar. He is surrounded by crowing cocks and fat white doves and is prepping for the initiation into Santería (the dominant Afro-Cuban religion, which hails from the Yoruba culture of Nigeria) of a lady who is lying down in a room next door. But, being Cuban, he finds time to chat, regardless. His premonition-filled dreams and spiritual visions started at the age of 13. His father, an atheist communist, initially thought he was mad. A number of years later, finally convinced of his son’s authenticity, he wrote to the state, requesting to turn the family house into a temple. The powers that be acquiesced.When the heat of the day softens, we trundle down in the campervan to the long, scrubby finger of land that is Península de Ancón, 10km south of Trinidad, where there’s one of the best beaches on Cuba’s south coast. We lounge happily in the aquamarine waters of Playa Ancón and loll under fat palms until the sun dips behind the horizon. This time, instead of casting around for the last of the maquinas, the rumbling classic cars heading back into Trinidad at the end of the day, we are free to stay till the sky turns inky blue-black, drinking our own cold beer supplies.Back in Trinidad, we park on a quiet street of red-tiled rooftops and shuttered porticoes, where we’ll sleep later. We can’t enter the town centre: it is pedestrianised, something which lends it an unhurried feel. The giant, uneven cobblestones in this Unesco-protected town mean there’s no rushing, even if you want to. On the narrow streets, the camper feels a lumbering eyesore. But we are thankful: here, we are just another bunch of tourists in the throng, though it’s been sweet to see some offbeat and unexpected things along the way.• The campervan was provided by Cuba Private Travel, which has rentals for $180 a day, when renting for a week (email via the website for details).

And it had the effect of converting not only much of the UK trades union movement to the benefits of a marriage between social protection and regulated markets, but also much of the Labour party.Looking back, the Lexiters can see what they knew at the time: that this was a fallacy promoted by an isolated intellectual – then president of the European commission – whose powers were waning.Far from being havens of leftist social democracy, France and Germany were moving towards the right to become the main pillars of a neoliberal elite, based in Brussels, that dictated, and still dictates, an adherence to free-market dogma.The introduction of the euro cemented this view. Lexiters argue that it is a recipe for permanent austerity as policymakers seek to maintain the integrity of an internal currency bloc that is dominated by France and Germany.President Emmanuel Macron has proved to be just the latest example of a fake leftist. He has acceded to employer demands for a more liberalised workforce and cut back on benefits. In Germany, workers’ wages have risen for a skilled minority, but the rest of the workforce is being left behind, and those in the former communist east are out in the cold, with few jobs and a fraction of the wealth enjoyed in the west of the country.Like France, Germany is dominated by a centrist government, under Angela Merkel, and challenged by opposition parties that are even further to the right. A move leftwards in these dominant countries is as likely as Jacob Rees-Mogg singing the Internationale.What can an EU supporter say to these arguments, especially now that rejection of Theresa May’s deal is more likely, and a second referendum is gaining traction? One response is that Lexiter efforts to cast Britain in a different light from France and Germany is to deny that they all face broadly the same economic problems. It also denies that voters in all three nations have shifted to the right.The link running from the Bullingdon club cavaliers of Osborne, Cameron and Johnson back, via Blair and Brown, to Major and Thatcher is strong in one important respect: all these politicians understood that voters were unwilling to pay more income tax or share their wealth.Today, most countries in the developed world have ageing populations and are rapidly running out of money to cope. The funds do exist it’s just that those self-same ageing voters refuse to address the difficulties posed by their longevity by handing over any of their income or wealth.Last week’s call by Macron for a closer union between European nations, and his more specific proposal for a joint European army, revealed the controlling tendency of the EU elite, according to many Brexit supporters, and was another good reason for the UK to quit. Except his main motive was to put forward reforms to overcome the euro’s flaws and separately share the costs of military hardware as the bill escalates beyond the finances of any one country.Of course, Britain is outside the euro and could easily take the same stance as Sweden and Denmark: wish the euro members well while retaining an independent currency.As for the military, without going so far as to advocate that the UK throw its lot in with a European army, voters need to recognise that a 21st century military carries an exorbitant cost.Inside or out of the EU, Jeremy Corbyn could meet rising costs – from welfare to the NHS – with increases in investment, skill levels and productivity, and thereby increase tax receipts. However, even if voters hand him the keys to No 10, they are not going to give him any money. That is what Macron found, and Corbyn will find the same.Would the EU elite help a Labour government? Well, however rightwing they are painted, they are tackling the same problems with a closer eye on social cohesion and poverty than any UK government of the past 10 years. And they are still pursuing an economic agenda that is a world away from Donald Trump’s America or any other country that trade secretary Liam Fox has mentioned as a potential economic ally.So Europe remains the best option for any Labour member."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Numbers applying for Irish documents in wake of Brexit vote continue to increaseTravel, border controls and pension rights are becoming a real worryA total of 140 babies underwent therapeutic hypothermia treatment over two yearsEx-foreign secretary tells DUP conference North would be \u0026lsquoeconomic semi-colony of EU\u0026rsquoFoster also issues abject apology over \u0026lsquocash for ash\u0026rsquo scheme , saying lessons will be learnedIrish Rail says trains to depart Heuston and other terminus stations as soon as possibleSiblings recall trial at which their sister\u0026rsquos husband Eamonn Lillis was found guilty of manslaughterDUP MP: Brussels and Dublin must do more to \u0026lsquoexplore\u0026rsquo alternatives to avoid hard borderBoy to be sentenced next year for attempting to murder woman in Dun LaoghaireDodds says DUP \u0026lsquowill be tried and tested like never before\u0026rsquo over Brexit in coming daysFlights resume after temporary suspension on Saturday morning\u0026lsquoViolence against women and girls is one of the most widespread, persistent and devastating human rights violations in our world\u0026rsquoDrumlish native Danny McGee was found unresponsive outside bar in QueensLegal observers believe we can now weigh up the right of defendants to a fair trialNew rules seeking to ensure only bona-fide journalists and lawyers may report or tweet from court cases will come into effect on MondayRegulating short-term lets expected to be \u0026lsquologistically very difficult\u0026rsquo says head of planningSeveral in the organisation who had sex abuse complaints made against them are in prison\u0026lsquoFarmers ready to roll up their sleeves on climate action\u0026rsquoThirty-five years ago, Republican gunmen massacred worshippers at a church in Darkley, Co ArmaghIMO says release of earnings figures are \u0026lsquomisleading and unhelpful\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3709543.1543072668!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"heuston station rail disruption continues after tragic incident","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThere have been  major disruptions to  services to and from Heuston station in Dublin on Saturday  after a tragic incident on the line.

Photograph: Michael CooperPA  DUP leader Arlene Foster when delivering her keynote speech at her party’s annual conference rejected the British government “spin” that the only choice is between the withdrawal agreement or no deal.Ms Foster in her address at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Belfast on Saturday also apologised for the botched Renewable Heat Incentive scheme.In her speech to some 600 delegates she held firm to the party line that the DUP could and would not tolerate the EU-UK withdrawal agreement.It was however the nature of her apology over the RHI scheme, which has become known as ‘cash for ash’, that ultimately could cost the Northern Ireland taxpayer up to half a billion pounds that was most striking about her speech. In an implicit reference to North Antrim MP Ian Paisley taking family holidays from the Sri Lankan government she also referred to poor behaviour in public office.On RHI Ms Foster said her motivation always was to do the right thing. “Some of our past decisions and actions have left a lot to be desired and I know that they have personally hurt and offended many of our members, voters and the public,” she said.In her speech she also appeared to anticipate a hugely critical report by Judge Patrick Coghlin when the findings of his inquiry into RHI are published next year.“The public inquiry has been difficult for many inidually and painful for the party collectively. No party would want to have all of its dealings exposed for all to see at a public inquiry, especially in the unique system of government we have, with the struggles and strains required to make it work,” she said.“But I make no excuses,” she added. “Today as leader of the party I apologise. As a party we are deeply, deeply sorry for the mistakes we made and for the things we got wrong during that period. I am determined our party will learn the lessons from RHI and how government business was conducted at Stormont more generally.”Ms Foster also referred to the criticisms of some of the DUP special advisers over RHI. “We will work hard to make amends and regain the support and trust of those who were upset by what they saw unfolding over the last number of months,” she said.The DUP also implicitly adverted to how the House of Commons suspended Ian Paisley over taking family holidays in Sri Lanka from the Sri Lankan government. “I know I speak for many when I say that over the course of the last twelve months there have been a number of other areas where behaviour in our ranks has not matched the standards expected of people holding public office,” she said.“We must ensure there is no repeat of such behaviour and that those high standards we aspire to ourselves, and that others rightly require of us, are applicable at every level within this party,” she added.Ms Foster strongly reiterated DUP rejection of the EU-UK Brexit withdrawal agreement. “This party wants to see a negotiated and orderly withdrawal from the European Union, that has always been our position,” she said.“We are not campaigning for a no deal exit nor do we want barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and our neighbours in the Republic. The choice is not between this deal and no deal despite what the government spin machine may say,” she added.“The reality is that if we are to secure a better outcome than is currently on offer then the only option is to look beyond this current draft withdrawal agreement and work in the time ahead for an improved outcome.”In reference to how a broad range of business interests in Northern Ireland support the withdrawal deal Ms Foster said she understood how they wanted certainty over Brexit. “But for us we cannot wish away the fact that the draft withdrawal agreement contains arrangements that we believe are not in Northern Ireland’s long term economic or strategic interests,” she said.“In addition to the economic arguments we believe the constitutional implications of the deal cannot be ignored,” she added.Ms Foster said the DUP was a pro-devolution party and had a priority to restore the Northern Executive and Assembly. “I am as committed to devolution today, as I was the day the institutions stopped functioning,” she said.Ms Foster said the DUP would step up its engagement with Northern Secretary Karen Bradley and the other parties to “chart a way forward” to restore Stormont.The last attempt to strike a deal between the DUP and Sinn Féin largely broke down over the DUP’s inability to sell the idea of Irish language legislation to its constituency.While her predecessor as First Minister and DUP leader Peter Robinson this week said that he “could not care less” about an Irish language act being introduced Ms Foster made no direct reference to the Irish language.She referred more generally to culture. “We must be conscious that there is a lack of cultural security primarily for unionists but also for others. We need a new cultural deal for everyone in Northern Ireland that respects difference and fosters understanding,” she said.“It is in unionism’s interests for those from all backgrounds to feel comfortable in a Northern Ireland at peace with itself. The result will be a Northern Ireland with effective functioning devolved government, making a tangible difference to people’s lives,” said Ms Foster.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

File photograph: Getty ImagesMore than 158,000 people from Northern Ireland and Britain applied for Irish passports in the first 10 months of this year.Last year, 163,000 applications for Irish passports were received from the United Kingdom . Of those, 82,274 applications came from Northern Ireland.The figures, from the Department of Foreign Affairs, represent a sharp increase in the volume of applications from the UK, following the June 2016 Brexit vote to leave the European Union.In 2012, the department processed 45,646 passport applications from Britain.

Ms May faces mounting opposition within the Conservative Party from hardline Brexiteers over the text.On Saturday, former British foreign secretary Boris Johnson said the UK was “on the verge of making a historic mistake” if it voted through the draft Brexit agreement.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

We are leaving.”Amena Hassan left Aleppo three years earlier, in 2013, and now lives in a small apartment in Izmir, Turkey’s third-largest city, with her nine children aged three to 23.Today she is at the EU-funded physical rehabilitation centre, Relief International-MUDEM, with her son Hajji who has serious heart problems and mental disabilities.Hajji’s medication, which costs 3,000 lira every three months, is being paid for by the Turkish government, but Amena is terrified that the funding will be revoked.Her family also qualifies for the EU-funded ESSN – a cash transfer scheme providing monthly assistance to the most vulnerable registered refugees in Turkey – but with rising inflation due to the country’s ongoing financial crisis, it is becoming harder for refugees to make that money stretch.“I have a responsibility to my children and life is so difficult in Turkey that I don’t want to stay here,” she says.Khalil’s children and grandchildren are now learning Turkish in Sanliurfa and he hopes that they can finish their education here, but he misses his home country. He would like to return one day and hopes the country will be rebuilt, though he doubts that will happen in his lifetime.“Aleppo was like the mother of heavens. I miss the beauty of it,” he says.His wife, Fayrouz, does not feel the same. She wants to stay in Turkey and does not want to go back to Syria because her memories have been destroyed by the war. Does she see an end to the violence?“Only God knows. We do not have a country called Syria anymore. We lost everything. There is nothing left in Syria. So, if we are talking about an end, it is already here,” she says.Amena Hassan believes that her children would have more opportunities and that her son Hajji would get better medical treatment if they went to Europe or Canada.She has applied for resettlement and is hopeful, but according to last year’s figures from the UNHCR, of the 19.9 million refugees of concern to the agency in 2017, fewer than one per cent were resettled under the programme.“It doesn’t matter which country. I just want to live in a better situation,” Amena says.Her eldest son offered to go to Europe illegally in the hopes of making Hajji’s case known to the authorities and securing safe passage for the rest of the family, but Amena refused.“I said no. I said if we go we will go together, if we die we will die together and if we stay we will stay together,” she says.Mohamed Hamza and his wife Houria thought about going to Europe in 2015 when smugglers’ fees were lower, but decided it was too dangerous.“I couldn’t risk my daughters’ lives,” he says.Mohamed fled Aleppo nearly five years ago on his youngest daughter Tulin’s first birthday, leaving his wife and children behind until he could afford to pay for them to join him.Today, his two eldest daughters – Derin (13) and Laurin (11) – are counting the minutes until they can go to school.The Hamza children speak Kurdish at home and Turkish in school, but they cannot speak Arabic and Mohamed worries about what would happen if Turkey decided to send the refugees back to Syria.“Sometimes I think, ‘why didn’t I take them to Europe years ago?’ Because I’m sure the education is guaranteed somewhere like Germany, ” he says.People are afraid to go back to Syria.Some of the refugees will not give their full names because of the rumours that president Bashar al-Assad is making lists of those who left during the war and that they may face persecution on their return.Mohamed says he has heard of people being arrested, but he is not sure what is true and what is not. Even so, he believes his life could be in danger if he went back.Does he see a future in Europe?His wife’s cousin recently went to France through the UNHCR resettlement programme and they would consider joining her, but only through official channels.Going illegally would not make sense, he says.“I fled Syria because of the conflict and because it’s not secure. I can’t go illegally to Europe, it’s not secure. So for now, I am just here in Turkey and I am already integrated into the community.”Mahmoud Abdel Karim and his family did try to go to Europe illegally.They fled Deir al-Zour in eastern Syria four years ago when it was overrun by Islamic State and in July 2017 they paid smugglers $350 (€309) per person to get them from Izmir to Greece.Mahmoud, his wife Hazar and their six children, tried to board the packed rubber dingy but backed out, afraid that they would drown.“The capacity of the boat was for 20 people, but they had put more than 30 people on it,” he says.The Karims have applied for resettlement in Germany through the UNHCR, but the process has been stopped due to issues with the birth certificates of two of their children, which can only be fixed by going back to Syria.That is not possible, says Mahmoud.“They would kill us if we go back,” he says.“Terrorists are everywhere. Blood is everywhere. I used to keep my kids in the house so that they would not see it,” he says.More than 370,000 refugee children in Turkey are not in school and child labour is a big problem, with many families dependent on the money their children bring home.Until recently the three eldest Karim children – Zahraa (17), Mohammed (16) and Ahmed (14) – had jobs, but now they are on the Accelerated Learning Programme which is funded by the EU and run by the Turkish ministry of education and organisations including Unicef.It aims to get refugee children outside the education system back to school through tutoring and language support.Zahraa is delighted to be in school instead of working – “there is no future in having to work at this age,” she says.Their father is also happy, but without their incomes it is a struggle to put food on the table.“The other day we could not even find a piece of bread . . . I am dreaming of leaving to guarantee a better future in Canada or Germany,” he says.Would they like to go back to Syria?“Not to Syria,” says Zahraa. “We have nothing to go back for now.”Jennifer Ryan’s trip to Turkey was funded by the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid OperationsRead full coverage of events here"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3708504.1543000125!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may refuses to rule out resigning if mps reject brexit deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May took calls from members of the public during a BBC phone-in on Friday. Photograph: BBC NewsPA WireTheresa May has refused to rule out resigning as prime minister if MPs reject her Brexit deal, raising the stakes ahead of a summit in Brussels on Sunday where European Union leaders are expected to approve it. Asked three times during a BBC phone-in on Friday, the prime minister repeatedly declined to say she would carry on in Number 10 if the deal is voted down in parliament.“I am focused on ensuring we get this deal. I believe it’s the right deal for the UK. As I’m sitting here I am not thinking about me but getting a deal for this country. That’s what drives me,” she said.“I am going to be around the country, explaining the deal up and down the country. I think this is important. It’s not just about MPs it’s about people understanding what the country is about.”\u0026nbspMore than 80 Conservative backbenchers have indicated that they could vote against the deal, as have the DUP’s 10 MPs who want the prime minister to scrap the Northern Ireland backstop. Dominic Raab, who resigned as Brexit secretary last week, said Mrs May’s proposals were worse than remaining in the EU.“I’m not going to advocate staying in the EU. But, if you just presented me terms, this deal or EU membership, because we would effectively be bound by the same rules but without the control or voice over them, yes, I think this would be even worse than that,” he told the BBC.The prime minister said he believed her deal was a good one for Britain and that it ensured that the country’s future would be in its own hands. She said that if MPs rejected the deal in a “meaningful vote” next month, there would be little point in returning to Brussels seeking to renegotiate it. “I don’t think they will come to us and say we’ll get a better deal. I’m making sure we get this through parliament. If we don’t, what we will see is more ision and uncertainty. My focus, all my focus, is getting . . . we’ve got to finalise the deal on Sunday but beyond that it’s getting the vote through,” she said.Mrs May said she would travel around Britain in the coming weeks to take her case for the Brexit deal directly to the people beyond Westminster. Downing Street is working to persuade MPs at Westminster too and some reacted cynically to the news that John Hayes, a Brexiteer who is backing the deal, is to be knighted.Downing Street dismissed speculation that, if the deal is voted down next month, MPs could be asked to vote again as the United States Congress did 10 years ago on the Tarp bank rescue deal, which passed on the second vote. Mrs May declined to say what her Plan B is if the deal is rejected, describing her job as persuading people it is a good deal.\u0026nbsp“The job of an MP is to say to themselves: ‘Does this deliver on what people voted for?’ And I believe it does deliver . . . this should be at the forefront of people’s minds,” she said."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

2017 | Terror attacks in the UK“We are also ensuring technology companies play their part by stopping terrorists from exploiting their platforms,” he said.In its report yesterday on the terrorist attacks, the ISC revealed an MI5 assessment showed “almost all attack planners downloaded, shared or consumed radical and extremist media of some kind.”Salman Abedi, the Manchester Arena bomber who killed 22 people including children, had also been able to manufacture his improvised explosive devices from online videos.“Action that affects their profits hits home harder than any sense of ‘doing the right thing’, and it is this that the Government should focus its efforts on.The committee highlighted cases where tech firms had refused to remove extremist content or co-operate despite Government requests, often citing the right of their customers to privacy as “trumping other considerations.”In one, an unnamed tech firm claimed the “violent and disturbing images” linked back to an academic site and to remove it “would compromise the quality of analysis the site owner provides.” Another refused to take down the website of a banned terrorist group.WhatsApp cited its “end to end encryption” for not revealing to police the final messages of  Westminster attacker Khalid Masood who stabbed PC Keith Palmer to death.The committee said it had been among the first to castigate the social media firms for failing to be more proactive in hunting down and removing extremist material rather than relying on users, organisations or police to alert them to it.But that was, four years ago after the terrorist murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby.Although the firms have hired more moderators to assess material, the committee was frustrated that they continued in many cases to be used as a “safe haven” for extremists and terrorists.Searching the internet for “how to make a bomb” returned almost 2m results and a search for “beheading video” returned 250,000 hits in a study five years ago - and it was likely to have increased since.Although the tech firms were developing algorithms to track down terrorist material and alert police to it, the MPs said: “It is disappointing that - despite a great deal of engagement - little tangible progress has been made in the four years...and the scale of the challenge remains significant.”The criticism was backed last night by Yvette Cooper, chair of the home affairs select committee, who this week wrote to Twitter, demanding to know why extremist material from a proscribed far right group was still available on its site.“It is frankly outrageous that these internet giants continue to profit off dangerous content, which we know can have fatal consequences,” she told The Daily .“These companies have been asked repeatedly to develop better systems to remove illegal material and have failed to do so. It is not good enough.”“Given the vast scale of this content, law enforcement and intelligence agencies are simply not equipped to tackle this issue alone. Social media companies must immediately take responsibility for dealing with extremist and illegal materials on their sites.”Senior counter terror officers said they had struggled to get quality data out of the tech giants for years. “They simply don’t get it, so to take action that affects their advertising revenues would be the best thing to do,” said one ex-counter terror chief.Brexit latest news: Spain and Britain reach deal with EU on Gibraltar - live updatesBoris Johnson: Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit deal is like the Titanic - and there\u0026#39s an iceberg right aheadTijuana authorities seek help as sickness spreads through migrant campComment: We must pray Matthew Hedges is victim of cock-up, not conspiracy, in the EmiratesFears for Brazil\u0026#39s healthcare system as Bolsonaro sends Cuba\u0026#39s white coat diplomacy packingTradition locks horns with health and safety in crunch Swiss vote to save iconic image of cowsGovernment accused of massaging immigration statistics in run up to Brexit voteDriverless cars to be tested in London ahead of launch this ChristmasComment: This is a calamitous, cowardly Brexit deal - and we\u0026#39re now being shafted for it by the EUDual nationality Turks being stripped of citizenship by far-Right in Austria\u0026#39s \u0026#39Windrush\u0026#39 scandalWhat it\u0026#39s like to be dragged through UAE\u0026#39s cloak and dagger legal system and dumped in prisonComment: Why a \u0026#39sunset clause\u0026#39 could restore the near total collapse of trust in the Brexit processComment: Is the UK at last turning into a tough adversary on Brexit - or is it all just an accident?Lengthy school reports are \u0026#39burdensome\u0026#39 for teachers and should move to shorter versions, panel concludesCauliflower, Guinness and a hot bath - how BBC German Service waged a propaganda war in WW2Cookery programmes must do more to save the curry trade, Asian food champion saysGermany \u0026#39refuses\u0026#39 to help trace Nazi-looted £3.5m Edgar Degas paintingTheresa May an \u0026#39incompetent arch Remainer\u0026#39 who is bungling Brexit, says former Tory donorWhat is the Brexit deal, and what will happen after Parliament votes?Theresa May\u0026#39s draft Brexit withdrawal agreement - read in fullVote of no confidence in Theresa May: How is it triggered and what is the role of the 1922 Committee?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/11/23/TELEMMGLPICT000181399392_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq1wRt9OKUQdm3ozQDx50efXTVJoqefb4nODplG_f3HAY.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"inside north korea hidden aid packages belie kim jong uns promise","story":"Cha Song-Chol, supervisor at North Korea\u0026#39s Children\u0026#39s Foodstuffs factory, which is playing a vital role in the effort to alleviate child malnutritionThe Children’s Foodstuffs factory in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, has a proud tradition of nourishing generations of the country’s children with its fresh and powdered milk and delicious soybean yogurt drinks.Every morning at 7am, dozens of delivery vans set out from its regional branches to deliver nutritional products to thousands of kindergartens.

The move was seen as an attempt by the Prime Minister to win support among Eurosceptic Tory MPs in the run up to the Brexit vote.But, immigration experts and campaigners yesterday warned that the proposals would mean that those arriving under the 11-month visa would not be counted as immigrants.Leaked Cabinet papers reveal Home Office plans for a new 11-month low-skilled migrant visaJonathan Portes, professor of economics and economics and public policy at King’s College, London, said: “In theory these people coming into the UK under this visa would not be immigrants and would not be counted as immigrants.“I would call it a pretty transparent attempt to massage the immigration figures.”Immigration statistics are based on the International Passenger Survey in which up to 800,000 people arriving and leaving the UK each year are asked a series of questions, including how long they intend to stay or have stayed in the country. The results are used by a number of Government departments and contribute to the official statistics on the number of immigrants coming to the UK.While anyone remaining longer than 12 months is deemed an immigrant, someone staying 11-months or fewer would be classes as staying a “short term” and so not ratchet up the official immigration figures.“If you’re coming to the country for more than one year then you count as a migrant,” Professor Portes continued. “But, if you say you’re on an 11-month visa then you are not recorded as an immigrant.”Sunder Katwala, the director of British Future, a think-tank specialising in integration and migration issues, said the Government’s decision to cap migration for low-skilled workers at 11-months raised questions about the motives, particularly because trust surrounding immigration is currently so “low”.In a tweet he asked: “Was the main reason that you chose 11 months visas, not 12, because 12 months counts in immigration stats, while 11 months is immigration that you don’t count?It is understood the proposals will be part of the Government’s long awaited migration White Paper due to be unveiled in the week beginning December 3.It is anticipated that Mrs May will then try to frame the Brexit debate around migration, claiming her EU deal fulfils the referendum pledge of taking back control of UK borders.It is thought that the proposed 11-month visa for low-skilled workers would help to ensure that a post-Brexit Britain would be able to maintain and control a workforce in a variety of sectors that rely on short-term contract employees.  Boris Johnson: Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit deal is like the Titanic - and there\u0026#39s an iceberg right aheadBrexit latest news: Spain and Britain reach deal with EU on Gibraltar - live updatesTijuana authorities seek help as sickness spreads through migrant campComment: We must pray Matthew Hedges is victim of cock-up, not conspiracy, in the EmiratesFears for Brazil\u0026#39s healthcare system as Bolsonaro sends Cuba\u0026#39s white coat diplomacy packingTradition locks horns with health and safety in crunch Swiss vote to save iconic image of cowsDriverless cars to be tested in London ahead of launch this ChristmasComment: This is a calamitous, cowardly Brexit deal - and we\u0026#39re now being shafted for it by the EUDual nationality Turks being stripped of citizenship by far-Right in Austria\u0026#39s \u0026#39Windrush\u0026#39 scandalWhat it\u0026#39s like to be dragged through UAE\u0026#39s cloak and dagger legal system and dumped in prisonComment: Why a \u0026#39sunset clause\u0026#39 could restore the near total collapse of trust in the Brexit processComment: Is the UK at last turning into a tough adversary on Brexit - or is it all just an accident?Lengthy school reports are \u0026#39burdensome\u0026#39 for teachers and should move to shorter versions, panel concludesCauliflower, Guinness and a hot bath - how BBC German Service waged a propaganda war in WW2Cookery programmes must do more to save the curry trade, Asian food champion saysGermany \u0026#39refuses\u0026#39 to help trace Nazi-looted £3.5m Edgar Degas paintingTheresa May an \u0026#39incompetent arch Remainer\u0026#39 who is bungling Brexit, says former Tory donorWhat is the Brexit deal, and what will happen after Parliament votes?Theresa May\u0026#39s draft Brexit withdrawal agreement - read in fullVote of no confidence in Theresa May: How is it triggered and what is the role of the 1922 Committee?Brexit explained: All your questions answered about the UK leaving the EU  We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/11/24/TELEMMGLPICT000159951338_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"lengthy school reports burdensome teachers should move shorter","story":"The move to shorter school reports risks prompting anger among parents. In recent years school reports have been criticised by both parents and some teachers for being \u0026#39impersonal\u0026#39.Department for EducationLengthy school reports are “incredibly burdensome” for teachers and should be replaced with shorter versions, a Government advisory panel has concluded.A review commissioned by Damian Hinds, the Education Secretary, found “limited evidence” for the benefits of progress reports that go beyond the “relatively lean” basic requirements imposed on schools.It also suggested expanding the use of “automatic reporting” to parents - currently used by some schools to flag up a child’s absence.Mr Hinds’s department has now pledged to review national guidance on school reports, suggesting it could be altered to warn teachers against sending long updates to parents and s.However the move risks prompting anger among parents. In recent years school reports have been criticised by both parents and some teachers for being “impersonal” and even “robotic”.The review by the government’s Teacher Workload Advisory Group, which comprises several headteachers as well as Whitehall and trade union officials, recognised that parents’ involvement with their children’s education is “consistently associated with better pupil performance.”“Lengthy written reports to parents and carers are usually burdensome for teachers to produce, and there is insufficient evidence to suggest that this is the best or only way to engage parents and carers in education.“Schools should remember that the statutory duties on what schools must report to parents and carers are relatively lean, and that there is limited evidence of impact for producing written reports that go beyond these.”The panel, chaired by Becky Allen, director of University College London\u0027s Centre for Education Improvement Science, continued: School and trust leaders should review their approach to producing the annual written report, to inform parents and carers of their child’s performance and behaviour at school in a way that is manageable for teachers.The 18-strong panel also included four senior civil servants, including the education director of Ofsted, the regulator, five headteachers, and the heads of the  Association of School and College Leaders and  National Association of Head Teachers.The report cites the network of Ark academies as an example of institutions that have relieved pressure on teachers by sending automatic notifications to parents whose children are absent from school, including about the consequences of their absence.In one school, this replaced a paper-based process requiring input of five members of staff which took the equivalent of an entire school day to complete, the report states.Bernadette John, director of The Good Schools Guide education consultants, said reports offered an opportunity for parents and s to gain a better understanding as to how a child is doing at school and could give the first indications that things are not going to plan.However, while the consultants often hear complaints about computer generated school reports and \u0027cut and paste\u0027 jobs, well-written reports could give a clear indication of a pupil\u0027s capability and application in just a few sentences, she added.Department for EducationPlease review our commenting policyBoris Johnson: Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit deal is like the Titanic - and there\u0026#39s an iceberg right aheadBrexit latest news: Spain and Britain reach deal with EU on Gibraltar - live updatesTijuana authorities seek help as sickness spreads through migrant campComment: We must pray Matthew Hedges is victim of cock-up, not conspiracy, in the EmiratesFears for Brazil\u0026#39s healthcare system as Bolsonaro sends Cuba\u0026#39s white coat diplomacy packingTradition locks horns with health and safety in crunch Swiss vote to save iconic image of cowsGovernment accused of massaging immigration statistics in run up to Brexit voteDriverless cars to be tested in London ahead of launch this ChristmasComment: This is a calamitous, cowardly Brexit deal - and we\u0026#39re now being shafted for it by the EUDual nationality Turks being stripped of citizenship by far-Right in Austria\u0026#39s \u0026#39Windrush\u0026#39 scandalWhat it\u0026#39s like to be dragged through UAE\u0026#39s cloak and dagger legal system and dumped in prisonComment: Why a \u0026#39sunset clause\u0026#39 could restore the near total collapse of trust in the Brexit processComment: Is the UK at last turning into a tough adversary on Brexit - or is it all just an accident?Cauliflower, Guinness and a hot bath - how BBC German Service waged a propaganda war in WW2Cookery programmes must do more to save the curry trade, Asian food champion saysGermany \u0026#39refuses\u0026#39 to help trace Nazi-looted £3.5m Edgar Degas paintingTheresa May an \u0026#39incompetent arch Remainer\u0026#39 who is bungling Brexit, says former Tory donorWhat is the Brexit deal, and what will happen after Parliament votes?Theresa May\u0026#39s draft Brexit withdrawal agreement - read in fullVote of no confidence in Theresa May: How is it triggered and what is the role of the 1922 Committee?Brexit explained: All your questions answered about the UK leaving the EU  We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 24 november 2018","story":"Aston the bull with his owner Sabine Rouas,43.

It’s part of our image.”Yet three-quarters of Swiss cows are dehorned or genetically hornless.Armin Capaul, 66, has seen his obscure campaign gain national momentumArmin Capaul, 66, a well-known anti-establishment farmer who first mooted the idea for the referendum on preserving the “dignity of livestock” eight years ago, insisted hornless cows had low morale.“We must respect cows as they are. Leave them their horns. When you look at them they always hold their head high and are proud. When you remove the horns, they are sad,” he said from his small farm in northwestern Switzerland.He said that “listening” to his livestock had inspired his drive for funds for the extra space horned ruminants require to avoid injuring each other while grazing.Horns, he added, are far from merely ornamental as they help cows communicate and regulate their body temperature while experts also say they play a part in their metabolism.He is asking for a 190 Swiss franc (£150) annual subsidy per horned animal for farmers.Opponents of dehorning say burning a sedated calf’s horn buds with a red-hot iron is painful and unnatural but supporters say it is no more traumatic than castrating cats and is an issue of health and safety.The government has also warned the extra subsidy would drain up to 30 million francs from its three billion franc annual agricultural budget as horned cows are more dangerous both for other animals and handlers and require more space.Agriculture minister Johann Schneider-Ammann even described the initiative as an “own goal” for animal rights.But Mr Capaul said: “I only wanted to give the cows and goats a voice.”When he failed to secure political support for his campaign, he launched a petition in 2014 and collected the required 100,000 signatures to trigger a referendum on the issue.The latest poll says the vote is too close to call.The “horn vote” is the latest in a series of popular initiatives, which range from abolishing the military to granting everyone six weeks holiday and banning minarets. Proponents insist such direct democracy is a great way to vent frustration with the political elite.“If you have such an outlet, then people can bring up matters that have been forgotten or suppressed by the system,” said  Andreas Ladner of the University of Lausanne.Additional reporting by Chris Dyke​Please review our commenting policyBoris Johnson: Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit deal is like the Titanic - and there\u0026#39s an iceberg right aheadBrexit latest news: Spain and Britain reach deal with EU on Gibraltar - live updatesTijuana authorities seek help as sickness spreads through migrant campComment: We must pray Matthew Hedges is victim of cock-up, not conspiracy, in the EmiratesFears for Brazil\u0026#39s healthcare system as Bolsonaro sends Cuba\u0026#39s white coat diplomacy packingGovernment accused of massaging immigration statistics in run up to Brexit voteDriverless cars to be tested in London ahead of launch this ChristmasComment: This is a calamitous, cowardly Brexit deal - and we\u0026#39re now being shafted for it by the EUDual nationality Turks being stripped of citizenship by far-Right in Austria\u0026#39s \u0026#39Windrush\u0026#39 scandalWhat it\u0026#39s like to be dragged through UAE\u0026#39s cloak and dagger legal system and dumped in prisonComment: Why a \u0026#39sunset clause\u0026#39 could restore the near total collapse of trust in the Brexit processComment: Is the UK at last turning into a tough adversary on Brexit - or is it all just an accident?Lengthy school reports are \u0026#39burdensome\u0026#39 for teachers and should move to shorter versions, panel concludesCauliflower, Guinness and a hot bath - how BBC German Service waged a propaganda war in WW2Cookery programmes must do more to save the curry trade, Asian food champion saysGermany \u0026#39refuses\u0026#39 to help trace Nazi-looted £3.5m Edgar Degas paintingTheresa May an \u0026#39incompetent arch Remainer\u0026#39 who is bungling Brexit, says former Tory donorWhat is the Brexit deal, and what will happen after Parliament votes?Theresa May\u0026#39s draft Brexit withdrawal agreement - read in fullVote of no confidence in Theresa May: How is it triggered and what is the role of the 1922 Committee?Brexit explained: All your questions answered about the UK leaving the EU  We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/04/15/bitcoin-price-latest-news-update.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6258776  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/04/15/bitcoin-price-latest-news-update.jpg","title":"bitcoin black friday 2018 best deals giveaways online cryptocurrency","story":"Created with Sketch.Subscribe  registerSubscribeJoin us Subscribe  registerJoin us SubscribeLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 14 daysSee the optionsCryptocurrency exchanges hold bitcoin giveaways, while merchants list exclusive deals fro people paying in digital currencyClick to followThe Independent TechThe\u0026nbspannual shopping bonanza that is Black Friday is here, and for the sixth year in a row it’s also coming to holders of the cryptocurrency bitcoin.The unofficial start to the Christmas shopping period comes at a turbulent time for bitcoin, coming at the end of a week of dramatic price drops, though this hasn’t put off online retailers hoping to cash in on the cryptocurrency.“While most consumers are flooding into supermarkets and retail stores, there’s a quiet revolution brewing in the corners of the\u0026nbspinternet,” states the Bitcoin Black Friday\u0026nbspwebsite, which says it will publish all the best deals from merchants today.“Bitcoin Black Friday is a one day event that brings together bitcoin merchants and bitcoin users.

On a weekday, when thousands of commuters were trying to get to work, college and school let alone the other, vast number of folk who thought they they would see the railway as their most convenient form of travel.Because it was in the North, the stoppage raised barely a glimmer of interest in the South. If it had happened in Kent or Surrey, to trains into London Bridge or Waterloo, all hell would have broken loose. Instead, it was just another day of misery, to go with the other numerous days lost, including when they changed the timetable, and the services across the North could not cope.Meanwhile, the Government is pressing ahead with a £56bn plan to develop HS2. Will the new high-speed link between London and the North-West change any of this? Will it improve things? Not at all. Will it make a difference that justifies such vast expenditure? Hardly. Is it a grotesque example of ministerial machismo, of gesture politics, of a total inability to see the wood for the trees? You bet it is.Archaeologists begin examining 10,000 years of history along HS2 routeNow we know HS2 really is a flawed projectHS2 requires extra £43bn \u0027for people to make the most of it\u0027The trains I’m talking about, the ones that were cancelled, were mostly on the branch lines, on the routes that people use day in, day out - not the West Coast Line, which already has a fast, comfortable service. In my lifetime, since growing up in Cumbria, and travelling to and from London to visit family, journey times have plummeted. On the main, trunk route - not on the secondary ones. This is where the problem lies, where the service is creaking.Cutting several minutes off the London to Manchester service does not matter a h’apporth. What would boost the experience immeasurably there would be to ensure that wifi works all the way, that a mobile signal is not lost. But that, too, is not what HS2 is about.Already, there is talk by those on the inside that the projected costs are soaring. The “main works civil contracts” on the London to Birmingham section, reports The Sunday Times, are “several billion pounds” over the official budget of £6.6bn. That’s before any earth is turned, and all manner of unseen, below ground problems are discovered.Conscious of a final bill that could spiral out of control, and being seen to get a grip, ministers are demanding that instead of sanctioning extra expenditure, costs are being renegotiated, to stick to the budgeted figure. This, in turn, has led to delays, as more design and development is required, and specifications redrawn. Again, the word is that the vast project - the country’s biggest and most demanding infrastructure scheme - is likely to be more than a year behind schedule.That\u0027s how fast HS2\u0026nbspservices will travel at when the project is completedPart of the issue here is that mooted figures are proving inaccurate, the result, apparently of an insistence that the new railway meets a deadline for the beginning of services, of 2026.The thinking behind this demand, that Britain is sick and tired of major capital constructions that seem to take forever to reach fulfilment (runway expansion of Heathrow was first raised exactly 50 years ago) is laudable. But put that together with a scheme that is huge and complex, and it can become a recipe for chaos. And that’s without HS2 being unnecessary in the first place.This is what ministers should realise: that £56bn buys you an awful lot of terribly needed enhancements, for instance to existing country and suburban services, and to digitalisation.There is a subtext, of course, to HS2 - one that is hardly ever raised, let alone publicly admitted. And it is that the 250mph railway has another purpose, beyond rushing passengers from London to Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. It is that the faster railway makes commuting from Birmingham in particular all that more manageable. House prices in the West Midlands are so much cheaper than in the South-East. Public sector workers in essential occupations, in sectors like the NHS and education, will be able to afford to commute from Brum. HS2, you see, is aimed in part at alleviating London’s growing housing crisis. Which makes it a very expensive solution indeed.When confronted with the news of the overruns and delay, the Department for Transport said it would not comment on speculation. “Our priority is to ensure value for money for the taxpayer.”Yes, but does the overall project seriously provide value for money?Ministers have the ability to stop it in its tracks, to ert the investment elsewhere. Of course, that would involve a loss of pride. There would be some dismay in the North, but not as much as might be expected - particularly if the money was spent on other local, much-needed advancements. Perhaps they should test attitudes towards the new service before it\u0027s too late.For there are warning lights flashing all over this. An awful lot of cash is being committed to something for which there is little demand. Getting from A to B may become quicker, but B to C will be just as slow –\u0026nbspand it’s the B to C that is used by so many people every day, that ceased to operate last week and will do so again, even with HS2.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That could allow Apple to put the phone back on sale at a lower price.Apple designer Jony Ive explains his \u0027utterly absurd\u0027 way of workingThe new handsets released in September were available at an increased price compared with previous years: the new iPhone XR, pitched as the more affordable model, begins at the same price the top-end phones had been marketed at until the iPhone X came along.Instead of buying those new phones, customers have been opting for the iPhone 8, according to numerous reports. Price-conscious customers are realising they could buy last year\u0027s handset instead for a much lower cost\u0026nbsp– despite it not featuring the brand new iPhone design – and that is thought to be having an impact on sales of the more expensive models.It is not clear when the iPhone X will be re-introduced to the line-up, or even if it will make it back onto sale. The iPhone X features an almost identical design to the iPhone XS, but misses out on new features such as an improved camera and upgraded processor.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Created with Sketch.The best films of 2018 (so far) Show all 17Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles.

But as\u0026nbspSean O’Grady\u0026nbspexplains, she is following in a long Conservative tradition\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentBattles over the UK\u0027s relationship with the continent have blighted successive Tory premiershipsCould Europe be enough to wreck yet another Tory premiership?As Theresa May faces prospective votes of no confidence,\u0026nbspin her leadership from her own MPs, and in her government from internal dissidents and opposition parties, it may be scant comfort that she would hardly be the first Conservative leader to see their dreams and ambitions destroyed by a subject – Europe – that is seemingly incapable of resolution.Indeed, May, punningly enough, exists as a sort of political mayflower – her\u0026nbsplife in office, be it long or short, devoted to one purpose only: Brexit. All the stuff about “burning injustices”, the high-minded schemes to reinvigorate the British economy with an “industrial strategy” – her own mild brand of corporatism – or the plight of the “just about managing” families has been subsumed by the question of Britain’s EU withdrawal.To use a modern phrase, her administration has not the “bandwidth” to deal with everything else as well as sort out Brexit in truth it doesn’t really have the capacity or the intellectual clout to deal with Brexit itself.\u0026nbspBritain Before Brexit in photos: a portrait of the West MidlandsIn order to break the blackmailing hold of her band of Eurosceptic fundamentalists – and, to be fair, the truculent resistance of the Europhiles – she sought her own mandate at the general election of 2017. In an inexplicably long campaign the British electorate did what they usually do when asked a question by a prime mister – they chose to answer a different one. Called upon to back her with the kind of resounding support that would give her the oomph needed to carry out her Lancaster House hardish Brexit plan, the British electorate instead decided to blow a large raspberry and vote in unthinkable numbers for Jeremy Corbyn.“Nothing has changed,” she foolishly said during yet another campaign cock-up. In reality everything changed when she lost her majority, her moral authority and her political autonomy. Ironically, from that moment on she was the captive of every voluble faction or personality persuaded they could do a better job than she could – and there was no shortage of those. It was quietly said that she wouldn’t lead her party into another general election, even after she had jettisoned her closest aides and handed a veto over her cabinet-making to the 1922 Committee. She indicated that she had got her party and the country into his mess – and would get them out of it. It might have been better all round if they’d just ditched her then but, as usual, her enemies were willing to wound but not to kill. (My apologies if that language seems too violently intemperate for our times)Those who refuse to contemplate consulting the British people would in my view make more likely our eventual exitThe outcome of the British general election of 2017 was, then, not the triumph of May and the Leavers, but the revenge of the Remainers. It has left its mark. Now May is chained to the radiator of the Democratic Unionist Party, whose illogical and inconsistent demands could only be carried out by means of ine intervention.Sad, as they say, but true and hardly unpredictable. We remember\u0026nbspall too well\u0026nbsphow David Cameron almost casually tossed away his place in history – which might otherwise have been relatively distinguished – with a pledge to hold an inout EU referendum. On 23 January 2013 – a day that should live in infamy – at a speech at the Bloomberg HQ in London, Cameron explained his rationale. To be fair, he had some good points to make:“Those who refuse to contemplate consulting the British people would in my view make more likely our eventual exit.“Simply asking the British people to carry on accepting a European settlement over which they have had little choice is a path to ensuring that when the question is finally put – and at some stage it will have to be – it is much more likely that the British people will reject the EU.“That is why I am in favour of a referendum. I believe in confronting this issue – shaping it, leading the debate. Not simply hoping a difficult situation will go away.”“First, the problems in the eurozone are driving fundamental change in Europe.Second, there is a crisis of European competitiveness, as other nations across the world soar ahead. And third, there is a gap between the EU and its citizens which has grown dramatically in recent years, and which represents a lack of democratic accountability and consent that is – yes – felt particularly acutely in Britain.”By the way, and as if to prove the sure touch, if not genius, for politics possessed by Tony Blair, the reaction of the ex-prime minister at the time to Cameron’s move is chillingly and amusingly prophetic:Travel Question: Will Brexit affect holidays in Spain?In the early 2010s, as the coalition cut its way to dismal poll ratings Cameron was, in truth, spooked by the rise of Nigel Farage and Ukip, capitalising on a widespread but inchoate set of grievances in post-financial crisis, post-austerity, “left-behind” Britain.Cameron feared being outflanked by them on the right, splitting the traditional Conservative vote and losing seats to Ed Miliband’s Labour Party. In a way his strategy succeeded – but too well. At the 2015 election, with the collapse in the Liberal Democrat vote, Labour’s rout in Scotland at the hands of the SNP and some recession in Ukip’s charge, very possibly because of Cameron’s referendum pledge, Cameron and his campaign manager George Osborne succeeded so far as to win an overall majority – the first Tory one since 1992. Instead of another round of coalition, with an even stronger Tory domination, they could steer their own course. Instead of being able to plead that “Nick Clegg won’t let me hold the referendum”, Cameron was forced to do so.Or was he? Back in 2015 and 2016 no one was much bothered. Europe hardly featured in the voters’ list of concerns, although immigration often did. Cameron might have got away with forgetting his promise (as he had before on a “cast-iron” one to hold a plebiscite on the Lisbon Treaty of 2009).In any event, Cameron was complacent and, like many, too mesmerised by the precedent of the 1975 vote, when the people tended to “follow the faces they trusted”, as the arch-Europhile Roy Jenkins remarkeCameron failed to see how times had changed, and how folk were more sceptical about “the establishment”, whipped up by Ukip. Cameron also refused to countenance “blue-on-blue” debates, which allowed Boris Johnson and Michael Gove to parade unchallenged directly by their Tory peers the Treasury’s “Project Fear”, by contrast, seemed implausible to many of the public.You can think of ex-ministers who are going around causing all sorts of trouble. We don’t want another three more of the bastards out there...So Cameron lost. He lost his party and his premiership, and he is now routinely relegated to the bottom of the historical premier premiership table, along with Sir Anthony Eden (Suez) and Neville Chamberlain (Munich), in their own ways also guilty of serious delusions about foreign policy. Maybe the memoir\u0026nbspCameron is composing in his £25,000 “shepherd’s cottage” will succeed in rehabilitating him.Before Cameron there was John Major. Like May today, Major faced a huge series of battles to get a European agreement through parliament: the Maastricht Treaty strengthened European integration, but also contained a series of British “opt-outs”, the most valuable being the right to keep the pound and avoid joining the ill-starred euro.Like May today as well, he had no overall majority for much of his time in parliament and a well-organised group of Eurosceptics tormenting him. Some crucial votes he only won with the support of the 20 or so Liberal Democrats, then led by Paddy Ashdown, prepared to put country before party Labour was uniformly hostile to Major’s legislation, though agreeing with almost everything in it.Eurosceptics (AFPGetty)Major, like May, had a gang of leaky Eurosceptics in cabinet permanently causing trouble. In an unguarded moment in front of a live mic, he let slip his true feelings:“Just think it through from my perspective. You are the prime minister, with a majority of 18, a party that is still harking back to a golden age that never was, and is now invented. You have three right-wing members of the cabinet who actually resign. What happens in the parliamentary party?“I could bring in other people. But where do you think most of this poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. You can think of ex-ministers who are going around causing all sorts of trouble.“We don’t want another three more of the bastards out there. What’s Lyndon Johnson’s maxim?...”May must feel the same way about today’s “gang of five”, the “pizza club” of Leadsom, Gove, Fox, Grayling and Mordaunt. And, indeed, about Michael Howard, Peter Lilley and John Redwood, still banging the same drum as they did in Major’s cabinet a quarter century ago. (At least Michael Portillo has gone off to play with trains and model garishly coloured blazers.)ITVRex)Major survived his own leadership crisis over Europe, one he felt he had to end himself by, shockingly, resigning his position as party leader (but not prime minister) and inviting his enemies to “put up or shut up”. John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, did so and scored respectably, but ultimately lost. So Major carried on, his authority scarcely enhanced before he was slaughtered by Blair in 1997. It was the Tories’ worst thrashing since 1832. As he himself said within weeks, it was time to “leave the stage”.When Major claimed that his foes were “still harking back to a golden age that never was, and is now invented”, it was plainly a reference to the Thatcher premiership – which remains to this day a golden age for the right of the Conservative Party and their fellow travellers in Ukip – the likes of Arron Banks and Farage explicitly declaring their devotion to her.\u0026nbspIn many ways the Leave campaign was a movement that sought to bring back Thatcherism, the EU being regarded as a pettifogging, bureaucratic,\u0026nbspeven socialist\u0026nbspbarrier to the return of free enterprise, low tax\u0026nbspand the small-state policies of the 1980s. It was, if you will, a campaign for Mrs Thatcher’s fourth term in office, the one she never got to deliver.Eurosceptics (KeystoneHulton ArchiveGetty)The allegiance to Thatcher was, however, of the late-vintage Thatcher – the one who, when she reached the Lords, was happy to vote against her own party on Maastricht the one who made the landmark Bruges speech in 1988, a sort of Old Testament for Eurosceptics. A brief extract gives its flavour:“We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain\u0026nbsponly to see them reimposed at a European level with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels.“Certainly we want to see Europe more united and with a greater sense of common purpose.“But it must be in a way which preserves the different traditions, parliamentary powers and sense of national pride in one’s own country for these have been the source of Europe’s vitality through the centuries.”Pure prototype Ukip, you might say. Yet she also declared in that same address, less comfortably for the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg and Farage:“The lesson of the economic history of Europe in the Seventies and Eighties is that central planning and detailed control\u0026nbspdo not\u0026nbspwork and that personal endeavour and initiative\u0026nbspdo that a state-controlled economy is a recipe for low growth and that free enterprise within a framework of law brings better results.“The aim of a Europe open to enterprise is the moving force behind the creation of the single European market in 1992. By getting rid of barriers, by making it possible for companies to operate on a European scale, we can best compete with the United States, Japan and other new economic powers emerging in Asia and elsewhere.”Margaret Thatcher, the longest serving peacetime premier of the 20th century, left office on 22 November\u0026nbsp1990. She did so for four manifest reasons. First, what was called “style” – an increasingly imperious manner. Second, a deepening economic recession. Third, the poll tax, which was incredibly unpopular and became a direct threat to Tory MPs’ chances of holding on to their seats. But there was also the question of Europe.Created with Sketch.Brexit: 10 of the most ridiculous headlines Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.This wholly false headline merited the first ruling by IPSO (the press regulator) under clause 1 of the revised Editor\u0027s Code of Practice.

At the time the Conservative Party had many more European true believers at its head than today and when the then-leader of the Commons, Sir Geoffrey Howe, resigned in protest at the prime minister’s dismissive approach to Europe, she was fatally damaged. Her words at prime minister’s questions were the final straw for Howe, Michael Heseltine and the other Europhiles, and they echo down the years:Biggest rise in UK poverty since Thatcher was in power, experts claimThree weeks later she had had to quit, but not until she had had time to refuse\u0026nbspa request from the Labour leader, Neil Kinnock, to hold a general election so the British people could make their own choice about her successor. Plus ça change.The trouble for the Tories over Europe goes further back still. Britain’s first, belated attempt to join the then European Economic Community (EEC) was rejected after a few years of negotiations in 1963 – because of a French veto. After President Charles\u0026nbspde Gaulle said “non” to the UK, the fortunes of the Conservative movement declined markedly.The prime minister responsible\u0026nbspfor the bid, Harold Macmillan, saw it as the great strategic purpose of his administration:\u0026nbspthe way to find a role in the world as the British empire was being dismantled, and a way to boost the UK’s sluggish growth by joining in with the fastest growing economic bloc (apart from Japan) at the time. Macmillan, in the end, failed and his government was defeated by\u0026nbspLabour in 1964.In fact the only Tory leader to remotely prosper from Europe was Ted Heath, who was Macmillan’s chief negotiator – the reverse of a Brexit secretary – and went on to be the Tory PM who took the UK in to the EEC in 1973.Even there, though, the effort left some bad feelings among the small band of Tory proto-Eurosepctics, led by Enoch Powell, a man in love with parliament and fixated by sovereignty. More concerned with immigration, his hatred of the EEC was visceral, and his advice to Tory voters in marginal seats in the West Midlands in the 1974 election to vote Labour – because they\u0026nbsp were offering a referendum on staying in the EEC – was pivotal in pushing Heath out of No 10. So, in his way, even Heath was a victim of his party’s troubled and ambiguous relationship to the European issue.So there they are then: Macmillan, Heath, Thatcher, Cameron, May. Europe has haunted the Tories for almost seven decades, ever since Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden and Harold Macmillan politely said “no” to an invitation to join attempts to create a European Community in the 1950s.Wrangling about Europe also badly distracted the Tories in opposition under William Hague and Iain Duncan Smith. The floor is littered with other political corpses and zombie policies (remember Hague’s “Save the Pound”?). Ken Clarke and Michael Heseltine never became leader of their party because they were too pro-European. Others, such as Johnson and Gove, have\u0026nbspfound their anti-European crusading not quite sufficient to carry them into No 10, mainly because most of the parliamentary party remained relatively relaxed about the EU – epitomised by, say, Amber Rudd and\u0026nbspPhilip Hammond, as well as Cameron and Osborne.Further back in the mists of history, all the way back to the mid-19th century, we find the Conservatives split about protectionism and “imperial preference” as against global free trade. The issue came back time and again to mither Tory statesmen from Robert Peel to Stanley Baldwin. Only the Second World War forced them to take their minds off trade policy.The last Tory leader to talk much sense about Europe was in fact the Mark I David Cameron, the one who in 2006 told his party simply to “stop banging on about Europe”.Whatever happened to that idea?Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century.

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles.

And now we will do the same thing in Morecambe.“So, we have talked about things like what do you find on the beach there?\u0026nbspYou find mussel colonies and, funnily enough, when you want a structure that has the ability to house gardens and attractions and to give people a unique experience, well, the shape of mussel shells would be perfect.”Attractions within, he said, would introduce visitors to Earth’s various water worlds in the same way Eden Cornwall – which boats a 16,000 square metre rainforest – introduced people to the planet’s plants and trees.Grimshaw Architects)“There, the focus is on plants and humans and their interdependence,” he said. “So, here, we’ll be doing something similar but in a marine context.“The first priority is getting people to connect with the bay outside the front door but that will then allow us to tell the story of what goes on in other places around the world and give portals through to those places.”He said the emphasis would be on visitor interaction and described a possible attraction where people could walk through a single magnified drop of water to experience how much invisible life teems within: “We don’t want this to be passive or a standard museum – we are in the business of giving people experiences they would not get elsewhere.”The autumn announcement that an Eden was to be built in Morecambe – if funds could be raised – brought much excitement to the town, with MP David Morris hailing it as a “game-changer”.The announcement\u0026nbspfollowed a year of behind-the-scenes work after Lancaster University first approached Eden Project International and sold it\u0026nbspthe idea of opening its second UK venue in the town.\u0026nbspThey said Morecambe – a once thriving seaside destination now widely perceived to have fallen on hard times – was in need of the same regeneration which the Eden Project Cornwall had brought to that region since opening in a disused clay pit in 2001. They pointed out that the town’s bay – famed for the speed with which the tide comes in – was an area of special scientific interest which would suit enviro-tourism.“We get a lot of approaches from different places across the world,” said Mr Harland, who says Eden Project International\u0026nbspis investigating other possible venues in China, South America and New Zealand. “But this one spoke to us and to what we are about.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.England batsman Jonny Bairstow celebrates after reaching his century during Day One of the Third Test match against Sri Lanka at Sinhalese Sports Club in ColomboPrime Minister Theresa May joins a parent and baby group during a visit to the Kentish Town Health Centre in LondonA crashed car, with an object protruding through the windscreen, sits abandoned on the A628 in the Peak District, as a blast of snow hit the north of EnglandWaves crash over Seaham lighthouse near Durham as the cold and wet weather continuesPrime Minister Theresa May speaking at the CBI annual conference at InterContinental Hotel.

The sticking point on such huge projects, however, can often be local opinion.So far, claims Mr Harland, that has\u0026nbspbeen overwhelmingly positive.“You know how news works,” he said. “We announce we’re doing this thing, then the local TV goes out and finds two people in favour and one against, and in Morecambe, they were struggling with that. Across the board we’re getting support because… I think people can see the potential it has for the town.”Issues such as pressure on local transport links and infrastructure would be smoothed out as part of the development, he said.\u0026nbsp“Those are the things that people worry about – and rightly, because let’s not kid ourselves, people will be impacted. What we say is the impact will be offset by the social and economic benefits which this will bring.”Certainly, the benefits have been felt in Cornwall. It has attracted 19 million visitors and pumped an estimated £2bn\u0026nbspinto the local economy since opening 17 years ago.“We would love to do that for Lancashire,” said Mr Harland. “The history of Morecambe is that this was a place where, traditionally, people went to escape, take the air and seek a version of the exotic. That’s all we’ll be doing now –\u0026nbsptrying to bring back the exotic.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The Northern Ireland backstop protocol states: “Quantitative restrictions on exports and imports shall be prohibited between the Union and Northern Ireland” – effectively insisting on free movement of goods.\u0026nbspAnimal lovers who had hoped Brexit could allow for a ban fear that instead\u0026nbspthis wording will create a loophole that would prevent one.If Britain puts a block on live exports, sheep and cattle farmers would be highly likely to charter vessels to ship animals to Northern Ireland,\u0026nbspfrom where they would be taken\u0026nbspthe Republic and then the Continent, Compassion in World Farming believes.The worries have arisen as activists are focused on the port of Ramsgate in Kent, where exports of calves from Scotland, just a few days old, have restarted.Peter Stevenson, chief policy adviser at Compassion in World Farming, said there was a precedent for exporters using the Northern Ireland route. Until last month, unweaned calves were sent from Scotland to the province then driven by road to the Irish Republic before being sent to Europe.Our message to the government: Please get clarification from Europe that there should be an exception for live animals“We are deeply worried,” he told The Independent. “I imagine those drafting this document didn’t think about live exports but our message to the government would be ‘Please get clarification from Europe that there should be an exception for live animals’.“The science is very clear: young calves can’t cope with long journeys – their immune systems are low so they’re susceptible to disease when stressed and can’t control their temperatures.”Ramsgate (Compassion in World Farming)Mr Stevenson said his charity was immensely disappointed by the Scottish government’s support for live exports, and that the beef and dairy industries should work together to raise calves for beef, reducing the UK’s bill for beef imports.“We don’t have a view on Brexit, but a lot of our supporters in the run-up to the EU vote were very excited about getting an end to live exports and voted to leave for that reason, but if they find this deal hampers a ban, they will feel very cheated.”Until now, the government has always argued EU law on movement of goods prevented the UK from implementing a live-export ban.Official figures show that each year at least 4,000 sheep are transported from the UK to Europe for slaughter, with an estimated 6,000 calves exported from Scotland via Northern Ireland, mostly to Spain and Italy.Krissie Richards, who has witnessed recent live exports through Ramsgate, said: “These calves are still babies, suckling our hands for comfort. It’s truly heartbreaking.”Thanet council banned exports from Ramsgate after 47 sheep died at the port in 2012 but it was forced by the High Court to backtrack.Created with Sketch.

The Brexiteers may lose their Brexit.”Ms Rudd also cast doubt on Ms May’s plans to seal the Brexit deal at a summit with EU leaders on Sunday, acknowledging there are still obstacles in the way.“Hopefully it will get through this week,” she said, adding: “There is still a negotiation going on in terms of actually getting this agreement through.”The comments make Ms Rudd the first cabinet minister to rule out a no-deal Brexit – and the first to suggest an agreement at European level could yet be derailed.They came as the prime minister prepared to head to Brussels for talks with Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, under huge pressure for further “wins” in the final text.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

We passed that as a resolution at conference as one of a series of options.Theresa May casts doubt over her future if MPs vote down Brexit dealBut yeah, people should be careful what they wish for, because my view is that if we had a second referendum tomorrow, Leave would win again and not only would Leave win again but Leave voters would say \u0027What didn’t you understand about Leave the first time?\u0027.A growing number of MPs\u0026nbsphave voiced support for another public vote on Brexit amid parliamentary deadlock over Theresa May\u0027s planned\u0026nbspdeal.\u0026nbspLabour has said\u0026nbspit will push for a general election if the agreement is voted down.

She will meet Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker on Saturday, and then head to the full meeting at around 9am on Sunday. The whole thing should be wrapped up by lunchtime – if it goes to plan (and things often do not). Here’s all you need to know about it:What is the summit about?Theresa May is hoping that EU leaders from the 27 remaining countries will sign off the withdrawal agreements she has negotiated with Brussels.\u0026nbspThe UK government is happy with the current agreement, as is the European Commission – which has been directly negotiating with Britain. Now the 27 leaders will have to formally approve it.Could they reject the agreement?If they show up at the summit, they almost certainly won’t be rejecting the agreement. This is because some national leaders, including Angela Merkel, have said they won’t attend unless there is a deal ready for them to sign. The summit is essentially for show to cap the whole thing off.The heads of state and government want to avoid all-nighters like the ones they experienced during the Greek debt crisis, and think negotiations are best delegated to officials.Is this the first time member states have seen the Brexit deal?No, their officials and ambassadors in Brussels have been arguing about it for days and trying to make changes. It currently seems likely that there will be a number of “side-declarations” next to the deal clarifying aspects of it that the member states wanted to change.A lot of member states – Denmark, France and the Netherlands especially –\u0026nbspare annoyed that the Commission has not guaranteed their fishing fleets access to UK waters as part of the deal. They think this is important because the Northern Ireland backstop essentially gives the UK the benefits of the EU customs union, which was supposed to be a bargaining chip. It\u0027s possible this issue could be solved by a so-called side-declaration where leaders make clear how they think the agreement should be interpreted.Spain is also angry because it does not want the agreement to apply to Gibraltar and says it will vote against the plan. It can\u0027t stop it on its own, though if the fishing nations aren\u0027t satisfied, there could be trouble.Who will we hear from at the summit?Leaders will give their views on the deal on the way in, on the doorstep of the summit. Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and Council president Donald Tusk will give a press conference after everything is signed off. Theresa May might also give a press conference of her own, though this has not been confirmed. There\u0027ll also be a presentation by European Parliament president Antoni Tajani.Does this mean Brexit negotiations are over?Far from it. Once the withdrawal agreement is approved there will need to be negotiations about what the trade relationship will be. These will start next March, if everything goes to plan, and they will take years.\u0026nbspBut even if EU leaders agree to the withdrawal agreement it could still get rejected by the UK parliament, with MPs\u0026nbspfrom all parties threatening to derail it when it comes to the House of Commons.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

speech.Poulsen and his assistant Peder Oluf Pedersen quickly obtained a patent, their innovation the precursor\u0026nbspto all magnetic tape recorders that would follow.In 1900 Poulsen attended\u0026nbspthe Exposition Universelle in Paris, where he demonstrated his device by recording the voice of Austrian emperor Franz Josef - our earliest surviving magnetic recording - taking home the Grand Prix for his trouble.He followed this breakthrough with the invention of the first continuous wave transmitter in 1903, dubbed the Poulsen\u0026nbspArc, which would be used in the earliest radio broadcasting stations and enabled\u0026nbspcommunication between Lyngby\u0026nbspin the Copehagen suburbs and Newcastle in the UK, effectively bridging the North Sea\u0026nbspwith the aid

It will be a system that looks across the globe and attracts the people with the skills we need.Crucially it will be fair to ordinary working people. For too long people have felt they have been ignored on immigration and that politicians have not taken their concerns seriously enough.However, since the Prime Minister unveiled her new Brexit agreement, people have been concerned the deal will not fulfil the key referendum pledge of taking back control of borders.With the new curbs on low-skilled migrants, Mrs May hopes to reframe the Brexit debate around migration and win the support of Eurosceptic Tory MPs.

but the EU has warned that would render the mechanism pointless.It would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.At the same time the UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries.On November , thereported that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab demanded the right to pull Britain out of the EU’s Irish backstop after just three months.The paper claimed the hardline pitch to the Irish government “stunned” Irish officials.Its claimed Mr Raab’s proposal was put to the Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney in a private meeting in London.However, the Irish Prime Minister told Theresa May that he will not accept a Brexit deal which gives the UK the unilateral power to halt backstop arrangements for the border with Northern Ireland.The EU has suggested a backstop that would see Northern Ireland staying in the customs union, the EU VAT system and parts of the single market.This will essentially draw a customs border down the middle of the Irish Sea, potentially damaging the union of the UK.Mrs May has suggested a backstop that will see all of the UK aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after .Brussels has two issues with Mays plan.The first is that May wants the backstop to come to an end after a certain time period the EU thinks this would be self-defeating as its possible no solution for the Irish border would be found.The EU also thinks this risks leaving Britain benefiting from the customs union and single market for years after Brexit - reaping all the benefits without having any of the obligations that full membership would entail.In June  European leaders said Britain was running out of time to do a deal because of the unsolved border problem.In July Theresa May quoted Shakespeare as she insisted the UK would not be broken up with a border down the Irish Sea.Theresa May has told EU leaders she is looking at ways of keeping Britain under their rules for at least another year as part of efforts to break the Brexit deadlock.Addressing the  national bosses at a tense summit in Brussels on the night of October , the PM said she is “ready to consider” extending the  month transition period after the UK leaves the EU next March.The potentially incendiary move has been drawn up by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier to try to end a bitter impasse over the Irish border.It would mean abiding by all Brussels rules until December  at the earliest.The news comes after talks on Sunday, October , hit a brick wall once again, as the issue of the Irish border continues to cause a headache for Theresa May.Theresa May has insisted any backstop arrangement must apply to the UK as a whole so not to create a border in the Irish Sea.However, talks broke down after the EU had insisted on a second backstop arrangement - just involving Northern Ireland -the UKs version wasnt ready in time, according to Downing Street sources.Brussels admitted in a draft trade agreement that technology COULD be used to solve the thorny issue of the border, using Max Fac solutions at the frontier as part of a future deal between the UK and EU.But the backstop - which keeps Britain in the customs unionno alternative is agreed to keep the Irish border open - will stay in the withdrawal agreement as an insurance policy.Ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith said: The withdrawal agreement will make it very clear that should we struggle with a negotiation for a free trade arrangement and not complete that process, we will fall into the Northern Ireland backstop.I would hope that she would now consider that none of this is at all workable unless we get the withdrawal agreement now amended so that any arrangements we make strip out that backstop.Former minister Owen Paterson added: As long as the backstop is in existence in a legally binding document, there is a danger that should talks fail the backstop becomes accepted.We would have the horror of falling into a customs union, the horror of having Northern Ireland separated from the rest of the United Kingdom. Mrs May dubbed the continuing row with Brussels over how to avoid a hard border in Ireland as “the one real sticking point left, but a considerable one”.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.On November , , the PM faced crunch Cabinet showdowns with her ministers where she will set out the details of the agreement she struck with Brussels the previous day.A number of pro-Brexit ministers are feared to be on the brink of walking out over the deal.They believe it would leave Britain tied to the EU customs union for years to come, because of the controversial Irish backstop arrangement.If the Cabinet does block Mrs Mays deal, she could find her position is untenable - leading to a Tory leadership crisis."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0003390043191.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"no deal mars bar brexit jane moore","story":"The operative word being “could”, of course.

But really, does anyone actually believe this Project Fear twaddle  No one has yet suggested that “no deal will see an end to Brussels sprouts”, but it can only be a matter of time.Meanwhile, we are still being peddled the prospect of medication piling up at the border, the entire City of London decamping to Paris, flights being grounded at the stroke of midnight on March , gridlocked motorwaysand “civil unrest”.Enough already. Like .million others, I voted for Brexit on the basis thatthe EU wouldn’t give us a mutually beneficial deal then we would simply leave without one.It’s now clear that, despite the clear mandate from . per cent of the British people that they want out, the painful preication of Mrs May’s “negotiations”has told the Brussels Eurocrats that our government is wavering on that mindset and, consequently, they feel they have us over an imported barrel.So it’s time to show them that they don’t — by openly preparing for no deal. After all, the notion that Merkel, Macron et al will bite off their own electorate’s noses to spite Britain’s volte face on EU membership is an absolute nonsense.In a letter to The Times yesterday, the chairman of pub chain JD Wetherspoon, Tim Martin, wrote: “The great urban myth, promoted by advocates of the deadly exchange rate mechanism, the euro and Remain, is that a ‘deal’ with the EU is a prerequisite of future prosperity.”The reality, he says, is that no deal would allow us to join successful countries such as Canada, Singapore, Israel and Australia in the free-trading world and “by slashing the EU’s , protectionist tarfs, shop prices will fall, with no loss to the Treasury, since tarf income is currently remitted to Brussels”.On top of that, we won’t have to pay the £billion orce bill, will regain control of our fishing waters, borders and laws and, ultimately, all have more money in our pockets.

Or, in John Sergeant and Ann Widdecombe’s case, common moths in freefall after a battering from a tea towel.But former Pussycat Doll Ashley is used to performing complicated dance routines in front of huge crowds and, therefore, oozed confidence and expertise from the get go.Little wonder since, according to her former dance teacher in the US, she was taught “all dferent styles of dance” from the age of eight to  and once had an introduction to ballroom training by an elite dance company at summer school.So yes, she’s undoubtedly the best, with former Steps trouper Faye Tozer not far behind. But the true Strictly stars are all the others who improve each week despite being way outside their comfort zone.FOLLOWING the shocking attack of a female PC being karate-kicked to the ground by a thug, the flippant commentary accompanying the footage is indeed sickening.But at least the film might help secure a prosecution and hopefully prove a turning point in how we take back control of our lawless streets.Because the real problem here is the fact that thugs clearly don’t fear the consequences of their actions.So may I humbly suggest that it’s high time the Home Office toughens up and shows, not tells, our hard-pressed police that they now have the power and support they need from on high to do their job effectively.CHECK out poo guru Gillian McKeith out on the town with her smiling -year-old daughter Skylar.Considering my daughters won’t be seen dead with meI wear anything more risqué than a baggy polo neck and tweed maxi skirt, she’s very fortunate indeed.THE £.

In , we expect our national broadcaster to reflect all our opinions even-handedly.We don’t want the BBC to tell us that one side is right and the other wrong, or what we should believe, or which opinions are “true” and which are “”.But that is what the BBC has started to do, at least on the subject of Brexit.The BBC tried to be reasonably balanced during the referendum campaign, but it was so upset by the outcome that it has abandoned any attempt at impartiality and become grotesquely one-sided.The views of Remainers are not just over-represented, they are rarely challenged. And scare stories about Brexit which are either exaggerated or completely imaginary are presented as fact.I decided to compile a list of myths about Brexit — particularly scare stories about what will happen when we leave the Customs Union orwe leave Europe without a deal.Then I compared them with the facts. Although the pamphlet did not mention the BBC, most of the myths were things we hear daily on its programmes.The BBC rose to the bait and invited me into the Today programme on Radio  yesterday to be grilled by John Humphrys, its star interviewer. It was a fair enough interview. He challenged my arguments but I was able to refute his claims point by point.However, they then brought on a chap called Chris Morris, described as the BBC “reality checker”, who was invited to rebut my document. But all he did was oppose my facts with the opinions of people with whom he agreed.He systematically argued the Remain case and defended their Project Fear scare stories. The one thing he did not do was bring in any new facts. My central claim was thatwe leave the EU Customs Union but have a free trade agreement with the European Union, our businesses have little to fear.The main dference will be that traders will have to send in a customs declaration detailing the goods they are buying from or selling to Europe.That is a nuisance which we should try to simply as much as possible.But allegations that “this will be hugely costly, cause y delays, disrupt supply chains and undermine economic growth” are imaginary or exaggerated.“Fact checker” Morris said the majority of trade experts and freight companies to whom he had spoken robustly disagreed with me. This is an opinion, not a fact.Surely,trading in a free trade area — like that which exists between Switzerland and the EU or between Canada and the US — is so intolerable, the people there would be calling for a customs union.But they aren’t. I prefer their practical experience to the speculation of Mr Morris’s contacts.I also quoted a report by the CLECAT organisation, which covers , companies handling  per cent of the freight and customs in Europe, who said: “All the ingredients to ensure a smooth exit process of the UK from the EU, and which allow almost frictionless trade after the exit, are already available.”Why should a BBC fact checker’s unnamed contacts count for more than their considered view He then claimed there are no checks at the border at present. I go across to my house in France frequently and see the checks — for drugs, illegal immigrants, alcohol, cigarettes.And companies have to report all their cross-border trade separately on their VAT s and provide statistical s to Brussels.Then Mr Morris claimed there would be more checks by our customs officers at Dover, resulting in delays and disruption. That is nonsense.The Head of Customs and Revenue has said it only stops and searches lorries at present where it has intelligence information about drugs, illegal immigrants, and goods such as tobacco and alcohol, upon which excise duty is paid.It does not expect any of these risks to become more frequent. So it will not need to search any more vehicles.As I was still in the studio, I was able to rebut his pathetic attempts to rebut my facts. Normally he gets a clear run.But what is intolerable is that he almost never tries to rebut arguments by those trying to overturn the referendum result.I asked him afterwards to name a single Remainer whose case he had attempted to dissect. When he replied that there were “lots”, I said it should be easy to name one and, after repeated challenges, he named Jeremy Corbyn.The idea that Mr Corbyn — a man who has voted more often against European membership than any other MP and went on holiday during the referendum — is a Remainer could only be taken for reality by a BBC reality checker.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I said, No no, Im not sick.Air Transat said the pensioner felt unwell and exhibited symptoms of dizziness and nausea.The captain contacted Medilink - a service which provides airlines with medical assessments on passengers by telephone.An airline spokesperson said: “Medlink assessed that Mrs. Stratakos was unable to safely complete the flight and advised us that it was best to disembark her.”Anna was escorted off the plane by airport security when she refused to leave the aircraft.She was given no medical follow-up despite the airline claiming they refer customers who have been removed for health reasons to a -hour hotline to help them make new travel plans.The grandmother was instead directed to the Air Transat desk at the airport where she was told she would have to spend  on a new ticket for a flight taking off four days later.After being contacted by CBS last week, the airline finally offered an apology to Anna and her family - around five months after the incident.The company said that given the inconveniences suffered by Mrs. Stratakos and any ensuing miscommunication that could have occurred, it will refund herflight.Anna’s son George Stratakos, who originally lodged a complaint with the airline, said: I believe that Air Transats employees overreacted, and made overreaching decisions.”Describing the impact on his mother, George said: I cant imagine just being thrown off a plane.When we got home, she burst into tears.

If theres a worse one in the country Ill sit on the top myself.”The picture shows a forlorn-looking tree, sparsely decorated with only a few baubles on it.The council though said it had not yet been properly decorated and it was still a “living tree” which still has to grow.Rebecca added: They’d have a job decorating that to anything of any decent standard it [looks like] its been there since last year!She also claimed other locals had been far from impressed by the tree, saying they were “going mad on Facebook”.Rebecca told The Mirror:  Last years was a big joke among residents but everyone is really disappointed with this years.The council replied to the tweet to say the local traders are planning to decorate it and do a switch on but a lot of people feel it shouldn’t be down to them.It isn’t a criticism of the town or the people at all.

The other was keeping watch. I was worried they may have weapons.”Renowned locally for his charity work, Stephen — one of three volunteers on the .am patrol — says he shone his light in the perched intruder’s face as a pal rang the cops.In the darkness, Stephen told the suspects: “You’ve got ten seconds to get your a**es out of here. I know what you look like now. Do one.”For here in Hartlepool, folk have begun taking the law into their own hands. This week the gritty North Sea port was described as “the town where police have given up”.With a population of ,, Hartlepool has just ten officers on duty overnight. And a BBC investigation found that on one recent Saturday, all ten were tied up with incidents, leaving none to respond to  calls.The local force, Cleveland Police, has had nearly £million cut from its budget since  and has shed  officers. This week it announced the mothballing of Hartlepool’s custody suite, meaning that from next year, arrested suspects will have to be driven  miles to Middlesbrough to be questioned.Many locals I spoke to in Hartlepool this week say police have simply stopped responding to some calls.It is little wonder, many argue, that crime rates in the County Durham town — especially involving violence — have soared.Some here have even taken to Facebook to try to solve crimes when threadbare policing let them down.One member, Darren Price, , says: “We feel we’ve no option but to try to look after ourselves.“People are scared, especially at night. It is vans and houses getting broken into, anti-social behaviour.“We don’t blame the police. It is like the NHS, we know it is under-staffed and morale is low. We are just trying to give a helping hand.“We don’t encourage anybody on the patrols to engage with anybody who commits a crime, all we ask is to report it to the police.”Another member, self-employed gas engineer Paul Timlin was unable to work when cops failed to turn up for two weeks after he had £,-worth of tools stolen earlier this year.Outside his neat semi in the Hart Station area, he shows me how the thieves — “most likely druggies,” he says — were captured by his CCTV cameras ransacking his work van.Paul, , tells me: “I went down to the police station and told them I had CCTV but got no real response other than a crime number.“People behind the desk said it was a low-grade crime as far as they were concerned. But to me it was a valuable set of tools and the theft stopped me working.“I had to replace them quickly or I’d lose money daily, so I put my CCTV video on Facebook that day. People identied one of the guys.”Paul says he “knows a few people who know a few people”. A phone call was made to the villain saying: “Those tools need to be ed.”He adds: “Within the next day or two we got the tools back.”Around two weeks later police finally arrived to take a statement from Paul. He handed over the CCTV and the name of the criminal.He says: “The police said they had a major incident in Stockton on the day of my theft and just didn’t have the numbers. A few weeks later I got a message saying the case was closed. No further action would be taken.”He says he felt uneasy taking the law into his own hands, but adds: “Unfortunately, the police haven’t got the bodies to deal with this sort of crime, that’s why it’s on the rise.“Criminals realise the police’s response time is low. Partof my council tax is allocated to the police, but that wasn’t cut when Cleveland Police reduced their numbers by .”In Hartlepool’s Foggy Furze district, locals have welcomed the patrols by Stephen and eight other volunteers.Retired forklt truck driver David Dodds, , says: “I hope it’s a deterrent. The police should be doing it but I feel for the officers. It’s not their fault there’s not enough money.”Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that , crimes were recorded from the year to March.This means a rate of  crimes per , residents during  to  - above the England and Wales average of .Gun and kne possession offences rose from o to  incidents, while theft shot up by  per cent.The latest police figures also reveal the number of robberies between April  and March  more than doubled.There were  robberies - including violent muggings - in the period, which is an increase of . per cent in - when  were reported.Hartlepool also has the highest level of crime across the force area.At the nearby Ye Olde Durhams Social Club, supervisor Jacqui Hunter serves afternoon pints to mainly retirees from Hartlepool’s heavy industries. Drinkers here overwhelmingly welcome the community patrols.Mum-of-two Jacqui, , says: “We had cars broken into at am. We caught it on CCTV and called police. That was in March. We’re still waiting for police to pick up the CCTV footage. They give you a crime number, then you wait for weeks and nothing happens.”Retired toolmaker Dick Massey, , says: “I had the lead pinched from the canopy above my door three weeks ago. I went to the police station the next day.“I expected them to come and have a look but they didn’t. They just gave me a crime number. I’m not happy about it. I pay my taxes.“I asked them why you never see any police about now and they said, ‘We haven’t got the numbers’.“I’m not surprised people are organising their own patrols.”Co-ordinated via Facebook, the Foggy Furze Neighbourhood Patrol insist the “vigilante” tag they have been labelled with is wrong.Taxi driver Stephen, , says of his early-hours encounter this week: “If we were vigilantes we would have had them on the floor, face down, with our knees in their backs. We’re a deterrent. We called police and, to be fair, they arrived in five minutes. We gave them a description of the men but they’d gone.”Recorded crime in Hartlepool is up  per cent in a year. There were  robberies between April  and March , up more than  per cent on the previous year.Gun and kne possession offences rose from  to , while theft is up by  per cent.Hartlepool’s Labour MP Mike Hill has called an urgent meeting with police chiefs and described the recent instance of too few cops to answer Saturday night emergency calls as “unacceptable”.He tells The Sun: “I don’t condone vigilantism in any form and don’t see that as an issue in Hartlepool. But, clearly, we’re a step closer towards that unless we get funding to see more bobbies on Hartlepool’s streets.”Cleveland’s Chief Constable Mike Veale admits: “The service we are providing the public is nowhere near where it needs to be.”In a statement he says: “I would not be exhibiting the courage that my officers and staff deserveI continue to say we have enough resources,I continue with this commentary that things in policing are OK. They are not OK.“The cuts created and caused by austerity are too deep and have gone on for too long. My message is clear — give us the tools and we will do the job.” Since  police funding nationally has fallen  per cent and officer numbers by ,.Writing in The Sun this week, former Hartlepool Detective Superintendent Ray Mallon — nicknamed Robocop for his zero-tolerance approach that cut crime by  per cent — said that “simply giving police more money does not make them more effective”.He added that officers should be taken from specialist units such as CID and put back on the beat.Yet Chief Constable Veale’s broadside will resonate in Whitehall, where Home Secretary Sajid Javid last week promised a “fresh look” at police funding.But until the thin blue line becomes thicker in Foggy Furze, Stephen and his friends will be out protecting their neighbourhood."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004513656161.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"bungle chow puppy released cops","story":"The puppy smothered his family with loving licks after being released from police custody.He then tore through the house with his owners’ other dogs, Newfoundlands Fluffy and Gigi, before settling down in front of the TV.Bungle was also greeted by Sun reporters dressed as TV favourites Zippy and George.Owners David and Susan Hayes and their -year-old son Joseph were relieved he was home after five days.Joseph said: “It must have been so awful for him but he looks ashe’s back to his old self already.”Five-month-old Bungle was taken away by police after he escaped from his home near Towcester, Northants, and nipped an officer.But he was ed within hours of The Sun campaigning for his release under the headline “I’m a silly puppy . . . get me out of here!”.Banker David, , said: “He was a bit dishevelled so he’ll need a good groom.

By sniper fire.It turns out, however, that only two cities in ­Britain enforce yellow box laws with one, London, saying that they are ­handing out £ fines as fast as the postman can run. Almost  people a DAY are being fined at one junction alone.Offenders say they can’t help it and that poor traffic light sequencing is to blame. Hmmm. Well let’s impose my death penalty idea and seethey’re quite so willing to flout the law then.WE were always told the HS high-speed rail link would be worth it, as it could cut the journey time between London and the North West by as much as  or  seconds.But now, engineers are saying that trains will not be able to go through the tunnels as quickly as they’d hoped.So actually, ­Manchester United fans ­wanting to travel from where they live, in ­London, to Old ­Trafford may in fact be better off using a horse.MANY people ran into the street screaming this week when it was revealed that one of ­Britain’s top bosses was paid £million in the last financial year.And what’s more, it turns out that the boss in question, Denise Coates, pictured, from the gaming ­company Bet, was paid £million the year before. That’s nearly half a ­BILLION in two years.Even the Tories were cross, with one MP saying that no one in the country should be allowed to earn more than a million a year.Well, let’s think about that shall we Mrs Coates, who started the business herself, has donated more than £million to ious charities. She’s helped the victims of cancer, typhoons and even gave £, to a school in Stoke so they could help youngsters in Sierra Leone.She sounds to me like a very sound, very big-hearted and very good woman.And then there’s the small matter of how much tax she pays.As she still lives here, quietly, in Cheshire, it’ll be around  per cent of what she earns.Which means in the past two years, she’ll have given the Treasury about £million.That’s one taxpayer coughing up enough to build eight secondary schools.Which means she’s done a damn site more for the country and the world than some bitter and twisted MP who just wants to get her name in the papers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They are deluded and seem more worried about how the bloke might feel.I am not aware of this lad having done anything inappropriate, but it’s clearly wrong that he should be in a class with children.A mum added: “It was obvious he was a man.He welcomed news that the pupil had been identied as a male, saying: “All I wanted in the first place was for him to be removed and he has been.“My thoughts are that I’m ashamed both for the school and the Government for allowing this to happen. They have both failed to protect our children.Mr Newby kept his daughters away from the school after finding out about the pupil and only let themwhen he was certain the man was not going back.Sandy Martin, the Labour MP for Ipswich, said the Home Office “need to get their act together” to ensure adults cannot pose as children in the classroom.He said: “The Home Office needs to make sure that they are not sending people who are overage to school.“They have the means to do this and they need to do it. It doesn’t help the young people involved any more than it helps the schools.“I think the fact that it has had such a high profile in the news has made sure that the Home Office will do their job a bit better in the future, although the history of the Home Office doing its job a bit better isn’t very encouraging.”“The question is, how didn’t the Home Office or the teachers see what was ­blindingly obvious to everyone  “Heads need to roll and us parents won’t rest until we get a full explanation of what went wrong. It’s a massive safeguarding issue to have a man, whose background is not known, in a class full of youngsters.“He had chest hair and the body of a man. It beggars belief that it was ever allowed to happen.”An investigation was launched when a pupil posted a picture of their new classmate in unorm in a classroom on Snapchat with a message saying: “How’s there a -year-old man in our maths class ”Parents were shocked, and some even removed their children from the school as classmates shared old pictures of him on Facebook, showing him with a full beard, a hairy chest and swigging a beer.Sources confirmed that the ft in tall pupil who spoke poor English was assessed as being aged over  in an investigation ordered by the Home Office.While the Home Office has refused to reveal the newly-assessed age of the man - or any details of his background due to data protection issues - it is now understood that he is being treated as an adult asylum seeker.He could now face being thrown out of the UKhis claim for asylum is denied.A further probe into how he managed to pass as a student is being carried out.The stepfather of a girl in the same class as the pupil said he had gone to the school to complain before the man was removed and had contacted Suffolk Police to make a complaint that a grown man was “posing as a pupil” in her class.He said: “They logged my call and advised me to go back to the school and demand what action they were going to take.“I ended up speaking to this teacher who said that the Facebook picture of the boy was a case of mistaken identity.“The teacher actually threatened that all the parents who were jumping on the bandwagon could face legal action because complaining about the pupil was a criminal offence. He was basically calling all the parents bullies.“I explained that I was sorrythe pupil turned out to be a genuine -year-old, but that parents had a responsibility for the safeguarding of children in their care, as should the school.“The teacher told me that he had children himself and all the paperwork and been looked at for this person and had been passed by the Home Office. I was absolutely livid and was trying to behave myself.“He was so ignorant and not really listening to what I was saying. I wanted to kick him up the backside and tell him not to be so naïve.

If the application is unsuccessful, and appeal rights are exhausted, removal action will be pursued as appropriate.“In the absence of documentary evidence, Home Office staff are only able to treat a claimant as an adulttheir physical appearance and demeanour very strongly suggest that they are signicantly over  years of age – and where two officers have reached this conclusion independently.“The threshold is set deliberately high so that only those who are very clearly over  are assessed as adults.”The pupil was removed from the school earlier this month on the day he was due to sit a mock GCSE maths exam and has not been seen there since.The Ormiston Academies Trust confirmed at the time that the pupils were “not attending the school” and that it had asked the Home Office to investigate the case.The school has not made any new statement and Suffolk County Council has also not responded to requests for comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000449960","title":"britains castles brought back to glory technology","story":"These are the castles reconstructed with computer animation in all their former glory.On the brooding coastal clfs of north Country Antrim sits the ruin of Dunluce Castle, built by the MacQuillan family around .The castle was later seized by the MacDonnell clan who stamped their mark on it under the leadership of famous warrior chieftain Sorely Boy MacDonnell.But it was Sorley Boys grandson, the nd Earl of Antrim, and his we who finally decided to abandon Dunluce.In  as they were waiting for dinner one evening the kitchen, along with kitchen staff, fell into the sea. This is thought to have been the final straw.On a remote headland in Northumberland, built by Earl Thomas of Lancaster in , sits Dunstanburgh Castle.Constructed during a time when the earls relationship with King Edward II was becoming increasingly hostile, the earl failed to reach the fortress when his rebellion failed and was executed in .The castle was later passed onto John of Gaunt, who strengthened it against the Scots by converting the great twin towered gatehouse into a keep.During the Wars of the Roses the fortress was twice besieged and captured by Yorkist forces.As the Scottish border became more stable, King James I sold the property to private owners in  but it was neglected and subsequently fell into decay.Perched upon a steep bank above the River Clyde in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, is Bothwell Castle.Owing its origins to Walter of Moray, an aristocratic family that acquired Bothwell in .The family designed the grand castle as a display of feudal pride, but their dreams were never completed, with the outbreak of the Wars of Independence in  delaying progress.After the wars, Bothwell Castle passed to another powerful noble family, the Black Douglases, and they rebuilt the fortress following an updated design.After the Black Douglases were overthrown in , Bothwell Castle changed hands several times, with it slowly deteriorating along the way.

It is now owned by English Heritage and open to the public.Caerlaverock Castle in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, is a moated triangular fortication first built in the th century by the Maxwell family.It was besieged by the English during the Wars of Scottish Independence, and underwent several reconstructions over the th and th centuries.In , the fortress was besieged for the last time and was subsequently abandoned.

It started out as a wooden structure but was later rebuilt in stone.In , its strength was put to the test during the rebellion of Owain Glyn Dŵr.The town of Kidwelly fell to the attackers but the castle held out.The National Museum of Wales notes that the old town never recovered from the attack and in the centuries that followed, the castles fortunes also declined and, in , it was described as greatly decayed."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000451540346.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"fish chip sop pigs blankets christmas","story":"Bestwood Fisheries in Nottingham have taken the traditional sausage-wrapped-in-bacon Christmas dinner staple to a whole new level.The colossal banger is a foot-long, wrapped in bacon, battered and deep-fried.The family-run chippy in Arnold Road is the first to put a twist on its battered sausages last year.Co-owner Antoni Tsiolas, who mans the fryers with cousin George Keliris, said: A lot of people are excited about them again.

Pack up Theresa and inform the Sun.Pour away the inept and sweep the dead wood. This party now can never come to any good. If theres one thing Western democracy has proven, it is that no-one can be trusted with power for very long.A first administration achieves change the second stagnates and a third,it appears, eats itself from the feet up. The same is true of every party, in every nation, and there is none among us who would be immune to the madness of power were it delivered for a third time.It sends all politicians who have ever managed it into the sort of cocaine-inspired bender Elton John was once famous for - trying to outdo Freddie Mercury with their own sense of misplaced grandeur, while actually being destined for a le in which they look forward to the John Lewis Christmas ad. It happened to Thatcher, it happened to Blair, and now its happening to the entire Conservative Party at once. This time its not a prime ministers career doomed to failure -  years of British politics is circling the plughole, entirely unaware of its looming extinction.   Over Thatchers time in office she burned every friend she had, endeared herself to half the country by presiding over an economic boom, and flushed middle-class goodwill down the toilet with the poll tax. Tory MPs with an eye to their own survival queued up to kne her as their only escape, and combined with the fact shed destroyed the other half of the country along with unions and manufacturing her time was nigh. Blair started out as a nice-sweatered saviour and came to believe he was genuinely touched by God, able to heal wars, depose despots with his righteousness and had no need to plan for the future because he was going to be raptured as soon as hed fixed the Middle East. He even tried to go one better than Jesus by cutting a deal with his personal Judas, and the net result was the whole Labour Party got stuck in the psychodrama and forgot they were supposed to be working for the people.Now we are in our eighth year of the Tories being in control, and theyve gone completely round the bend in half the time it took the others. Lets be kind. Theyve managed a fourth administration on a technicality, been presented with the most complex political problem in British history, and had the backwash of the Great Recession to deal with. But a party operating in the realms of sanity would not have called the fourth election, would not have attempted to settle centuries of squabbling with Europe by flipping a coin, or claimed to be fixing the economy by letting bankers keep their hands on the interestingly-smashy bits.The fact they were going round the twist so early in their reign is the surest sign this is the end game all decisions since  have been touched by madness, with the inevitable result that the Tories now think they really CAN lick their elbow because theyve spent so long claiming to be the only party you can trust with dficult stuff. Every economic, housing, health, justice and education policy did more to reduce than to improve them. This is not a political point but a factual one - the Tories have managed not one single victory, no shining achievement, in almost a decade of control. But there is a near-infinite number of turds. They deported British citizens in the Windrush scandal. They watched  people die in a towering inferno and sent benefit fraudsters to jail quicker than those who caused the deaths. Under their rule , people are thought to have needlessly died. An unprecedented rise in mortality has been linked directly to their policies. The greatest British invention of all time, the National Health Service, is being thoughtlessly destroyed for lack of maintenance. More than a million people are living in destitution and while they crow about near-full employment, millions of those in work rely on charity to feed their families.The Tories, whatever you may think of them, have never been so definitively linked to death and misery. If they had their wits about them, the backbenchers should, about now, be trying to dig their party out of this homicidal mire. Instead theyre declaring every disaster is someone s fault.  Having secured the countrys backing for Brexit, they spent two years arguing with themselves to the detriment of the British economy. Having secured the agreement of the EU on how to Brexit, they want to go back to negotiating it. And despite being called the Conservative and Unionist Party they seem prepared to throw Northern Ireland on the bonfire to appease their most eccentric members.They spent the first year of negotiations demanding Theresa May call an election to secure her mandate, and after she did so spent the second year demanding her head. The million letters of no confidence they cheerfully predicted turned into  they expected by pm, then definitely , then somewhere nearer . They dont even have confidence in their lack of confidence, and their only chance of passing a motion is with internal application of WD-. And while repeatedly calling themselves the party of law and order they let off their own sex pest because he says he was ill, when all sex pests in whatever courts remain open are sent down without mercy.Theyre now a minority government pretending theyre not, killing citizens while claiming to be acting in the national interest, and the only reason this rabid party hasnt been put out of its self-destructive misery is because the Opposition is too busy shooting itself in the foot.

So why doesn’t the king of UKIP get his modern-day Tommy Cromwell to share his expertise on other subjects like assault, drugs, public order offences, mortgage fraud and using someone ’s passport to travel to the USA, all of which he has convictions for  Also, Gerard, can you be more specic about his advisory remit  It’s Asian rapists only, isn’t it Because Robinson has never condemned the string of white paedophiles with links to the EDL, such as Peter Gillett, jailed last month for  years for raping children as young as eight. And can you ensure the remit doesn’t involve caring about the child rape victims BecauseRobinson did care about them, why has he constantly attempted to do the one thing that could have stopped them getting justice: risked causing the trials of their accused to crash due to his behaviour  Oh, and while you’re at it, why not bring Katie Hopkins in to advise on how to sink the boats of the refugee cockroaches heading from Africa to Europe    It’s not hard to see what Batten, who has openly called Islam a “death cult”, is up to.Swelling his diminished party ranks by targeting lies and bigotry at white working-class people who feel dispossessed by immigration, while wrapping it up in conspiracy theories about liberal elites.And riding the wave of far-right fervour that pollutes the global shypolitical narrative through hate preachers like Marine Le Pen, Donald Trump and Nigel Farage. The one funny aspect of this disturbing story is Farage being “appalled” at his “non-racist” party hiring Robinson.That’s the same Farage who spoke at a neo-Nazi AfD rally in Germany and who unveiled his blatantly racist “breaking point” poster showing crowds of queuing migrants during the EU referendum. Maybe he’s jealous there’s a younger kid on the block getting all the fascist love. But that’s where the humour stops. Because there’s nothing funny about giving a mainstream voice to a neo-Nazi.That leads to another voice yelling “Britain First” as an MP like Jo Cox is murdered in broad daylight. Or the number of far-right terrorists jailed in Britain more than tripling in the past year.Or to a rally in support of Robinson drawing the largest fascist gathering Britain had seen since Oswald Mosley’s Blackshirts. And don’t for a minute think we’ll neverto those dark days of the s because, as the Germans found out, when you start with a grievance against an Establishment which you believe has stolen your birthright, when you scapegoat a religion, talk up your own race as being superior, have a largely non-challenging media, expound a belief that breaking the law to protect the defence of the motherland is fine, and a jailed martyr, you can soon find your country in a very dark place. Maybe that’s what Gerard Batten really needs advising on.

On Twitter, the mum wrote: Bit shocked, just tried to book this apartment in Liverpool for me and my children and they don’t accept booking from Scousers. The tweet was followed by a screen grab with a reply from a member of staff at Host So Simple who said due to past issues the company could not take bookings from people from Liverpool. The full reply said: Thank you for your message.   Unfortunately we cannot accept guests who are from Liverpool themselves as we have had a lot of issues with this in the past, where guests had told us they were coming as a family and were not and had a lot of people who come who were not part of the guest list. Of course I understand that this does not apply to everyone who requests under this circumstance. I hope you understand and I sincerely hope you can find accommodation for your stay.

We are a young, Liverpool-based business, owned and operated by Scousers and we welcome everyone to our properties within the terms of each inidual booking.   It is an industry wide issue that parties from across the country will book in to luxury apartments and create thousands of pounds worth of damage, and in this instance the property has had a previous problem booking from locals, which is why they came to Host So Simple to manage their experience. Last minute local bookings have created issues for us in the past and the owner has stipulated that for this specic property we should be on high alert.

Turning from the window, he laughs that his cravat is similar to the one he was wearing then, too. “My mother was making sure I was smart. I arrived here in one,” he smiles. “I’ve always preferred them.” But the clear dference between  and  is then -year-old Leslie was attempting bravely to look forwards today, aged , he is bravely looking back. With -year-old grandson Oscar by his side, he sits on the Harwich to London Liverpool Street train retracing his steps as one of  Jewish children to arrive on the first Kindertransport.   December  will mark eight decades since that groundbreaking rescue mission as the persecution faced by Jews in Nazi Germany intensied. They were waved off in Berlin, taken by train to the Hook of Holland, and then sailed across the Channel to arrive in Harwich, Essex the following day. Weeks later, young Leslie shytravelled this route to London before being transferred to a boarding school in Kent. Some , more children would follow until the outbreak of war in September . Recalling that first morning, Leslie says: “We landed after a very stormy night, everyone except me was sick. “We were all unslept, unkempt, unwashed and bewildered. We were in the same clothes, I had only eaten the shysandwiches my mother gave me.  Holocaust survivor tells of brave Polish family who risked their lives to protect him“I brought underclothes, carefully labelled with my name which my mother had stitched, a couple of extra shirts and an extra sweater, handkerchiefs, a book or two, and a tiny little teddy bear.” But the most treasured items were passport photographs of his mother and father, Charlotte and Arthur Baruch, and beloved sister Eva Susanne, who was two years older. Is there anything  he wishes he had been able to bring  “My sister,” Leslie replies, his voice almost lost in a train announcement. Leslie heard Eva chose not to come because she had fallen in love with a doctor at the hospital where she was a trainee nurse. Later, the -year-old wrote she had received a suitcase as a gt, a hint she may have changed her mind. It was too late. She and their parents were transported to their deaths in . “She was a headstrong young woman,” says Leslie. “We quarrelled of course, but we loved each other... I’ve had a huge dose of luck in my le.  But then there was my family’s fate...” That luck began with his parents’ selflessness. When Nazi shypersecution in his shyhometown of Koumlslin, then in Germany but now Poland, drove him from school, they sent him to an orphanage in Berlin to protect him. It did so more than they could have known. After Kristallnacht in early November , when the Nazis ransacked Jewish property and shysynagogues, he was one of seven from the orphanage selected by the director for the Kindertransport. “I don’t know on what basis I was chosen,” Leslie shrugs. “He was taken to Auschwitz and died. Most of the boys that remained were sent there, too. The real heroes of the Kindertransport were the parents. They gave away their children without knowing where they would finish up.” On December  his stood at the station. “I can see them still. They tried to maintain a stf upper lip and not cry,” he says.  “They waved shyhandkerchiefs. I didn’t cry. To an extent it was an adventure, not realising we’d never see our parents again.” Oscar admits shyly: “I think I’d cry. To leave your parents. If grandpa had not come over, I wouldn’t be here. It is amazing.” Leslie recalls the complete hush on the train. The Nazi police were hostile in some carriages children were abused. “We were told we had to be on our very best behaviour in case the German authorities threw us off or turned the train back,” he says. On reaching Holland that changed. Astonishingly, a photograph captures Leslie in that moment, standing in the carriage within a group, anxiety darkening his face. “I was thinking where am I going, what’s happening to me, what does the future hold ” he recalls. The atmosphere in Harwich as the children stepped off the boat to a throng of press was welcoming. “The policemen smiled at us,” he says. They were taken to the holiday camp Dover Court. Some were selected by couples, but he was chosen for Bunce Court boarding school in Kent. He flourished there, while missing his family, who sent treasured Red Cross telegrams. The last came in September  from his father.  Leslie describes the “extremely wild handwriting.” It reads, simply: “We are going on a journey.” “I know now he had already been told to go to an assembly point two days later. At the time I didn’t know what it meant,” he adds. Leslie joined the British army in , changing his name to Brent, hoping he would be helping his family. Tragically, they were already dead. He assumed they died in Auschwitz. In , shytravelling in Poland on a lecture tour as a scientist specialising in immunology, he visited the former camp, and broke down for the first time. It was to be a few more decades before official records revealed they were taken to Riga, Latvia, and shot in woodland. After making contact with a friend who survived, Leslie adds: “I discovered when my parents were deported Eva needn’t have gone. She was working in a hospital serving both Jews and non-Jews so she might have been protected.  But she didn’t want to leave them.” It’s important to Leslie people know about his headstrong sister and his brave parents. He couldn’t do anything for them  years ago but he can do this. He sits close to the grandson who would not be here today without the Kindertransport, and smiles. “When I die there will be no one left who knew them. But it keeps them alive when they are in people’s memories.”For more information visit ajr.org.uk.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are leaving west London and moving into the -bedroom home, near Windsor Castle, to raise a family in a quieter setting amid alleged tension with Prince William. The Queen is giving them their own pad on a Windsor estate - Frogmore House - thats been a favourite royal hideaway for more than  years and is home to a royal burial ground. The Grade II-listed cottage is said to be undergoing a multi-million pound refit, paid for by the taxpayer, before pregnant Meghan gives birth to the couples first child. Kensington Palace confirmed the move on Saturday, saying Windsor is a very special place for the couple.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, whose due date is in the spring, will move into their main official residence early next year once the refit is complete. It is claimed that they had planned to move into one of Kensington Palaces main apartments, next to William and Kate, but there has been a bit of tension between the brothers. It is likely that it will get a full security upgrade to keep prying eyes away. Previously, the public could walk right up to the property, which was surrounded by a small fence with a sign reading Private. The couple currently live in their first marital home, a cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace in west London, where Prince William and Kate Middleton also reside.  Frogmore Cottage has more than enough space for the Sussex family and a nursery for their baby - and even a gym or a yoga studio - with  bedrooms. Formerly known as Double Garden Cottage, the home is set within Windsor Castles Home Park and faces the stunning and sprawling grounds of Frogmore House, which will no doubt become a more popular stop on the Windsor tourist trail. The cottage is currently ided into five units which were home to royal staff, but it will be transformed into a family home with modern amenities. Frogmore Cottage is set in an area that has sentimental value and many memories for the Duke, , and Duchess, .  Its half a mile south of Windsor Castle, the Queens summer residence, and St Georges Chapel, where Harry and Meghan tied the knot in May as millions around the world watched on TV. Their wedding reception, hosted by the Prince of Wales, was held at Frogmore House, which was also where the couples engagement photos were taken. They reportedly had a summer picnic there in  before getting engaged. Frogmore House is in a peaceful and secluded location, surrounded by  acres of lush vegetation and Berkshire countryside.  The estate has its own man-made lake, Frogmore Lake, and is home to the Royal Burial Ground and the tomb of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Those interred at the burial ground include King Edward VIII and his we Wallis Simpson - the orced American socialite whose intended marriage to Edward sparked a constitutional crisis and led to his abdication in . Meghan is the second American orcee to marry into the Royal Family, but unlike Wallis she has been warmly received. Frogmore House was once home to Victorias mother, the Duchess of Kent, for almost  years. Her remains are also held there, in an elegant mausoleum. The House - built in the s and purchased by Queen Charlotte, we of George III in  - is open to the public just one month a year, in August, plus three charity open days in June.   The sprawling grounds allowed Queen Charlotte to indulge her love of botany, as the gardens, initially flat, were filled with , trees and many rare and unusual plants. Charlottes Vice-Chamberlain, Major William Price, and the Rev. Christopher Alderson of Derbyshire transformed the estate, creating the winding lake, wooded mounds, glades, walks and bridges in the Picturesque style. Tickets cost up to pound a person through the Royal Collection Trust. Inside, there are grand and elegant rooms - including one decorated by th-century flower painter Mary Moser. Princess Elizabeth, the daughter of George III and Charlotte, painted garlands in The Cross Gallery.  The Britannia Room is furnished with items from the Royal Yacht Britannia, which was decommissioned in . Watercolours by Victorias daughters, Princesses Victoria and Louise, are still in the House. Public access is extremely limited because Frogmore House, currently uninhabited, is still used by the Queen and other members of the Royal Family as a retreat for private and official royal engagements. Frogmore House was built by Hugh May, Charles IIs architect, and given a name that refers to the abundance of frogs in the surrounding, low-lying marshy area.  It became a royal residence about  years later and has become a hideaway for royal couples and families, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh and their children. Victoria was fond of Frogmores peace and quiet, and it is said to have been her favourite retreat, visiting during her long widowhood and working on her papers there. Frogmore Cottage was once home to Abdul Karim, Victorias Munshi, or teacher. A summerhouse in the form of a Gothic ruin and a teahouse made for Victoria are both still standing on the estate.  George VI and the Queen Mother honeymooned in the grounds in . In , it hosted the wedding reception of Princess Annes son Peter Phillips and his Canadian we Autumn. Last year, the Queen called it a wonderfully relaxing environment that holds a special place infamily’s affection. Harry and former Suits actress Meghan are currently residing at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace.  Once they move to Windsor, their office will continue to be based at Kensington Palace. It is claimed that the couple opted for secluded Frogmore Cottage over a -room flat next door to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who reside in a -room apartment with children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. The Sun quoted an unnamed royal source, who said: The initial plan was for Harry and Meghan to move out of their cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace and into one of the main apartments. But there has been a bit of tension between the brothers.  Now Harry and Meghan don’t want to live next to William and Kate and want to strike out on their own. The couple need more room and hope the Frogmore Cottage renovation will be complete before they welcome their baby, the source claimed. In a statement, Kensington Palace said on Saturday: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will move to Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor Estate early next year as they prepare for the arrival of their first child. The couple have lived at Nottingham Cottage since their engagement last year. Windsor is a very special place for Their Royal Highnesses and they are grateful that their official residence will be on the estate. The Duke and Duchesss office will continue to be based at Kensington Palace. The Duke and US-born Duchess of Sussex will keep their country home in the Cotswolds while they reside in Windsor.

Its said one of the Imams at Al Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre, in west London, had implied women who listened to music were at risk of becoming strippers and they should not pray while they are on their periods. The Duchess of Sussex has promoted a charity book on the back of numerous visits to the Hubb Community Kitchen, which is based at the mosque. Profits of Together: Our Community Cookbook supports the families of the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire, which happened less than two miles away. And Thetoday alleges the Imam in question, Samer Darwish, also claimed in the past women should not cry when visiting graves. But these attitudes are at odds with what the Duchess has campaigned for in the past. She has been praised for her feminist values and has supported charities that empower women.  Three of the four Beatles terror suspects - Choukri Ellekhli, Alexanda Kotey and Aine Davis - are believed to have attended the mosque. The trio, all from west London, were involved in jihadist activity and became one of the Islamic States most notorious terrorist silos. They were led by ISIS fighter Jihadi John, real name was Mohammed Emwazi, who was killed by a drone strike in Syria three years ago . The terrorist group was behind the murder US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning and aid worker and Iraq war veteran Peter Kassig.  A spokesman for the mosque said the Muslim centre was on the record rejecting and condemning extremism and terrorism. The kitchen, redesigned with the womens input to capture its spirit as a place for the community to come together over meals, opens seven days a week, up from just two when it began last year. A source told : The funds raised by the book are supporting the Hubb Community Kitchen, which is an independent project that leases space from Al Manaar.

Now Nicola - who has a four-year-old daughter, Olivia-Mai, with Darren - is aiming to raise money for an epilepsy charity as well as awareness about the illness in his memory, the Stoke Sentinel reports. The -year-old speech therapist said: Darren and I had separated but we were still really close and he was a massive part of my le.   I got a phone call when I got home from work to say that Darren had gone for a swim and was later found at the bottom of the pool. He was pulled out of the pool and resuscitated. He was transferred to intensive care and was kept on le support for  days. I flew out there to be with him and support his family. He had been without oxygen for more than the maximum time to survive. The medics said he had all the symptoms of brain-stem death. It was a massive shock to lose him. The hardest part was telling our daughter. We both miss him terribly, I feel like Ive lost my best friend.  Darren, who lived atTrentham, had suffered from epilepsy for most of his le. Nicola said in the last couple of years his seizures had become more frequent and more complex. Nicola, ofNewcastle, said: Darren was a brilliant dad. He was very loyal and a massive Stoke City fan. He was focused on his career - he was training to be a maintenance engineer at the New Look distribution centre. He wanted to live his le as normally as everyone .   We have to focus on something positive to help us through this, so we are doing a lot of work with the charity SUDEPAction. At the moment,  people in the UK die every week due to SUDEP, usually young people. I want to help promote SUDEP Actions safety checklist to help raise awareness. Ive also got together with Darrens friend, Dave Bithell, to do a charity CD to raise money. Singer Dave had known Darren for around  years, after they met through their mutual love for Stoke City. Dave was putting together his fourth CD to raise money for charity when Nicola suggested supporting SUDEP Action following the August tragedy.  The -year-old, who lives at The Westlands, said: When I heard about Darren it was devastating news. Nicola got in touch and suggested this charity. The CD is my way of trying to turn something negative into something positive. When Darren died I knew what epilepsy was but I didnt realise the statistics on how many people are affected by it. The CD has already raised pound, and I want to raise as much money as possible. The CD, which contains the tracks - Heroes by David Bowie and Never Enough from The Greatest Showman soundtrack - features a host of local performers. It is on sale for pound and to buy a copy email Dave at bithelld@gmail.

Despite reportedly having doubts about their marriage, the note was supportive and offered her advice for the big day. In her new book about Camilla, royal author Penny Junor writes: The night before the wedding, which Diana spent at Clarence House with her sister Jane, he sent her a note, along with a signet ring that bore the Prince of Wales feathers.

Flight Lieutenant Thomas Hansfords targets were more than a mile away from each other during a coalition blitz in September last year. He had to navigate his fighter jet through thunderstorms as he wiped out the suicide trucks in a series of air strikes on his first Operation Shader mission as lead pilot. Flt Lt Hansford has now been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, which recognises an act or acts of valour, courage or devotion to duty whilst flying in active operations against the enemy. PTSD soldier reveals how horror of war meant he couldnt cope with everyday le Backing up the Syrian Democratic Forces, he and another pilot had been patrolling the skies over Hawijah, in eastern Syria, for five hours when they spotted the ISIS truck bombs. The vehicles, intended to kill and cause further terror in the region and, were obstacles on the road into Hawijah, near Syrias border with Iraq. Flt Lt Hansford fired four Paveway IV laser-guided bombs to destroy the trucks and the explosives amid Britains involvement in a US-led anti-ISIS operation.  After a record nine hours, he flew back to his base in the Mediterranean, RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus. Flt Lt Hansford, of  Fighter Squadron, was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross on Friday. He and other armed forces heroes listed in the latest operation honours will be recognised during a ceremony at Buckingham Palace next year. Flt Lt Hansford said: I feel incredibly proud to have been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, yet lucky to be in this position when I am confident that any other pilot on the squadron or Typhoon Force would have achieved equal successtasked with the same mission.  It still feels surreal to be receiving such a prestigious award. None of the Typhoon operations against Daeshwould be possible without the teamwork and tireless support of our ground crew and air-air refuelling units. His citation read: Flight Lieutenant Hansford demonstrated exceptional leadership, judgment and bravery during his first mission as a lead pilot. The complexity of this simultaneous strike required him to precisely enter ying cockpit switch selections, controlling sensors and weapons. A single error could have resulted in a failure of the mission and a direct threat to friendly forces on the ground. The Distinguished Flying Cross has been awarded since June , shortly after the Royal Air Force was formed.

In the south east, Leigh Bell Wharf and Clacton Groyne , both in Essex, were found to be below par.  Other poor beaches included Weston-super-Mare , Burnham Jetty North, both in Somerset, and Combe Martin, Instow and Ilfracombe Wildersmouth, all of which are in Devon. The results may sound bad but they compare to just  per cent of beaches passing water quality tests in the early s.

Weston’s Cleaner Coastlines group member Debbie Apted told the Weston Mercury she was surprised and disappointed’by the result.  She said: “This issue must be addressed. Our sewers were built in the Victorian era and not designed to be blocked with plastic items, many of which we find on our beach cleans. “The main culprits we come across are cotton bud sticks – hundreds of them, wipes and tampon applicators. “It is vital to get the message across that we must not use our toilets as bins.”  Emma Howard Boyd, Chair of the Environment Agency, reportedly said:: Seaside tourism is worth over pound billion to the economy and good water quality is essential for people to visit and enjoy our beautul beaches. The Environment Agencys hard work has helped  beaches achieve the top Excellent or Good ratings this year and at beach cleans throughout the summer Ive seen the commitment of local communities and campaigners to reduce pollution and protect our environment.

The cold snap could begin as early as next week. Northern England and Scotland were told to brace for a bumper  to  days of snow and ice disruption. While the South faces  to  days’ snow and ice.  Freezes will peak after Christmas. Forecasters blame the bitter outlook on more Arctic chills and fewer mild Atlantic spells affecting Britain this winter. Leon Brown, head of meteorological operations at The Weather Company’s Weather Channel arm, said: “This winter looks colder than normal. Scotland and parts of northern England are expected to see  to  days of snow and ice cold weather disruption, with the coldest spells in the New Year. “Southern England is looking at  days of disruption, or  days in a worst-case scenario.  “Minimum temperatures well below -C, so around -C locally, are expected. “Snow and ice are expected in both the South and North, so people should be prepared for signicant travel disruption on roads, rail and at airports. Travellers should pay attention to weather warnings. “The jet stream is expected to slacken, lessening the Atlantic’s influence on our weather and allowing cold conditions from the north to become established.” The Met Office November to January forecast said: “The highest chance of any cold weather impacts is towards the end of the period.” "},{"url":null,"title":"vital phone call meghan markle","story":"NewsVital phone call Meghan Markle will get from royals before going out on Christmas DayThe royals have strict traditions and protocols they must carry out on Christmas DayShareCommentsByMirror:,  NOV NewsMeghan Markle will have to get used to the royal familys Christmas traditions \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIts tough being a royal at Christmas.

Any family member who has been invited to holiday with the Queen and Prince Philip must follow these rules. Royal protocol is normally worked out according to precedence and seniority, with the most junior and least important arriving first.  Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince William and Prince Harry are always the last to turn up, except from the Queen and Prince Philip. They then form a “welcoming” committee for the Queen and Prince Philip. The Queen also likes to slum it to Sandringham on public transport and has been known to take the Thameslink train to Kings Lynn, surprising passengers.

Steph Nally, , says she asked a GP for the test after suffering excruciating back pain on and off for four years. The mum-of-two had been diagnosed with sciatica and was repeatedly sent home with painkillers. But after suffering abnormal bleeding she requested a smear - months after being given the all-clear following a previous test. Steph said that because of her earlier results, she was turned down - months before being given the bombshell news she had stage four cancer. Steph, from Wythenshawe, south Manchester, started chemotherapy last week. Her devastated family have vowed to help her fight the disease and are trying to raise funds to send Steph for alternative treatment abroad.

When police told him he had failed the polygraph test, he broke down, admitted he was not a good man and told police where he could find his victims bodies. Watts, who was having an affair with a colleague, had smothered the girls and strangled Shanann, loaded their bodies into his truck and dumped them at the oil site where he worked.  The girls were found submerged in a mixture of oil and water in ft tanks, while Shanann, who was  weeks pregnant with a boy she planned to call Nico, was buried in a shallow grave. Watts, from Frederick, Colorado, told police the girls were still wearing nightgowns, and Shanann was wearing just a black or grey T-shirt and underwear. He was jailed for le last Monday after he pleaded guilty to murdering his we and daughters, and unlawfully terminating a pregnancy.  He admitted the offences in a plea deal to avoid a possible death sentence. It has emerged that Watts didnt want a third child, he wanted to start a new le with his mistress, Nichol Kessinger, who says she thought he was orced, and he and his we were having serious financial problems. Text messages revealed by police show that Shanann had tried to save their marriage, and she had bought him self-help and counselling books, which he had binned.  Watts told investigators that he had fallen out of love with Shanann and he was in love with Nichol. Police documents revealed after the sentencing hearing say Watts finalised his twisted plan at a birthday party, and then took his daughters home, where they were murdered in their beds in the early hours of August . Shanann, a Le-Vel distributor, was killed that morning after she ed from a business trip to Phoenix, Arizona. Later that day, Watts claimed they were missing, but his mistress and neighbours say he did not seem distressed.  He went on TV pleading for their safe , but he quickly became the prime suspect. Watts gave a voluntary polygraph test on August , but he failed as he was questioned about whether he had killed his family. During the interview at the police station in Frederick, he told an FBI agent: I cheated on her. Im not proud of it. She accused me of it. I denied it.  He added: I feel horrible for it. Like, she was pregnant. I didnt hurt her. He claimed he would never harm his daughters, telling the FBI agent: If I could have my babies back home right now, I would. I want them back. I want everybody back. That is the Gods honest truth. After Watts was told that he had failed the test - it came back with a deception indicated result - he confessed to strangling Shanann, but claimed he did so after she had strangled the girls.  Watts claimed his we reacted angrily after she found out that he was cheating on her. But a prosecutor and police said his claims were a lie and he wanted a new le with his lover. In court, Watts admitted killing all three, plus the unborn baby. Investigators asked himthe girls were still alive. He responded: They’re gone, there’s no bringing them back.  Watts was allowed to speak to his father, Ronnie, after his partial confession. When his dad asked him where the bodies were, he said of the girls: They’re in a freakin oil tank. I didn’t know what  to do. Please, God, forgive me for everything. I’m not a good man. He also told investigators: I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t know what to f***ing do. None of this made sense. Why would she hurt my f***ing girls  After killing his we and daughters, Watts went to work at Anadarko Petroleum and acted like nothing had happened, and later claimed they were missing.

It disappeared in Lake Huron, Canada in  and, even though people survived, the wreck was never found. For decades, the site of the ship has remained a mystery. But it has now been located beneath the waters where it plied its trade in Lake Huron, Canada – and some of its most precious cargo is still aboard.  Maritime historian Cris Kohl said: “There is a long-held superstition among sailors thatsomeone changes the name of a ship, that person and or that ship will encounter bad luck. “When new owners moved the vessel to Lake Huron from Lake Ontario in early , they changed the name to Manasoo. Under its new name, the vessel lasted less than one year before sinking with tragic results in September , he continued. The Manasoo proved to be a classic example of the bad luck that will plague a vessel after its name has been changed.”  Along with fellow shipwreck hunters Ken Merryman and Jerry Eliason, Mr Kohl located the wreck at a depth of ft near Grfith Island, Ontario. The Manasoo, which was built in Glasgow in , spent  years of its le as the Macassa before it changed ownership and was renamed. However, according to sailors’ superstition, a renamed ship will be cursed with misfortune – and true to form the Manasoo was tragically lost within a year. The ship had been having a very successful first season under its new name and owners, when at am on September , , it encountered a violent storm. Captain John McKay, seeing the ship settling at its stern, realised something was terribly wrong and made for the nearby island, but the Manasoo sank before it reached the shore. The cause of the sinking remains unexplained, but it’s been suggested that the cargo of  cattle may have shted in the storm, making the ship list dangerously. No human or animal remains have been found inside the wreck, however a  Chevrolet Coupe – now covered in mussels – is still parked aboard the vessel. It belonged to the owner of the cattle, Donald Wallace, who was the only passenger to survive the sinking.  It is very rare to see a car, an automobile, on a shipwreck, said Mr Kohl. Images of the vessel show its pilot house, complete with wheel and compass, is still intact, while the presence of leboats testies to the speed at which she sank. The car is also visible, as well as the fallen smokestack, the cabins, the dining salon, and the cattle pens. Most of the damage is to the stern of the ship, true to the accounts of its sinking. The very unique thing about the wreck of the Manasoo is that it sits on the lake bottom at the very same dramatic angle at which it sank, said Mr Merryman. The stern is embedded up to its railing in the soft bottom, while the bow points up towards the surface, rising high above the lake bottom.  The Manasoo was given its fateful name to reflect its new primary ports of call, Manitoulin Island and “The Soo” - a local nickname for Sault Ste. Marie. After she sank, her captain, four sailors and one passenger drted on a le raft for  hours before they were intercepted by a passing steamer, the Manitoba. It was too late for one of the men, chief engineer Thomas McCutcheon, who had already died from exposure. Efforts began immediately to locate further survivors, but to no avail. No quest devoted to the saving of human lives was in these parts ever carried out more unselfishly and more faithfully,” wrote local historian William Fox in . To the deep regret of all who were engaged in it, not another survivor of the disaster was found. The team who discovered the wreck will now study it further, and Mr Kohl plans to include the vessel in his next book. You can watch the ers tour the wreck in the video above.

It’s a tight league and everybody keeps beating everybody .“We need to keep going and get three points wherever we can, others can worry about thatthey want.”Even so, the summer arrival from Dunfermline admits to draw level with a team who looked almost out of sight just under two months ago would be a boost.“We knowwe go and win against Ayr we will be level with the team who are top of the league right now, so that’s a massive incentive for us.“We were eight points behind when the manager came in andwe have wiped that out by next Friday it would be a big achievement.“It shows the dference in the team now but what is most important is we keep working hard in training every day and get the points at the weekends.”That dference he refers to meant his recall to the starting XI took him by surprise, though it was one he was ready for.“It was brilliant to be back on from the start but to be honest I wasn’t expecting it because the boys have been doing brilliant.“When you get your chance it’s important you take it and I was delighted to get  minutes and help out with a goal.“My last start was Queen of the South away in the second league game of the season, so the next one has been a long time in coming.“I picked up an injury and that set me back for a while but I’ve been working hard in training to get my fitness back up.“When you’ve been out you need to get yourself prepared for when you do come back but, obviously, the boys have been great and I did think I might have had to wait a bit longer than this.“It’s a massive squad here and a great squad as well.

I’ve been very pleased with what we’ve seen from him so far.”Curran’s role has changed under the new manager after previous boss Neil McCann wanted to develop him into an attacking full-back.McIntyre, though, sees him further up the pitch where he can use his pace to hurt opposing teams more directly.Also able to play as a central midfielder, Curran’s versatility has its uses for a manager but Jim has urged the young Aussie to “nail down a position” to really fulfil the potential he sees in him.The Dens boss said: “I see him playing further forward rather than right-back, though I know he can play there.

It was aspirational and we knew that we wouldn’t get everything asked for.”However, the value of the deal – less than half of what was aspired to – has left some disappointed.West End Labour councillor Richard McCready said: “I will be seeking an explanation of the downgrading of expectations of what can be achieved through the deal.”"},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged pound million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"hydro-turns-five-meet-the-head-of-entertainment-who-spoke-on-anniversary","story":"OVER five million concert-goers in five years have visited the SSE Hydro...a figure which has exceeded the expectations of the woman responsible for bringing some of the worlds biggest acts to Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas - a deep fried MARS BAR calzone containing around , calories."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-and-meghan-expecting-first-baby","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in spring , Kensington Palace has announced."},{"url":null,"title":"teen-bakes-grandads-ashes-into-biscuits-and-shares-with-classmates","story":"A high school student mixed her cremated grandfatherrsquos ashes into homemade sugar biscuits and shared them with several classmates, police in Calornia said on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"rbs-paid-contractors-400-a-day-to-stuff-envelopes","story":"Royal Bank of Scotland paid contractors a staggering pound a day to stuff envelopes, wasting thousands of pounds of taxpayersrsquo money in the process, it can be revealed."},{"url":null,"title":"youre-dragging-us-into-the-gutter-celtic-chairman-ian-bankier-blasts-section-of-parkhead-support","story":"Celtic chairman Ian Bankier has told a section of the Parkhead support that they are ldquodragging the club into the gutter with their persistence in singing inappropriate songs."},{"url":null,"title":"style-mile-carnival-leaves-st-enoch-centre-on-sunday-for-festive-fun","story":"IT is one of the citys most popular festive events... and this year the city centre will be transformed into a fairy tale."},{"url":null,"title":"michael-buble-tickets-to-go-on-sale-today","story":"EVERYONES favourite Christmas crooner Michael Buble will release tickets for his Scottish tour date today."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-new-celtic-christmas-advert-featuring-pc-mikael-lustig","story":"Celtic have once again embraced the holiday season with another hilarious Christmas video."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-manager-brendan-rodgers-wont-ring-the-changes-for-the-sake-of-it","story":"Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers will avoid making too many changes to the Parkhead squad as they prepare for a gruelling run of games between now and the New Year."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-defender-marvin-compper-wants-january-exit","story":"Celtic defender Marvin Compper will look to engineer an exit from the Parkhead club in January but maintains that he will look to resurrect his career where."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-cup-medal-worn-by-celtic-legend-sells-for-thousands","story":"A SCOTTISH Cup medal won by legendary Celtic centre half, Willie Cringan, almost  years ago has sold for pound, at auction in Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-raffling-off-3m-mansion-for-just-25-a-ticket","story":"AN English couple have decided to raffle off their pound million house via an online contest."},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118520.jpg","title":"Festive fundraiser helping mum get through baby loss","story":"A MUM whose baby son died unexpectedly six months ago is throwing herself into fundraising activity to help her cope with her loss.Stevie Dixon of Sicily Road, Inverness woke up on May  to find -week-old Harry had died during the night.Speaking about it publicly for the first time, the horror of that morning remains vivid for the -year-old home carer who is bravely trying to move on with her le with her husband Liamand their other two sons Charlieand Zak .ldquoWe woke up and he was gone, she said, adding that she was in such a state her husband had to call the ambulance before carrying out CPR.ldquoWe did everything we could till the ambulance arrived, but we knew he was gone.ldquoHe was just starting to get his own personality and was a happy wee boy and in good health.

Ness Bank and Cavell Gardens ndash on the opposite side of the river ndash is also included in the proposed mph zone.The zone includes a road near the park where motorist John Macdonald knocked down a four-year-old boy and drove off leaving the youngster seriously injured in July last year. Macdonald was later jailed for four months, banned from driving for a year and fined pound.Statistics show several other accidents took place between January  and July  in the planned mph zone.Regional MSP and long-time road safety campaigner David Stewart said winning public support is vital for the project.ldquoWith such issues, I am always of the mind that key stakeholders and those directly affected should always be fully consulted on such matters and consideration given to any concerns raised before a final plan is put forward for approval, he said.ldquoI have in the past been an advocate for wider footpaths to better accommodate cyclists and pedestrians and I have also suggested that the surfaces be painted a set colour to inform those utilising them of their primary use.He added: ldquoWith regards to the mph speed restriction proposed for the Bught Park area, this makes total sense to me since this area is well utilised for sporting and recreational purposes by many people and will make the surrounding roads safer for all.Saturday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118446.jpg","title":"Vital housing service is under review","story":"SCORES of vulnerable people in the Inverness area are set to lose a leline service.The housing support service provides practical help to people at risk of becoming homeless or struggling to manage their everyday affairs.But almost  long-term clients have received letters from Highland Council saying they will no longer receive it as it is only short-term.The move has alarmed charities such as New Start Highland and Gateway ndash previously the Highland Homeless Trust ndash which are contracted by the council to support clients with tasks such as managing money and helping to keep them safe.Following urgent representations, the council has agreed to review cases where there would be signicant hardship but concerns still remain that more people could become homeless or fall into debt.Frank Reid , of Dalneigh, suffers short-term memory loss and has relied on support from Gateway to maintain the tenancy of a bungalow since losing his we four years ago.

at Fir Park in the quarter-finals of the League Cup and then lost by the same scoreline in the Scottish Cup semi at Hampden. In both games the Reds were out- muscled by Well.But Ball is confident Aberdeen will more than hold their own in the physical battles and insists there will be no holding back for fear of sustaining an injury that could kill any cup final dream.He said: “Everyone who is playing has to go out there and give everything they have – like we do in every game.

However, the last month was maybe not my best month. However, that is football.“You have a really good run of form and sometimes you drop.“For me it is just about picking it back up and pushing on this month.”Today’s clash with Motherwell begins a congested fixture list where the Dons will pack in  games before the end of the year.It is a pivotal period that could ultimately yield a trophy and will also have major influence on the Premiership bid.He said: “We have  games coming up between now and the winter break and we need to get as many points as we can.“Everyone in the squad is going to play a part in that time.”"},{"url":null,"title":"deals there if you want it gary boss","story":"Aberdeen have opened up contract talks with winger Gary Mackay-Steven and are set to offer the Scotland cap a new deal.Dons boss Derek McInnes today confirmed preliminary discussions have started with the -year-old who is out of contract at the end of the season.Mackay-Steven’s value to the club long term was underlined and it was intimated a deal would be there should he also see his future at Pittodrie.With his deal set to expire next summer GMS will be free to speak to any interested clubs from the start of the winter transfer window on January .Mackay-Steven is the Dons’ leading scorer this season with six goals.

It also relies on the bridge and therefore would not improve access for abnormal loads, would have a limited impact on the perception of poor access and would not enhance transport resilience.”At its meeting on Tuesday, the council’s city growth and resources committee will be asked to give the green light for a second appraisal.This would take three years, and cost £, – taken from the Aberdeen City Deal funding, and would consider eight transport options.They are: A – Build a road from Greenbank Road via St Fitticks Community Park to Coast Road with a new underbridge under the railway line.A – Build a road from Greenbank Road via the former Ness Landill site over a new railway bridge.A – Improve the route via Hareness Road by building a bridge over the railway on Coast Road.A – Build a road between Coast Road and Souter Head Road and a new bridge over the railway on Coast Road.The remaining options include: Improve buses between the harbour and the city centre.– Provide a new bus service between the harbour and the city centre for cruise passengers.– Improve “active” travel routes, used by cylists and runners, between Bay of Nigg and the city centre.– Build a cycle route from the Coast Road through Tullos Hill to the A and to Deeside Way."},{"url":null,"title":"reynolds wants lynx side to stay ruthless","story":"Head coach Owen Reynolds is taking nothing for granted ahead of Aberdeen Lynx’s league clash with Dundee Tigers tonight.The Lynx made it two Scottish National Leaguewins from two matches last weekend, demolishing Kilmarnock Thunder - at the Galleon.Reynolds’ team were lethal, Christian Johnson and Jack Flynn scoring three times each, while Mikulas Novotny and Jack Durkacz bagged doubles.Five more of the Granite City side’s players found the net.Now comes the visit of the Tigers – a team the Lynx beat home and away in the early-season Eastern Conference.Reynolds said: “After a couple of wins against Dundee Tigers this season already, we’ll be going into the game as favourites but we’d be foolish to think it’ll be a walk in the park.“The Tigers will be keen to prove a point after our last game and, despite their recent results, they’ve still got some dangerous players, such as Callum Turnbull, as well as adding a great young goalie in Dale Shearer to their ranks.“We learned a lesson in complacency when we faced Kilmarnock Thunder in the Scottish Cup and only just scraped a win after underestimating our opponents.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as .

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"bustling prestwick town praised national","story":"NewsBustling Prestwick town praised on national stageThe town landed second place in Scotland at the Great British High Street Awards last week.ShareByPippa Smith:,  NOV NewsSuccess Prestwick is boom town \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBustling business in Prestwick has been praised on the national stage.

He said: “That is a long time in the hospitality sector. It has been very successful in that time.”Referencing food trends, he said research showed people buying breakfasts and takeaways was on the increase.He added: “The building we built  years ago is not as fit for purpose as it was then.

There will be no increased public areas.” Troon Conservative councillor Peter Convery said: “It think it is a remarkable change. It will certainly enhance the town of Prestwick.”Prestwick and Conservative councillor Margaret Toner said she was delighted by the plan.She said: “I was always amused by the retractable roof.”"},{"url":null,"title":"a-taste-of-southern-gospel-comes-to-gala","story":"A GALASHIELS church is to host a free concert next month.Old Parish and St Paulrsquos, in Scott Crescent, will welcome Southern Gospel Music, led by John and Pat McIlroy.The pair, who are from Edinburgh have performed all over the world including America, Africa, the Middle East, Bermuda on cruise ships and extensively throughout the UK.A promoter for the concert told us: ldquoThe McIlroys have recently ed from the south east of the United States, which is the home of Southern Gospel.ldquoWhile they were there, they shared their Christian and Scottish and Irish music in churches and at festivals.ldquoCome along and enjoy, listen, sing along or bring an instrument.

I hope that nightmare prospect really focuses minds in the days ahead.There is nothing to stop the SNP and Labour backing the deal. It achieves key goals set out in their own Brexit plans, like protecting trade and citizensrsquo rights.

with a view to building new schools, assessing which schools may need to be merged or closed, and considering how appropriate current catchment areas are.Education bosses at the council are known to prefer an intergenerational model of education, such as the poundm campus at Jedburgh which will cater for - year olds and contain community spaces and a library.In April , Scottish Borders Council agreed to create inidualised plans for schools in Galashiels, Hawick, Peebles and Selkirk, and agreed to bring an update to the council in October.However, the update has so far failed to materialise leaving parents and students in the dark about the future of their school.John Lamont, who represents Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk in Westminster, said: ldquoHawick High School has had its fair share of publicity recently, but it is clear that hard working pupils and staff are being let down by a site which is simply not fit for purpose.ldquoThat is why I have joined with my colleague Rachael, to call on the townrsquos representatives to come together for the good of the town.ldquoGalashiels is already the front runner to get a new school, because the town and the community is united and has a clear plan.ldquoHawick is lucky to have very active local representatives who have already put in a lot of work in to securing a new school for the town.ldquoNow is the time for the community and for its representatives to come together to focus on delivering for Hawickrsquos pupils, teachers and parents.ldquoIf we argue amongst ourselves about details, the effect will be that Hawick is put to the back of the queue.Rachael Hamilton, who represents Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire in Holyrood, added: ldquoMaking a decision on a site would give pupils, teachers and parents a real boost.ldquoOther towns in the Borders have been fortunate to benefit from a new modern teaching and learning environment and Hawick is clearly in need of some investment.ldquoPolitical infighting wonrsquot help, clarity should be provided over such an important issue, this is about giving young people and future generations a place to be proud of.The townrsquos councillors have welcomed the intervention of the two politicians, and threw their weight behind the campaign.Councillor Stuart Marshall commented: ldquoI think itrsquos very important that all politicians, councillors and community leaders join forces to continue the campaign for a new high school.ldquoOf course funding such a project will be a major factor in whether we can deliver such a project, and itrsquos great that both our Westminster and Holyrood representatives in the area are throwing their weight behind such an initiative.ldquoLet us hope that between them they can come up with much of the finances required.Councillor Watson McAteer said: ldquoI am delighted that our local elected UK and Scottish Conservative politicians are throwing their weight and influence behind a new high school for Hawick.ldquoI am in complete agreement that politics should have no role in deciding the future of our children and by definition our town and the quicker this project is agreed by all the better.ldquoHawick High School has seen its fair share of problems and a new learning campus would go a long way to resolving existing and future problemsCouncillor David Paterson added: ldquoAll of the Hawick councillors are campaigning furiously to get a new high school for Hawick, and the councillors in other wards are shouting for their areas as well.ldquoIrsquod like John Lamont MP to encourage the Tory government to make more money available to the Scottish Government to make this into a reality.The proposals to create inidual plans for Galashiels, Hawick, Selkirk and Peebles came on the back of assessments of the four schools that found they all have what are described as major defects.The facilities at each school were graded from A to D, with A signying that the buildings are performing well and operating effectively and D indicating that the economic le of the facilities has expired and they are at risk of failure.The overall conditions of Galashiels Academy, Hawick High School and Selkirk High School were given C ratings, while Peebles High School was deemed to have a B, or good, rating."},{"url":null,"title":"devastated-family-pay-tribute-to-charity-that-helped-them-remember-their-beautiful-baby","story":"A FAMILY from Blyth Bridge wants to repay the kindness shown to them

cease trading this yearamid severe turmoil in the sector.The Press Association reported earlier on Friday thatthe company had enlisted KPMG to assess all options for the firm, including an administration.KPMG was initially brought in to oversee an accelerated sale or merger with another provider, but the collapse of rival Extra Energy this week and well-documented pressures in the industry caused alarm among would-be investors.A Spark spokesman said that the company is still working to merge the parent firm and its workforce with a larger provider.ldquoIf successful, it would mean Spark becomes a standalone part of this large independent supplier ndash operating from our offices in Selkirk, Edinburgh and Horsham offices, supplying our customers under the new parent companyrsquos licence, he said.Sparkrsquos failure means it is the seventh small energy supplier to go bust this year, leaving hundreds of thousands of customers in limbo.Spark has nearly , customers in the UK and employs  people at its head office in Selkirk.The failure comes days after Spark missed a deadline to make a pound. million renewable energy payment and barely  hours after rival Extra

Council has published a belated update on its much-anticipated school estates review, and it reveals that Galashiels is the top priority to receive new investment, with Hawick second, Selkirk third and Peebles fourth.Education chiefs are recommending that councillors approve plans for a pound.m cross-generational campus in Galashiels, which would be due to open in .The plans would see , secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students,  primary school pupils and  nursery children educated across the campus, to be split between the new Langlee Primary School and a new building at either Scott Park or Netherdale.Although the cross-generational campus is the preferred model outlined by council officers, there would be a public consultation which would explore alternative options, which includes a new standalone secondary school building which would cost pound.m.The costs outlined in the report are currently indicative but would be confirmed once a detailed delivery strategy is drawn up.The report states: ldquoWhile both Galashiels and Hawick high schools are both classed as grade C in relation to their condition, Galashiels will require signicantly more financial investment on an element-by-element fabric basis in order to remain a fully ing asset with no impact on the delivery of the curriculum.ldquoIt is recommended therefore that Galashiels is the first priority for investment given the current condition and suitability of the existing school in relation to the rest of the estate.If the report is approved by councillors, Hawick would be the second town to receive investment in its school estates.As in Galashiels, council officers are recommending the construction of a cross-generational campus, due to open in , at a cost of pound.m.The campus would cater for  secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students, , primary school pupils and  nursery children.Again, the option to create either a cross-generational campus or just a stand-alone secondary school at a cost of pound.m would be discussed with Hawick residents.However, issues relating to flooding risk and available space have led to Hawick missing out on first priority place as council officers do not currently have a concrete plan for where any new campus would be sited.The report continues: ldquoThere are other complex issues within Hawick aside from questions of scale and accessibility, in particular with relation to flood risk.ldquoWhile the existing high school site in Hawick has been included within the options appraisal, it is noted that further detailed investigations are required regarding the currently proposed flood prevention works at this site and the nature of permissible development works which could render this and other adjacent town centre sites undevelopable for an education project of this scale.ldquoThe Hawick flood protection scheme will deliver protection to the town generally at a level commensurate with one in -year flood events.ldquoEarly advice is that any new school provision on the same site or at the same level would require to achieve, a higher level of protection commensurate with its classication as a strategic asset.ldquoIn addition, other sites are already identied within the local development plan in terms of business, mixed use or industrial zoning, and this could have a detrimental impact on the wider economic health of the townutilised for educational purposes and an analysis would therefore be required.Selkirk would be the third priority for new investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m cross-generational campus, potentially due to open in .As with the campus recommendations at Hawick and Galashiels, there would be a public consultation that would consider just building a replacement secondary school, at a cost of pound.mThe report states: ldquoFrom experience with the Jedburgh intergenerational campus model, it is considered appropriate that a three-to- campus option could be considered for the Selkirk cluster.ldquoThis could comprise all the schools within the town and potentially a partial inclusion of the rural schools within the cluster, as was suggested during the pre-consultations, with pupils from P and P transitioning to the campus.,params: .pushldquoPrevious consultation with the community has focused on secondary education. It is therefore proposed that further consultation is undertaken with the community, parents, pupils and staff to determine the preferred option in terms of educational model.ldquoThis will help develop a proposal to take forward to the next stage of the process. Discussions will also be progressed with the public, private and third sector regarding the potential for other services to share services and facilities.Peebles has been designated as the lowest priority for a new school but it would receive the largest investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m campus to be opened in .The alternative would be a new secondary school building at a cost of poundm.The report continues: ldquoPrimary and secondary schools within Peebles currently have limited capacity for increased roll numbers, which is the main concern in this location as opposed to issues of condition at Galashiels and Hawick.ldquoBoth Priorsford and Kingsland primary schools are operating at  per cent capacity and Peebles High School at  per cent capacity, and further work on projected roll figures is required.ldquoIt is recommended that any decision to build a new school or campus model must form part of an overall Scottish Borders Council masterplan for the town taking cognisance of projected housing developments, transport links, infrastructure, including flood risk, and the local development plan.The campus model is favoured by council officers and the elected administration as consolidating educational provision in one or two locations would allow the closure of disused school buildings and reduce annual running costs.The report will be presented at the next full council meeting, to be held next Thursday, November , and councillors will be asked to approve the priority and sequence of investments."},{"url":null,"title":"50k-boost-for-museum-from-festival-of-speed","story":"MORE than pound, has been donated to a Borders museum by organisers of the Goodwood Festival of Speed.And a

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo. While there are undoubtedly people who commit evil and need to be stopped, it is the conditions which allow hate to flourish which give rise to their power and influence in the first place.In our remembrance of those who have fallen, let us do so with the reflection and not the frenzy. Let us not forget that the real enemy of us all is hate."},{"url":null,"title":"long-serving-coach-driver-retires-after-30-years","story":"Tranent man Alec Napier, who turned  on October , said he was looking forward to le in the slow lane.ldquoIrsquoll be taking it easy and letting someone  do the driving, said Alec.ldquoIrsquove stayed in lots of nice, and some not-so-nice, hotels in my time.

We had just popped in to get a few simple items, but I ended up with a very upset wee boy. The supermarket had already begun to display toys. My son had noticed them immediately because they had been deliberately placed at his level.I eventually managed to distract him and we made it out without a major meltdown, but it just highlighted to me the pressures we are all put under.I kept on saying to my son: ldquoNo, but maybe for Christmas.It was a tactic to get some immediate peace, but I realised I was building up expectations that Christmas is the time when all the accumulated desires for stuff are met.We are made to feel that the value of Christmas is measured in the amount of stuff we acquire or give. I hate this and reject it but I am by no means immune from its pressure. I am made to feel guilty and every year I give in some way or another.The psychological warfare in our minds has already begun. The new toys laid out in that supermarket was but the opening shot. Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them. And there are a host of local Christmas fairs taking place in schools and community halls all over East Lothian where many local craftspeople, artists and others will be selling locally produced and environmentally friendly gts which have real value and are designed to last. It seems to me this is the best place to take our custom.I know this has not been a proper story but, then again, in a sense it is. Itrsquos the story of how our rituals and the meanings of our lives have been turned into market value, and we now often feel powerless or unable to step out of it without feeling guilty, inadequate or ldquoa Scrooge.Thatrsquos how I feel every Christmas but Irsquom going to make a Herculean effort this year to practice what I preach. Irsquom not rejecting that lsquoChristmassyrsquo feeling or refusing to buy presents. But Irsquom defining it on my own terms, or at least Irsquoll try. Itrsquos about my time with people I value. Itrsquos about putting in thought rather than looking at the price tag.Itrsquos also about understanding how terribly dficult Christmas is for so many people and finding ways to connect with them and show them some kindness and inclusion.Maybe itrsquos just me, but I think that is one of the best gts you can give your children and others you love."},{"url":null,"title":"great-grandmother-84-enjoys-microlight-flight","story":"Jenny Lyall, , was the passenger in a microlight, taking off from East Fortune Airfield, earlier this month.The small aircraft, piloted by Kim Ritchie, gave Jenny the chance to look over her home in Haddington.Clients at the townrsquos day centre, managed by Caroline Scott, have been outlining things they would like to do, from having a holiday in the spring to going on the London Eye.For Jenny, though, it was a chance to take to the skies.She said: ldquoIrsquove always watched the microlights going over and would be sitting in the garden saying: lsquoI quite fancy doing that.rsquoldquoWhen Caroline askedthere was anything anybody would like to do I said I would like to go up in a microlight.A few days later Jenny received a phone call telling her there was a surprise for her at the day centre and she said she was thrilled when she found out that was a microlight flight, adding: ldquoI thoroughly enjoyed it ndash I would do it again tomorrow.ldquoNot bad for an -year-old!Caroline was delighted to be able to help.

The rolling hills and fertile soils have attracted people to live and work in the area since prehistoric times.Glenlivet Estate and the wider Moray Speyside region are synonymous with whisky making and another tourist route, the Malt Whisky Trail, meets the NE to offer many options for visiting distilleries and a historic cooperage.Walkers and mountain bikers will also delight in a network of waymarked trails across the estate.From Tomintoul, the NE departs the Old Military Road, originally built in the mid-s to pacy the Highlands under instruction of Major William Caulfeild, and follows a peaceful road to the whisky settlements of Knockandhu and Glenlivet before joining a busier road, the A, just south of Ballindalloch.On reaching Aberlour, also home to a picture-postcard whisky distillery, I take up my booking for a campervan pitch at the newly upgraded Speyside Gardens Camping and Caravan Park. Husband and we owners Olly and Amy Lyon are anticipating greater numbers of guests thanks to the NE.Olly said: ldquoWe believe the NE route will introduce our beautul area to many more people and hopefully it will bring a boost to local businesses and attractions.Already I have seen so many more tourism gems than I ever knew existed and my journey is not even a third completed.I am fortunate with the spring weather although many locals are keen to tell me how much sunnier and drier it is in the north-east of Scotland compared to the west. ldquoMind, it can be a couple of degrees cooler, one shop owner told me.From Aberlour, the NE continues north to reach Spey Bay on the Moray Firth. The landscape changes from gently undulating farmland to flatter coastal plains before I see the sea. This coast is popular for wildle spotting, especially dolphins.Several former fishing settlements, such as Findochty, Portnockie and Cullen, feature must-see historic harbours and pretty beaches. I find myself meandering slowly between each before I park up and investigate a coastal walking path that links the settlements.A well-trodden trail from Cullen takes me to a cove to view a slanted arched rock called Whales Mouth. Further along the shore at Portknockie is the striking sea arch, Bow Fiddle Rock.Back on the road going east, I spot another signpost, this time for Findlater Castle. While the ancient building is in ruins, the airy clf-top location is magnicent.I have another campervan pitch for the night near Banff but before booking in the calm, bright evening affords me the time to explore the grounds of Duff House, a Georgian estate house owned by Historic Scotland.Almost half way around the -mile tourist trail, I set off on day three for the longest section of my trip. I might normally expect to drive  miles in less than two hours but it takes me almost  hours because there is so much to see.My first port of call is the tiny settlement of Pennan, made famous as the fictional village of Ferness in the s film Local Hero. The road down ndash and back up ndash is crazily steep but well worth it for the picturesque setting.I follow another hillier coastal path on foot to Aberdour Bay, where I discover a string of sandy coves hidden between rocky clfs.Driving further east and then south through the large fishing town of Fraserburgh, the eastern coast of Aberdeenshire serves up more fabulous landmarks. Atmospheric Bullers of Buchan is a collapsed sea cave, located adjacent to a precariously perched hamlet.Next is Slains Castle, an imposing clf-top ruin accessed by a narrow sandy road. The castle is said to be the inspiration for the  novel Dracula.The beaches are long, plentul and sandy on Aberdeenshirersquos coast. Near the village of St Fergus I follow a tourist sign for Scotston Beach where I am rewarded by a superb stretch of yellow sand brilliantly hidden behind high grass-topped dunes.The NE skirts the north-eastrsquos largest settlement of Aberdeen, although there is no reason why you shouldnrsquot visit. In fact, many people will choose to start and finish the NE at the granite city.After a night at the largest caravan park of my trip at Maryculter, west of Aberdeen, I drive the final  miles of the loop. Heading west through beautul Royal Deeside country the attractions come thick and fast, including the th century tower house of Crathes Castle with its lovely gardens and a Go Ape adventure course the nature reserve of Muir of Dinnet and Forestry Scotlandrsquos Cambus orsquo May trails.Soon I can see the mountains of the Cairngorms again and I drive back through Braemar, stopping for a lovely cafeacute lunch, before entering the long glen, this time downhill, back to Spittal of Glenshee.On reflection, I wished I had taken a week rather than four days to travel the NE ndash and I know I willsoon.Travel notes:Day : Overnight at Speyside Gardens Camping and Caravan Park. www.speysidegardensDay : Overnight at Wester Bonnyton Caravan and Camping Site, Gamrie, Banff. www.westerbonnytonDay : Overnight at Deeside Holiday Park, Maryculter. www.woodleisure our-parks deeside I hired a Fiat Tribute  campervan from Open Road Scotland, near Glasgow Airport, to drive the NE.

Down in the harbour, the little boat that will take us out to the rock is being bullied by the water and the conditions are forecast to get a lot worse later. We need to get going.Once on board the boat, the skipper shows me a passenger log listing the people whorsquove been out to the rock before ndash and there are lots of names from all over the world. I ask him why they come here. Because they love the Bell Rock, he says. We look to the horizon and there it is,  miles out, a swab of black where the grey of the sky meets the grey of the sea.Accompanying me on the three-hour round trip out from Arbroath to the Bell Rock is the conservationist, writer and lighthouse lover Tom Nancollas, who has just written a history of rock lighthouses like the Bell. Tom cares very much about preserving important buildings but he cares particularly about lighthouses and especially the lighthouses built in the middle of the sea, those sea-lashed towers, constant and strong.Talking on the boat about the history of the Bell, itrsquos easy to understand Tomrsquos admiration. The lighthouse was built because of the dangerous ft-long reef it sits on, once known as the Inchcape rock, which is only fully exposed at the lowest spring tides. In the winter, the rocks used to claim around six ships a year and from the th century onwards there were attempts to protect seafarers from the dangers.The first was said to have been by the Abbot of Arbroath who attached a bell to the rock , the idea being that it would be rung by the waves to warn passing ships. Itrsquos hard to see how it could have been effective, but the bell inspired the poet Robert Southey. ldquoA sound aswith the Inchcape Bell, he wrote, ldquoThe Devil below was ringing his knell.By the late th century, there was a clamour to do something about the rock which is when the idea emerged of putting a lighthouse on it. Robert Stevenson, one of the famous Stevenson family who were devoted to building lighthouses and making Britainrsquos dangerous seas safer, believed a light on the Bell Rock was possible, and so, with the chief engineer on the project, John Rennie, an ambitious ndash some said impossible ndash plan was drawn up.You get an idea of how hard it would have been when yoursquore close up to the reef. Bits of it stick up from the water, like rotten teeth, and the skipper says itrsquos too dangerous to attempt a landing today. But imagine for a minute: more than  years ago planning to build a huge stone tower here,  miles from the shore, and then doing it. of Scotlands most remote lighthousesTom points out what looks like a small railway line that runs round part of the rock. This was used to move the granite that had been shipped from the mainland and, remarkably, still survives more than  years later a large wooden house on stilts was also built on the site so the workmen did not have toto the shore every night.The work began on Tuesday  August  and in his book, Seashaken Houses, Tom describes that remarkable day. ldquoIt was half past five on a perfect summerrsquos morning. The waves lapped about quietly, but would not fully uncover the reef for another half-hour or so. While they waited, the excited masons were regaled with a glass of rum by the shiprsquos steward by six in the morning, the tide was fully out and they got to work, cheeks flushed. They had two hours before it immersed the reef again, so they hacked quickly at the rock. After waiting the whole day aboard their boat, they managed a further two hoursrsquo work at the evening low tide.Standing at the front of the boat looking out to the reef  years later, Tom talks about just how extraordinary that effort by the Victorian masons was. ldquoIn those days there was none of the health and safety regulations that protect lives now but there were surprisingly few deaths, he says. ldquoBuilding the Bell Rock, there were only five deaths in total [out of a workforce of up to ], which considering the extreme conditions, was a testament to how well planned it was.Tom says the whole enterprise had to be incredibly carefully planned. ldquoStones would come once a week, he says, ldquohaving been carved on land, they would be unloaded with these ingenious timber frames with pulleys. They weighed up to five tons and they were carved into precise shapes soyou knocked them against something, you would have to do it again. The Bell Rock as a jigsaw puzzle and thatrsquos what has given it the resilience that it has.Itrsquos this mix of ingenuity, strength and blood that helps explain the love that Tom and many others feel for the Bell and other lighthouses. Building this great tower was a miserable occupation, he says, but a heroic one too. This is not like building a house on the land, he says this is something bigger and more important. So strong is the towerrsquos allure and power close up that itrsquos easy to start getting romantic about the whole thing, but Tom warns against it. As he was writing his book, he says, he was always looking for romance, myth and love but the lighthouses kept telling him the truth: much of the story is horrible.Joan Boath knows just how horrible. He was the last principal keeper of the Bell Rock and when I talked to him about his job he told me how, when he was working there, he would sometimes walk about on the rocks at low tide just visualising the work that went into building the lighthouse. But he also told me just how hard it the job was.\"The Bell was tough, he said, ldquoand was responsible for a lot of men resigning, but in those days it was your job and you got on with it. There was no use mumping about it. I would say to my we, Dont phone with any problems ndash youll have to deal with them yourself.\"The rota Boath and his colleagues worked to was four weeks on and four weeks off and even getting into the lighthouse was tough. Unlike other lighthouses, there were no steps up to the door instead, the keepers had to be winched across from a boat and inside there were no baths or showers and water had to be rationed. Tom also points out that the diameter of the rooms was only abut ft which meant you couldnrsquot walk more than that in a straight line. It was a weird, tough existence a le lived in circles.When the Bell Rock was first built, however, there was one extraordinary nod to luxury and elegance. Just below the lantern room was a library and guest room described by the writer RM Ballantyne as being decorated in a style worthy of a ladyrsquos boudoir. There were handsome chairs, a large bookcase, an oak table, and a domed ceiling painted to represent stucco ling, and above the window a bust of one of the men who made it possible, Robert Stevenson.For Tom, it is one of the most interesting parts of the Bell Rockrsquos story. ldquoNothing  like it existed at the time or has existed since, says, ldquoA circular library decorated like an Edinburgh New Town drawing room in the middle of the sea. Itrsquos a lovely idea that you pour everything into a design even though few people will ever appreciate it for what it is.Sadly, when the lighthouse was modernised in  and the light was converted from paraffin to electric, the library was stripped bare and part of the purpose of Tomrsquos books is to remind us of the extraordinary achievement of putting it there in the first place. However, the book is also about the wider story of all  of the rock lighthouses of the British Isles, four of which are in Scotland: the Bell, as well as Skerryvore  miles off Tiree, and Dhu Artach  miles west of Colonsay, and Oxcars on the Firth of Forth.Standing on the boat in front of the Bell and braced against the thumping of the sea, Tom talks about what he sees as some of the symbolism and power of these great rock lighthouses. Part of their appeal is down to their architecture and technology, particularly in Scotland where our designers were among the worldrsquos great pioneers.For Tom, though, there is a less tangible but no less powerful appeal to rock lighthouses and he explains it as we stand bobbing up and down on the water next to the rock. ldquoLighthouses have a particularly strange depth to them, he says. ldquoThe Bell Rock has a daytime identity and a night-time identity ndash by day, itrsquos a big tower, and the sturdiest thing possible, and by night itrsquos a very intangible, fragile light and it has these dferent presences. The whole story of lighthouses is this layering of good and evil, dficulty and ease, heroism and tragedy and few other building types have that mixture. There is also a spiritual quality to the light itself ndash here is a light in the darkness to guide you.Tom is also confident about the future of these buildings. Up close, what strikes you about the Bell Rock is the remarkable lack of wear and tear for a building that was conceived and constructed during the reign of King George III. Maintenance is always necessary ndash and believe it or not, keepers like John Boath use to hang in a bosunrsquos chair to paint the outside of the building ndash but the shape of these lighthouses means they dissipate the force of the waves. The Bell is also built from a thousand tons of the strongest stone imaginable ndash granite ndash and has withstood the salt and the water and the wind for over  years. Tom is confident it will withstand another  and whatrsquos more will still be used despite advances in technology that might seem to make a stone tower old fashioned.ldquoIn the medium term, they are secure and we will absolutely need them, he says. ldquoAnd what they offer ndash what only a thousand tons of granite can offer is the certainty of a warning when you need it. Intangible methods of navigation, such as radio and so on, are useful and good but they are no fail safe by any means.There are no keepers in these lighthouses any more, of course ndash at least not ones that still live in the towers. There are retained keepers who usually have responsibility for several lighthouses and visit them a few times a year to maintain them . As for the lights themselves, they are controlled by a small team at the headquarters of the Northern Lighthouse Board in Edinburgh. of Scotlands most remote lighthousesThe Bell Rock was one of the last lights to be automated, in , but the fact that the light is controlled via a little digital sensor has done nothing to diminish its power. You can feel it  miles away standing in the harbour at Arbroath but close-up it is even more impressive and daunting. In particular, there is something about it that can awaken the superstitious in you and there are stories of ghosts and eerie lights and ethereal music heard by the stonemasons. There is myth in the stones.Standing in the boat as we circle the Bell, Tom Nancollas says there is also a positive power in the tons of granite. A rock lighthouse, he says, is a symbol of tolerance and altruism, of assistance made available to those in need regardless of their nationality. It is also a type of building that is not introspective, but outward-looking. It deserves to thrive, he says, and on the boat  miles out to sea we think of the special prayer Robert Stevenson commissioned during the building of the Bell Rock. He petitioned God to ldquoprosper, we beseech thee, the work in which we are engaged. May it remain long after our eyes have ceased to behold it.Seashaken Houses by Tom Nancollas is published by Particular Books at pound.SCOTLANDrsquoS ROCK LIGHTHOUSESBetween  and ,  rock lighthouses were built to mark the most dangerous hazards to shipping in the seas around the British Isles and of these  survive today, and  of those still show their lights. First lit in , the Bell Rock is the oldest working building to remain standing upon its reef. The other three are:SkerryvoreBuilt  miles off Tiree, Skerryvore has been called the most beautul lighthouse in the world. Two hundred years ago, before it was built, the rocks wrecked many ships every year and there was money to be made from collecting the wreckage that regularly swept up on the beaches of Tiree. Work began in April and was completed in July . Some called it the noblest of all the lights. It was automated in .Dhu ArtachSitting on the Torren reef  miles west of Colonsay, Dhu Artach lighthouse was designed by Thomas Stevenson, the father of Robert Louis Stevenson who later used the reef as the place where David Balfour and Alan Breck are shipwrecked in Kidnapped. Work began in April  and it was lit in OxcarsDesigned by David and Thomas Stevenson to protect shipping on the Firth of Forth, Oxcars was originally lit by an oil burner and attended by keepers. It became the first of the Scottish lighthouses to be automated when it was converted to gas in ."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-queen-margaret-union-celebrates-50-years-of-music","story":"And that was, as they say, just the boys. Another unique selling point of the band formed by ex-Generation X bassist Tony James and fronted by the flamboyant Martin Degville was an all-female road crew. Mark Mackie, who had begun working with promoters Regular Music having been entertainment convenor at the QMU as a student, remembers that they had certainly not been recruited for their equipment-lugging physique ndash and the stiletto heels they wore were not ideal for that job either.All of which was a far cry from the QMU of  years earlier, when a generation of s feminists ran the place, and some of that erse history will be recalled when the th anniversary of the building at the end of University Gardens is remembered during an evening of Glam Rock Dialogues at the end of this month.These occasional evenings of debate, music, feather boas and extravagant eye make-up were initiated by Glasgow University academics David Archibald and Carl Lavery, and have in the past included musical input from the rhythm section of Franz Ferdinand and the songs of Bowie and Bolan to accompany discussion of the political legacy of revolutionary France. The spirit of  will be present on November  again, because it was then that the Queen Margaret Unionrsquos present home, a modernist design by Glasgow architects Walter Underwood and Partners, opened.Archibald says he and Lavery will be taking a less prominent part in this event, however, as befits the celebration of a facility built for women, whose numbers at the university had outgrown the QMUrsquos previous home in the John McIntyre Building on University Avenue. The key contributors to the St Andrewrsquos Day event will be female, with narration by Theatre Studies lecturer Cristina Delgado-Garcia and testimonies from current QMU president Mata Durkin, and Christine Hamilton, whose tenure on the board was in the buildingrsquos earlier years.Hamilton says that, as was said of the s,you can remember which bands you saw at the QM you werenrsquot really there. But she also claims that Freddie Mercuryrsquos Queen played there so often in her day that one of the band suggested it would be easierthe QM audience travelled to them.ldquoBut I mostly remember the politics at the time, because men were only allowed in as guests and could only be signed in after noon. These were the years of student protest and a wave of feminist consciousness-raising and we wanted the place to be mixed. It almost seems like we have come full-circle now, to be arguing for women-only spaces.Hamilton had come to Glasgow from a state school in Fe and found that the womenrsquos union was traditionally run by young ladies from private schools who still lived at home, and were not minded to fight for sexual equality. ldquoThey would say things like they didnrsquot want men to be able to see them first thing in the morning without their make-up! she says.Hamilton, who heard shipyard union leader Jimmy Reidrsquos rousing speech when the students elected him Rector of Glasgow University, stool as part of a slate of women from state schools who lived in student flats. They wrested control of the QM, although it was a few years before their argument for equality led to a mixed union, and Glasgow University Union ndash the ldquomenrsquos union ndash persisted with male-only membership, barring women from certain parts of the building, for many years.ldquoIt was equality that we were fighting for, although some women would point out that the level of power and control of budgets they had enjoyed in running the show at the QM was something they might never have again for the rest of their lives.Christine Hamilton studied drama and went on to a career in the arts and then in academia but the friendship she made through the QM board brought her long-term friends in the worlds of science and medicine as well.ldquoThey were women who made their way in the world independently and continued to work, and were not content to merely become lsquogood housewivesrsquo.At a time of draconian licensing laws, she says, the QM was unusual in arguing for and winning a regular late licence for music and dancing. ldquoIt was a huge amount of fun, but it was not just a social club ndash I remember some very edgy debates, including one I was chairing on Northern Ireland where we had to clear the gallery.Nonetheless, it was the bands that brought most students to the QM, and Hamilton said that her generation had rules about them. ldquoI was told: never touch the boys in the band, and never pine after them ndash because there will be another one along next week!By the start of the following decade, the QM was a mixed facility and Mark Mackie was studying marine science, living in a bedsit on Byres Road and eating every day in the union. When the catering was out-sourced, he stood for election to the board on a ticket to have the food he liked restored. In that aim, Mackie concedes that he failed, but he now runs one of Scotlandrsquos main music concert companies, Regular Music, all because he started helping out with the discos on Fridays and Saturdays.Frequent visits by bands to the QM had stopped when Mackie became entertainments convener and he wanted to put that right, as someone who enjoyed going to live music. He started local and his first concert was Del Amitri supported by the Suede Crocodiles with a Malibu drinks promotion and a ticket price of pound.. Other Scottish bands followed ndash The Bluebells and Lloyd Cole and the Commotions ndash before a Runrig gig gave him his first sell-out.With the bar takings more than justying the concerts and the tickets price covering the band fees, Mackie argued for an upgrading of the venue, with the installation of proper power supply and the building of a new stage to replace the low  that had been in use throughout the s .ldquoHaving cut my teeth with the Scottish groups, I started making calls to agents ndash and the QM was back on the circuit, he remembers.When The Smiths played at the very start of their fame, and their single This Charming Man newly in the charts, frontman Morrissey arrived by himself by train ahead of the band. With newspapers clamouring to speak to him, Mackie insured that the only interviews he gave were with the Glasgow Universityand the film and television students running the campus television channel ndash conducted on the roof of the QM.Mackie reels off an impressive list of bands that he put on at the venue, either as Ents Convenor or in the years immediately after, when he began working with Pete Irvine and Barry Wrightrsquos company , liaising with the students who followed him in the post. The Pogues, Was Not Was, Billy Bragg, Spear of Destiny, Big Audio Dynamite, The Waterboys, Slade and the aforementioned Sigue Sigue Sputnik ndash the s happened in full bloom at the QM.ldquoThe ticket money covered the cost of putting on the gigs, andwe sold out there would be  people drinking beer, so there was no way not to make money, says Mackie. A further tweak to the constitution of the student union gave board members dispensation to ldquosign in up to  non-students each, so effectively there was an open door policy that worked around local licensing laws.David Archibald also remembers regulations being less than scrupulously enforced in his teens so that he regularly saw bands there, including Wet Wet Wet, who had gone to the same school. He also recalls music being very male-dominated at that time, which he intends will not be that case at the Glam Rock Dialogues, with women in the band and well as in speaking and singing roles.Nonetheless there will be room for a male drummer who has a doctorate in the history of pop music, and another former QM ents convenor on keyboards, Ronan Breslin, now a lecturer at Glasgow School of Art.Much of the musical history of the Queen Margaret Union will be covered by the DJ who takes over until pm after the live performance, and Archibald is keeping the set-list for the live band under wraps until the night. However, smart money suggests that the greatest hit of Nirvana, who famously performed there on the same date, November , back in , is pretty certain to be included in some form.

Voe terminal on Shetland.These could be used to help bring other fields in the area into production.West of Shetland has remained relatively under-explored compared to parts of the North Sea close to

the luxury of a kitchenette with fireclay washtub and sink, a coalbunker and a press.For slum dwelling families, new housing schemes in places such as Blackhill were a taste of paradise.But as a new book reveals, they were blissfully unaware that they ndash and generations to come after them ndash were being condemned to a future of prejudice and stigma, because of city housing officialsrsquo deep-set Victorian attitudes.According to new research by former Glasgow corporation housing official and sociologist Seacutean Damer, a former Glasgow corporation housing official, slum tenantsrsquo futures were doomed by prejudiced attitudes that led to a three-tier ldquoclass system of housing which saw slum dwellers consigned to poorly designed schemes in polluted areas with few facilities.In the case of Blackhill, noxious fumes from the nearby gas works and toxic canal water led to early deaths, while the stigma of living in the area followed families for decades.ldquoAnyone with brains could see Blackhill was saturated with gas fumes when the wind blew from the west, says Mr Damer, whose new book, Scheming, explores the wheeling, dealing and class snobbery that went on behind the scenes of the cityrsquos slum clearance housing schemes.ldquoAnyone could see the chemicals which spewed out toxic waste to the derelict Monklands Canal, that children would make a playground on the canal and some would be drowned there.ldquoBut the scheme was built on what was manestly a dangerous site.While other housing schemes such as Mosspark enjoyed wide roads, landscaped gardens and schools, the lower tier schemes where slum dwellers were placed were bland and monochrome with muddy courtyards.They were also and devoid of decent roads, shops, schools or a church.And while the more privileged families were able tocalled in favours from well-connected figures of influence to secure homes in first and second-tier areas such as West Drumoyne, those at the bottom of the heap faced humiliating and degrading treatment from housing officials, says Mr Damer.Despite the disparity, the horric conditions of Glasgowrsquos early th century slums at Cowcaddens, Calton, Garngard and Townhead meant post-First World War families were grateful to make the move.In , almost half a million Glaswegians were squashed into small rooms and kitchens, most with shared outside toilets or lavatories set up on inside landings, and, in a few startling cases, with as many as , even up to , children per family.In the worst ldquobacklands slums, the population density reached  people per acre ndash giving Glasgow a dire reputation for more slums and worse conditions than any other city in Britain.Various housing acts promised vastly improved conditions.However, according to Mr Damer, deep-set Victorian attitudes meant there was little sympathy for those surviving in the worst conditions, battling war wounds and TB in densely-packed tenements with little ventilation, sunlight or sanitation.ldquoTo Victorians, these people were feckless, the great unwashed lsquoPeople of the Abyssrsquo, he says.ldquoThere had been a great debate in late Victorian years about what to do with them.ldquoThere was cholera and typhus in the slums that killed middle-class people and they couldnrsquot have that.ldquoDebate raged between those who wanted to rehouse them and those who wanted them to die out.ldquoSo when the State passed legislation saying local councils had to build housing for working class people, the Corporation was trapped in its whole ideologically becausethe slum dwellers did not deserve good housing they should not get it.ldquoPeople were reluctantly rehoused, he adds.ldquoAndthey were to be rehoused, they were getting the kind of house in the kind of area they deserved.A three-tier system was established which meant people considered to be upstanding, clean and capable were given homes in leafy schemes such as Mosspark, while others considered respectable skilled and semi-skilled blue collar workers were handed keys for homes in places like West Drumoyne.Many climbed the housing ladder after calling in favours from well-connected figures of influence.For those at the bottom of the heap, however, the process was much more harshwere treated harshlyfaced humiliating and degrading treatment from corporation staff and they often moved en masse, taking the stigma of the slum with them.ldquoCorporation officials treated people in re-housing schemes as a homogeneous bunch of wasters so they treated them in a very authoritarian manner, adds Mr Damer, who used interviews captured with original slum-dwelling families to create a picture of le in the new schemes.ldquoIn spite of official belief that people are thick, the vast majority of people who moved were so delighted with their new houses that they were clean and well managed.Once consigned to live in a slum-clearance scheme, stigma and prejudice followed families for generations.ldquoIt was inevitable that this pernicious ideology would overflow into the council housing management practice of Glasgow Corporation, adds Mr Damer in hisbook.ldquoConsequently, generations of Glasgowrsquos council housing managers have been imbued with authoritarian attitudes towards, especially, the tenants of tenemental rehousing schemes.Scheming by Seacutean Damer is

Albaredahope readers will Make Someones Day on St Andrews Day on November  and to then celebrate our art and culture on Fair Saturday on December  to help raise funds for good causes. Well, thanks to a new campaign by the Scottish Government, we don’t have to imagine the outcome.For that dream will become a reality on November , with people across the country being asked to commit to doing something nice for someone  on St Andrew’s Day.The Maake Someone’s Day initiative aims to celebrate our generous nature.On Saturday, December , we’re also being invited to take part in the first Fair Saturday here, a celebraion of art and culture while raising funds and awareness for charities.A helping hand...making someones day need not cost a penny. Why not pop in on an elderly relative or neighbour and make their day Founded in Spain in  to combat Black Friday’s commercialism, it is now a global movement.But Scotland is the first nation to sign up as a whole.Ben Macpherson, Minister for Europe, Migration and International Development, was delighted to launch the initiative.He said: “This St Andrew’s Day presents an inspiring opportunity for people in Scotland, in all our ersity, to celebrate the inclusive, outward-looking and compassionate spirit of our nation – by helping others and showing our generosity.Pause for thought...consider buying a homeless person a hot meal or drink to help make their St Andrews Day.“We can all show the best of what it means to be Scottish by each doing something small to #MakeSomeonesDay. “If each of us does something kind for someone , together we can make a hugely positive impact.“We wanted our national day to act as a focal point to showcase the Scots’ generous spirit and nature.data-src\"https:images.johnstonpress jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.donsidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Missing teenager Liam Smith\"  Liam Smith: Search widens viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"“This is not about how much you can spend it’s about little acts of kindness that mean so much more.“We’re asking people to make time for elderly neighbours, donate goods to charity shops, hold a charity bake sale at work, volunteer time to a good cause or gt a meal or hot drink to a homeless person.“Everyone can get involved – all you have to do is make someone’s day.”The initiative is tied in with Fair Saturday which next year will take place on St Andrew’s Day itself.Ben added: “We’re linking in with the event this year so we can build up to having a major celebration in .“Fair Saturday gives communities across the country a chance, through arts and culture, to celebrate what it means to be Scottish in the st century.“We live in a multiculural and erse society and we want to celebrate that.“Fair Saturday offers the perfect  to do that.”First staged in Bilbao in , the Fair Saturday movement is spearheaded by social entrepreneur Jordi Albareda.It has since been adopted by Malaga, Santander and Huelva in Spain, Milan and Pisa in Italy, Lima in Peru and Bristol in England.However, Scotland is the first nation to sign up.Jordi said: “When we began the Fair Saturday movement, we wanted countries all over the world to embrace its ideals of creating social impact through arts and culture. “It is fitting that Scotland is hosting the first nationwide Fair Saturday festival outside of Spain.“Scotland is a nation that focuses on ersity, multiculturalism, social empathy, kindness and, of course, arts and culture. “So it made complete sense for us to deliver the movement here. It is the most vibrant case of Fair Saturday to date.“In a time of building walls, we want to build bridges to connect people, cities, communities and cultures. “Millions of people working together surely must be stronger than some irresponsible global leaders.“We hope the Scottish people will mobilise behind our aim of creating a better future for all.”Some  events have already been organised in  cities and towns across Scotland on Fair Saturday, December .And the movement will also be celebrated in more than  locations globally.Jordi said: “More than  cultural events with a social impact will be taking place around the world.“Could you imagine the day when millions of people take part  It would send such a powerful message – that’s our aim for the future.”Fair Saturday aims to make people reflect on how arts and culture and social causes contribute to society. So all its events support a social cause of their choice in one of three ways:By recognising the charity’s workBy allowing the charity to spread its message to a wider audienceBy contributing to the charity’s work via ticket sales and donations.November  and December  in Scotland will also serve as a perfect antidote to Black Friday’s commercialism, which initially prompted Fair Saturday’s launch.Jordi added: “We connected with the Scottish Government thanks to our British Council in Bilbao in late  and are delighted to launch our first Fair Saturday here this year.“We believe it is one of the best nations in the world in which to start the journey. “Scotland’s National Day is all about sharing, giving and being kind. That tells you a lot about its people.”Visit www.scotland.org events st-andrews-day makesomeonesday to find out more or share your good deed at #MakeSomeonesDay.Fair fight back against Black FridayFair Saturday aims to mobilise people through social empathy rather than commercialisim – being staged the day after Black Friday to make that point.Jordi Albareda, its founder, convinced  choirs to perform in Bilbao, Spain, on November , , in dferent locations around the city at the same time. The result was incredible more than  people attended, raising more than  Euros for social causes.Since then, the movement has continued to grow, with more cities, cultural and social organisations and supporters joining along the way.Jordi said: “We are living in a material world. It prevails over humanity. “The strong desire of having has taken over from the profound aspiration of being. But living to the fullest is mostly about love. “In the last hours of our lives we won’t remember the things we owned but rather the people we loved.“Black Friday is one of the most irrational days of the year strong proof of a growing materialist system, based on the short term and unsustainable. “We do not pretend to fight against Black Friday but we do offer a positive alternative.“It’s all about culture before materialism. Social empathy before greed. “It’s a day to be better following a day to have more.”As for the future, Jordi hopes to target one of the world’s largest commercial markets – America.He added: “We are already taking the first steps to develop the movement in the USA in  and we’re expecting more European cities to get involved too.“Black Friday may be popular but surely Fair Saturday makes more sense.”To support Fair Saturday and find out about events in your area, visit the website at https:app.fairsaturday.org.

Every year I am bowled over by how much the campaign means to families in need throughout the City and Shire.“Applications have soared in recent years and we have been overwhelmed by the generosity of the public in allowing us to address the demand. “This year we are expecting more requests for help than ever before but we are confident that the generous people of the North-east will give what they can to bring the joy of Christmas to families in their communities.”Donations will be accepted at more than  drop-off points. Applications are accepted from professionals working with disadvantaged families until December .

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Saturday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : amAdvertorial: The Farm of Green, Eday Approximately  acres £, freehold The farm and lands of Green are situated at the south-east of Eday, just two minutes’ drive from the pier.

These concerns were echoed by the group of experts giving evidence to the Committee this morning.Speaking after the committee meeting, Mr McArthur said: “Today’s evidence session left no doubt at all that the Scottish Government is now isolated over its approach to tackle fuel poverty in rural and island areas. It is increasingly clear that Ministers will have to think again and ensure their proposals are properly #island proofed#.“In a desperate move yesterday evening, the Housing Minister issued a briefing to MSPs seeking to justy his decision not to include a rural Minimum Income Standard in the revised definition of rural fuel poverty.  This attempt by the Minister to get his retaliation in first backfired, however, as the Committee heard again today how this approach flies in the face of all the advice.“The Rural Fuel Poverty Task Force, the government’s own Independent Panel of Advisers and every organisation across the Highlands  Islands involved in housing and fuel poverty have made plain that excluding a rural MIS risks support not going to the people and communities who need it. As a result, the government’s own targets for combatting fuel poverty across the country will be undermined.“While fuel poverty is not simply an island issue, all the evidence shows that it affects rural and island communities more than others. Hopefully, today’s committee evidence session will persuade ministers to think again. If not, it will be up to parliament to force the government to do the right thing”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There are a number of potential routes we could now take with them – some of which offer us the opportunity to generate income, some to make savings # and officers will be exploring these opportunities in due course.”According to OIC, the Stewart Endowment Trust disperses the majority of its funds locally, including to NHS Orkney. The council therefore anticipates that most of the money generated from the sale will stay in and benefit Orkney.Iain Macdonald, chair of the Stewart Endowment Trust said: “The Stewart Endowment Trustees offered these islands for sale in order to generate funds, which are used to support the work of local congregations, the Balfour Hospital and a couple of national charities, as defined by the Endowment’s founding document.#We are delighted that they will be moving into ship of the local authority, where they will remain a precious asset for the whole community for generations to come.”The main island, Faray is around  acres, the Holm of Faray around  acres and the smallest of the three, Red Holm, is just five acres.There are a number of ruinous dwelling houses scattered across Faray together with a bothy which is housed in the former school. The island is mainly semi-improved grassland and has several sandy beaches together with rocky shorelines and clfs.According to the council, Faray had a population of  in , falling to  by . By the late s, there were eight crofting families living on the island, making a living through lobster fishing.

Albyn Housing is asking them to pay a lot more each month in some cases.The concerns were echoed by the MP Mr Blackford who said ldquofor quite a while now, he has been working with the CAB to get to bottom of ldquowhat I would generously describe as curious practices from Albyn Housing.He added: ldquoIn one case an Albyn Housing client who had just undertaken a tenancy was immediately sent a letter informing her rent was already in arrears.ldquoIn effect, they are asking for a payment arrangement in view that it is a debt, and extra payment is, therefore, being requested each month.ldquoI am sure as a charitable organisation Albyn Housing has their tenantsrsquo best wishes at heart, however, their recent practices raise many questions.ldquoThese must be reviewed to ensure that no additional hardship is being brought upon the people who take up a tenancy with them.In response, Calum Macaulay, chief executive at Albyn Housing Society, insisted his rent due date had not changed and said his organisation followed the statutory form of tenancy laid out by the Scottish Government in the HousingAct  ldquowhich states that rent is due on, or before, the first day of the month, paid in arrears.He went on: ldquoTenants claiming housing benefit previously had their rent paid directly to Albyn Housing.ldquoWe were always made aware that the payment was due, and as such, any arrears would be treated as technical.ldquoNow, with universal credit, the tenant is responsible for paying their rent direct. The society has no dealings with the DWP and we are not made aware of incoming housing payments. This means that all tenants, regardless of whether they are claiming universal credit or not, are required to pay their rent in accordance with their tenancy agreement.He said housing officers would be ldquomore than willing to help tenants make arrangements that work for them.It comes weeks after Albyn Housing had to apologise to a vulnerable tenant in Inverness after a boiler check bungle ended up leaving the single mum locked out of her flat for the night with her toddler daughter and having to rely on social workers to pay for emergency accommodation.Saturday  Nov  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It really is a reflection on the incredible commitment staff put in to their work.“It’s also a reflection that we have a really happy school. The pupils are engaged in quality learning and what they achieve is outstanding.“There’s a sense of community at the school and all the pupils and staff feel part of it - it’s a great school.“We don’t go out to win awards. We go out to do the best we can at everything we can - this is just the icing on the cake.”And the award was all the more sweeter given a year of upheaval for the school as it moved into new premises.The new £m school opened its doors in February months late - only to be deemed too small and in need of extra classrooms.Educations bosses will have to splash out an extra £. million to extend the premises to take in an additional  pupils by .“Moving house is a big enough task, moving a school is fraught with dficulties and to do it without any negative on the le of the school is really great,” said Mr Dempster.Fettes College in Edinburgh is ranked top of the Independent schools in Scotland studying for A-levels, GCSEs and International Baccalaureate, while Merchiston Castle School is in third place.Alastair McCall, editor of Parent Power, said: “Boroughmuir’s second triumph as Scottish State Secondary School of the Year in six years is testimony to the sustained levels of excellence that now pass for the norm at this school.“A new school building has given students surroundings commensurate with their academic success, providing an environment where they can continue to achieve great things both inside and outwith the classroom.“Students and teachers alike should be congratulated for their outstanding efforts.”St Leonard’s School in St Andrews, Fe, won The Sunday Times Scottish Independent Secondary School of the Year award.Mr McCall said: “No Scottish independent school can match St Leonard’s achievements in the sixth form averaged over the past four years.”Jordanhill School in Glasgow maintained its place at the top of the overall table with  per cent of pupils gaining five or more Highers.THE TOP  STATE SCHOOLS\u2028.

The likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson scented blood.In the end, the hard Brexiteers on the Conservative benches at Westminster could not - or, at least, have not yet - mustered the numbers they require to begin the process of trying to remove the Prime Minister from office.As the saying goes, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger and so Mrs May heads to yet another EU summit tomorrow more secure in her position than she has been for some time.The Scotsman continues to believe the UK’s departure from the EU is a mistake that will damage the economy and lessen the nation’s standing on the international stage but, in the absence of a second referendum, this is a process which will grind to its grim conclusion in March next year.This being so, it is our belief that Mrs May has a duty to do whatever she can to ameliorate the most damaging impact of Brexit. As she meets fellow leaders, we hope she will think first of this responsibility rather than of how she might placate the more excitable members on the Conservative backbenches.Those at Westminster who advocated most enthusiastically for Brexit have, in the two years since the EU referendum, repeatedly failed to explain how the painless break with Europe that they promised might be achieved. Their reassurances that the UK could dictate terms and that the EU would gladly comply have long since been exposed as fantasy.This reality, we have no doubt, will not prevent the continuation in the days and weeks ahead of nonsensical claims that they could have negotiated a stronger deal than the one Mrs May has secured. The EU has always had the upper hand in these negotiations and no amount of bluster from Brexiteers could have changed that.The legacy of the  vote is a ided country. A deal – the \u2028only deal on the table – that will satisfy neither Leavers nor Remainers will do nothing to repair that schism.This, we take no pleasure in concluding, was always going to be the case.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4834364.1543003206!/image/image.jpg","title":"stephen jardine in praise of a stirring christmas tradition","story":"Here#s a stirring way to start the magic of Christmas, writes Stephen Jardine.At it’s worst it can be an excuse for things that really belong in the pastthey cannot adapt to the modern world. Anyone who watched the documentary this week about the antiquated attitudes to women surrounding the Hawick Common Riding will know exactly what I’m talking about. However some traditions are worth preserving exactly as they are. Like Stir Up Sunday.Tomorrow, people across Britain will make the pudding that will be the crowning glory of the great feast in  weeks time. It is a food and drink tradition like no other.In an age of instant gratication, Stir Up Sunday is the opposite of that. It is the promise of good things to come but just a lot of washing up right now. Like so many of our festive traditions, it has it’s roots in Victorian times. The origins of the Christmas Pudding are medieval but Prince Albert made it fashionable in the th century and started the habit of families making it together. The last Sunday before Advent provides time for the puddings to mature and the general prayer read in churches gave the day it’s nickname : “Stir up, we beseech thee O Lord, the wills of they faithful people”. The people making their Christmas Puddings at home are nothingnot faithful. The supermarkets report declining sales as more and more customers turn instead to lighter alternatives. Only % of us will sit down to Christmas Pudding on December th.The other % will be opting for everything from clementine pavlovas to gingerbread cheesecakes. Tesco now sells three times as many Christmas Pudding alternatives as it did just  years ago. However that hasn’t put off the Stir Up Sunday traditionalists. If shop sales of puddings are falling, the home made iety is bucking the trend. That may be down to the pervasive influence of social media. After all, a Sunday spent making and stirring a pudding is a very Instagram friendly activity. With a few tiny tweaks, it is also suitable for vegans. With more and more people choosing that way of eating, a pudding full of fruit and booze that ticks the right boxes is something worth preserving.But over and above all that,what keeps Stir Up Sunday going is the tradition itself. In an age where the weekend can just mean dferent generations sitting in dferent rooms staring at dferent screens, making the pudding for Christmas Day is a simple shared activity no one can object to. According to tradition, as many members of the family as possible should be involved with the youngest giving it the first stir and the eldest giving it the last. Proper pedants also insist it should be stirred east to west to mimic the journey the Three Wise Men took to Bethlehem but that may be taking tradition too far. Several hours of mixing and boiling will give you a kitchen full of the smells of Christmas and a pudding for the day itself.Of course it is too rich and heavy but that’s not really the point.If the festive season is about family and sacred traditions, a few hours spent making a proper pudding is as good a way as any to start the magic of Christmas. ©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

stand-off.The breakthrough follows \"extremely positive and constructive\" high-level discussions between the hotel group and Highland Council.Local Highland High Leusers have been unable to use the leisure pool since the end of August when access ended because of a funding wrangle.Macdonald Hotels chairman Donald Macdonald and deputy chairman Gordon Fraser met with the councils new chief executive Donna Manson in Aviemore on Tuesday and reached a one-year agreement to resolve the stalemate.HLH users will not have to pay any additional charges which had been one of the options on the table as attempts were made to break the deadlock.There is further good news with confirmation that HLH swimming lessons for children and aquafit will also resume.Details of the funding arrangements have not yet been made public nor when the doors will re-open.Speaking after the meeting, Mr Fraser said: \"Were extremely encouraged by the positive and constructive approach taken by Donna Manson and her team and are very happy that we have reached an agreement which will see the local High Le Highland members enjoying the facilities at Aviemore Resort very soon.\"We understand that local authorities throughout the country are facing financial pressures and that there is a clear responsibility to spend tax-payers money wisely.\"We were also encouraged by the recognition of our own position that we have had to swallow a wide range of very signicant cost increases in rates, energy bills and staffing costs over the past  months.\"Mr Fraser continued: \"Its clear that both we and the council were very keen to welcome back local people and reach a clear and swt resolution to what has been an unfortunate situation for everyone concerned, and particularly for the many local High Le Highland members.\"For our part, we are very keen to have our local guests back through the doors, and I know that members of the local community will be happy that this matter has been resolved.\"The new agreement will allow time for further consultation on public access to the leisure facilities in future years.Highland Council convener Bill Lobban, who lives in Aviemore, said: \"I am delighted that a sensible agreement has been reached.\"This new deal is great news for Highland Council, High Le Highland and Macdonald Aviemore Resort but most importantly its fantastic news for the residents of Badenoch and Strathspey.\"The swimming pool is a well-used, important attraction and I would like to congratulate the staff from both sides who have worked really hard behind the scenes to get this result and more especially members of the local community who made sure that their voice was heard in the process.\"Well done to all.\"A positive community campaign had been launched called Save Our Swimming following the doors closing to HLH users at the end of the summer.SOS co-ordinator Joe Kirby described the agreement as a fantastic result for all the parties.He said: \"It is great that the council and Macdonald Hotels have listened to the concerns of the community and that a pragmaticto talks has delivered this deal.\"I know as a father myself that folk across the strath will be really looking forward to getting backing into the swimming pool with their children and other families members.\"Id like to thank everyone who wrote correspondence to Macdonald Hotels, attended the public meetings and demonstrations and who helped to fund the SOS  campaign.\"It all goes to show what can be achieve with a bit of community spirit.\"Judith Thurlow, chair of Aviemore Primary School parents council, was also absolutely delighted.\"This is a leline for so many members of our community and an essential skill for the local children to learn,\" she said.\"Thank you to everyone in the community who has persevered, shown great resilience and played a part in reaching this really positive outcome.\"Pupils from the school had written to Mr Macdonald imploring him to let them go swimming again and local GPs and aquafit users ndash some in their eighties ndash had also gone public with their health concerns.There had also been several peaceful

Highlands and Islands Enterprise who commissioned the report have described the findings as a starting point.But it appears that there would have to be very persuasive arguments to now veer from this set course.HIEs head of business development Susan Smith told the Strathy: \"This is the start of a long journey but at the centre of this needs to be the buy-in from stakeholders and the local community.\"Naturally an element of funding has to come from the public purse.\"There are large infrastructure funds for which this project may be eligible.\"Intriguingly she continued: \"Without setting hares racing it is prudent that we look at what alternative funding mechanisms might be available.\"I would put the option forward there may be a number of philanthropic investors out there who are passionate about Cairngorm who may with a sensible model and plan consider some form of philanthropic investment.\"Ms Smith would only add when pressed: \"We have a very loose expression of interest which suggest to us there may be the opportunity to do a bit more work to tease out whether this is an alternative strategy but there is absolutely no guarantee.\"On Coire na Ciste, she said the consultants found there was no business case to develop the area as campaigners and many ski visitors would like to see.The HIE boss said: \"They have come back quite unequivocally saying that it would not stack.\"They have looked at the two sites and said it is unsustainable as a second site until there is a capacity of  peopleor more using CairnGorm Mountain because facilities would have to be doubled up.\"This is the view of the experts and they have consulted widely and I have to take confidence in that... to deviate from these findings there would have to be a signicant rationale to do so.\"Ms Smith said the two new chairlts would replace some of the surface lts but was unable to say which ones.She said that their partners Highland Council, Cairngorms National Park Authority, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Enterprise Scotland were enthused and excited by the vision.She said: \"They believe that for the first time in many years this is a sensible approach for the way forward.\"She also said HIE wants to be much more inclusive working with the right community representatives.Ms Smith explained: \"It can not be a free for all. It has to be through proper and proportionate channels that we bring this forward.\"She said Natural Retreats is the operator and part of the journey and had bought into it.

not the pound.m which Councillor Bruce has claimed.\"HIE also acquired pound.m in preference shares.\"However, due in large part to delay, obfuscation and obstruction by the previous administration of Highland Council, planning permissions were still not able to be delivered after  frustrating years of trying.\"As a result, and to the intense dismay and signicant financial cost of the three partners involved, the scheme, which would have created hundreds of much-needed jobs locally in an area of the country which desperately needed them, was forced into administration.\"This obviously meant the loss of pound.m of public money, which was utterly lamentable and deeply regrettable, as well as millions of pounds of losses to the three partners involved, but it also delayed huge investment in the local economy.\"It was only because Macdonald Hotels had a rock-solid commitment to regenerating the resort that we reached an agreement with the administrators in June  which prevented it from closing down completely for a second time.\"Ironically, it was only after the administration process that Highland Council granted the planning permission which had been applied for  years previously and which two previous owners had walked away from during that time.\"There was nothing controversial within that planning permission and itrsquos no more than the design of the resort as it is today.\"Since then we have invested pound.m in transforming the infrastructure at Aviemore and are now the largest private-sector employer in the area, with hundreds of full and part time staff employed there and an annual wage bill of pound.m.\"\"Indeed, we estimate that the resort will have hosted over , overnight stays, including several international conferences ndash some of them with up to  delegates - in the current year, many of which will provide vital additional income to local bars, restaurants, shops and attractions.\"Gordon Fraser, deputy chairman of Macdonald Hotels  Resorts, said: \"It is, of course, right and proper that local politicians get involved in such important issues, but for Councillor Bruce to insist that we should simply swallow the enormous increases in rates, salaries and energy costs at Aviemore without seeking a reasonable increase in the amount we receive for allowing Highland High Le members to use private leisure facilities, is blatant double-standards.\"Itrsquos a bit rich for the council to increase our annual rates bill by . per cent in the year to March  and yet when we seek a modest uplt in charges to help us cover a small element of those and many other cost increases, one of the councilrsquos own officials described our request as lsquounaffordablersquo.\"Like us, many local businesses might consider their large rates increases to be lsquounaffordablersquo but we have no choice other than to pay them.\"Councillor Bruce should remember that we entered into this agreement, and were happy to do so, on the basis that it saved Highland Council from having to spend many millions on building their own swimming pool and leisure facilities locally.\"And he should also bear in mind that the annual sums we are discussing are far, far lower than those which Highland Council would face each year for running their own facilities.\"Despite the ill-judged intervention of Councillor Bruce, we have been encouraged by the constructive and helpful approach of other politicians and hope to meet with senior council officials in the very near future to resolve what has been a damaging and unnecessary episode.\"The sooner we can welcome High Le members back into Aviemore, the better, but it has to be on a sustainable and viable commercial basis.\"Councillor Bruce was unavailable for comment.He had asked: \"Given that HIE awarded an pound. million funding package to Macdonald Hotels to develop the Avie-more Resort ndash including the construction of the leisure arena in the early s ndash should Macdonald Hotels not allow High Le card members to use the swimming-poolfacility in view of the public funds they enjoyed and has this point been raised in negotiations rsquoHighland Council has said it remains open to restarting negotiations.Aviemore Primary School pupils recently wrote to Mr Macdonald asking for the pool to reopen and the schools parent council led by Judith Thurlow has also been part of the campaign.Saturday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118344.jpg","title":"Its far from being the end of the line","story":"Tom Ramage\"IM nervous as heck!\" confessed Karen Blessington, as she prepared to launch her own railway line last Friday.\"I have never spoken in public in my whole le so please bear with me...\"The huge crowd certainly did that and they loved every minute of the occasion as the flag went up again at Grantown East exactly  years to the day it last went down.It had been quite a journey \"from sadness to joy\" as she put it, following those drastic Beeching cuts of the s.\"The Phoenix has risen from the ashes of a derelict brown site.

point been raised in negotiations rsquoThe council leader responded in papersthat wentbefore the meeting: \"The core issue through negotiations with the resort was the financial terms of an agreement rather than public service or community obligations.\"Through successive agreements, there has always been a requirement for the council to provide funding to the resort to secure public access rather than it being provided at no cost to the council.\"Notwithstanding this, the council did seek advice some months ago from HIE, regarding the public funding arrangements related to the development of the Resort.\"The council will have further discussions with HIE, to explore whether there is anything further HIE can do to support the councilrsquos wish to see public access restored.\"She said the

this unfortunate situation and resume access to the facilities for High Le members.\"We greatly appreciate the efforts of local politicians Drew Hendry and Kate Forbes in helping to broker talks.\"John Bruces intervention will be judged on its own merits, but its worth pointing out that the company which received support from Highlands and Islands Enterprise went into administration

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster.

Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political .

Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27501  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna“We already have all-island teams that demonstrate that we can achieve great success when we work on an all-island basis.

I am not doing the work here for the students to recognise me in that way, I teach because I love it but it was such a great boost. I came into the classroom so happy and delighted to share the news with the class,” she said.Alanah spoke of the importance of young teachers making their mark in the city especially with so many who are choosing to go across the water or travel further afield.“Loads of my friends have left and gone to Liverpool, places like Qatar. I’m very much a home bird, I love being here, teaching here but I ask myself the question what does going across to Liverpool to teach have that we don’t have here at home  How are we supposed to make young lives betterwe leave and take our skills where “There is a young teaching staff in the Religion department here and our big focus is very much on ethics, making the subject more relevant to the pupils’ lives, how do you live out your faith through action  The girls I teach are so kind, there is a real kindness about our pupils, they would offer you the food from their lunch boxes, they are just so, so caring. At the minute our ‘Mini Marillacs’ named after St Louise, are collecting for the homeless and I would put a big emphasis on helping those less fortunate and the girls would bring in hats, gloves, scarfs, toiletries which are then brought to the Legion of Mary for distribution.”“Our sixth years go up to St John’s residential home every Tuesday to make cups of tea, bring buns and biscuits for the elderly. I can see them from my window and it just makes me smile knowing they are going up and more importantly want to go up, you don’t have to police them,” she said.Alanah spoke warmly of the “community spirit” in St Louise’s and how “everybody knows everybody” as school le presents “always something new”.“This is a huge school but you know everyone in it.

And he added that despite the fact that Remembrance Sunday was marked almost a fortnight ago, poppies are still being displayed by some staff – with some workers opting for the double-whammy of a banned football and the remembrance symbol.“Employees here are brazenly walking around in Rangers and Northern Ireland tops even though everybody knows the rules,” our source inside the factory said. “It’s not asCoca-Cola is a wee firm that employs two or three people in a shed. It’s a massive global company with strict rules in place to ensure harmony and equality and yet nothing is being done. People see other people wearing football tops and they think, ‘Oh, that’s allowed now.’ And the poppies are still around too as well as other symbols used by one side of the community. Sometimes they’re pinned to the banned jerseys.”The worker said that Catholic members of staff are disappointed by the lack of action by senior members of staff. He added that things would continue to get worse until existing policy is enforced.“Management have yet to do anything about it,” he said. No-one is even being talked to never mind disciplined for their actions.“Personally, I feel antagonised, intimidated and fearful working in a place that is allowing this to continue and I know others do too. This is a place of work and people should be able to come to work without being in fear or intimidated in this manner.”A spokesperson for Coca-Cola denied any knowledge of football shirts being worn in at the plant but pointed out that the wearing of poppies all year round is acceptable.“We are not aware of any recent instances of employees wearing football shirts at work. Doing so would be in contravention of our unorm and dress code policy.

These pressures have left many of our members on the verge of quitting their jobs. This is an intolerable situation for the NASUWT, we are committed to defending the rights of our members in this school and hope that a constructive engagement can begin soon with the employers to fully address the situation.”A spokesperson for the CCMS, which oversees St Patrick#s said: “CCMS fully appreciates the right of teachers to take industrial action. However, we do not believe that in this instance such action is either proportionate or warranted. It is our firm belief that the issues at the heart of this dispute can best be dealt with through an open and honest dialogue which seeks to provide balance to the concerns of both sides.“CCMS echoes the Board of Governors in its call for a suspension to the proposed industrial action in order to create the time and space for meaningful and respectful dialogue aimed at resolving the issues of concern and dispute.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37561535.ece/53705/AUTOCROP/w620/DUPconference002.jpg","title":"dup deputy leader tells pm it is not too late to bin brexit deal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Now named Everest, the animal gave birth to a litter of six a week after making herself at home with Lisa, but just days later she rejected her newborns.This left Lisa - assisted by her husband and two daughters - facing the massive task of hand-rearing them all and so began a round-the-clock battle against the odds to keep the six little bundles alive, fed, watered and loved.Speaking to the Belfast , Lisa said: \"I took a call from a member of the public who said she had found a dog in a very distressed state so I told her to bring it to me.\"I was a bit surprised to see that the dog, which we called Everest, was heavily pregnant so I took her to the vet who told me she was ready to give birth at any time.\"We made a whelping area ready for her and she delivered six pups a week later.\"Everest, who, at around a year old is not much more than a pup herself, did well for the first week as a new mum but then kept sitting on her litter, burying them and dragging them by the back leg across the kitchen floor.\"I knew then I would have to step in or she would have killed the pups, so me, my two daughters and my husband worked around the clock bottle-feeding all six.\"The smallest one - we called him Tiny Tim because he was less than half the size of the others - had been bottle-fed from day one by me because he just wasnt going to survive,\" she said.\"He has done so well, in fact he did that well we couldnt call him Tiny Tim any longer and re-named him Arlo.\"New homes have been found for five of the litter and their mother, but the idea of parting with the puppy formerly known as Tiny Tim was too much for Lisa so he has become the latest rescue animal to join the Patton household. \"People have asked meit was hard to give them up and it was to an extent, but at the same time you are constantly cleaning up. \"They are lovely dogs who have gone to really good homes but I just couldnt part with Tiny Tim,\" she said."},{"url":null,"title":"foster eu withdrawal text not in nis longterm interests","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

No one has reasons to be happy.

treatment for a rare spinal condition in that hope that it will be made available to children in the North.Donna Ferris’ three year-old son Charlie was diagnosed with progressive infantile idiopathic scoliosis when he was just six months old.If left untreated, the spinal deformity can lead to severe twisting of the spine, respiratory problems and even decreased le expectancy.When little Charlie was first diagnosed back in February , doctors in Belfast told his anxious parents Donna and Jodie that their only option was to put their son in a plaster jacket to hold in the curve in his spine until he was old enough for surgery.However, determined Donna vowed to do everything in her power to keep her baby son away from the operating table and invasive surgery.After hours of online research, the mum-of-four found a hospital in the United States which offers specialised scoliosis treatment.Donna discovered that Shriners Hospital in Philadelphia offered advanced treatment which could potentially avoid surgery.She said: “When I was researching I checked for hospitals in the east coast of America as I knew it would be easier to fly into there from Ireland.  I came across Shriners Hospital and made contact straight away askingthey accepted international patients.  They said they did and sent me some forms which I filled in.  Within four days of applying to the hospital for the treatment Charlie was accepted, and within a month he was at the hospital.”On April , , Donna, Jodie and their four kids made the trip to Philadelphia for Charlie’s first appointment.Just a few days later, Charlie was fitted with a Mehta cast which was specially designed to correct the curve in his spine.Over the last  months, Charlie has made the same journey  times.Before having his first cast fitted, the curvature in Charlie’s spine was at a -degree angle.Earlier this month, during their th trip to Shriners Hospital, the Ferris family received the news they had been hoping for.“They took Charlie’s brace off  hours after arriving at the hospital and sent him for x-rays.  After this the doctors brought us in and gave us the great news that Charlie’s spine is now down to six degrees,” said Donna.“I just burst into tears crying.  I just couldn’t believe it.  The staff at the hospital were also crying and hugging us.  They were just so, so happy.  They are always willing the children on there.  It was just amazing news to get.”Donna said before starting his treatment in the US, Charlie was a ‘very restless baby’ and she ‘really struggled to get food into him’.Now, she says her son is a completely dferent person.“The boy we have now is just perfect.  He is meeting all his milestones and is doing everything a wee child of his age should be doing and he will go on to lead a healthy le,” she said.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Charlie knows that he’s dferent and he has to wear a brace that not everyone  does but he’s adapted to it all from the get-go, he’s just brilliant.“The plan now is that Charlie will remain in brace until June next year and then he will switch to a night time brace for six months at least.  Hopefully he will not have to wear a brace at all eventually.”Following Charlie’s diagnosis and the news that he would have to travel to America for the specialised treatment, the Ballinderry and wider community set about fundraising for the family to help fund their travel, something which the Ferris family are ever grateful for.Donna also has nothing but praise for Shriners Hospital.“Words cannot describe how grateful we are to the hospital for what they have done for us,” she said.“When we first took him to the hospital we knew Charlie was going to be in expert hands as they specialise in infantile scoliosis.“We are so, so grateful to them and it’s very hard to put into words how good they all are.  They don’t just treat Charlie, they treat the whole family.  It’s the same people treating Charlie each and every time and he has become so familiar with them all.“Shriners is a non-profit hospital and they treat families regardless of their ability to pay.  All the time we have been there we have never received a bill from them.  To go half way across the world to another hospital and not be billed is just amazing.”Charlie’s journey over the last  months has been well documented by Donna on a Facebook page named ‘Charlie’s Journey with Infantile Scoliosis’.Through the page, other parents in similar situations have reached out to Donna who has offered them support and advice.  She has also given them ‘hope of what can be achieved’.On November , Donna attended the Families First awards ceremony in Sligo Park Hotel where she was presented with an ‘Inspirational Person’ award – an accolade which she had been nominated for by a parent from Co Cavan.“I spoke to the audience and told them our story and I received a standing ovation afterwards.  I was just overwhelmed by how many people I have touched out there.  It was the perfect end to the perfect week.”Donna now hopes that by speaking out about Charlie’s treatment that it will give other children hope.“The treatment that Charlie received at Shriners Hospital has been available at Great Ormond Street Hospital since July this year however I really want it to become available across the UK and Ireland.“Charlie is living proof of what can be achieved by this gentle, non-invasive treatment so why not offer it to babies here and give them a chance.“I want to be able to help other children in our own country and want parents not to have to feel the need to travel abroad for adequate care.  I would just love to see this treatment available here so there is hope for other families.”To follow Charlie’s progress visit ‘Charlie’s Journey with Infantile Scoliosis’ on

filmmaker wants james bulger film screened derry reopen debate case","story":"The writer and director of an award-winning film about the murder of Liverpool toddler, James Bulger, screening in Derry this weekend, said he hopes the film will open up a new debate on what made two -year-old boys murder a child.Vincent Lambe’s film, ‘Detainment’, is based on the true story of James Bulger, abducted in Liverpool in  and found brutally murdered two days later. However, the most shocking aspect of the case was that the main suspects were just children themselves - two ten-year-old boys, Jon Venables and Robert Thompson. Based on their interview transcripts, the film dramatizes the police interviews which took place at the time.Detainment stars Will O’Connell , David Ryan , Tara Breathnach , Morgan C. Jones , Brian Fortune , Kathy Monahan , and introduces two exceptional young actors, Ely Solan and Leon Hughes.Speaking to the Derry News, Vincent Lamb said that he hopes the film will challenge public perception of the boys who committed the murder and open a wider debate on the matter.When asked what drew him to the story, he replied: “I was asked that same question when I was over in London where I did an interview for Sky News the UK audience find it strange that an Irish filmmaker would be interested in something so deeply rooted in the British consciousness.“But it affected the people here in Ireland just as much as the people in the UK. I was  at the time it happened and I remember it very well.“I remember growing up hearing about it and heard it mentioned again as an adult and it was unexpected how I felt about it at the time.“I started reading everything I could find on it and then I got the transcripts [of the police interviews] and felt that I was seeing something not everyone  was seeing.”SensitiveVincent said that casting the child actors for the roles of Thompson and Venables was challenging but that the young actors, Ely Solanand Leon Hughes , who have been critically-acclaimed for their astonishing performances, were ‘phenomenal’.“I had a lot of apprehension about making a film on such a sensitive story,” he said.“The public outrage at the time was unprecedented and it hasn’t gone away, it’s still there. So many people just seen these boys as being evil and couldn’t cope with the fact that they were just two little boys. The only way they could make sense of it was to see them as evil.“Newspapers labelled them as ‘evil monsters’, the spawn of Satan’ and ‘freaks of nature. People hadn’t really looked at other points of view andyou did, you were criticised – people couldn’t see any other reason for it other than they were evil.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“When I was , I accepted that they must have been evil but as an adult when I researched it a bit more, my opinion altered and I hope that this film will help other people change their minds.“By looking into the boys’ family background, I got a better understanding of what could have led two -year-old boys to commit such a horrible crime.“This film is not sympathetic to the boys and is not trying to make an excuse for them in any way but it humanises them. People may be more comfortable thinking of them as evil monsters but, after reading the transcripts, it was a tragedy for three families and that’s not a popular opinion.“The film is entirely factual, there is no embellishment – it is almost entirely verbatim. When I was making the film, given my apprehensions, it was very important to me that everything was factual.”‘Prevent this happening again’Vincent said that he was especially nervous when he heard that journalist and expert of the James Bulger murder, David James Smith, was attending one a screening of the film at the Winchester Film Festival. Smith wrote a book on the matter, The Sleep of Reason: The James Bulger Case.“He turned up at the last screening in the UK and I was terried,” he said.“He’s such an expert on the case, I was dreading to hear what he thought but he said the film was ‘authentic’ and a ‘remarkable achievement’ which was an amazing endorsement.“He also wrote a lovely review saying thatthe audience were willing to find the truth out about those boys, they could not ignore their inescapable smallness.”“People don’t talk about this case enough, butyou have any other opinion other than the boys were monsters, it’s rejected and it stles debate on the issue. We want to prevent this happening again so we need to understand the case.“I remember the Judge’s comments about the boys and I thought it was a ludicrous decision to name them but the more I read, the more I understood his reasons – he wanted a discussion about it, to look into the background of the boys and see how something like could be prevented from ever happening again. I hope that people will debate the case again after watching the film.”Vincent finally had a word for the Bulger family: “I don’t want anyone to think that I don’t have sympathy for the Bulger family, I have enormous sympathy for little James, for what he went through and what his family have been through.”‘Detainment’ by award-winning director, writer and producer, Vincent Lambe and Irish producer, Darren Mahon, will screen at Foyle Film Festival in the Nerve Centre on Sunday, November , at pm.More information about the film and upcoming screenings can be found at: www.detainmentfilm"},{"url":null,"title":"people derry urged think twice visiting emergency department winter emerges ae altnagelvin dealing 230 people","story":"UP to  people are visiting the Accident and Emergency department in Altnagelvin Hospital every day, it has emerged.The figure emerged at Novembers meeting of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Health and Community meeting, where senior figures from the Western Trust were in attendance to discuss its Winter Resilience Plan  .Speaking at the meeting Geraldine McKay, Director of Acute Hospitals with the Trust, said that ‘demands’ were already very high on its services as it had experienced an increase in the numbers of people attending the AE department at Altnagelvin over the past year.She told the meeting that the eight per cent increase over the past year meant that the hospital was now dealing with  to  people on a daily basis, compared to a figure of  to  every day last year.Mrs McKay added that the bulk of people attending the department were Category  and Category  patients, who she said were the ‘sickest patients with the most complex needs’, adding that these patients would be in need of ‘immediate attention’, and required treatment within an hour.The meeting was told that the emergency department was facing additional pressures due to issues with gaining accesses to beds within the unit, adding that there also had been an increase in the numbers of people who have had to wait over  hours for treatment.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshMrs McKay continued that it would be issuing an appeal through the media urging people to consider their condition before attending the local Accident and Emergency department.“We do believe there will be a tough winter ahead of us all, and we hope you can disseminate that information to people that they may not need to attend the Emergency Department,” she told the meeting.Mrs McKay also spoke of the extreme pressure placed on the department last winter due to the outbreak of the norovirus, and also urged people to take advice from their GPs on their condition before attending the AE.However, she also stressed thatpeople do feel that they must attend the unit, then they should not ‘take any chances’.“Go to your GP and take the advice,” Mrs McKay said.“If you need to the be there , then you need to there, because there are people who put off going there over the fear that there may be already large numbers there.”"},{"url":null,"title":"newtowns railway station bidding for access upgrade","story":"Disabled access at Newtown railway station on Wednesday, November , .MS-ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt-lt spangtlt spangt\" \"   typemchtype\" \"\"Newtowns railway station bidding for access upgradeA general view of Newtown railway station on Monday, March , .Pic: Mike Shltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgteridan County TimesMltspan classtruncate-full-screengtS-lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" \"   typemchtype\" Newtowns railway station bidding for access upgradeA general view of Newtown railway station on Wednesday, November , .MS-ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt-lt spangtlt spangt\" \"   typemchtype\" Skip to next image raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"angela receives highest uk air ambulance honour","story":"WAA Chief Executive Angela Hughes receives her Letime Achievement Award.\" \"   typemchtype\" \"\"Angela receives highest UK Air Ambulance HonourWAArsquos fleet of four helicopters.\" \"   typemchtype\" Skip to next image raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"visiting tangent clubs luminary on hand to switch on llandrindod wells christmas lights","story":"Prize winners in the decorated lantern competitionreceive their prizes as Sue ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtHill presents Sophialtspan classtruncate-full-screengt Morgan with her first place award.

I hope new hotel investment, which would provide the local economy with a signicant boost, can be realised, he added.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the council undertook a study to review hotel provision across the district and identied additional need specically within the Newcastle area.ldquoThe council has carried out an initial feasibility study on the Newcastle Centre site which identied that a hotel could be built on the site. General discussions have subsequently taken place with a number of potential developers about hotel provision in the Newcastle area,rsquorsquo he continued.ldquoThe council is also currently working with a consultant on the feasibility study for leisure provision in the Newcastle area and it is anticipated that a report will be presented to the Active and Healthy Communities Committee in the coming months..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan wildlife activist recognised by Prime Minster  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN teenager has been recognised by Prime Minister Theresa May for urging young people to protect the environment.Fourteen year-old Dara McAnulty is one of the latest recipients of the the Points of Light award, which recognises outstanding volunteers who are making a change in their community and inspiring others.He was presented with his award at an event held at Kew Gardens in London last week.Mrs May wrote to Dara congratulating him on his achievement.ldquoThrough your award-winning blog, you are encouraging young people to support their local environment and learn about the importance of conservation, she said.ldquoYour writing is raising awareness of how nature can help people cope with autism and you should feel proud of this remarkable achievement.Dara has been a driving force behind the Grassroots Challenge run by Ulster Wildle.In his blog he encourages other people his age to make videos of the out-doors and at the same time participate in conservation.Dara, who is autistic, says he is inspired by the beauty of the Mourne countryside on his doorstep and that developing a connection with nature helps him manage his anxiety.This in turn helped him to open the door for other people his age to become conservation enthusiasts too.Dara said: ldquoI am honoured to receive the Points of Light award. I sincerely hope that it shines a light on how vital nature is to us all, our mental health, our wellbeing and the survival of all le.ldquoWe need more young voices to speak up and take action for nature though.

The players ran their socks off and there was plenty of commitment. The tackling was hard, but fair, and it was a credit to the spirit in which the tie was played that not a single player was yellow-carded.The first half chance of the match fell to nippy YM striker Aaron Cheevers, who was almost through on goal, but was thwarted when Connolly came quickly off his line to save.Jack Roddy then headed narrowly over for Olympic and not long afterwards Olympic were awarded a free kick outside the box following Richard Annettrsquos challenge on Shane Rodgers. Unfortunately, Darryl Russell shot tamely against the wall.The best chance of the half fell to Olympic just after the half hour. Following a corner Gary Wilsonrsquos shot was cleared off the line and Roddy blazed over the bar.Cheevers was always a threat up front for the YM. On  minutes he was clean through, but again Connolly came out to thwart the danger. On  minutes he came within inches of putting his head on a cross by the impressive Wilson and just before the break his flicked header were narrowly wide.Ten minutes into the second half Olympicrsquos Simon Marmion found Joshua Fennell with a long pass, only for Fennell to shoot over from outside the penalty area on the right side.Four minutes later Damian Travers found himself with space in the box, but his left-footed shot was easilysaved by Connolly.On  minutes YMrsquos Sam Annett let fly, but his shot took a deflection off an Olympic defender for a corner.Both sides made a number of changes to break the deadlock and with five minutes to go YM substitute James Croskery shot low and hard, but straight at Connolly.The breakthrough nearly came moments later when Wilson delivered a dangerous free kick into the YM box, but Adam McDowell and Lee Maxwell couldnrsquot get a touch.In the first period of extra time, Rhys Patterson thought he had won it for Olympic, but Tate pulled off a great save.Just at the end of the second period Ronnie Johnston shot inches wide for YM after a good cross from the left by Adam McDowell.But the goals didnrsquot come and in the end it was all down to a penalty shoot-out. Olympic deserved to win, but it was cruel on the Young Men.Ballynahinch Olympic II: R Connolly, J Roddy, D Russell, N McGlew, M Rice, S Marmion, J Fennell, G Wilson, R Patterson, D Travers, S Rodgers.

The council also hopes to acquire match funding from central government.Among the key issues identied by council officials is either restricting or banning altogether unsorted black bin bag waste. Thousands of people regularly empty a iety waste into the bin bags and take them to the recycling centres. But that could be about to change.Council officials also want to vigorously challenge the perception that the centres are viewed by many as ldquodumps and reinforce the message that they are for recycled waste only.They say the misuse of the centres has potential cost implications for the authority, with the review examining detailed guidelines and systems which are required for what is being described as the ldquoproper operation of the recycling centres.The review examined entrance policies and a potential restriction or complete ban on large vans using the centres with a daily restriction on the amount of waste the facilities can receive.There is also growing concern at senior management level that a signicant amount of the waste being taken to recycling centres ends up in the general waste stream as it cannot be recycled. Council officials say addressing this issue will cut costs and produce savings.Last night, politicians were asked for permission to complete a detailed report on the way forward, based on the evidence gathered during the review process, with a particular focus on centre opening hours and staffing levels that must be achieved at no extra cost.Councillors were told the report will also make a recommendation to harmonise policies and procedures across all current recycling centres in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.Over recent months, local politicians have expressed concern at a number of fly-tipping and illegal dumping incidents across the district, with several taking place within a stonersquos throw of the Cloonagh Road facility in Downpatrick.This particular facility has long since passed its sell-by-date with work on a poundm replacement at the nearby Flying Horse Road currently underway.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A request by this newspaper three weeks ago revealed a list of over  decisions. However, a list obtained by the Belfastcontains  decisions.Stormont Castle stressed that it was not a complete list because “it is not possible to specy the terms in which any request for a decision may be put to ministers”. However, the Executive Office said that it expected the list it released to contain many of the proposals which will be put to them “at an early stage”there is either a restoration of devolution or a move to direct rule.The decisions cover every Stormont department with the exception of the Department of Finance, which did not include a response.The decisions which have built up include:• Whether to close or merge schools which are judged unviableSam McBride: DUP’s electoral insulation could be a  comfort Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"• A series of major planning applications of Northern Ireland-wide importance• An action plan to root out paramilitarism• Dozens of public appointments• Plans for superfast broadband• Use of recycled manure solids on farms• Funding for safety improvements at football stadiums• Welfare reform mitigation schemes• Radical reforms in health and education.There is some evidence, however, that Ms Bradley’s legislation to give civil servants some powers of ministers is having an effect. The list initially included the inability to raise pay for health workers. However, this week civil servants agreed to a policy which will see that happen.Calling for direct rule ministers, UUP leader Robin Swann said the revelation showed that “government is grinding to a halt”. He added: “Karen Bradley MP wouldn’t stand for it in her own constituency, so I don’t see why the people of Northern Ireland should have to stand for it either”.try catch     .               ..

Dogs are wonderful at pretending they understand everything you say especiallyyou are saying it near the cupboard where the treats reside.The whole sorry saga of Brexit is impossible to escape.I was about to roll up a page of newspaper to light the fire only to be drawn to the headline at the top: ‘The EU will turn us into captiveswe sign up to this appalling sell-out.’ It was the latest rant in the Dailyfrom Boris Johnson, who wants the Northern Ireland backstop scrapped with both sidesto simply ‘commit to avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland by the use of new unobtrusive checks and discussions of the future economic partnership’ where, he says ‘the Irish discussion rightly belongs’.suitcases packed.That was the day before Sinn Fein’s president Mary Lou McDonald was shouting at the top of her voice about the DUP being out of step on Brexit and ‘must face reality’. Now, I wonder what that reality might be  Seconds later she was urging Arlene Foster to “wake up and smell the coffee”. This is the very same Mary Lou who claims to have “no regrets” over her handling of the Mairia Cahill case. Mary Lou can shout all she wants. Only her own side will be listening.The Northern Ireland born Labour MP for Vauxhall Kate Hoey had a lot to say this week too. Ms Hoey informs us she has “ploughed through” the  pages of the proposed withdrawal agreement plus the explanation notes – that makes her a hero in my eyes – and declares that “Northern Ireland, to all intents and purposes, becomes separated in many ways from the rest of the United Kingdom”, with the backstop arrangements looking like they were written by the Irish government.All in all it means that the Republic of Ireland would, effectively, be representing Northern Ireland in the EU, she believes. A highly respected politician, one not given to exaggeration, I would say she has got it right. That was one page of newspaper I saved from the flames.Then, of course, there are the Scots whose nationalism is getting a fresh kick from the Brexit chaos.Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s First Minister, accuses Theresa May of asking people to “take a blindfold leap off a clf” with her Brexit deal. Ms Sturgeon, as we all know, has her heart set on independence for Scotland. She may yet be successful second time around. How amazing it is that women are playing such a big role in the whole Brexit saga.Years ago Margaret Thatcher had the political field all to herself. Had she been in charge today she would long ago have hand-bagged Jean-Claude Junker and the elegant Mr Barnier into submission. Theresa May, on the other hand, looks like the one being hand-bagged.Legacy Scandal: The IRA was able to wage terrorism on Castlederg because it was near the safe haven of the Irish Republic Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"So when does this crisis begin to calm down so that the rest of us can get on with planning our Christmas  It’s not looking good.

Four weeks later the cash for ash scandal erupted and rapidly led to her removal as first minister.At last year’s party conference, though weakened by an appalling Assembly election result in the wake of the scandal, Mrs Foster was able to use the DUP’s stunning position after the subsequent Westminster election to project an image of her party wielding unparalleled power and influence.The de facto deputy prime minister and the government’s chief whip were present to make speeches, a feat which would have been unthinkable for much of the history of a party which was steeped in anti-establishment ideology.Over the last year, the party has been dogged by crises and embarrassing revelations.In February, the party leadership came to the verge of a deal with Sinn Fein to restore Stormont but couldn’t sell it. That was followed by Ian Paisley’s suspension from Parliament for accepting lavish holidays from a foreign government.And for months the RHI Inquiry has exposed the myth of the DUP as a happy family, exposing feuding, nepotism, alleged drunkenness, incompetence, greed and backbiting.For the second year in a row, Arlene Foster has refused to speak to News Letter readers, declining to do the traditional sit-down interview ahead of the party conference.No reason was given for that decision but there has been internal DUP concern about Mrs Foster’s tone in interviews and her ability to face dficult questions.This year there are still the trappings of the DUP’s powerful position, with Tory big beasts in attendance at the conference.But there is the increasing concern among some unionists that the DUP’s influence with the government is not as substantial as the party boasted.For more than a year the DUP has been explicit that it was prepared to accept almost any form of Brexit so long as it involved Northern Ireland being treated the same as the rest of the UK – what Mrs Foster described as her “blood red line”.And yet the party has been unable to convince the prime minister of sticking to the one red line it outlined, with Theresa May’s Brexit deal setting out the prospect of Northern Ireland erging from the rest of the UK and staying closer to the EU in key areas of regulation.Foster: EU withdrawal text not in NI’s long-term interests Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The party now faces myriad dilemmas with decisions over coming months about whether to bring down the government and risk Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister, whether to replace Arlene Foster as leader, how to respond to the looming RHI Inquiry report and the question of whether it can sell a compromise with Sinn Fein in order to restore Stormont.Many unionists are reassured to see the DUP in the position where it finds itself, recalling how other avowedly unionist prime ministers have been prepared to disregard their views.For those people, the DUP is now a constitutional handbrake. Eventhat handbrake fails over Brexit, it will not necessarily result in electoral punishment for the DUP because in those circumstances those voters are likely to see Northern Ireland’s place as being all the more precarious and therefore see an increased need for a strong unionist voice.But while the DUP may be electorally insulated, the real damage could be to the Union itself, with the combination of Brexit, the exposure of DUP behaviour in government and Northern Ireland’s farcical governance vacuum leading to soft nationalists and some of the constitutionally unaligned becoming increasingly vocal in stating that they are now looking to Dublin for a solution.try catch     .               ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/shore_1.jpg","title":"alternative london the place to be seen in the city","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business From London’s thriving bohemian hub and street art capital to a food, drink and nightle must-visit... John Mulgrew explores Shoreditch and beyond Once just the purview of the artistic and trendsetting, Shoreditch has fast become a location worthy of a trip in itself when visiting London.Nestled in the East End of the city, Shoreditch offers up a buzzing cultural environment, lots of independent places to eat and drink, and boasts one of the city’s best markets. Now, those in the north west always feel a little hard done by when it comes to connectivity outside Northern Ireland.In this case though, Flybmi now connects City of Derry Airport regularly with London Stansted. From there, it’s a regular train into Liverpool Street station, and then onwards using the tube or bus across the city.Andyou’re visiting Shoreditch, it’s hard to miss Boxpark. Sitting close to the tube station, it’s an array of black-clad shipping containers, with a host of retailers and places to eat. A bite at posh chip shop Poptata helps fuel the day.Journalists often prefer the freedom to explore a city at their own pace – picking up things along the way, without being ferried from place-to-place. But a food-focused tour from Alternative London brought out areas that might have otherwise been missed.Shoreditch is famous for the sheer volume of graffiti and art strewn around the area, but getting an insider’s view on the changes taking place in the area – including paid-for advertising now adorning some of the spaces reserved for artists from the area, or a Banksy – really helps take in as much as possible.Christiaan Nagel’s mushrooms, which can be found in several roof-top locations, led us to teashop T, taking in a salt-beef bagel at Beigel Bake on Brick Lane, followed by the modern, family-run self-styled home-style Indian restaurant, Gunpowder. The aloo chaat is a signature, with punch, depth and zing, while an almost unavoidable venison and vermicelli ‘doughnut’ is worth the visit alone.A brief half in the grade II listed Ten Bells, which has links to Jack the Ripper, was followed by a familiar trip to Old Spitalfields Market. It has a dense, tight offering of top-end food stalls, from Asian steamed buns at Yum Bun, to Portuguese custard tarts and fruit tea at Yi Fang.An unmissable food destination sits across from the market. St John Bread and Wine is one of Fergus Henderson’s London outlets. It’s a casual, laid back and sparse affair, which allows you to same some of the best British cooking available. You can stop by for a very reasonably priced, and one of the restaurant’s signature dishes, such as Welsh Rarebit, devilled kidneys on toast or, my choice on this visit, blood cake and egg. Think richer, chunkier black pudding, crispened in a pan with a rich-orange hued yolk. There are plenty of spots to socialise in and around Shoreditch, with some of London’s better beer bars included. The Craft Beer Co has a location on Old Street, while there’s a Brewdog and the Draft House, hidden in the Bower development.Arriving back to the hotel in the evening, don’t expect dull or leless environment at the Hoxton. The downstairs is thriving during the day, with the usual spectrum of aluminium-clad Apple Macs, but at night, especially at the weekend, it’s very much a nightspot in the area.Butyou’re after a decent night’s sleep, there’s very little sound making its way to the bedrooms from the ground-floor buzz.Leaving the hip surroundings of Shoreditch, and heading to the rather more touristy affair of Leicester Square, the Hotel Indigo is offers a grand view of the London skyline.The new rooftop bar is a superb vantage point to overlook the square, and pick out the city’s most famous structures. Then there’s the National Portrait Gallery – which sits just a short distance away from the Hotel Indigo.During the trip there was a Michael Jackson ‘On the Wall’ exhibition – one for Jackson fans, certainly – but the gallery itself, which is free, is worth a visit for everyone . It also hosts a ‘Friday Lates’ event – opening into the night, and with a small pop-up bar for visitors.Not far away, the Japan Centre offers up a myriad of everything the country has to offer in regards to food and drink in particular – from freshly made miso, to a ied and wide-selection of sake, it’s a stop worth making for anyone keen on trying to replicate the flavours they’ve had while visiting the country.Meanwhile, Shoryu Ramen – located very close to base camp at the Hoxton – offers some of the best casual noodles in the city. Starting off with cleanly flavoured salmon sashimi, followed by the garlic kick of the Dracula Tonkotsu – a heady allium-rich version of their -hour pork broth.For those in and around what is one of the city’s most tourist-heavy locations, Granaio is a reasonably recent addition.It’s a fairly familiar format – Italian classics and a wide-ranging menu, which will keep the majority of visitors content, at a reasonable price, considering the location. A beef tartare was solid, and a ribeye cooked correctly on the inside, despite a lack of charring on the outside.The theatre obviously plays a large part in the attraction to London, but the Immersive Gatsy experience turns a chunk of a Long Lane building into an interactive re-telling of F Scott Fitzgerald’s the Great Gatsby. It’s dferent, but impressively choreographed, and something alternative to spending a huge wad of cash on a West End show.A crisp sunny day before heading back on the train to Stansted offered a chance to try Hawksmoor. The steak restaurant now has nine locations in the UK, and focuses on dry-aged beef and all that comes with it.A Sunday lunch of rich, pink rump of beef comes with a Yorkshire pudding, stunningly crunchy roasties and a roasted bulb of garlic, and shallot – leaving them soft and packed full of umami.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
