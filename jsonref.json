Video: Enda O\u0027DowdIn a highly significant move at Cop26 an alliance of countries has committed to phasing out production of oil and gas – and is to push for an international agreement on setting an end date for the exploration and extraction of the fossil fuels.The launch of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA), which Ireland has joined, is a first in an international climate process which up to now has focused on limiting carbon emissions from fossil fuels rather than turning off the tap. The 2015 Paris Agreement did not even mention fossil fuels, which generated 91 per cent of human-induced carbon emissions in 2020.The alliance is seeking to curtail new licensing and undertake other measures to phase out oil and gas production in line with the Paris accord. Ireland joined Costa Rica Denmark, France, Greenland, Quebec, Sweden, Wales, California and New Zealand in making the milestone announcement.Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan said: “Ireland is leading the way in incentivising the transition to renewable energy and putting ourselves on a pathway to net zero, by legislating to keep fossil fuels in the ground. The decision we have made today sends a powerful message we are moving irrevocably away from fossil fuels towards a renewable future - both in Ireland and internationally.”“Through the Climate Act 2021, Ireland has closed the door on new exploration activities for oil and gas. There is no longer a legal basis for granting new licences,” he underlined. In line with Government policy of keeping fossil fuels in the ground, “we are also currently legislating to prohibit exploration for and extraction of coal, lignite and oil shale”, Mr Ryan confirmed. Founding members “committing to end new concessions, licensing or leasing rounds, and promoting dialogue on the need for a managed and just phase-out”. Mr Ryan added: “By prohibiting offshore oil and gas exploration, not only are we doing what we need to do to address climate change, we are also protecting our bioersity which is intrinsically linked to climate change. There are other impacts. For example, scientific research demonstrates that the seismic activity that accompanies exploration and drilling has significant environmental effects.”No futureDenmark and Costa Rica led the initiative. Denmark’s minister for climate, energy, and utilities Dan Jorgensen said that it was expensive for his country as it was the largest producer of oil in the EU but “we do it because we believe we need to”.“There’s no future for oil and gas in a 1.5-degree world,” he added.Costa Rica’s environment minister Andrea Meza said the alliance was about early movers showing courage, “backed by concrete actions”.“It’s a big deal,” said Harro van Assel of Stockholm Environment Institute. “It’s the first time governments are committing together to phase down oil and gas production.”Jerry Mac Evilly, head of polity at Friends of the Earth Ireland said Ireland’s participation in BOGA was hugely positive. “Ireland has taken important steps in recent years to phase out fossil fuels, from ending new oil and gas exploration, to banning onshore fracking. However with the new alliance we are now finally seeing domestic progress being reflected in foreign policy.” He added: “The fossil fuel era must be brought to an end and this means leaving fossil fuels in the ground. This new alliance is an opportunity for Ireland to show leadership and end the reckless expansion of oil and gas at home and abroad.”Meanwhile the Government has also announced €2 million to the Climate and Clean Air Coalition which aims at cutting short-lived pollutants including methane and to reduce air pollution – an initiative that has been led by US climate envoy John Kerry.

Photograph: Robert PerryEPAThe rulebook for implementing the 2015 Paris climate agreement could be completed at the Cop26 in Glasgow this week, European Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans has said.He said completing the rulebook, which sets out detailed guidance for how countries must implement the goals agreed in Paris in 2015, would be one of the key outcomes of this week’s summit. “It will allow us to start delivery of what was agreed six years ago in a way that is transparent for everyone and accountable for everyone,” he told a press conference in Glasgow. “I think there is a positive dynamic, and I see a growing sense among fellow leaders that we need to find agreement. We in the European Union continue to work to keep the momentum going and hopefully drive it to the highest possible level of ambition.” Most of the rulebook has been agreed since 2018 but a number of key issues remain unresolved, notably on the regulation of carbon markets where emissions are traded. Completing the rulebook would be a major success for Cop26, which is due to end by 6pm on Friday but Mr Timmermans warned it would be a “very bad signal” if a reference to phasing out coal and fossil fuels in a draft text published on Wednesday does not survive in the summit’s final statement . “It took the world a while to understand. I remember even some of our member-states only a couple of years ago saying coal is forever. And now every member state of European Union knows that there is no future in coal. “I think the sense of urgency has increased and the understanding that fossil fuels are part of the problem has increased. But if you remove it from the text, what is the message you’re sending then? Because the only way humanity can learn to live within planetary boundaries is if we rid ourselves of the dependency on fossil fuels that are making our survival impossible,” he said. The EU has faced charges of hypocrisy over its investment in dozens of gas infrastructure projects at the same time that it is calling in Glasgow for an end to fossil fuels. But Mr Timmermans said the EU had nothing to be ashamed of and asserted that its investment in gas infrastructure helped to prepare for a future beyond fossil fuels. “Exiting out of coal for a number of our member-states will have to happen through an intermediary phase of using natural gas to lead these countries to using fossil-free energy. That is reality. “Now, what we need to do with our investments is to make sure that the investments in the infrastructure that will be needed for natural gas are pre-fitted to also be able to carry decarbonated or green gases so that the density of different gases can be transported through this infrastructure,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"holohan asks for stronger public health messaging in run up to christmas","story":"A letter from chief medical officer Tony Holohan was due to be sent to the Government on Thursday night asking that public-health messaging be strengthened in the lead-up to Christmas. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsThe State’s public-health team has advised Government that people should work from home wherever possible amid surging Covid-19 case numbers.A letter from chief medical officer Tony Holohan was due to be sent to the Government on Thursday night asking that public-health messaging be strengthened in the lead-up to Christmas.The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) met on Thursday afternoon to discuss the Covid-19 situation.A source said that while they had recommended that people should be asked to work from home where possible, the letter did not contain any mandatory work-from-home orders and that businesses were “not being asked to shut up shop”.They said the team has focused on cutting social contacts and that asking people to work from home where possible would help with this aim.“The message is that if people don’t need to be in work then ideally they would not be.”Nphet has not recommended any additional restrictions whatsoever, the source said.It is expected the Cabinet will consider the latest Nphet recommendation at its meeting next Tuesday.The move to recommend an increased level of working from home came after Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said earlier that a work-from-home order was not something that the Government was considering. “In terms of regulation or Government policy, that is not something we are looking at,” he said, adding that the Government was also not considering extending the requirement of Covid certs to other areas such as gyms and hairdressers.Taoiseach Micheál Martin reiterated on Thursday that he did not anticipate a dramatic return to restrictions.A further 3,680 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed by Nphet on Thursday. As of 8am, 543 Covid-19 patients were hospitalised, of whom 97 were in intensive-care units.Youngest fatalityFigures released yesterday by the Health Surveillance Protection Centre show a 14-year-old has become the youngest person in the State to die as a result of Covid-19. The teenager was one of 25 people who died in the period between November 3rd and November 9th. They were one of six people under the age of 25 to have died in the State from Covid-19 in the pandemic to date. The previous youngest person to die from Covid-19 was 17. The oldest person to die was 105. The average age of those who died was 80 and the median age (the point at which an equal number of people are older and younger) was 82. A total of 5,566 deaths have been attributed to Covid-19 in the State since the beginning of the pandemic. Ninety-one per cent were over the age of 65 and 41.3 per cent were over the age of 85. Monaghan has the highest number of deaths per capita, with a mortality rate of 169.4 per 100,000 of the population, followed by Mayo (167), Louth (166), Cavan (157.5) and Kildare (154.2). Kerry has the lowest rate in the country at 56.2 per 100,000. There were 45,352 newly-confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the fortnight between October 27th and November 9th. Of those, 1,072 were in healthcare workers. There were 6,330 cases in children of primary-school age between five and 12 (14 per cent), with 2,727 in teenagers between 13 and 18, 4,868 in those between 19 and 24, 6,875 in those between 25 and 34 and 7,856 in those between 35 and 44.

Photograph: Brian Farrell A shortage of rental properties in Co Leitrim has meant that many young adults who fled from higher rents in cities during the Covid-19 lockdowns are still living with their parents a year on, local politicians say. Rents in the county have risen at one of the sharpest rates in the State, with the latest Daft.ie report indicating they are up 21.6 per cent since the third quarter of last year, to an average of €742. The lack of available accommodation is such, according to Cllr Enda Stenson, that if the former MBNA plant in Carrick-on-Shannon, currently on the market at €6.6 million, was to be bought by a major employer, it would struggle for staff who could find places to live. “If a big US company came in and wanted to create hundreds of jobs we just don’t have the accommodation,” he said, adding that many natives who returned to the county during the pandemic were having similar problems.“A lot came home and a lot are still working from home, but it is their mother and father’s home. I personally know 10 people in that situation who are living with their parents because they have no other option.”Estate agent Liam Farrell said the average rents cited in the Daft report seemed quite low given what he was seeing in places such as Carrick-on-Shannon. “We are quoting €1,490 for a five-bedroom house in Carrick at the moment in a very good location,” he said, adding that a similar property would have commanded €1,250 to €1,300 per month a year ago. He attributed the rent increases to Leitrim people returning to the county as they wanted to be nearer family during the pandemic and also to greater interest from abroad. “There is no question about it, Covid and the ability to work from home has had an impact on demand,” he said. “People reassessed their lives during the first lockdown and, as we have seen, people flee cities like London and Paris as well as Dublin.”He said people questioned why they should continue to cover “silly rents in Dublin” given remote working had become an option and they could pay €750 or €800 a month “for a waterside penthouse apartment in Leitrim”. Mr Farrell said his office was receiving a couple of inquiries from people based in Germany every week, which had not happened before in his two decades in the business.Tax breaksSligo-based estate agent John Murphy, who rents properties in Tubbercurry as well as in Sligo town, said while tax breaks in rural towns in the region meant there was plenty of availability 10 years ago, this was no longer the case. “People were buying second properties as an investment and renting them out in places like Tubbercurry because they weren’t paying tax on them, but that has all changed,” he said. Mr Murphy said a property he would have let for €350 a month three years ago in Tubbercurry now cost €600, with a lack of supply the key price driver.Sinéad Walsh, rental manager with Oates Breheny Group in Sligo, questioned how rents could have increased by, for example, 18.4 per cent for a two-bed house in the county given prices are meant to be capped in Sligo town and Strandhill, which are rent pressure zones (RPZs). She said villages outside the RPZs such as Ballisodare and Enniscrone were currently highly sought-after areas. Ronan Lyons, associate professor in economics at Trinity College Dublin and an author of the Daft.ie report, said RPZs in reality did not give much protection in such places, as people were probably not in a position to challenge landlords on prices given the lack of availability. He noted that rents had risen from a low base in counties such as Leitrim and Sligo and that while these “seemed very attractive “ to people used to city prices, the increases were considerable for people who have been living in the county throughout and “seen rents double over 10 years”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"cop26 pressure builds on eu to get climate deal over the line","story":"Environmental protesters demonstrate outside the offices of JP Morgan in Glasgow during the Cop26 summit. Photograph:  Andrew MilliganPA The Cop26 summit is facing into tortuous final hours as negotiators attempt to strengthen a declaration and add greater urgency in the global response to the climate crisis – with most pressure on the EU to get it across the line.With 197 countries locked in negotiations over a second version of a draft agreement, a flurry of small protests were staged inside the Cop26 venue, at its periphery and throughout the city. Activists deflated the tyres of about 60 4X4s in the city’s west end in protest at the cars’ high levels of emissions.Announcements made in Glasgow “on forests, methane, clean technology and more” were encouraging, Mr Guterres said. “But they are far from enough. The emissions gap remains a devastating threat. The finance and adaptation gap represents a glaring injustice for the developing world.” “Promises ring hollow when the fossil fuels industry still receives trillions as measured by the IMF,” he added, “Or when countries are still building coal plants. Governments need to pick up the pace and show the necessary ambition – we cannot settle for the lowest common denominator.” ‘Vulnerable countries’If the EU does not lead and build the high-ambition coalition needed, no one else will, the independent European climate think tank E3G said on Thursday night. “There is an immediate opportunity for the EU to leverage the political momentum from week one and the US-China statement to build the confidence that the trillions will be mobilised for developing and vulnerable countries for the net-zero and climate-resilient transformation we need.” Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Australia were reported to be resisting efforts to strengthen emission-reduction requirements, while vulnerable countries were seeking more robust commitments on adaptation, loss and damage and climate finance and going beyond the issue of delivering on $100 billion a year, to include “mobilising the trillions through the whole global financial architecture”, it added. European Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans said removing a text reference on phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies would be an extremely bad signal – a view strongly echoed by Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan. “If you remove it from the text, what is the message you are sending there? Because the only way humanity can learn to live within planetary boundaries is if we rid ourselves of dependency on fossil fuels that are making our survival impossible,” Mr Timmermans added.‘Close to abyss’He said the rulebook for implementing the Paris climate agreement could be completed at Cop26. Agreeing the rulebook, which sets out detailed guidance for how countries must implement goals agreed in Paris in 2015, would be one of the key outcomes of the summit. “It will allow us to start delivery of what was agreed six years ago in a way that is transparent for everyone and accountable for everyone,” he said.Mr Ryan, who is negotiating on behalf of the EU, said at a briefing the climate finance issue might be the last item to get across the line, with expectation that Cop26 will run into the weekend. He confirmed Mr Guterres attended an EU coordination meeting and underlined “when you are close to the abyss, your next step is important”.Irish climate activist and director of FaithInvest Lorna Gold believed the emotional intervention on Thursday by chair of the Elders Mary Robinson “really changed the tone”. “Leading now requires vulnerability cutting through the ‘blah’. Naming what’s at stake. This is under our watch. I think today governments see that now is the time to choose what side of history they want to be on,” she added."},{"url":null,"title":"dublin seeks to ease brexit tensions as talks resume in london","story":"The European Union’s negotiator Maros Sefcovic will be in London for talks with his UK counterpart  David Frost.

But the UK is insisting that the protocol needs a more fundamental redrafting including the removal of the European Court of Justice from its role as arbiter of EU law.“We think that the objectives set out by the UK are unattainable,” said a senior EU official. “The UK position is that the role of the EU’s institution needs to go... As long as that remains the UK position, I don’t see what we can do.” – Additional reporting:  How is Brexit affecting you?

The political and social convulsions of recent years have proved so fraying on the nerves that one is always on high alert for another drama cresting the horizon. Even the smallest shift in societal behaviour now demands closer inspection, in case it should prove to be a symptom – or worse, a portent – of something bigger.Why are there no high heels? Is it because we are all gender-neutral now? And what does it mean that I can’t get an Uber home? Is Brexit to blame, or the pandemic, or some deeper failing of the modern economy? Might it turn out to be a good thing – perhaps the black cab will stage a miraculous comeback, like the blue whale, once its predators disperse – or is this just a temporary hiatus before Silicon Valley unleashes upon us a new army of android taxis, currently gestating in pods?For most of my lifetime, nothing seemed to change much, even when it did. The forward momentum of Western capitalist democracy felt settled, and therefore almost invisible. Then came the digital revolution, and all the cultural and consumer revolutions that have spiralled out of it.And now nothing – not even the high heel, that impractical, agonising, perversely enduring invention of the 10th century – can be counted on to last.Ignoring the maxim that any headline which ends in a question mark can be answered with a confident no, the BBC News website ponders: “Would the world be better if it was run by teenagers?”Well, really. As if things weren’t dicey enough.I actually love teenagers – more than ever now that my house is often full of them. I find them extremely sympathetic, for all the same reasons they would be terrible at running the world.They forget or lose everything: homework, shoes, nuclear codes. They process information through their amygdala – aka the lizard brain – because their rational pre-frontal cortex is not yet fully formed, and this means they have patchily informed but thunderous opinions on everything. They care desperately about fitting in with their peers, which makes them acutely susceptible to groupthink. And they can never, ever admit to being wrong.Be sensible, Auntie. We have quite enough leaders like that already.More from NewsAustria: Lockdown for \u0026#39dithering\u0026#39 unvaccinated is inevitable, says chancellorSix healthy children died of Covid in a year, but lockdowns fuel youth health timebombCorbynite MPs face deselection ahead of next election after rule changeThe Tories are taking back control of their party – and Boris JohnsonFrance accused of Brexit ‘spite’ as 1,000 migrants cross Channel in a dayPupils could face four sets of exams under back-up plans if GCSEs are cancelledMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"liberals now new authoritarians","story":"Amsterdam. The most liberal city in the world. Tourists flow down its bicycle lanes and canals looking for a taste of the cannabis and sexual freedom that mark the Netherlands’ permissive approach to government. The Dutch brand of liberalism is not limited to social issues – a love of free markets goes back centuries, to their days as a world power in trade and finance.So at first glance it might seem surprising that the first call for lockdown of the post-vaccine age (at least in Western Europe) should come out of the Netherlands. The country’s official “Outbreak Management Team” has recommended the reimposition of restrictions to combat a dramatic rise in case rates. The next set of measures could include cancelling events, closing theatres and cinemas and reintroducing curfews, on top of the mask mandate and “green pass” certification system they have already introduced.Welcome to the new liberal paradise, friends: enjoy your marijuana cookie, but masked, socially distanced, not after 8pm, and not without your state-approved paperwork.It’s one of the paradoxes of the Covid era that political scientists will no doubt be arguing about for decades: why have the most nominally liberal governments consistently reached for the most illiberal interventions?Look closer, and perhaps it shouldn’t surprise us. The Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte took office in the same year as David Cameron, on a similar political platform that combined social and market liberalism. In this they were both heirs to Blair. (Unlike Cameron, Rutte is still in power, but it’s no accident that the last remaining true Cameroon Tories such as Matt Hancock and Jeremy Hunt have been among the most enamoured with lockdowns).This type of politician has always tended towards technocracy. If you believe that the “big values” questions over how society and the economy should be run have all been answered, what’s left is a narrow competition over who can better manage the execution. Measurement, efficiency and “smart” political techniques become the central project politics becomes a science.In this mindset Covid is just another neat policy problem: a single end goal (to minimise cases, hospitalisations and deaths) which can be tracked and forecast in thousands upon thousands of charts and complex models, all backed by the easy virtue of saving lives. Just another case study at Harvard Business School or Sciences-Po.Ideals that don’t show up on these charts – quality of life, for example, or the sacred importance of children playing unencumbered with their friends – become easy to dismiss as pie-in-the-sky, or even dangerous. The status of freedom itself gets diminished. Self-described liberals end up with something approaching scorn for a value that they increasingly see as the kooky obsession of backbench Tory MPs and cranks.That is why the coming winter matters so much. As the first following the vaccine rollout, what happens next will create a precedent for years to come. Having successfully offered the vaccine to everyone who wants it, and even followed up with booster shots, most Western governments have now done everything they can short of long-term curtailments to the freedom of their societies.Many European countries have already crossed the Rubicon – Italy’s draconian vaccine passports are seeing workers banned from offices and students from universities, and the massive street protests each weekend showcase their bitterly isive effect. The UK (or England, to be precise, as both Scotland and Wales are already going further) now stands almost alone, alongside the Scandinavian countries, in resisting this step change to the way we live.That we are in this position has more to do with luck than heroism. The UK’s latest case wave started before most of Europe, because we vaccinated earlier and so encountered the drop-off in immunity earlier. And the chance replacement of Hancock with Sajid Javid seems to have shifted the attitude inside Government just in time.For now, there are reasons to be hopeful: cases in England are trending down, even as cases across Europe are shooting up. If we can show that living with Covid can be done without destroying our free society, we will have done the world a profound service and might even reacquaint lost liberals with the value of liberty.More from NewsSix healthy children died of Covid in a year, but lockdowns fuel youth health timebombCorbynite MPs face deselection ahead of next election after rule changeThe Tories are taking back control of their party – and Boris JohnsonFrance accused of Brexit ‘spite’ as 1,000 migrants cross Channel in a dayPupils could face four sets of exams under back-up plans if GCSEs are cancelledChina could thwart Cop26 deal by blocking key pledge to cut emissionsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"oxford university should hand back dirty mosley money says black","story":"Oxford University should hand back “dirty” Mosley money, a Black Lives Matter group has said as they become the latest group to heap pressure on the university amid a row over “fascist” cash.No university should take money from “violent racists”, according to the BLM UK group which has written to Oxford’s vice-Chancellor and the Master of St Peter’s College to protest the donation.It is the latest organisation to raise concerns over the Mosley family donations and comes after a coalition of charities wrote to the university’s leaders earlier this week.“We have written in detail and directly in protest laying out what we rightfully and morally expect Oxford and St Peter’s to do,” a spokesman for BLM UK said.“We wrote… to tell them both in essence that the Mosley money should be returned. No university should touch money belonging to fascists and racists, especially violent racists.”The group is now encouraging its supporters to follow its lead and write to Oxford to demand that the “tainted and dirty” money is returned.The  revealed last week that Oxford University was given £6 million from a charitable trust set up by Max Mosley to house the fortune he inherited from his father, Sir Oswald Mosley, leader of the British Union of Fascists.Two of Oxford’s colleges – St Peter’s and Lady Margaret Hall – have also accepted cash from the Mosley family trust totalling more than £6.3 million.In a statement, BLM UK said: “Max Mosley was a racist and fascist. His father, titled Sir Oswald Mosley, was the leader of the British Union of Fascists in the 1930s. Max Mosley published racist and abusive election literature about the Windrush generation.“In total, Max Mosley made donations of £12 million to the University of Oxford and to St Peter’s in the years before his death in May 2021. His violent and racist past was public knowledge from 2018, but the university continued to take race hate money from him, nonetheless.”The donations have been made from the Alexander Mosley Charitable Trust, which Max Mosley set up in the name of his son, an alumnus of St Peter’s College, who died of a heroin overdose in 2009.The £6 million donation to Oxford University will be used to set up the Alexander Mosley Professor of Biophysics Fund, while the £5 million donation to St Peter’s College will be used to build a new block of student accommodation.A coalition of Jewish charities has also condemned Oxford’s “extraordinary” decision to accept “fascist cash” and urged the university to drop the Mosley name from a professorship.In a letter to Oxford’s vice-chancellor and the master of St Peter’s College, the charities said they are “at a loss” to understand how a Jewish student would feel comfortable being taught by a professor bearing the Mosley family name.The letter was signed by several leading Jewish charities including the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism, the Jewish Leadership Council and the Holocaust Education Trust.Earlier this week, the Education Secretary said that Oxford should explain to Jewish students why it took money from the Mosley family.Nadhim Zahawi said the university’s leadership must attempt to repair its relationship with Jewish students by “making sure they consult and explain the decision-making process” to them.Oxford University, St Peter’s College and Lady Margaret Hall all said that the funds they received from the Mosley trust were cleared by an independent committee, which reviewed donations in a “robust” manner, taking “legal, ethical and reputational issues into consideration”.More from NewsAustria: Lockdown for \u0026#39dithering\u0026#39 unvaccinated is inevitable, says chancellorSix healthy children died of Covid in a year, but lockdowns fuel youth health timebombCorbynite MPs face deselection ahead of next election after rule changeThe Tories are taking back control of their party – and Boris JohnsonFrance accused of Brexit ‘spite’ as 1,000 migrants cross Channel in a dayPupils could face four sets of exams under back-up plans if GCSEs are cancelledMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"president xi has wobbly biden wrapped around little finger","story":"Is the Cold War 2.0 between China and the United States already thawing?John Kerry’s side-deal with China on emissions at the COP26 conference and reports that a virtual summit between the US and Chinese Presidents will be held soon suggest that Washington and Beijing may be warming to each other.Most strikingly, the US Trade Representative, Katherine Tai, has hinted that China has made unnamed concessions to unwind the trade war started under Donald Trump. The spin from Washington is that China’s economy is under pressure after Covid lockdowns and US-led “de-coupling” of supply chains from Chinese producers.In this upbeat version of current developments, President Xi has seen the wisdom of the Biden Administration’s policies from climate change to America’s current account deficit.   Since the Chinese Communist Party leader has just had his Central Committee more or less confirm him as leader-for-life, President Xi can be forgiven for thinking it is the increasingly wobbly looking Joe Biden who desperately needs a foreign policy success.Yesterday, Xi told a virtual conference of Asian Pacific leaders that their countries should not tilt towards alliances with an unnamed outside power. Even President Biden’s national security team can probably work out who was meant by that.  So economists may be right that Donald Trump’s tariffs on Chinese imports have had the effect of pushing up prices for American consumers. But pure free traders miss the power political point that Trump understood – and he probably has a better grasp of balance sheets than Joe Biden. Free trade with an un-free rival state does not make for harmony in international relations.  Since Richard Cobden urged Britain to adopt free trade as the high road to world peace in the 1830s via Norman Angell’s insistence that mutual trade made war “the great illusion” before 1914 and on to the “golden era” of Anglo-Chinese relations proclaimed by David Cameron’s government a decade ago, the mirage that free trade is always cost-free for our security and political principles never fades away. Unlike the USSR in the first Cold War who had only raw materials to export, China has become a major supplier of manufactured goods and e-commerce facilitating hardware.  The Biden Administration says American CEOs have “assured” it that there will be no shortages but that’s the kind of “re-assurance” which sets alarm bells ringing. Far from having China on the ropes, Biden is anxious to get a deal – almost any deal – to free up trade to keep American consumers happy before next year’s mid-terms. China’s leaders calculate that their system can absorb more economic shock than the American one. They can therefore drive a harder bargain.For President Xi  all these economic issues are questions of power. Politics not economics are his key concern. China’s economic heft is a source of political influence on a global scale. So long as Joe Biden, John Kerry and co. seek a “win-win” whether on climate policy or trade, they are not playing the same high stakes game as Xi Jinping. China is playing to win – as America used to – but the Biden Administration’s strategy is to achieve “feel good” outcomes. Everyone cannot be a winner in the competitive global rivalry which Beijing is engaged in.It is possible and of course desirable to avoid a conflict in which we would all be losers. But thinking the post-Mao generation ruling China today who have discovered the benefits of capitalist profits will suddenly also decide to sacrifice the pleasures of unbridled power is naïve. Trading with a Cold War enemy may well be necessary but it is time to shed the illusion that commerce can transform communists.A century ago, Prime Minister,  Lloyd George, argued trading with Soviet Russia would lead Lenin to drop communism. Lenin told his trade negotiators that you shake hands with the capitalist to get your hand closer to his throat. President Xi wants our money not our values. Provided America doesn’t sell out its principles it can profit from trade with China. More from NewsSix healthy children died of Covid in a year, but lockdowns fuel youth health timebombCorbynite MPs face deselection ahead of next election after rule changeThe Tories are taking back control of their party – and Boris JohnsonFrance accused of Brexit ‘spite’ as 1,000 migrants cross Channel in a dayPupils could face four sets of exams under back-up plans if GCSEs are cancelledChina could thwart Cop26 deal by blocking key pledge to cut emissionsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"fresh sleaze claims tories take","story":"Exclusive: Fresh sleaze claims as Tories take .million from oil and gas donors under Boris JohnsonBoris Johnson has been blasted for climate change hypocrisy over Tory party funding as Electoral Commission records shows donations stretching back to  linking the Conservatices with oil and gas magnatesUnder strain Boris Johnson faces a crisis over sleaze Image: REUTERSByRachel WearmouthSenior Political Correspondent:,  Nov | comments The Tories face fresh sleaze allegations after it emerged MPs and the party have taken almost £.million in donations from the energy industry under Boris Johnson.The Prime Minister has been warned his climate crisis credentials lie in tatters as his party has been “swimming in oil and gas money” since he took power.

From Simply Blue Management of Newquay, he picks up another £, per month plus VAT as an adviser, and is expected to put in - hours a month.

Yet his government baulks at a £ an hour National Minimum Wage, and tells workers on Universal Credit “work two more hours” to recoup their £ benefit cut. Of course, all this lovely moolah on top of his £, a year parliamentary salaryis approved by the authorities. It is perfectly legal and above board.

Labour MP for Walthamstow, Stella Creasy, attempted to board a London bus with her baby on Tuesday, but was refused boarding by the driver. Ms Creasy posted a photo on Twitter showing the inside of the bus she was attempting to board.While two pushchairs can be seen in the space allocated to pushchairs and wheelchairs on the bus, the rest of the bus appears half empty, with plenty of space for another pushchair.Based on the photo MP Creasy posted, MyLondon was able to geolocate where the alleged incident took place in Chingford Mount, north east London. Tagging London’s Deputy Mayor of London for Transport, Heidi Alexander, as well as London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Ms Creasy said: “Well that wasn’t fun. “Just been kicked off an empty bus by a bus driver because there were two pushchairs already on it. “Surely when the bus is this empty andlarge amount of space as you can see it can’t be TfL policy to do this !” Her tweet triggered a wave of supportive comments from mothers who have also encountered the same problem. “I had the same problem  years ago.

Passengers with babies kids in pushchairs should be prioritised alongside iniduals in wheelchairs and buses should be remodelled to be able to take more of these passengers”. One user also commented saying London Mayor Sadiq Khan “might remind drivers that it is illegal to stop or refuse to allow the transit or transport” of an MP who might be on route to Parliament.

The website says: “If youaposre using a double buggy, feel free to get on the bus at the back exit doors, but remember to check with the driver first. “For safety reasons and general passenger comfort, move your buggy out of the middle aisle. “All buses have a wheelchair space available. By law, wheelchair users have priority over the space as it is the only place they can travel safely. When a wheelchair user is not using the space, you can use it on a first come first served basis. “If a wheelchair user wishes to board a bus, you should share the space, fold your buggy or move. You will not be asked to leave the bus, but you may choose to do so. “If you wish to board the next bus instead, the driver will issue you a transfer ticket so you donapost need to pay a double fare”.

The Tory, already accused of using his Commons office to carry out a second job, even claimed £, for his new place while working overseas. But astonishingly he has broken no Commons rules. An ex-standards chief said MPs earning abroad while claiming from taxpayers is “totally wrong”. On top of his lucrative outside legal work, Sir Geoffrey Cox is also adding to his incredible wealth by letting out his ­plush London home. But the Tory MP came under fire after it was revealed he uses taxpayer cash to rent a second property in the capital – and even claimed £, for the two months he was reported to be working from a Caribbean tax haven.Have your say on this story in the comment section Astonishingly, it is within Commons rules, but it will fuel ­criticism he is out of touch with voters in his largely poor rural constituency. Sir Geoffrey was already facing criticism after being accused of using his parliamentary office for his £million-a-year second job advising the British Virgin Islands government on corruption. He today broke his silence to insist he “does not believe he breached the rules”.  The Torridge and West Devon MP, on £, in that role, rakes in around £, a week for the home he lets out in Battersea, South London. He bought it with his we as a second home for £,, claiming £, in ­mortgage interest payments in four years. After the expenses scandal, rules on claims were tightened and Sir Geoffrey continued to use the Battersea flat while in London but claimed only £, to £, a year for utility bills and service charges. But in , he moved into another property and started charging taxpayers £, a month for the place. The arrangement, while ­controversial, is within the rules. Former Standards Committee chairman Sir Alistair Graham accused him and other MPs with similar ­arrangements of “a kind of flipping”. He said: “If they have got a flat in London they should be happy enough to use that rather than go through this device to gain somewhere  and build up extra income.”  Sir Alistair also criticised Sir Geoffrey for claiming for rent while he was working in the Caribbean. He added: “If MPs are out of the country and in the case of Mr Cox earning vast sums of money then to be at the same time claiming money from the public purse to safeguard their flat is totally wrong.” Sir Geoffrey has been reported to watchdogs after footage appeared to show him using his Commons office while working for the BVI, which MPs are banned from.  Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said the move seemed to be “an egregious, brazen breach of the rules”. She has written to Standards Commissioner Kathryn Stone asking her for “guidance on beginning a formal investigation”.Sir Geoffrey, who insists he has done nothing wrong, today said he would co-operate with any probe. He visited the BVI in April and May and cast Commons votes remotely from there. He claimed he had the ­permission, which chief whip Mark Spencer confirmed.  The Mirror has learned the former Attorney General this week missed more Commons votes because he was in Mauritius. He did not break any Commons rules. Sources confirmed he was on a “short business trip”. He missed four Commons votes on Monday but was paired with an absent opposition MP meaning he would have had permission to be absent. Sir Geoffrey did not comment about that trip or his home. But he faced criticism in his ­constituency. He faced criticism in his constituency.  Former nurse Jenny Davies,  – who did not vote for him – said: “MPing should be a full-time job, ­especially in a poor rural farming area, not a part-time hobby.” Another added: “I do not believe ­Geoffrey Cox is able to concentrate fully on his role as an MP whilst carrying out other roles.”  Boris Johnson today refused to apologise for the sleaze scandal engulfing his government. He said: “The most important thing is those who break the rules must be investigated and should be punished.”Timeline: Sir Geoffrey buys Battersea flat with his we for £,.-: He is elected MP. He declares the apartment his second home and claims £, a month – just over £, a year – in mortgage interest costs under the old expenses system.: The MPs expenses scandal causes public outcry and a change in the rules.: His expenses claims for the apartment drop to below £, a year, covering just utility bills and service charges.: Sir Geoffrey declares that he is renting out his London property and starts claiming £, a month in rent on another property in the capital.His accomodation claims rise to £, a year.

The personal trainers from New York in the US say they often get funny looks when theyaposre out and about together, but they insist they couldnapost be happier.

She added sheaposs from a family of tall people, with most family members measuring over ft. When she first introduced her beau to her loved ones, they were surprised at his height. Once they got to know him, they could see past something so shallow, she said. The loved up pair say that the height dference between them is the least important factor in their happiness because they are attracted to each other and share the same values.  Strangers stare at us and friends have made remarks such as aposI couldnapost be with someone tallerapos but we just laugh it off, Darlene said. We donapost see our height dference as weird as we are just two people who are in love. She took aim at the stigma surrounding height dferences when it comes to dating, adding it can be dficult to find love as a taller woman. She said: I orced three years ago and began to believe I may never find someone again. Dating is already dficult. I had a hard time finding someone who wanted to date a woman as tall as me.  I discovered there is judgement from others who are trying to find a partner using dating apps. She described a market where there are so many iables to consider as people are looking for perfection.Are you and your partner opposites  Email jessica.taylor@reachplc with your stories!By setting height preferences they are passing on so many incredible people, she said. Darlene admits she was starting to lose hope of meeting a new partner and was preparing to let the idea go. But in February , when Darlene fell ill, her friend of eight years, Matthew, took care of her. Feelings developed between the pair, and theyaposre now happily engaged. She said: When we look at pictures of ourselves we see two people who are happy to be together but others may think we look funny. When I post pictures of us short men comment they are so happy to see it and they feel validated. The quality and value of someone have nothing to do with theof your body.

So, at the beginning of , she booked herself in. I spotted a beauty salon was running a training day, and required models with a trainer who had more than  years’ experience. At £, it seemed like a great opportunity at a price I could afford. I wanted to give myself a new yearaposs lt, Barbara, , said. But when she went to have the procedure, she claims something didnapost feel right.For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here My treatment was really painful, and it felt very rushed. I was keen to get it over with as it hurt so much. The final result felt very tight, but looked fine, she recalled. After the treatment, Barbara was sent on her way and told to take ibuprofenshe felt any discomfort. She was also told to wait six weeks to see the full results. The next day, Barbara claims she felt something snap in her face - but when she called the salon, she was told it was normal. She said: “My face felt extremely tight and painful and even chewing was dficult but I believed it would settle as they told me it would. A few days later, she felt a bump above her top lip.  When I touched it, it felt sharp and stung, like it was piercing my skin. I contacted the salon again, and was told to try and manipulate the thread back up, and to not mess with it, she said. I was so concerned I sent a video of myself doing exactly as instructed to the salon, to show them. The next day she became even more concerned when a blue thread pierced the skin by her top lip and she pulled it out. “The thread had a cog on and came out of my face! Fortunately, there was no major bleeding, but I was incredibly concerned that my face would become lopsided.” After calling the salon to complain, she claims she was told it was her own fault. Barbara added: At no point did the trainer contact me directly to check on me. She had washed her hands of the whole thing. Terried her face was damaged forever, Barbara found another thread piercing her skin, near her eye. When she tried to pull out the thread, the cog at the end got caught on her skin tissue, which caused it to pucker. By now, blood was streaming down her face as she tried to push it back in. In the end, she managed to remove the thread by slowly manoeuvring it outward. I was left with two further lumps. One by my chin and another by my nose. I feared both threads would poke through at any moment, she said. I took myself to AE who were supportive, but said they couldn’t touch it as it was cosmetic and they would not risk hurting me further. I was beside myself. The pain was so bad I contemplated buying a scalpel to cut the threads out of my face. After conducting her own research, Barbara found Save Face, a national register of medical practitioners accredited to provide non-surgical cosmetic treatments.She travelled to River Aesthetics clinic in Bournemouth, which is a training centre for Silhouette Soft threadlts - which are only available from medically qualied clinicians.After a consultation with the clinicians, Barbara was determined unsuitable for threadlting treatment in the first place due to an autoimmune condition. Dr Manning, from River Aesthetics, said: “A medical professional would have identied this immediately.  “We could clearly see the threads had been inserted superficially and had migrated signicantly since their placement. “The threads were unlike any we had seen before. We suspect they may not have even reached UK standards. “ Dr Manning added he worked with Barbara to remove as much of the thread as he could from her face - and added she was lucky not to have been disfigured by her experience. We strongly urge anyone considering aesthetic treatments to research the treatment provider and the treatment itself, he said. Three months later, when Barbaraaposs face had fully healed, she went back to the clinic for the new look sheaposd originally wanted.The clinicians used MaiLi filler to plump up her cheeks, add definition to her jawline and enhance her lips.Barbara said: “I would strongly urge anyone contemplating an aesthetic treatment, to thoroughly research everything and ask questions about the qualications of the treatment provider, the treatment modality, the products being used. Seethey are accredited by Save Face. “Don’t do what I did and be seduced by the price and the promise that someone is a ‘trainer’.Have you ever had a cosmetic procedure that didnapost go to plan  Send your stories to jessica.taylor@reachplc“Iaposm absolutely thrilled with the results now. I should have researched the suitability of dferent procedures and treatments and got a better understanding from the experts about the results that I could expect to achieve. “We now know that I wasn’t suitable for PDO threads so itaposs frustrating to think that I went through all of that pain and worry for nothing.” Comment MORE ON Cosmetic surgeryPlastic surgery\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The healthy baby was born swtly, but there was no one there to help the non-English speaking mother except for volunteers. Melanie Clark, an RAF veteran who works as a nurse, explained how she had been volunteering at the hotel in London when she was alerted that the mother had gone into labour. We went up to the room, I thought I would be maybe reassuring someone and making sure an ambulance was on its way, she said. Neither the woman nor her husband spoke much English, but a fellow volunteer with Ms Clark was able to translate. Questions and answers had to be relayed from the ambulance control room to Ms Clark and her colleague and then translated for the husband and we, and back again.What do you think of this  Let us know in the comments below At some point, Ms Clark said, it became clear that paramedics would not arrive in time and that she would be delivering the baby - for the first time in her le Ms Clark, who works at St Richardaposs Hospital in Chichester, West Sussex, told PA: I am a nurse but midwery didnapost come in our nurse training. Before the baby arrived, before its head came out, it was scary. It was scary and nerve-wracking about whether this was going to turn out OK. Without knowing the motheraposs medical history, Ms Clark was conscious that there could be issues she was not aware of. But the baby boy - the motheraposs sixth child - was born safely and swtly. But Ms Clark, who served in Iraq with the RAF, said the birth raises questions about the level of medical care available for refugees in the UK. She continued: They are registered with a GP but the level of support they have had and the knowledge of their pregnancies is very, very limited.  I just thought, I am sure it will happen again. She added that more needs to be done to help those evacuated from Afghanistan. She said: We canapost just stand by... just bringing them into this country is not enough because they are traumatised and they need some kind of future... they need to know whataposs happening next. I went to Iraq. I have seen the dficulties people face and the effects of war on people. Almost three months on from the airlt, the Home Office has said the Afghan Citizensapos Resettlement Schemeis not yet open and that more information will be provided in due course. Louise Calvey, head of services and safeguarding at the charity Refugee Action, said people brought to the UK during the Kabul airlt were living in limbo. She added: Weaposd like to offer our congratulations to the family. We hope they can build safe and happy lives in the UK. But itaposs appalling that three months after the evacuation of Kabul thousands of Afghan refugees are still living in limbo in hotels with no settled access to employment, healthcare or education. Rather than the warm welcome people were promised, theyaposre seeing the cold reality of our refugee protection system. Ministers must move quicker to get people out of hotels and integrated into our communities, where they can start to properly rebuild their lives.

Kingaposs College genetic epidemiology Professor Tim Spector warned Brits to be prepared for Covid to cause major problems for the next five years. The lead scientist on the Zoe Covid Study app says experts now have a better understanding of the virus than last year.Scientists in  were mainly concerned about getting to the end of the year, but can now take a view into the future. Prof Spector said: And thataposs clearly turning out not to be the case, as we realise that just vaccines alone, even in countries that have got higher vaccination rates than ours, are not the final solution to this.  But we need a combination of measures. We need to extend the vaccination programme to include three shots. We also need to realise there will be breakthrough infections that are real, we now know that vaccinated people can still transmit the virus, and that is going to be running through our populations to some degree. How high we want those rates to be is highly determined by our complacency and our relaxation of some of the rules that we had in place, that last year I thought weaposre actually over the top, and now this year, I think insufficient. Speaking at an online conference for the Royal Society of Medicineaposs Covid- series, .Prof Spector says the ending of restrictions in July gave Brits the impression the pandemic had a black and white answer.  Prof Spector said: We have to realise we just have to in some way controlinto something that doesnapost cause as much loss of le, doesnapost cause morbidities, and reduce that. And to do that is a combination of the vaccines, the medicines, etc. But also we have to keep some public health measures in place to keep those numbers down - weaposre not doing that. And thataposs why for the last three months, weaposve had the highest rates not only of cases but also hospitalisations in western Europe. And I think itaposs pretty unwise for a country that has such a perilous health system - even at this stage about % of hospital beds full of Covid - at a time when weaposve got massive other health needs.  So weaposre not doing enough, we are too complacent. The Government has a sort of a black and white approach and I think the public health messaging from the Government has been appalling. He said the British approach to testing needs to move towards using a combination of lateral flow and antibody tests to pinpoint members of the public at risk of breakthrough infections. His comments came as a new study revealed the amount of under s in England who died from Covid between March  and February .  The research, published in Nature Medicine, found , young people died in that time period out of Englandaposs ,, people under the age of . Sixty-one of those tested positive for Covid- before their death.Of the ,  were due to coronavirus -gtcoronavirus - with cause of death for  being Covid, and three due to paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with the virus.Almost allof those under  who tested positive for Covid survived. Those older than , those of BAME background and co-morbidities were over-represented in the virus-related deaths compared with other deaths in children and young people. Researchers say the results will be key to guiding decisions on shielding and child vaccinations. The main iant studied was Alpha, but newer iants should be evaluated in a similar way. Russell Viner, professor of adolescent health at UCL, an author of the paper, said: In terms of what this means for us now, we donapost have updated data in this form for the last six months, although we will in the future. Paediatricians across the country believe that these findings still broadly hold - that children are at extremely low risk of death from this virus, most deaths of children with a positive test are not related to Covid but reflect the commonality of infection in the population, and that the children at most risk are those who have always been at higher risk - those with serious other medical conditions.

The -year-old had just missed hopping aboard the last service from Beverley Bus Station to Dunswell in north east Yorkshire.She pleaded with the bus driver to let her on the vehicle so she could get home, but he refused, Hull Daily Mail reported. Fortunately a police officer witnessed the encounter and came over to see what was going on. The girlaposs dad, Gary Hockney, said: She was so upset. It happened on Sunday night and on Monday she didnapost go to college. She was frightened to go on the bus because she goes on a public bus and she was worried that she would bump into this driver.  She came back on Monday and she was in tears about it and explained that was why. The teenager tried to board the East Yorkshire Bus service at .pm on Sunday, November , after visiting her friends. She claims that as she reached the bus it began to pull away. The girl stood in front of the bus while it was still in the parking bay so she was visible to the driver. But, she claims he refused to let her on and instead continually beeped the horn, flashed his lights and revved the engine while she was in tears. Can you just open the door, I need to get home, she can be heard saying in a video.  A police officer believed to have been dealing with another incident at the station came over after witnessing the incident unfold and spoke with the bus driver, who said that he could not open the doors due to health and safety reasons. Speaking about the incident, Mr Hockney said: In her words, which isnapost wrong going by the footage, the bus was still in the parking bay and as she approached it, it began to pull away. She was directly in front of the doors and in full view of the driver. He looked at her, he saw her and carried on pulling out. She started crying at one point and heaposs revving his engine, flashing his lights, beeping his horn and then fortunately a police officer in the station at the time came over and asked what was going on.  If you look at the footage, she challenged the driver and he just referred to this blunt health and safety policy. Fortunately for the girl, the police officer gave her a lt back home. Mr Hockney said: I want to draw attention to his actions but also the officers, because itaposs such a positive thing that she did, I would have picked her up but it was such a nice gesture. Having thought about it might be that the bus company doesnapost allow that sort of discretion, which is stupid. They should give their employees the confidence to make those decisions. Iaposm sure he would have let his own daughter on in that situation orhe saw somebody being chased or something surely at some point thereaposs a cut off and you show some discretion. A spokesperson for East Yorkshire Buses said: On Sunday night one of our buses was in the process of leaving Beverley Bus Station at its scheduled departure time when a late arriving passenger ran out in front of it to try to stop it leaving. For safety reasons, our drivers are advised not to allow any more passengers to board once they have closed the doors and reversed off the bus station stands, as it is unsafe for passengers to try to enter the part of the station where buses are moving. The passenger refused to move from in front of the bus, so a police officer who was in the station dealing with some antisocial behaviour came to speak to the driver, and agreed to give the passenger a lt home so that the bus could continue on its way. Our driver was satisfied that the passenger was safe, and the bus was able to continue with its journey. We’d advise that passengers always ensure they arrive at their bus stop in good time, and we have live tracking features on our website and app which you can use to ensure you never miss a bus.” Comment MORE ON Teenagers\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Heres how to watch the comet stream from the UKTaurid Fireball Observations in  as the two brightest Taurids fly over PolandByHarry Thompson:,  Nov | comments The Taurid meteor shower will be visible over the UK on Friday in what is expected to be a bright and long-lasting display. The meteors pass through every October and late November.A comet called aposEnckeapos causes the dazzling display. The large nature of the comet stream means there are actually two dferent parts to the shower.l The South Taurids are visible in the southern hemisphere and take place between th September and th November. Whereas the North Taurids can be seen from the UK between October  and December . Both parts of the shower are of similar visibility, as they are simply two dferent parts of the same cloud. When is the Taurid meteor shower  The North Taurids will be visible in the UK on Friday November , with what the Royal Museums Greenwich say will be a long and slow moving shower, with less than five meteors per hour.For your best at seeing as much of the shower as possible, you will want to find the darkest spot possible and hope for a clear night with little cloud coverage. Try and get as far away from any light pollution as you can and,possible, locate a spot with an unobstructed horizon. How to see Meteor shower Speaking to Science Focus, University of Bathaposs head of astrophysics, Proffessor Carole Mundell, said: “They’ll appear to have come from the constellation of Taurus, which will rise high in the sky probably around midnight to .am.” However, these meteors will move slowly across the sky, and you should be able to see them between midnight and am. The Taurids arenapost the most dramatic of the meteor showers you can spot in the UK - only travelling through the sky at a snail-like  miles per second or , miles per hour. However, you wonapost need binoculars or a telescope to see them - just a comfy chair and lots of layers.  Because of their slower-moving nature, they also provide a great opportunity to learn more about the nightaposs sky. Why are they called the Taurids  The shower earned it name because when tracing the origin of the where it seems they come from as they move across the sky, it appears asthey come out of the constellation called Taurus. They are also often called the aposHalloween Fireballsapos, due to their annual visibility over the holiday. It is thought that both the Taurids and Encke come from a huge comet that has been breaking up over the last  to  thousand years.

Fish World which was originally called Meat Wize previously had a red and black sign but gave itself the new name aposFish Worldapos and a brand new blue paint job after it introduced fish to its shop.

He explained: We used to say aposHiapos and aposHow are youapos every day for the last three years, then one day they do this. I donapost speak to them because thereaposs no point trying to reason with a person who does that. One of our customers went in there once and asked why they did it, but they were just told it isnapost any of their business. In response, Fish Universe has adopted a new colour palette in an attempt to distinguish itself from its new competitor. Alongside the new palettes, a notice has been up on its door which reads: Fish Universe is not associated with Fish World and does not promote, endorse or support this shop.  In no event will we be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential or incidental damages or any damages whatsoever, arising out of the use of a Fish World service or product. We are highly qualied fishmongers, and we are passionate about fish and the environment. Fish Universe opened its doors in December  with the ambition of bringing the freshest and best quality fish to our customers in Tooting. We have stayed true to our core values, ensuring every single product we sell is the freshest, best quality available. Fish Universe is not liable for any loss arisen from either the use of a Fish World product or service. aposWe are also not responsible for the accuracy of any information advice given to you. The identical branding has even left the local council confused.  Rafa claims he was sent a fly-tipping fine after a number of items were left on the road outside an alleyway leading to both shops, however, the CCTV images sent to him by the council actually showed men he claimed were from Fish World. On the other hand, Manan, owner of Fish World and who requested his surname not be included, protested that his neighbour was simply jealous that he has the bigger fish empire. But when asked on the issue of collecting waste from the pavement, Manon declined to speak. Manan, who said he has been a fishmonger for  years, said: People are copying me, I’m not copying anyone.  Our shops are completely dferent. We added this new fish bit recently but we sell meat, they don’t sell meat. We sell other products they don’t sell. We sell African and Caribbean fish that they don’t. It’s a nonsense, they are jealous that’s all. Business is free here so for him to say that is a nonsense. Rafa, from Fish Universe, said he has been frustrated by a lack of support from Wandsworth Borough Council. He said: When I need to pay my business rate, they get in contact. When they they want to ly accuse me of fly tipping, they get in contact. But when I ask the council to help me with someone stealing our brand, they don’t want to help. As someone who pays a lot of money in business rates, thataposs very frustrating. When contacted by MyLondon, Wandsworth Council said the council cannot resolve a civil dispute between neighbouring shops. A spokesperson said: The aggrieved shopkeeper needs to seek his own legal advice on this matter.

Yesterday the Government confirmed it will be mandatory for frontline NHS workers to have the Covid vaccine.With the exception of those with a medical reason not to, everyone must have had two jabs, most likely by April. Reluctantly I think it is the right call. No one should be made to do anything they don’t want to do. Butpeople don’t want the vaccination then they shouldn’t be in jobs that involve looking after some of the sickest and most vulnerable people in our society. Mandatory jabs are nothing new. Healthcare staff doing certain procedures need to have had the hepatitis B vaccine.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section Some argue that’s dferent as people who went into the profession knew they had to have the jab beforehand, so were able to make their own choices, while this is something retrospective. But we are where we are. It’s nothing short of a miracle that we have vaccines to protect us from a virus that has already claimed the lives of , people in Britain alone. I believe in the Covid vaccines. I’m double jabbed. I certainly wouldn’t ask someone to do something I wouldn’t be prepared to do myself.  But I also have an  year old grandmother with a lung condition – she needs a machine at night to help with her breathing. Would I be happy for an unvaccinated health worker to look after her  From a totally selfish point of view I wouldn’t. I want the safest pairs of hands possible giving her care. The NHS, scientists and our political leaders need to do a much better job of explaining that the vaccines are safe and have been tested on people across the world. I feel desperately sorry for anyone who feels they will have to leave the profession over this – there are already , unfilled positions in the NHS in England. They certainly shouldn’t be hounded out of the profession. Maybe they can be found jobs where they don’t come into contact with vulnerable people. I hope before April’s deadline more workers are convinced about the efficacy of the vaccines and roll up their sleeves to have the jab. It would be a shame to lose dedicated workers when we need them more than ever.

PC Andrew Wienand, or “PC Pants” as his colleagues now call him, dashed out of his home when he saw what was happening and even had a pickaxe thrown at his head, narrowly missing him. He was woken up in the middle of the night by loud banging coming from outside his bedroom window in Barnes. The officer, who had got home from work late the night before, awoke at .am on the morning of May , , to the commotion. His girlfriend looked outside the window to find four masked men taking it in turns to smash a pickaxe into the bulletproof window of the jewellery shop below his flat. After she told PC Wienand to do something to stop it, he leapt up without getting dressed and went outside to intervene. PC Weinand, who had moved to London from South Africa a few years ago, said: “I woke up super groggy and not knowing what was happening, and then I looked outside and the men looked up at me right in the eye. “They were fully clothed in black with balaclavas, helmets, and gloves and they had a pickaxe. “The building was shaking as the bulletproof glass was resisting and the panic started building in me when I realised that our door was the one next to the jewellers and they might have thought this was another way in. “I got scared, and when I get scared, I get angry and fight or flight kicked in.  “I thought ‘screw it’, and ran down the stairs in my boxer shorts before yelling at them in Afrikaans - my second language. “I thought it might frighten them - along with my bare chest, pasty white body, and lots of hair. “One of the guys picked up the pickaxe and I thought they were going to come and hit me in the head with it so I thought my only chance was to run at them. “So I did, screaming, and yelling to my missus to call the police. “The guy pegged the pickaxe at my head and I jumped left - and thankfully I did because it missed me very narrowly and I would have been deadit had hit.” The -year-old managed to disarm the robber and he picked up the pickaxe before chasing the masked men off with it. When recalling the incident, he explained that there were five men in total - one in a car with the boot open, two on mopeds, and the other two who were trying to smash the glass. PC Wienand said: “When I chased them they jumped and split off to go into dferent directions. “I was actually running barefoot over all the bulletproof glass that they’d shattered but I didn’t feel the pain at the time because my adrenaline was pumping. “It wasn’t the smartest thing to do and I was very new in the police at the time. “But, I’d do it again because when you are scared you go to base instincts and I’m a fighter. “A lot of people did nothing and just watched and my colleagues said they wouldn’t have done anything - but again, I’d definitely still do it again.”  PC Weinand then warned: “If a predator smells fear then you become the prey.” Shortly after, police officers arrived at the scene and PC Wienand, who usually works in the Hammersmith area, gave them the “pull over” signal, which he learned not long before during his police training. He told the officers what had happened as other police cars went screeching after the mopeds. According to PC Weinand, the suspect got away and was “unfortunately” never caught. PC Wienand added: “Ideally next time this happens I’d like to be in unorm with a baton and a little bit of pepper spray. “I don’t live at the address anymore so I’m not actually worried though. “I’m not sureit’s heroic, probably stupid more than anything - and my colleagues give me so much hassle it’s not even funny. “It’s all good-natured banter.” After the incident took place, PC Wienand was nominated for the  Police Bravery Award and although he didn’t win, his granny was proud of his heroism. He said: “I was overjoyed to be nominated andanything it was my granny who was happiest. “She’s  and she would go down to her local coffee shop and tell everyone that it was her grandson that stopped the masked men on Barnes High Street. “I did always want her to be proud of me and that’s happened.” His granny wasn’t the only one who was proud of his actions and the rumour about what had happened soon spread high up the chain of command. PC Weinand said: “At the awards, the Met Police deputy commissioner who is really high up said to me, ‘are you Pants Man ’ “I was like oh my gosh this person is so many ranks above me and he’s calling me Pants Man. “My colleagues use that name, PC Pants or Captain Underpants - and a few of them do call me a hero. “It’s all part of why I became a police officer though - to help people.” Although he was new to the job, PC Weinand explained that he had been subjected to similarly scary situations. He said: “And, that isn’t even the half of it, I’ve had someone try to rob me on my way to work who then chased me to the police station and a guy try to stab me and set me on fire.” In light of the armed robbery, a spokesperson for the politan Police said: “ A -year-old officer was off-duty when he was awoken by a disturbance near his home in Barnes High Street, SW, at about :hrs on Friday,  May. “He realised a jeweller’s shop window had been smashed and that suspects were attempting to break in. “Acting instantly, he ran out into the street in just his boxers - he challenged them and a pick axe was thrown at him. “It narrowly missed him and he picked it up and ran at the suspects to stop them further breaking into the shop. “The suspects managed to escape on mopeds but left behind a number of weapons including a pick-axe, sledgehammer, and a chisel. “The shop window was damaged but the suspects did not manage to break in and steal any property. “The officer cut his foot on broken glass but was not otherwise injured.” Commander Sally Benatar from the South West Borough Command Unit said: “The bravery of this officer undoubtedly stopped the suspects from stealing anything from the premises. “He is a brand new officer, merely days into his role as a PC and he should be very proud of his actions. “I have spoken to him today to thank him for his outstanding efforts. “This morning’s events go to show that police officers are never off-duty and will always go above and beyond to help their community.” Comment MORE ON politan Policepolitan Police ServiceCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The suspect was caught on camera passing the Hendersons’ front garden with a drink can in his hand. Seconds later the plastic turf was rolled up and taken away. Daughter Courtney, , said: “My mum opened the curtains and was like: ‘Where’s the grass gone ’ “She was really confused at first and rang my dad askinghe knew why someone had taken the grass.” She added: “It’s really bizarre because it’s like the smallest piece of grass ever.” A neighbour’s CCTV captured the moment the turf was lted at pm on Sunday as the family sat in their lounge in Heywood, Gtr Manchester, last Sunday. Courtney said: “It was at around pm, like an hour after my dad got in. I was literally on the couch at the time. “I don’t think it could be someone trying to sell it for money because it’s the tiniest thing ever, it must only be worth around £ at the most.”  The beauty business owner said the thief had a distinct walk and was wearing a bucket hat. She added: “I just don’t get how no one has seen a man walking down the street with a roll of grass. “He’s got a distinct walk and he’s wearing a bucket hat. Surely someone knows this guy as there can’t be that many people walking around Heywood with a can and a bucket hat.” Comment MORE ON CCTVCCTV footageCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The lelong condition, cerebral palsy, which affects his movement on the right-hand side of his body and weakens his muscles, affected Sam as a child. His parents were even informed he may never walk unaided again. Despite the heartbreaking news, Sam channelled his inner strength to prove the doctors wrong. He decided around  years ago he would make the biggest change to his le. Sam, who lives in Huddersfield, said: Itaposs quite remarkable because it was always a constant battle to get me to do the exercises to help with my rehabilitation when I was younger. Itaposs only as Iaposve grown older that Iaposve realised how important keeping strong actually is. I told my mum and dad that Iaposd like to start going to the gym around the age of  and they were questioning it because I wasnapost doing my stretches for the rehabilitation.The Mirror is committed to more hopeful news. We recognise the news agenda can sometimes feel overwhelmingly negative.And while itaposs our job to keep you informed and hold those in power to account, we are making a commitment to also report more hopeful news. We will celebrate the people, places and movements that are bringing good into the world and, more than that, we will dig beneath the surface of important issues with the aim of finding hope.We will be firm in our convictions - but always fair-minded. By sharing solutions to problems, we can do more good and feel better about the world around us. Because we believe you deserve it. #mirrormorehopefulFollow on Twitter @mirrormorehope And follow Mirror More Hopeful on Facebook But I fell in love with fitness ever since I signed up to the gym that day. Now  years later, Sam has grown the physique comparable to an Olympic champion. But he would be rocked with bad news when his former physios would inform that gym would make his joints worse. He said: Going to the gym would make my joints worse as this is what usually happens when you have a condition like mine as it tightens the muscles further. But I learnt to develop a set of techniques to help avoid the situation. I struggle with joint weakness which is a big part of cerebral palsy. When I was younger, the doctors predicted that Iaposd never be able to walk.  When I was at school I had people assisting me but I wanted to strive to do things that my body told me I couldnapost. I later saw the physio and she said sheaposd never judge a book by its cover again. And Sam is determined to prove to all that having a disability does not and should not dampen your dreams. He said: I just want to show people that you can do lots of things despite having a disability. The main hobby I have is going to the gym and lting weights to improve my own situation by becoming stronger as a result of that. I take that in my everyday le to strive to be better and show anyone that anything is possible. Sam has now added skying to his list of achievements after doing so to raise funds for the Childrenaposs outpatients department at Diana Princess of Wales Hospital - raising a total of £.  He said: I put all my fears behind me because I knew that my efforts would raise money for a good cause and to make a signicant impact to people on the outpatientsapos ward. I had to go through something similar when I was younger and the outpatients unit helped me out massively. I really did struggle and to give back to them was incredible. Iaposve worked with vulnerable adults, some with cerebral palsy, and I used to work as a rehabilitation assistant before so I understand more than most the challenges people face. I have seen how people try to do great things to better themselves and Iaposve seen people who have overcome challenges they face every single day.

Alireza Herefedoust, , met his -year-old victim online while she was studying at university and then started training her to be a powerlter. The couple moved in together shortly after and the woman even acted as a guarantor for Herefedoust so he could buy a new car, Manchester Crown Court heard.However, by Christmas, their relationship started to get worse after Herefedoust accessed the womanaposs laptop and found some old messages she had sent to another man before moving in together, the Manchester Evening News reports.Michael Lavery, prosecuting, said Herefedoust accused the woman of being a liar and a cheat, so she packed up and was going to leave him, but he persuaded her to stay and things seemed to settle down.  Mr Lavery added that the following February, a woman contacted the victim through social media and told her she wanted to meet up. Herefedoust was angry when he found out his girlfriend had been contacted and made threats against the other woman. Mr Lavery explained: Concerned that he might actually carry out those threats, the victim contacted that other woman to warn her and again packed her bags to leave. But again, he persuaded her to stay, this time saying that he would kill himselfshe left. She tried to leave him a number of times after that but each time he would stand in the doorway and physically prevent her from leaving. During this period the victim was contacted by an ex-partner of the defendant who told her he had previously been convicted of breaching a restraining order which she had taken out against him. At learning of this, the defendant became angry, punching doors and kicking things. He said to her aposI havenapost killed my ex but Iaposll finish my job with youapos. An argument followed during which he threw her down onto the bed, tried to hold her down and took her phone from her.  She sustained some scratches as a result of the assault, the court heard. The prosecutor added: Following this, she managed to leave the flat but the defendant followed her and convinced her to come back. When she did, though, he became angry again and again assaulted her by throwing her around. The victim then went to stay with a friend but Herefedoust turned up at the address and sent constant messages and videos and made repeated calls to her. He even demanded he accompany her to a doctoraposs appointment, the court was told. In May , in a bid to make up, Herefedoust took the victim away for a spa weekend at a hotel but during the trip he became aggressive and prevented her from leaving their room by standing in the doorway. She agreed to move back with him but as she was about toto university for the summer term, Herefedoust again accused her of cheating on him, snatched her phone from her and pushed her onto a bed saying: Get in your corner. It won’t end well for youI don’t get into this phone. Youaposre my property.aposapos When she tried to leave, he said: aposaposYou really think I’m just going to let you leave, you won’t be able to get out of here, you’ll be in a wheelchair. He then argued with her about the car she helped him buy and demanded that she gave him money throwing a punch at her and then kicking her to her upper right arm.  Mr Lavery added: He told her she had no choice as to where she could sit and he grabbed her arm and pushed her into the bedroom so hard that she fell over. She was so scared of what he would do that she curled up in the corner of the room and was shaking with fear. The next day he lost his temper with her again and said that he would not let her go anywhere and preventing her from going to view a flat which she had arranged to see. On June , when the defendant had taken some sleeping tablets and was asleep, the victim saw an opportunity to leave so started to pack up her belongings. But whilst she was packing up her car, the defendant woke up and when she came back in he shut the door preventing her from leaving. He said that he wouldn’t let her leave. He then attacked her, ripping the bottom of her dress and demanding her credit card. When she refused he grabbed her phone and snapped it. He then held a sharp part of the broken phone to her neck and threatened to kill her, saying, aposYour mother is not going to have a daughter by the end of todayapos. Fearing that his threats were genuine she sat down quietly. During this episode, he also broke her sunglasses. She was caused bruising and scratches during the struggle between the two. At a certain point, he left the flat to go to the car and she saw her opportunity and went down to the reception area and managed to call the police. Herefedoust was arrested soon afterwards but denied allegations of abusive behaviour saying their relationship had its ups and downs.  Herefedoust admitted coercive behaviour and was freed with a ten month jail term suspended for two years. In a withering assessment, Judge Goddard QC labelled him a very weak man. She said: You have been involved in weight training and weight lting but you are a very weak man. You do not see yourself in the same light particularly against the victims of your violent, bullying and controlling behaviour. I think you have a long way to go before you behave like a proper decent man. You exploited your strength with the victim and the fact she was someone who you were training added another layer of power. I hope you desist from forming any other relationships with females you are training. I am not sureit is a good for you to be training females - in fact it probably isn’t. Herefedoust, of Carlton Road, Whalley Range, was also ordered to complete  sessions of the Building Better Relationships programme and  hours of unpaid work. He was banned from contacting the victim for five years under the terms of a restraining order. His counsel Maria Brannan said in mitigation: aposaposHe is sorry for the hurt he has caused to the complainant and for having let him himself down in this way. The defendant was a full-time competitive weight lting coach and was her trainer. This took a toxic turn and this spiralled downwards very quickly. He is now a successful weight lting coach and has trained past champions. He has spent two years re-establishing his business and he has now been in a new relationship with a woman who works as an NHS dietician. She has been supportive throughout these proceedings and it is a much more equal relationship.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Court caseCrown courtCrimeBullying\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Volunteers for the British Divers Marine Le Rescuesoon arrived at the scene and found the whale half-submerged in the water. As they accessed the best way to get it back out to sea, the massive whale managed to free itself but was almost stranded a second time on nearby rocks. After wildly thrashing around, it made its own way out into deeper water and was monitored swimming strongly in an easterly direction.  But its body was found further along the coastline, the BDMLR said in an update on Thursday. The update read: “The Sei whale has sadly been found dead after restranding on a beach a little further up the coast. “Unfortunately the survival rate of large whales who have already stranded is quite low as there is usually a reason for why they have beached themselves. “Scottish Marine Animal Strandings Schemewill be attending to perform a necropsy on the animal and they will share their results with us to seethere was any underlying cause. “A sad ending to what was a hopeful rescue.”  In an earlier post, they described how the team had been drafted in to try to help the stricken whale. They wrote: “Yesterday, Wednesday th November , we received a callout to a stranding of a whale in North Queensferry, Scotland. “A team of our trained Marine Mammal Medics were dispatched to attend to the animal. It appeared the animal was stuck in chest-deep water and was unable to free itself. “On arrival, all our team could see was a long back and a tall dorsal fin with the odd breath from its blowhole. “From the large dorsal, plus the fact it measured .m in , it was determined to be a Sei whale. “The fact that the whale was upright in the water certainly increased its probability of survival, but the fact that it was submerged made it much more dficult to assess. “However, it appeared to be in a moderate condition and was moving excessively in an attempt free itself from the sand. “It managed to turn itself to face out of the bay, and just as our medics were exiting the water to make consolidated rescue plans, the whale made a big effort to swim out to sea. “Quickly, our medics made noises underwater in order to create a wall of sound to deter the whale from swimming closer to shore and persuade it to swim in the right direction. “As it swam off, the whale looped round to the left of the bay and almost restranded itself again, floundering on some rocks. “Just as medics were preparing to get back into the water for further support, the whale made its way into deeper water and swam successfully off into the open sea. “It was last seen headed East and swimming strongly.” Comment MORE ON Daily RecordRemembrance DayWhalesAnimals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Meghan sued the newspaper publisher claiming it misused her private information, infringed herand breached the Data Protection Act and won the case. But an appeal by the publisher is currently being heard and yesterday several bombshell claims were made by Mr Knauf in a court statement, including that Meghan wrote the letter to her dad knowing it could be leaked and that she and Harry did help the authors of the biography Finding Freedom. But who exactly is Jason Knauf, how did he end up working for Harry and Meghan and what is he doing now  Hereaposs what we know... Royal aide Mr Knauf originally hails from New Zealand and is a graduate of Victoria University in Wellington. He also gained a masters in politics and communication from the London School of Economics. He previously worked as an advisor to former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark and worked at HM Treasury, where he was the press secretary to financial services secretary Lord Myners. Mr Knauf was also a Director of Corporate Affairs at the Royal Bank of Scotland before joining the royal household in .Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.His first job there was communications secretary to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.After Harry married Meghan, he also looked after their communications at Kensington Palace. He even attended their wedding in May .Earlier this year, it was reported in The Times that in , Mr Knauf reportedly submitted an email to Prince Williamaposs private secretary Simon Case alleging unacceptable behaviour by Meghan. The email reportedly claimed the Duchess had bullied two PAs out of their jobs in the previous year. It also claimed that Meghan seemed intent on always having someone in her sights, and Mr Knauf said he had received “report after report” from people who witnessed unacceptable behaviour” by Meghan towards a member of staff.  The report was published just days before Harry and Meghanaposs tell-all chat with Oprah Winfrey and in a statement in March, the couple said: We are disappointed to see this defamatory portrayal of The Duchess of Sussex given credibility by a media outlet. It’s no coincidence that distorted several-year-old accusations aimed at undermining The Duchess are being briefed to the British media shortly before she and The Duke are due to speak openly and honestly about their experience of recent years. The Duchess is saddened by this latest attack on her character, particularly as someone who has been the target of bullying herself and is deeply committed to supporting those who have experienced pain and trauma. She is determined to continue her work building compassion around the world and will keep striving to set an example for doing what is right and doing what is good.Buckingham Palace said they would investigate the claims but it could be some time before the final report is released, The Times reports.Royal Foundation  Mr Knauf continued in his role as communications secretary before being appointed as senior adviser to William and Kate in March , when William and Harryaposs households became separate. However, in September  he was appointed the chief executive officer of William and Kateaposs Royal Foundation.Earlier this year, it was revealed he would be stepping down from the position at the end of  ahead of a planned international relocation.Royal praise In a joint statement on his departure, William and Kate said: Jason has been an integral part of our team since . We are immensely grateful for his hard work and commitment, both at The Royal Foundation and previously as our Communications Secretary. Since taking over as Chief Executive, Jason has driven positive change, making our vision for our charitable work and the causes that matter most to us a reality. We are sad to see him go but wish him all the very best in his future career.  We look forward to launching the recruitment search shortly and welcoming a new Chief Executive later on this year. Mr Knauf added: Working with The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge has been the privilege of my career. I will always be grateful for the opportunity I have had to support their leadership in the UK and internationally. The months ahead will be the busiest time in the Foundation’s history with the first awards for The Earthshot Prize and more progress on our early childhood work. We have a lot to do with our amazing team and all of our partners. Bombshell claims Yesterday, Mr Knaufaposs explosive new evidence was heard during the second day of an appeal by the publisher of the Mail On Sunday against a High Court judgeaposs decision that the publication of a letter from Meghan to her father Thomas was unlawful. Lawyers for Associated Newspapers Limitedtold senior judges on Tuesday that they want to rely on a recent witness statement made by Mr Knauf in their legal bid to overturn the ruling. Mr Knauf said in his written evidence : She also asked a specic question regarding addressing Mr Markle as aposdaddyapos in the letter, saying aposgiven Iaposve only ever called him daddy it may make sense to open as such , and in the unfortunate event that it leaked it would pull at the heartstringsapos. He said Meghan had deliberately ended each page part way through a sentence so that no page could be ly presented as the end of the letter. In the event that it was leaked she wanted the full narrative as set out in the letter to be understood and shared, he continued. Rebutting Mr Knaufaposs evidence, Meghan said: The proposition that saying that I recognised that it was possible that my father would leak the letter, albeit unlikely, is the same as saying that I thought it likely that he would do so is, I would suggest, absurd.Meanwhile, Mr Knauf also said Meghan and Harry agreed to collaborate with the authors of the bestselling book Finding Freedom. The book was described as an unauthorised biography, and the royal couple said they were not interviewed for the book and did not contribute to it.The Court of Appeal heard on Wednesday that Meghan and Harry authorised specic cooperation in writing in December  to the authors of Finding Freedom .Mr Knauf said the book was discussed directly with the Duchess multiple times in person and over email and that Meghan gave him helpful written background reminders briefing notes. He added that in an email: “The Duchess…added the briefing points she wanted me to share with the authors in my meeting with them. And, in a December  email to the aide, he says Harry wrote: I totally agree we have to be able to say we didn’t have anything to do with it. Equally, you giving the right context and background to them would help get some truths out there…especially around Markle wedding stuff… Meghan has since apologised in a statement to the court and accepted that Mr Knauf did brief the authors of Finding Freedom with her knowledge.She said: I apologise to the Court for the fact that I had not remembered these exchanges at the time. I had absolutely no wish or intention to mislead the Defendant or the Court.

Meghan, , won her High Court privacy claim after a judge found the publication of a letter she wrote to her estranged father was unlawful.But Jason Knauf, Prince Harry and Meghan’s former communications secretary, claimed she had written the letter on the “understanding that it could be leaked”, according to a witness statement released on Wednesday.Today the court heard a source close to Mr Knauf said he regretted not giving a statement to lawyers for Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Mail on Sunday, before the High Court case. Mr Knauf worked for the Sussexes until March  before becoming CEO of Prince William and we Kate’s Royal Foundation, which he is due to leave at the end of the year.  Keith Mathieson, representing the publisher, told appeal court judges it was only in July this year, months after Meghan’s High Court triumph, that Associated Newspapers had “received information from a confidential source to the effect that Mr Knauf now regretted not providing a witness statement to us”. He added: “Mr Knauf was plainly a central figure in the events he describes. “He was a senior and trusted member of the royal household staff and he continues to occupy an important position.  “His witness statement is measured in tone and he has been careful not to include evidence of matters beyond his own personal knowledge. Given the high-profile nature of this litigation and the likelihood of his evidencebeing widely reported, as well as the position he holds, it is hardly conceivable that he would say anything he did not believe to be true and I know of nothing in his evidence which is subject to any reasonable challenge.” Meghan sued Associated Newspapers Limited over five articles that reproduced parts of a “personal and private” letter she wrote to her father.  Lord Justice Warby gave his High Court ruling in a summary judgment, avoiding the need for a trial. But ANL says the case should go to a trial on Meghan’s claims including breach of privacy and . Andrew Caldecott QC, representing ANL, told the court yesterday that the letter to Thomas Markle from Meghan was “not a loving letter, not a generous letter”, contrary to how it was presented.  Justin Rushbrooke QC, for Meghan, previously described the case as “very straightforward” and said her human rights were “triply engaged” by the publication of part of the letter. In her written evidence to the Court of Appeal, Meghan denied she thought it likely that her father would leak the letter, but “merely recognised that this was a possibility”. She said: “To be clear, I did not want any of it to be published, and wanted to ensure that the risk of it being manipulated or misleadingly edited was minimised, were it to be exploited.”  Sir Geoffrey Vos, sitting with Dame Victoria Sharp and Lord Justice Bean, will give their ruling at a later date. Meghan sued Associated Newspapers Limited , which is also the publisher of MailOnline, over five articles that reproduced parts of a personal and private letter to her father. She won her case earlier this year after Lord Justice Warby ruled that ANLaposs publication of Meghanaposs letter to her father was unlawful in a summary judgment, avoiding the need for a trial.  The challenge, launched in the Court of Appeal over the last three days, argued the case should go to a trial on Meghanaposs claims including breach of privacy and . Andrew Caldecott QC, representing ANL, told the court on Thursday that Mr Markle faced nasty and untrue allegations in an article published by People magazine in the US and there was a public interest in correcting them. He added that the letter to Mr Markle from Meghan was not a loving letter, not a generous letter, contrary to how it was presented in the People article. The barrister continued: When we come to the very first allegation about cold-shouldering her at the wedding... this allegation is demonstrably , we say. Justin Rushbrooke QC, for Meghan, previously described the case as very straightforward and said her human rights were triply engaged by the publication of part of the letter. He said: This was a letter of which extensive contents, about half of it, were first published by the defendant without the consent of the complainant, or even notication.  In her written evidence to the Court of Appeal, Meghan denied she thought it likely that her father would leak the letter, but merely recognised that this was a possibility. She said: To be clear, I did not want any of it to be published, and wanted to ensure that the risk of it being manipulated or misleadingly edited was minimised, were it to be exploited, she continued. Sir Geoffrey Vos, sitting with Dame Victoria Sharp and Lord Justice Bean, said they will take time to consider their decision and give their ruling at a later date.

Prince Harryaposs official biographer Angela Levin says Meghan is brushing off new evidence in her court battle with the Mail on Sunday asitaposs nothing. But the details being revealed by former aide Jason Knauf at the High Court are very serious and could cause signicant damage to her reputation, Ms Levin says. The new evidence lead Meghan to issue an apology statement, in which she said she hadnapost remembered the emails between her and Mr Knauf and had no wish or intention to mislead the court. It comes amid the final stages of Meghanaposs legal fight with the publishers of the Mail on Sunday, Associated Newspapers Ltd . The mum-of-two, , took issue with the paper printing what she says was a private and personal five-page letter written to her estranged dad, Thomas Markle. In the letter the Duchess begs him to not speak to the media about her. Though Meghan won her case at the High Court in February, ANL appealed - and they claim to have bombshell details which could overturn the decision.  Yesterday Meghan was forced to apologise to the court for not disclosing emails in which she attempted to influence a biography about her and Harry. The emails, released by the Court of Appeal, showed that two years ago the couple gave press spokesman Jason Knauf a detailed brief before meeting biography writers Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand. Another email exchange, revealed by Mr Knauf, showed messages Meghan wrote to estranged dad Thomas, , after the royal wedding. Meghan told him she would call him daddy to pull at the heartstringsthe messages were leaked, Mr Knauf claimed.  The -year-old Duchess has strongly denied helping Scobie and Durand to write the Finding Freedom biography. But in  pages of court documents, Mr Knauf swore the Sussexes told him what to tell the authors. Palace aides are finally getting their own back at the Sussexes, Ms Levin - who spent a year with Harry writing his biography - told GB News. I think the whole thing is absolutely extraordinary, she told the broadcaster.  What is astonishing is that the Palace aides are now talking and saying what they think has really happened. Before, they followed the Queenaposs motto - which is to never complain and never explain, and staff did this too. But Meghan and Harry are a dferent breed now and [their comments are] thought to be so unfair and wrong that aides now going to speak about their views. She claims the Duchess tried brushing away Mr Knaufaposs evidence as though itaposs nothing.  But Ms Levin claims in the court setting she was in It is very serious. She explained: What she said in court was not true and I think her credibility will suffer for this in a signicant way. Ms Levin says the Duchess is also desperate to not lose against the publisher.  She doesnapost like to be beaten - she wants to win, and sometimes she goes overboard, she said. She doesnapost listen to detail, she doesnapost want to be told, she just wants to forge ahead. In a new witness statement, Meghan apologised to the court and accepted Mr Knauf did brief the Finding Freedom authors with her knowledge. She said: I apologise to the Court for the fact that I had not remembered these exchanges at the time. I had absolutely no wish or intention to mislead the Defendant or the Court. The Duchess added that had she known about the emails she would have been more than happy to refer to them as strongly supportive of her case. The Finding Freedom biography, published in August , detailed the married lives of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - and their infamous split from the Royal Family. The book was described as an unauthorised biography, and the royal couple have previously denied that they were involved with its creation.However the Court of Appeal heard on Wednesday that Meghan and Harry authorised specic cooperation in writing in December  to the authors of Finding Freedom .The book was discussed directly with the Duchess multiple times in person and over email, the court heard, and Meghan was said to give him helpful written background reminders.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Mail on SundayMeghan MarklePrince HarryRoyal FamilyFinding Freedom\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But when he came along, going out became a logistical nightmare. This misery was only compounded when Hari came along two years ago.“Six years ago I took a pregnancy test on board a train, ironically, to my friend’s baby shower,” said Sophie, , who is mum to Leo, five, and Hari, two.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here “When the two lines popped up I called my then bf, now hubby, and told him, he replied aposNo, f’in way!apos. He was in the queue to get into the Simmer Down Festival and was not in the state to be told such le altering news.“We were both partying most weekends and a baby just wouldn’t be practical for our bar hopping shenanigans - PST definitely doesn’t have baby changing facilities, she told Birmingham Live. She added: “And then came the power struggle once our son, Leo, arrived. Both tired, but both in desperate need for some time away from our colicky baby we found ourselves arguing all the time about who was getting a break next.” Not wanting to lose their pre-children lives, the couple had a sit down and began to map out when they could go out, together and separately.  She said that the plan wasnapost smooth initially. “If either of us did get out the other would be at home feeling resentful, jealous, even a little paranoid! “It took us another baby to smooth this out. Lots of long conversations led us to the conclusion that going out was the only thing that made both of us remember ourselves BC .” And so, Sophie and Rakesh started to go out again, both together and separately - but with some set rules in place. “We don’t have a strict timetable but we do have some loose rules - lie in only till am, donapost go out all the time and it needs to be put into our joint Google calendar at least a week in advance,” said Sophie, who met Rakesh seven years ago whilst both working for a small start-up company.  “We used to really resent itthe other went aposout outapos but we’ve come to find that it’s so good for our mental health to still do the things we liked doing before kids and let each other just be ‘us’ for a night. Sophie has since began organising family-friendly parties, under the name Big Fish Little Fish Raves. Following a sell-out Halloween family rave, Sophie is hosting a Pyjama Family Rave called Sweet Dreams are Made of This at Popworld on Broad Street, Birmingham on January .

The Prince of Wales was greeted by crowds of people as he left a branch of NatWest bank in Brixton, south London, after an engagement for the Princeaposs Trust on Thursday. One man asked him: Prince Charles. How is your mother  The heir to the throne gave him an encouraging pat on the arm, and appeared to say: Sheaposs alright, thank you. The Queen, , has been under doctorsapos orders to rest during the past three weeks after undergoing medical tests and spending a night in hospital on October . She has ed to Windsor Castle on Tuesday after spending six days at Sandringham, where she was believed to have been preparing to welcome her family for Christmas. She conducted a Privy Council meeting by video link from the castle on Wednesday afternoon, with ministers including Lord President of the Council Jacob Rees-Mogg and Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi among others.The -year-old monarch is understood to be feeling refreshed after spending time at her later husband Prince Philipaposs former home, Wood Farm on the vast Sandringham estate. Though the monarch has said she will miss the annual Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall on Saturday, Buckingham Palace has said it is her firm intention to be at the Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph. However, her attendance has yet to be confirmed. The Queen is commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces and has only ever missed six Remembrance Sunday services in the capital, four due to royal tours and two when she was pregnant.  The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall are expected to lead other members of the royal family on Saturday at the annual remembrance event at the Royal Albert Hall. This would include the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Earl and Countess of Wessex and the Princess Royal. Her Majesty has been told to ease up on her hectic schedule after she was last month forced to spend a night in hospital, with specialist doctors at the King Edward VII hospital in Marylebone, London, performing a series of tests described as “preliminary investigations”.  She was forced to cancel a two day trip to Northern Ireland at the last minute as well as a planned appearance at the COP climate change conference last week. Courtiers are understood to be working towards managing the Queen’s diary accordingly for the next few weeks leading up to Christmas, while she will continue to undertake light duties at Windsor Castle. In a statement, Buckingham Palace said: Following on from their recent advice that the Queen should rest for a few days, Her Majestyaposs doctors have advised that she should continue to rest for at least the next two weeks.  The doctors have advised that Her Majesty can continue to undertake light, desk-based duties during this time, including some virtual audiences, but not to undertake any official visits. The monarch has recently been spotted used a walking stick for the first time on royal visits. Despite any recent medical wobbles, the monarch is said to be “totally committed” to entertaining her loved ones at her Norfolk home after missing out last year because of the pandemic. But royal sources said she is determined to recover soon so she can see her family at their traditional festive gathering. Last year restrictions meant the Queen and the late Prince Philip had a quiet Christmas alone at Windsor Castle. But after losing her husband of  years in April, it is understood Her Majesty really wants to see everyone together. A Palace insider said: “This year, more than ever, it is incredibly important to Her Majesty to be surrounded by her loved ones. “The Queen is totally committed to hosting everyone as she hopes to make it back to full health in the coming weeks. “Her Majesty is resting under doctors’ orders with the intention of being able to fully enjoy the company of her extended family over the holiday period.

Raihan Ahmed, , was driving mph in a mph zone across a bridge in Birmingham’s Digbeth district on August . The stolen caraposs wheels at one point left the ground before landing on the other side of the bridge, smashing into -year-old former bus driver and father-of-four Ghulam Nabi, who died of his injuries.Police have released the CCTV video clips, which show Ahmed fleeing the scene at high speed before abandoning the car, BirminghamLive reports. Ahmed, of Great Barr, was arrested just  hours later following a successful appeal by the police and jailed for three-years and eight months.  He has been banned from driving for four years and ten months. The family of the victim, Mr Nabi, agreed for police to release the footage to warn drivers over the dangers of speeding. West Midlands Police detective Paul Hughes, of the forceaposs serious collision investigation unit said, “Mr Nabi was a totally innocent party in this matter and, as a pedestrian, should have been afforded safety on the pavement.  Ahmed was driving at such a speed on a public road and, in a specically restricted speed limit, that the loss of control on the bridge resulted in all four wheels leaving the road. “Itaposs always a dficult decision to release footage from such tragic cases - however this is some of the worse driving I have seen in a long time. “By releasing footage, with the support of Mr Nabi’s family, I hope it will make people think again about the responsibility they carry when driving.

She said she regained consciousness in the toilets of the venueHattie Brown has described regaining consciousness in a night club toilets to find a human bite mark on her arm Image: BPM MEDIAByKaty KeighleyChiara Fiorillo:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | commentsA teenager who was claimed she was spiked at a nightclub found a human bite mark on her arm when she regained consciousness. Hattie Brown said she felt really confused during a night out during which she suffered memory loss. The student at Exeter University said when she regained consciousness in the toilets of the venue, she noticed she had been bitten.She told Devon Live : Somehow I lost my friends, I looked around for them, but I don’t remember finding them.I then have a complete memory gap and I remember waking up, or regaining consciousness in the toilets, with my back up against the door.  I was really confused. I looked down at my arm and there were teeth indentations. I saw that I had been bitten by a human and I was really confused because I’ve never really heard of that happening before. I’m assuming that I must have been spiked because I don’t understand how I could have gone from being pretty much sober to having complete memory loss, and how I would have been bitten that hard on the arm without feeling it. She added: It’s one of those things where you will just never understand what was going through the mind of that person and how it happened. Part of me doesn’t want to know what happened, and I’ve kind of accepted that I won’t, but it’s so bizarre.  The -year-old said she is still suffering with bruising, swelling and pain two days later. However, she does not want this experience to stop her from going clubbing in the future and instead wants to warn others hoping it will help them stay safe on nights out. She shared her story on TikTok, gaining over , views, telling people to stay with your mates, let your mates know where you are and where you’re going.  Earlier this month, a university student said she collapsed in an AE waiting room after being allegedly spiked by injection at a nightclub. Amy Taylor said her legs felt fuzzy and her arm was bruised while she started feeling unconscious. The alleged incident happened at Fab aposNapos Halloween Guild of Students club night on October , Birmingham Live reports.The third-year human biology student said she noticed a puncture wound on her arm after being helped into an Uber to AE. She claimed she was spiked at the end of the night, between .am and am.

Thomas Markle slammed his daughter following revelations from her then press secretary Jason Knauf that she was aware about the book Finding Freedom. The Duchess of Sussex said she had not remembered emails between her and Mr Knauf despite a spokesperson for the Sussexes insisting they did not collaborate with the authors on the book, nor were they interviewed for it In a damning interview on GB News on Thursday evening, he claimed: I cant speak to much about this but I think she was trying to deceive.  I think she was telling lies. Finally the truth is coming out and thank god for Jason Knauf. I would like him to come over so I can take him out for a steak. Meghan has apologised in a new witness statement, where she accepted that Mr Knauf did brief the authors of Finding Freedom with Meghanaposs knowledge. She said: I apologise to the Court for the fact that I had not remembered these exchanges at the time. I had absolutely no wish or intention to mislead the Defendant or the Court.  The Duchess added that had she known about the emails she would have been more than happy to refer to them as strongly supportive of her case.In the interview Thomas claimed Meghan had demanded he stopped talking to his two older children and that she had ghosted her family from both sides after marrying Prince Harry.Meghan has claimed that her two older half-siblings Samantha and Thomas had said hurtful things about her in the past.  The interview this evening comes as the Associated Newspapers Limited - the publishers of the Mail on Sunday - appeals against a summary judgement given earlier this year. Meghan had sued the company over five articles that reproduced parts of a personal and private letter sent to her dad in August . The High Court ruled ANLaposs publication of Meghanaposs letter to her father was unlawful, meaning there was no need for a trial. Mr Markle last appeared on British TV screens at the end of October when he was interviewed on Good Morning Britain.  The show was subsequently hit with a  Ofcom complaints by viewers unhappy that he had sounded off about his estranged daughter once again. The Duchess of Sussex has been the subject of a number of cutting remarks from her father and he also tore into Prince Harryaposs new tell-all book, which he branded shameful.  During the attack on the Sussexes Thomas claimed he was being ghosted by Meghan and has vowed to continue to publicly attack his daughter until she begins speaking to him again. I think Harry has abandoned the Queen, the royal family, the British people and the Army. Heaposs abandoned them all, he said on GMB. I’ve made it quite clear until I hear from her until she does speak to me that I’ll continue to do this.  I will do a show for at least a monthI can get it through and eventually sooner or later she should start talking to me - this is way too childish. This is kind of silly. It’s time to talk with each other. We’re family. At one point the retired lighting director said heaposd considered taking legal action in a bid to see his grandchildren, Archie and Lilibet. Some viewers found that suggestion galling. Thereaposs something quite tone deaf about Thomas Markle, one person wrote on social media. Surely youaposd know that your daughter has cut you off because you keep bashing her to the press  How can you be that unaware  The last time Mr Markle went on GB News was back in August this year.  He was asked by Wootton for his response to Meghanaposs comments about him, regarding the infamous paparazzi pictures he staged with an agency before her wedding. The Duchess had, in an interview with Oprah, implied her dad had intentionally caused her pain with the photos. My first response is whataposs going to happen to these children  her dad said. I donapost know what terrible things are going to happen to these children because I did some photos, I donapost know what theyaposre talking about, what Harry is talking about, he kept saying apos you do that only one kid will be protectedapos, not two, I donapost know what heaposs talking about.

The WikiLeaks founder has been held in Belmarsh Prison in London since  after the United States took legal action to extradite him. The couple, who met when Assange was living in the Ecuadorean embassy in London, have two children. Speaking on Twitter, Ms Moris said: I am relieved that reason prevailed and I hope there will be no further interference with our marriage. A Prison Service spokesperson said: Mr Assangeaposs application was received, considered and processed in the usual way by the prison governor, as for any other prisoner.  Assange secretly fathered two children with Morris, who has spoken in his defence at rallies, while in Londonaposs Ecuadorian embassy. The Aussie couple are expected to get married in a Catholic service in the London prisonaposs chapel, with guests chosen from fellow prisoners. Mr Assange, an Australian citizen, was arrested by police after spending five years in the Ecuadorian embassy, where he had sought political asylum as he fought to avoid extradition to Sweden, fearing he would be taken to the US for questioning over the activities of WikiLeaks. He was jailed for  months for skipping bail but was kept in Belmarsh while a y legal case was mounted by the US.  In January a judge refused the USaposs request to extradite Mr Assange, but an appeal was lodged, with the outcome still pending. No date has been set for the wedding. The couple have been engaged for a number of years and have been trying to get married despite the legal action. Their sons Gabriel, four, and Max, two, are British citizens.The couple were taking legal action against the prison governor and Justice Secretary Dominic Raab, accusing them of preventing a wedding being held.

Twin Curtis Means, who is now a healthy -month-old, was delivered in Birmingham, Alabama, in the US, last year weighing just g .The average weight of a newborn is around . lb , while a full-term pregnancy is usually  weeks.Guinness World Records has now confirmed that Curtis, who was  days - nearly  weeks - premature, set the new record. His mother, Michelle Butler, scrambled to get to the hospital after being into labour on July  , amid Independence Day celebrations.  Michelle gave birth to twins, Curtis and C’Asya, at lunchtime the next day. Little C’Asya tragically died a day later. However, Curtis beat the odds, clinging on in intensive care. Dr Brian Sims, who was the attending physician, said statistically, children born as young as the twins had virtually no chance of survival. In a statement from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, which operates the hospital, Dr Sims said doctors typically advised “compassionate care” in situations of extremely preterm births.  This allows the parents to hold their babies and cherish what little time they may have together.”But instead, Curtis grew stronger by the day and was thriving,the BBC reported.He received help from therapists to learn to breathe and to use his mouth to eat, and after  days, was eventually taken off a ventilator and discharged from hospital.  Mrs Butler, of rural Eutaw, Alabama, said in a statement: Being able to finally take Curtis home and surprise my older children with their younger brother is a moment I will always remember. While Curtis, the youngest of four, still needs supplemental oxygen and a feeding tube, doctors say he is in good health. Dr Sims, who oversaw the delivery, told Guinness World Records: Iaposve been doing this almost  years, but Iaposve never seen a baby this young be as strong as he was. There was something special about Curtis. Curtis cut a whole  hours off the previous record. Wisconsin baby Richard Hutchinson was born just a month prior, at  weeks and two days. The record had remained unbroken before Richard’s birth for  years, with the previous record holder being a baby boy born in Ottawa, Canada, at  weeks and five days.

The Duchess of Sussex, , smiled for the cameras as she glided across the red carpet in New York City. Meghan appeared in a flowing long dress at this year’s Salute to Freedom Gala at the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum. She was holding hands with her husband Harry, , who looked dashing wearing a dinner jacket, bow tie and military medals. But just hours earlier - and some , miles away - the Court of Appeal in London had learned more about the writing of the bestseller Finding Freedom.  A statement from Meghan, read to the court, claimed emails between her then press secretary Jason Knauf about a meeting with the authors of the book, Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, had slipped her mind. In a statement, Mr Knauf noted that Meghan and Harry authorised specic cooperation in writing in December . He had advised the couple that putting the authors in touch with Meghanaposs friends was not a good idea, emails show. Being able to say hand on heart that we did not facilitate access will be important, he told the pair. A witness statement from Meghan then said she accepted that Mr Knauf did brief the authors of Finding Freedom - with her knowledge. She said: I apologise to the Court for the fact that I had not remembered these exchanges at the time.  I had absolutely no wish or intention to mislead the Defendant or the Court. The Duchess added that had she known about the emails she would have been more than happy to refer to them as strongly supportive of her case. Last year a spokesperson for the couple said they did not collaborate with the authors on the book, nor were they interviewed for it, OK reports. Despite the dayaposs revelations, the pair put on a united front on the red carpet. When a reporter asked Meghanshe was proud of Prince Harry, she replied: Iaposm always proud of him.  Harry later joked in a speech at the event that he is now living the American Dream. He said: “It’s wonderful to be back on USS Intrepid a decade after my last visit – and a lot has changed since then. Just last week, I went for a ride on the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile – how’s that for living the American dream. Each year the museum pays tribute to people in the military who have shown “extraordinary leadership” and honours the roles they have played to defend their country.  Harry continued: I’ve lived in the US for close to two years now. I have to say, witnessing your support for all those that put themselves in harm’s way in defence of our freedoms and liberties – it’s remarkable and hugely respected. “It reminds me of the deep reverence us Brits have for our military as well. The armed forces communities in both our countries share a special bond, and I’m grateful to have served in support of our joint allyship for many years.” Meghan was wearing a red Carolina Herrera dress and red shoes to match the high-slit fashion choice. She had her long locks up into a high bun. Harry had a line of four medals on his jacket along with the cross for Knight Commander of Royal Victorian Order around his neck. Palace rules mean Harry can wear medals on his jacket but was stripped of his titles after deciding to leave for the US. He was reportedly particularly upset to have the rank of Captain General of the Royal Marines taken from him. As they moved along the red carpet, it was Harry who appeared more keen to stop and chat. He was overheard to ask one person: Are you excited  Then a reporter asked him: Howaposs your grandmother  He smiled and nodded before moving on.  The Sussexes, parents to Archie, two, and five-month-old Lilibet, were both wearing a poppy. The event is held ahead of Veterans Day in the US and Remembrance Day in the UK. Harry is a special guest at the event where he will give out medals for the Intrepid Valor Awards to five service members, veterans and military families who are living with the “invisible wounds of war”. The event is particularly relevant for Harry who himself had a military background before leaving the Royal Family and moving to Calornia.  He served in the military for  years including two tours of Afghanistan and has been working with veterans as well as founding the Invictus Games - a sporting event for wounded for ex-servicemen. Harry and Meghan have been dedicating their time to charity work and humanitarian initiatives since moving to the US. Also at the veteransapos event was Jon Bon Jovi who collaborated with Harry to release a song for the Invictus Games and he received the  Intrepid Letime Achievement Award for his work as chairman of the Jon Bon Jovi Soul Foundation.We are so grateful to Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex for honouring and amplying the stories of these heroes and helping to raise awareness for mental health support for our men and women in unorm, said Susan Marenoff-Zausner, president of the Intrepid Museum. This is their second trip to New York this year having attended the Global Citizen Live concert in Manhattan in late September. Harry has spoken out recently about the trolling of Meghan online, including over the decision by the couple to leave the UK for the US that became dubbed “Megxit”. He reportedly told the Wired’s Re:Wired Conference on Tuesday that the “term ‘Megxit’ was or is a misogynistic term and it was created by a troll, amplied by royal correspondents and it grew and grew and grew into mainstream media.”  Meghan meanwhile has said she is now feeling much better after admitting she suffered suicidal thoughts while pregnant with son Archie. The Duchess of Sussex was speaking to host Andrew Ross Sorkin at the New York Times DealBook Summit where she said stepping back from royal duties has lead to an improvement in her mental health. Mr Sorkin said there was a moment when a lot of the world was concerned and wondering about the comments she made. Meghan told an interview with Oprah Winfrey earlier this year, she had suicidal thoughts while a member of the Royal Family living in the UK.  She also alleged racism by a royal who asked her what would be the colour of her child when she was pregnant for the first time. She responded to the host that she was now feeling “better about everything. Just days ago royal biographer Andrew Morton revealed the Oprah interview was planned years in advance, shortly after the Sussexes got married. The Sussexesapos rt with the Royal Family led to them moving to the United States last year and since then they have spoken regularly to American media about problems they allege forced them to leave.

But, in actual fact, around  percent of marriages end in orce, proving this is sadly not the case. It most instances you would assume itaposs impossible to tell whether the couple will go the distance, but according to a wedding photographer, the signs of future orce bells are a lot less subtle than youaposd think.Shayla Herrington recently took to TikTok to share the three signs that a marriage is doomed from the very beginning, according to a wedding photographer of more than  years, who shared their wisdom with her.Posting from the handle @shaylamherrington, Shayla explained: One time I was shooting under this wedding photographer, and they told me they can always tella couple will last or not, based on three things.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Mind you this photographer has been in the industry for  or  years, so I was really interested to hear their theory on this, she added. The first sign, Shayla explained, isone of the spouses takes more than three photos without their partner - which actually makes a lot of sense,you think about it. This one kinda makes sense to me, just because you might get a few with your mom and dad, but to kick them out of more than three photos, seems a little suspicious, she explained. The second indicator is the bridesmaids, or the groomsmen will avoid talking about the spouse when they are getting ready or doing toast or anything, which she explained typically means they donapost like the spouse. And finally, Shayla revealed that the third indicator the marriage will not last is when the couple spend more time with family and friends than with each other during the day. The photographer then questioned her followers over whether they believed these indicators to be true, and many shared their own experiences of weddings and orce. Yep. My ex-husband didnapost spend time with me at the wedding, and his groomsmen didnapost say hi to me at all, one TikTok user commented, while another added: It depends. My husband didnapost even MEET half my family until the wedding day so there wasnapost that relationship between him and my family.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Itaposs getting colder, darker and weaposre about to officially enter the period of Christmas parties. So fans of McDonald’s will be pleased to hear, there is a range of suitably festive items available from November  to revive you.We visited McDonaldaposs HQ in East Finchley for a sneak peek of the menu - prepared by their in-house chefs in the test kitchen. Hereaposs what we thought. The fast-food chain is introducing two new burgers with a Christmas influence- the Festive Stack and Festive Crispy Chicken.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here I started with the Festive Stack burger This burger contains two British and Irish beef patties with red onion relish, white cheese sauce, bacon, crispy onions, red onion, lettuce, cheddar cheese in a glazed brioche-style bun. Reminiscent of the sandwich you create on Boxing Day, surrounded by leftovers, the cheese sauce is a nice touch - while the chutney jazzes up the burger. The only downside was I didnapost really notice the crispy onions - but the red onion did prove a satisfying crunch. The Festive Crispy Chicken, meanwhile, is packed with a chicken breast fillet in a crispy coating with cranberry sauce, sage and onion mayo, bacon, red onion, lettuce, cheddar cheese in a glazed poppy and sesame seed bun. This is the Christmas winner - the cranberry sauce is nice and sweet, while the sage and onion mayonnaise means that it doesnapost feel cloying. Perfect for ordering at am after drinking all the shots at the annual work Christmas do. These both retail at £. on their own or £. as part of a meal. Treat yourself, itaposs Christmas. Next up were the cheese Melt Dippers, which are made with Camembert. Iaposm a big fan of the chainaposs mozzarella sticks, so had high expectations for these, and they were met. Carby, cheesy goodness - whataposs not to love  They could have been crunchier, but I expect most people to prefer the squidge. These came with a herby ketchup, which wasnapost remarkable, but provided some tang. Four dippers cost £., but you can go all out with Cheese Melt Dippers Sharebox for £.. Next up was the Festive Pie Theyaposve taken the classic hot crispy pie and filled it with mincemeat and custard. This was a winner, but could never replace the apple-pie shaped hole in my heart, as itaposs held with such esteem. But it is a fun festival treat - perfect with a cup of coffee to fuel you while shopping for presents. This will retail at £.. We wrapped things up with the Celebrations McFlurry Itaposs the festive chocolate box of choice for many families, mixed with ice cream. Whataposs not to love  Described as soft dairy ice cream, swirled with Maltesers clusters, Galaxy chocolate drops, Caramel pieces, Mars chewy pieces and Twix biscuits, eagle-eyed fans will notice there are no Bounty pieces.Whether thataposs controversial depends on your feelings - a recent survey showedof Brits claim itaposs their least-loved chocolate.McDonaldaposs has around , restaurants in the UK.You can use its store finder tool online to locate your nearest branch.

Misty MurphaposAriens, , and her husband Bryce , have become homesteaders - self sufficiency experts - since moving into a remote Canadian forest  years ago. They spent a few years learning tips and tricks from rural-living relatives before buying land and building a cob house - a natural material made of clay, sand and straw for just ,.The former chefs, who have daughters Sage, seven, and Aurora, five, are almost entirely self-sufficient, cooking their meals on a wooden stove.  They get electricity from solar  and use rain and a well for water, while most food comes from their own cows, chickens and ducks, and their vegetable patch. The garden grows all the traditional orchard fruits and produces a iety of nuts and vegetables which they harvest on a weekly basis. The pair reckon their lives cost just ,a year to fund which is , CADless than the average four person household in their province. Misty, from Dundalk, Ontario, said: From the moment we met we instantly knew we wanted to live an alternative lestyle.  Bryceaposs grandmotheraposs cottage was so peaceful and we were constantly disappointed when we had to leave and go back to the city. Iaposve always suffered with intense migraines but when we moved to the countryside they started to become less and less frequent. Six-months after moving theyaposd stopped completely and Iaposm convinced it was the noise and the city environment which had been the cause of my discomfort.  Rural living immediately made sense to us, and the idea of being completely self sufficient was really appealing. The couple met while working as chefs in Hamilton, but quickly realised they werenapost suited to living in the big city. Instead they opted to follow a more rural path and began learning about le on a homestead.  After visiting Bryceaposs grandmotheraposs cob cottage in rural Durham for  weekends in a row, they eventually moved there in . They spent three years learning how to lead the homestead lestyle, before going out on their own and buying a piece of farm land in the local area. In , the couple purchased the land for , despite it being covered in rubbish and abandoned materials which they spent weeks clearing  It took Misty and Bryce four months to build their aposcobapos home. Every summer since the move, they have expanded and improved their home. Their daughters are home-schooled by Misty, and taught a traditional syllabus with the addition of key primal skills, animal care and building techniques. The children have grown up learning some key skills which they may not have learned at school.  To earn money, Misty and Bryce run a small catering business in the local community, but with no car, they get around by cycling, walking or travelling on horseback. Bryce claims the reason their family is financially stable despite their lack of consistent income is their low cost, self sufficient lestyle. Weaposve worked out over the years that our annual living costs amount to approximately , - and thataposs with raising two kids, he said.  We try to be as self sufficient as possible, farming and harvesting all the food we eat. We do get the occasional shopping delivery to the nearest road, but thataposs only for a very select range of essential items. I think the dference with our lestyle is not so much what we do, but why we do it.  Of course we do have to acquire money, but the focus of our day is finding the most sustainable and fulfilling way to live. Whereas most people are spending the majority of their time working to afford the necessities of le, we spend our time working to acquire these necessities directly. Granted its not a le for everyone, but it works for us, and, as a family, weaposve never been happier.

Itaposs bedtime, darling. Pop back to bed, Iaposll come and see you in a second. Smiling after the interruption, Mrs Ardern apologised to viewers and then told her daughter to go to her grandmother who would take her to bed. She then laughed at the camera and joked: That was a bedtime fail wasn’t it  She added: Does anyone  have kids escape like, three, four times after bedtime  Thankfully my mumaposs here so she can help out there. But shortly after the Prime Minister started addressing her viewers on the coronavirus pandemic once again, her daughter ed. Mrs Ardern told her: Iaposm sorry, darling, it is taking so long. The PM then announced she would be ending the live stream. As the pandemic forced many people to work from home, there has been an increase in the number of children jumping in while their parents are on calls or appearing on live broadcasts. In August, a New Zealand cabinet minister became embarrassed during a TV interview after her son entered the room showing a phallic carrot he had found among groceries.  Carmel Sepuloni, the minister for social development, later tweeted a video of the incident, saying: That moment when you’re doing a live interview via Zoom and your son walks into the room shouting and holding a deformed carrot shaped like a male body part.Yes, we were almost wrestling over a carrot on camera, and yes, I’m laughing about it now but wasn’t at the time!Last year, a BBC News interview with Dr Clare Wenham and Christian Fraser was photobombed by Clareaposs adorable daughter, Scarlett.The child stole the show and had viewers tweeting in droves to say how funny she was.In , Professor Robert E Kelly gained the nickname apos BBC Dadapos after his two children hilariously interrupted his live interview.Comment MORE ON Carmel SepuloniCoronavirusJacinda ArdernNew Zealand\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Jesus rebuked him for his unbelief and said: ‘Blessed are those who have not seen yet believe.’We believe lots of things, not because we can see them for ourselves but by accepting the word of those who have.Christians believe in Jesus, not because we have seen him with our own eyes, but because of the reliable word of the apostles who physically saw the risen Jesus with their own eyes.I encourage you to read the Gospels, the accurately written-down eyewitness testimony of the apostles to Jesus so that you might see who he is and as you trust in him alone,"},{"url":null,"title":"from our files october 29 2021","story":"Campbeltown#s vital Ring and Ride bus service is safe – for now.It was granted a last-minute reprieve from council budget cuts on Wednesday, two days before it was due to be scrapped.Argyll and Bute Council agreed to continue the Ring and Ride service whilst it takes time to look for an alternative.Councillor Rory Colville, community spokesman for Argyll and Bute Council, said: #We are responding to the concerns of the people who need this service most.#It will continue in its current form for as long as it takes to make an informed decision about changes and we will make people aware of what will be provided in the future.#No timescale was given as to whether this would be before next May#s elections.In last year#s budget, the service was earmarked for the axe at the time, but the council gave assurances alternative arrangements would be put in place.Councillor John Semple said: #I am glad to see that finally some common sense seems to be filtering through – only three weeks ago the administration voted to continue with this cut.#I will continue to look after the interests of the most vulnerable people in this community as the administration#s plans materialise.#Argyll First councillor Donald Kelly was a prime mover in establishing and expanding the service and is totally against the withdrawal.He told the Courier that this is only a stay of execution for this service and assurances are needed that the service will be retained in the long-term.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOThe MP for Argyll and Bute has pressed for additional facts about the ferry service between Campbeltown and Ballycastle.During last Friday#s Scottish Questions in the House of Commons, Mrs Ray Michie pressed the Secretary of State for Scotland, Mr Michael Forsyth, for more information.She said: #I welcome the announcement, at long last, of the ferry service, although I am disappointed Caledonian MacBrayne was not allowed to run it.#She went on to ask: #For how long does Sea Containers have the contract  Is the Secretary of State expecting the service eventually to run all year, so that we can build up not only a good tourist service, but a good import and export trade #Mr Forsyth responded: #It was important for the new route to be established. It was possible to achieve that with a private sector operator taking the risk, which means that CalMac#s available public capital and running costs can be deployed on maintaining other services and introducing new ones.#It must be the right approach to use the state#s nationalised service and the scarce resources available to it as wisely as possible.#That was what lay behind our thinking.#He went on to say that he would write to Mrs Michie regarding the contract.Mrs Michie commented: #It is important we get the full facts about this service so that we can judge whether this really is value for money as the government claims.#FIFTY YEARS AGOEmergency sea rescue services in the Firth of Clyde could have been victims of another hoax on Friday.For the Campbeltown leboat, three naval vessels and a Dakota aircraft spent nearly six hours searching Kilbrannan Sound and its approaches for a boat reported to have been sinking off Campbeltown.The drama began at lunchtime when the Campbeltown leboat mechanic, Mr Alistair Gilchrist, intercepted a wireless message which read: #Mayday Boy Danny sinking  degrees off Campbeltown.#Kildonan Coastguard Station, Troon Leboat Station and Portpatrick Radio also picked up the call the boat#s name, however, was not mentioned in the message received by the other three stations.Then a full-scale search operation swung into operation. Along with the leboat, the warship HMS Eastbourne, Fishery Protection vessel Vigilant and the US Navy ship Victoria began combing the area between the south of Arran and Kintyre.They were joined later in the search by a Dakota aircraft from Prestwick.An RAF patrol vessel stood by at Campbeltown.Campbeltown leboat reported the discovery of a large piece of timber. It was, however, too heavy to lt aboard and it was not thought to be part of possible wreckage.Then, after six hours, the search was called off. The plane and boats had covered an extensive area of sea.Coastguards using mobile equipment searched along the shores of Arran and Kintyre.Nothing was seen.Police in Campbeltown began investigations into the matter shortly after the leboat put to sea their enquiries are continuing.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOAuchencorvie United, one of the teams that came into being in the rural area as a result of the formation of sports clubs among agricultural workers, made their first appearance in local competitive football last Saturday afternoon.Drumlemble supplied the opposition and had a comparatively easy victory by four goals to nil.Auchencorvie had several players of some promise but, as a whole, the team was sadly wanting in science and judgement and the lesson of their first experience should impress on them the fact that mere lusty vigour is not sufficient to win on the football field.In the first half, Drumlemble did not press their undoubted superiority unduly, being content with a one-goal lead at the interval. James Munro was the scorer.In the second half they added three more to the total, D Thomson having two and A Kerr one.At the opening concert of the winter session of the Scottish Clans# Association of

goal last Saturday after an th-minute strike resigned the Kintyre Park side to a narrow defeat away to St Peter#s.Playing at Renfrew FC#s impressive New Western Park, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils started the match brightly, despite another y injury list which saw several established first-team players ruled out and others unavailable due to work commitments.The Pupils took the lead before the -minute mark when John McCallum, playing at right wing in a --- formation, reacted quickest to Craig Lamont#s long throw-in, which bounced up on the dry synthetic surface, to guide a deft looping header beyond the reach of the St Peter#s keeper.The Kintyre side had efforts from left winger Scott Souden and lone striker Sean Grady go wide of the target – the latter#s promising effort deflected wide of goal – while McCallum was released by Grady and rounded the hosts# keeper only for his cutback to be cleared for a corner, away from the feet of the waiting Souden.At the other end, the Pupils had a new-look combination in defence, with full backs Craig Lamont and Michael McKinlay, and Ross Souden in central defence partnered by -year-old debutant Antonio Akoulli, studying in Scotland and hailing from Thessaloniki, Greece.The four had to be alert to the efforts of St Peter#s wingers Menzies and Lewis on either flank, and did so very well for the opening  minutes until a lapse in concentration saw Scott Lewis – signed from fellow WoSFL side Benburb FC for a transfer fee – ghost along the edge of the box and slot home a fine finish across keeper Alasdair Ferguson with his weaker left foot, into the young keeper’s bottom left-hand corner to make it -.Impressively, the Pupils rebounded from this setback and scored with  minutes played when Liam Renton, playing as an attacking midfielder, latched onto a ball from Scott Souden just inside the hosts# box, and turned his marker sharply before guiding a left-footed shot beyond the keeper#s grasp.All the while, the Pupils# deep-lying midfield pairing – a real contrast of experience levels between skipper Keith Mitchell, and Conner Brown beside him making his club debut – continued to break up play and keep the Feathers Inn-sponsored side moving forward.Despite this, there was a further scare in the visitors# penalty area when St Peter#s hit the bar from a powerful volleyed shot on the stroke of half time, but the Pupils# lead remained intact.Into the second half, though, the Pupils were pegged back in the opening few minutes of proceedings, a clever turn and precise shot beyond the grasp of Ferguson providing a fine equaliser.Admirably from a Pupils point of view, there was no onslaught from the ision#s third-placed team, also boasting a loan signing from Greenock FC, another semi-professional side, in their midfield ranks, and smatterings of semi-pro experience across their starting .However, what followed instead was a gradual build-up of pressure which the Pupils had to work increasingly hard to contain, the home side#s willing forwards continuing to probe for openings in the visitors# defence.The hard-working pair of Matthew Lang and Calum Houston were introduced in attack for the Pupils with  minutes remaining, with fresh legs required as the embattled visitors# energy levels began to wane.But even the dismissal of Lewis for the hosts, hitting out at Renton in reaction to a robust tackle from the latter, which earned the Pupils man a booking, couldn#t deny the Paisley side a late, late winner, a long ball going undefended in the Pupils ranks, and slotted home in the box by a St Peter#s midfielder to give them all three points, and in turn deny the Pupils a probably deserved draw.The Pupils# management team conveyed thanks to the travelling players for their efforts, even in defeat, and will surely take consolation from giving experience to young talent in the side, with four club debuts made in the space of week – after -year-old Andrew Renton#s appearance against Rossvale on cup duty – and within that clutch, a potentially very useful defensive addition.Tomorrow , the Pupils are at home to Glenvale FC, from Paisley, again on league duty, with kick off at pm.For more information, visit @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"leader october 29 2021","story":"More must be done to prevent the continued spate of

Photographs from the early days up to  are from the collections of the late Robert Grieves and from John Sinclair, two indefatigable photographers whose material is of national Scottish importance. This week#s article is the conclusion.West Coast#s business portfolio now extends well beyond Kintyre.In , it bought the Glasgow Citybus concern which operates on the north side of the Clyde.Two years on, it also picked up a city tour business which is now operated under the City Sightseeing franchise in Glasgow.It also operates the inter-rail station shuttle in the city.An interesting ersication in  was what became a fast passenger ferry link from Campbeltown to Ballycastle while a few years further on, Fairline Coaches, based near the company#s Glasgow Citybus depot in Whiteinch, Glasgow, was absorbed into West Coast.The company also won the contract to operate Citylink#s new Glasgow-Edinburgh Airport service and additionally, partnered Fort William-based Shiel Buses on Citylink#s Glasgow-Fort William and Skye services.Perhaps the biggest and most signicant recent extension of West Coast#s business came with the creation of Borders Buses.

Firstly, I wish to acknowledge and applaud the drive and foresight of the Craig family in building the business from its original heartland in the southernmost area of Argyll.Public transport is full of challenges whether air, sea, rail or road and, as in every field of business le, there are never any guarantees of success.Once any business reaches a successful position, it often requires even more effort to maintain it there, let alone continue to grow it in size and influence.The presence of Covid since  has, of course, created major dficulties for every business virtually across the board.Finally, a word of praise for the staff and especially for those who are engaged on the vital long-distance links, particularly the Campbeltown, Oban and Skye services.These routes are not only amongst the most weather prone in Scotland, they operate almost exclusively over ordinary trunk roads, iniably convoluted in nature and of borderline width for the safe transit of long vehicles.A driver myself, though never on any of these routes, I#m familiar with all these roads and have some perception of the extreme challenges drivers frequently face.To them, and to all the company#s staff and management, I, and I#m sure many readers who are users of the services West Coast Motors provide across Argyll and in other parts of Scotland, offer grateful thanks."},{"url":null,"title":"muddy good rugby festival at taynuilt","story":"More than  players from Campbeltown, Lochgilphead, Oban, Fort William, Mull and Taynuilt took part with some fantastic rugby on display across all the age groups from the Micro P-Ps to the P s.Conditions were damp under foot given the amount of rain that has been falling lately.

As of this evening  pupils have been confirmed as COVID-positive, along with five members of staff. A further four members of staff have recorded positive lateral flow test results.As a result, the nursery has been forced to close entirely, while four primary classes will remain home.The classes to close from Monday to Wednesday are: PM, PE. Classes PE and PM are to close on Monday only at this time. Online learning will be offered to affected pupils.According to a statement released by OIC, this evening, the situation will remain under daily review andthe position changes, parents and staff will be updated.The remainder of classes at Papdale Primary School will be open on Monday as usual.James Wylie, OIC’s executive director of education, leisure and housing said: “Staff have been working tirelessly over the last week to try and ensure Papdale Primary and Nursery were able to remain open in full, however, this has now reached the point where it is simply no longer possible. There are several factors for this including staff reporting positive PCR test results, being contact traced by Public Health, and the supply teaching staff list having been exhausted.“We realise that this may cause childcare issues for working parents and that is partly why we will keep the closures to an absolute minimum and monitor and manage the situation on a daily basis, ensuring that the settings are able to reopen once it is safe to do so with the appropriate staffing levels in place. It is also vital that we keep our educational facilities open whenever possible for the learning of our children, who have already missed out on so much these past  months of the pandemic.“I, again, take this opportunity to thank our staff, parents and pupils for the way in which we all continue to manage these situations, which are challenging for everyone.

Today,  pupils who were able to attend school did so, while  were provided online learning from home. A further  pupils were absent from school for a iety of reasons. Some remained at home due to developing COVID, or for self-isolation purposes, while others were kept home by parents due to concerns over the current situation.Orkney Islands Council has confirmed this evening that four classes will not be ing to school until at least Thursday. These are PM, PE and PE and PM.Papdale Nursery is also closed in full until the same date due to all staff having been contact traced.Authorities have said that the situation is being kept under constant review by NHS Orkney Public Health and OIC and daily updates are being provided to parents, staff and the wider community via the head teachers and communications on the council website and social media, and local media outlets.Online learning to those pupils having to remain at home is being provided by the school.OIC executive director of education, leisure and housing, James Wylie, said: “The situation at Papdale is changing at pace and I must commend the Head Teacher and her staff for doing all they can to ensure learning continues for pupils whether that is in class or remotely during these extenuating circumstances. My same thanks must go to the Nursery manager and colleagues for also going the extra mile to work through the challenges.“Orkney has been very lucky up to this stage with comparatively low numbers of COVID-, however we are all now facing a very dferent picture – the waves which have hit other areas are now on our shores. I must also praise parents who have, on the whole, been very supportive of the staff at Papdale and recognise the tremendous efforts they have been putting in to try and follow the Public Health guidance and ensure the most appropriate and safe plans are in place.“As already said, we continue to meet with Public Health, Environmental Health, Safety and Resilience and Education staff to evaluate the present situation to influence the next steps. As a result of staffing issues due to COVID we have no alternative but to keep the P classes closed for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. We will update all parents as soon as possiblethis position changes and further closures are required.“We do understand that there are dfering opinions on this some parents are anxious about sending their child to school where there have been positive cases and there are others who feel that given the enhanced mitigating measures in place, that routines and learning should continue whenever possible.  What we must do as educators is look to the advice and guidance of Public Health and collectively, in a multi-agency way, find the balance.“I joined an Environmental Health colleague from the Council, along with the Head Teacher,  this morningon a walk through the school to evaluate the mitigations in place. For all those that may be concerned Environmental Health are confident that appropriate measures are being taken.“There is no doubt that the virus is not going to disappear in the near future so we must adapt as best we can. Our children deserve an education and that is what we will strive to provide.

I sense every step of that journey.In , Borrodale school closed for that last time. And yet,we listen, we can still hear from Borrodale, forever young and in timeless cèilidh.Put in this kind of context we can sense how community relationships are deeply connected to change. The continuity of change, both backwards and forwards, gives us insight, and proximity with dferent and creative ways of being in place.Times change and culture continues. It is important to be hopeful in this and to not perceive the shadows of the past as a fading le force but as an index pointing to future relationships.The second social experience is of course relates to the typical excitement of guising at Oidhche Shamhna. Originally, Oidhche Shamhna was integral toour sense of place and the cultural relationships of le cycles, including time itself.Oidhche Shamhna is ‘the night of summer’s end,’ and in our older understanding of the festival, it reveals that new le begins in darkness and is born into light similarly, just as days used to begin and end at dusk, the move to the darker half of the year is also the continuation of a cycle and is equally about new beginnings.In the deeper memory of Gaelic cosmology, this is the beginning of the new year, and of course, November is still called ‘an t-Samhain’ in Gàidhlig.My earliest memories of guising would be like those of many, our dad taking my sister and I for a few easy visits to long-standing neighbours and family friends. Even though we would only go to a few houses in those early days, the intensity and excitement of the initiation on a cold dark night was largely experienced through the warmth and kindness revealed in the relationships that emerged in the evening.Guising, then, is a form of cèilidh, where the encouraging and nurturing of the gt of exchange is more intangible than we always appreciate. It is that dimension of sustaining or developing relationships that seems most important to me.One of the first homes we would have visited on my first Oidhche Shamhna will have been that of Angus and Effie Ross in Fàsach. In my early years it was a home that we probably had more time in than any house outside of my family.It was a home I visited everyday day walking home from Borrodale school. My errand was to collect our newspapers from the post office, but it wasn’t a job, it was a relationship.Our family had a strong connection with these Rosses. In , Angus Ross’ great-uncle Alexander Ross had been nominated to deliver the prepared statement for the Fàsach croftersto the Napier Commission.In it he testied specically to the clearance of my great-great-grandfather from Ramasaig , who was removed along with all the families from Ramasaig around -, to make way for sheep, congesting further the land in Fàsach. So, it is from at least that time that our family had been friends.Alexander Ross’s brother, Kenneth Ross, also Fàsach, had among his eight children a first son called Neil and a second called Norman, both being young boys during the land wars....I did know Margaret but I never did met James Ross as he had a fatal accident in the early s in Glasgow, outside the BBC.Angus Ross and Seanair worked together on the County lorry . We saw Angus and Effie a lot and my mum credits him with telling her and her siblings about their Cameron origin story in Glendale.A mysterious tale of a man with long grey hair and a beard living in a cave at Scornandaoine on the east side of Loch Poolteil. He had arrived from Lochaber, in the mid to later s, likely a refugee from any number of social problems in the Gàidhealtachd of that time.Even now it still sounds like a good Halloween story. Certainly, my mum has never been a fan of beards in the family, but we were always welcomed by the Rosses in the ceilidh ethic of everyday relationships., Tobraichean a’ Gluasad .Here, ‘Tuam’ talks about his knowledge of local wells the necessity to move between dferent wells for sustenance, and so there will be times when a well in one place becomes dry while water would be plentul in another well.A resource such as Tobar an Dualchais helps us think about our many and ied relationships with culture, place, and time.Part of the intangible gt to be found within the archives, and also with the people and places around us, is how the wells of culture will be found popping up with all their potential, anywhere and everywhere, carried through the voices and relationships we nurture and come to know.Importantly, this can activate new dialogues, experiences, and gestures of cèilidh, and to embrace these for all in our communities, our futures, wherever the wells emerge."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20211103_133201-scaled.jpg","title":"climate action group to hold skye bridge march and vigil in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, which formed shortly before the pandemic, is inviting people to show their solidarity with activists across the world in highlighting the need for urgent change to tackle the existential threat of climate change.Speaking to the Free Press during the first week of the COP UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Skye Climate Action coordinator Anne MacLennan described the summit as “critically important” and was keen to emphasise that Saturday’s event should take place in a peaceful and respectable manner.#Saturday is the Global Day of Action for Climate Justice, and the themes are that we need to act, and act urgently, and there is also the huge justice issue,# she said.“The idea for the march is for us to leave the Kyleakin-end at  noon and to walk over the bridge by the pavements and walk back again.#It is really important that the event is peaceful, family-friendly, and respectful of everyone # I think it is a demonstration of the kind of society we want to head towards being, so we can live in a sustainable and equitable way. Issues of climate, bioersity, equity are all interconnected.She added: “I think it is more powerfulit is a peaceful walk.#Giving her views on the progress being made at the COP, she added: “There are some really hard-hitting things being said, so I hope the issues are getting through to people. It is important that those who are convincedcan demonstrate.#Addressing the potential for far-reaching consequences to impact people across the world, she said: #We are cushioned now to some extent, although people in the UK have had to suffer from flooding, wildfires, and drought.“Much of our food comes from overseas, andpeople will have to migrate and find somewhere  to live # so people will be moving around the world, so places that are nice and comfortable now might then receive other people.#A huge element of this issue is about all the youngsters and children # the more carbon we put into the atmosphere, the more trouble that they will have to face, meaning there will be less chance for them to turn the situation around.#This issue is critically important.”On Friday th November, as the conference is expected to be closing, there will be a candlelight vigil in Somerled Square in Portree from .-pm.Ms MacLennan added: “There is a sense that people want to show solidarity with what#s happening at COP in Glasgow, and they want to be able to express their concerns.#Holding it in Portree makes it more accessible for people in the north of the island, because Saturday#s march over the bridge is a long way for people further north to travel to be involved, especiallyit is a dreadful day.#For those unable to attend Saturday#s march over the bridge, everyone is of course welcome to walk over the bridge with signage at any point at the weekend.“It might be good for people to be wandering over the bridge to and fro at dferent times to help convey the message.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Uist-beach-Floraidh-Forrest.jpg","title":"climate change and the hebrides the rising sea and an eerily prophetic","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineFor those acquainted with Gaelic oral lore, it cannot be denied that there is something intensely perceptive, and eerily prophetic, about the traditions tied to the steady ingress of the sea.Since time immemorial, the mental record-keeping of a coastal people has documented and predicted the near imperceptible, yet near constant, rise of the waters since the Ice Age. century.In Tobar an Dualchais, there are numerous recordings illustrating similar examples where the sea has conquered the land.In one example from , Dòmhnall MacCuinn and Dòmhnall Ailean MacCuinn were recorded describing old domestic ruins seen at extreme low tides over a mile from the shore in An t-Ìochdar .These homesteads must have once been on dry land, they surmise.In Tracks   , the collector Dòmhnall Eairdsidh Dòmhnallach of the School of Scottish Studies asks Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson about submerged places near An t-Ìochdar, including Sgeir na h-Àtha – The Skerry of the Barn.Similar shore names which incorporate terrestrial features dot the seascape of Uist and evidence the widely held belief that the machair once stretched much further into the west.Anxieties tied to coastal le were not only informed by past experience and day-to-day observation they also manested themselves in people’s visions of the future.There is a prophecy, for example, retold by Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson in Track . It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4193378.jpg--.jpg?1635492771000\n","title":"frightful fun for all at hallowena 2021","story":"THE People’s Park, Ballymena will host one of the scariest nights of the year on Friday, October , from pm to .pm.The free event, organised by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, will thrill and chill with a packed programme of spooktacular activities for your little monsters to enjoy, with a huge walking dragon, fire juggling display, a fancy dress competition, a kiddies funfair, live music from The VIPs and a spooky illumination trail.You can sink your fangs into some sweet treats or tasty hot food to beat those Halloween hunger pangs, while the fun and festivities will finish with a fangtastic fireworks finale at .pm.Why not have your own #MEAdventure in the park  Outdoor areas including the brand new play equipment will be accessible during the event and there will be a free kiddies fun fair to entertain your little terrors.Wandering ghouls and spine tingling figures will be ready to spook you at every turn with a few hair-raising special additions.Follow the extended spooky illumination trail throughout the park and bump into some familiar characters along the way!Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, encouraged everyone to join in the Hallowena fun: “It is a great delight for us to be able to safely welcome our community to events this year and the Hallowena celebrations are always among the most popular on Council’s entertainment programme.“There is literally something for ghosts and goblins of all ages to enjoy on Friday  October in the stunning People’s Park in Ballymena, and I am really excited about the evening.“I am privileged to welcome everyone in our community to the park for some spooktacular fun, and I encourage those attending to observe the necessary public health guidelines so that we can protect ourselves and those around us.”There are over  off-street car park spaces within a -minute walk of People’s Park so make an evening of it with a visit to any of the fantastic shops or restaurants in the town.Parking for blue badge holders is available from pm at the People’s Park council car park off the Ballymoney Road.To help with a safe set-up of the site People’s Park will be closed to all members of the public on Friday  October until the event starts at pm.For everyone’s safety dogs, alcohol or fireworks are not permitted in the park and under s must have a responsible adult with them.Admission is free and no tickets are required.Visitors to the Hallowena event are asked to use the hand sanitisers provided and observe social distancing.

Credit: PAPA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueAustin Currie. Credit: PANovember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailAustin Currie was a good friend of mine since we were honours history students together at Queen’s University in the early Sixties.Austin, like me, came from a working background, and the opportunity to earn a degree opened a door to careers which were not possible to previous generations from the rural outposts like Tyrone and south Armagh.Austin from the very start had great personal charm and a warm friendliness. We came from nationalist and unionist communities, but these dferences did not matter in those innocent days when it seemed that the violence which had plagued the province in the s would never . How wrong we were.In our small history tutorials at Queen’s, Austin was never lost for a word, but like me he could have done more homework. I recall one session on American history when the tutor asked him to speak about the economic decline of the West Indian sugar plantations.Instead, Austin launched into an eloquent dissertation about the Irish potato famine, until the tutor interrupted him and said, “You are not answering my question”, to which Austin replied: “I am answering my own question.” I thought even then that Currie had some of the right qualications to be a politician. After Queen’s we went our separate ways — he to politics, and me to journalism — but we never lost respect or regard for one another. I admired his integrity, his courage and his vision as he fought for justice. He trod a dficult and sometimes dangerous path, but he was totally supported by his lovely we Annita who had great courage also, and by their beloved children.Austin’s civil rights and political trail-blazing has been somewhat underestimated in the shadow of John Hume and others, but he was a political Titan in his own right.Signicantly the heartfelt tributes have come from across the political and community ide, and notably from the Church of Ireland Primate Archbishop John McDowell, who shrewdly pointed out that “his whole political career was founded on a desire for justice and peace... his contribution deserves as an example to be remembered”.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Austin Currie was a credit to his old university and his tutors, to his family and friends, and to his native province, people and island.

Photo: Getty Images Cavan Images RFClaire McNeillyTwitterEmailNovember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailWhen you can’t switch providers, what can you doyou’re a gas customer seeking a cheaper way of heating your home The good news is that cheaper, efficient options are available. The bad news, however, is that the initial upfront costs can be hefty — but government grants are accessible in most cases to help ease the financial burden.Here are five other — and in the long term, occasionally less expensive — ways to heat your home during the winter months...  Read MoreFurther gas price hikes can’t be ruled out, Firmus Energy chief warns after costs double in yearSTORAGE HEATERS: Older storage heaters may be inefficient but newer models are much better, so buying a new one could be a great way to save energy, while lowering bills. As they’re powered by electricity, they charge overnight using off-peakenergy, which can then be used during the following day. These will save you even more moneyyou’re on a time-of-use electricity tarf, such as Economy , which means you pay a cheaper rate for energy overnight . AIR SOURCE HEAT PUMPS: If you’re looking for a greener alternative to a boiler, air source heat pumps could be worth consideration. They work by absorbing heat from the air outside, using it to heat your home and give you hot water. Although they require an upfront cost, they can offer great benefits in the long run. They’re powered by air — which is obviously a renewable energy source — rather than fossil fuels, and they can save you money on your bills. Installation costs are understood to range from £, to £,, so the advice is to shop around.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up  GROUND SOURCE HEAT PUMPS: Ground source heat pumps are similar to their air source relatives and they represent another alternative to a traditional boiler. They draw heat from the environment surrounding the house, usually via pipes buried in the garden, which draw heat from the ground. They circulate a mixture of water and antreeze around a loop of pipe, absorbing heat from the ground into the fluid, which is then passed into a heat exchanger in the pump. Like air source heat pumps, they also require an upfront cost — but they can reap rewards in your carbon use and energy bills. Installation costs range from £, to £, so, again, get a few quotes before deciding. HYBRID HEAT PUMPS: A hybrid heat pump system combines a traditional boiler with an air source heat pump. It automatically switches between the two, to give you the best energy efficiency. Householders may find that this is a good stepping stone from a traditional system to a more environmentally-friendly one. SOLAR THERMAL PANELS: Most people have heard of solar  — but there are also special solar thermal  especially for turning sunlight into heat. Solar thermal systems use free heat from the sun to warm hot water. They’re even more efficient than traditional solar , as heat waves carry more energy than sunlight. Also, there’s no transformation process needed to turn that energy into electricity. On average, a solar thermal system creates as much as % of your hot water, and can help you save up to  kg of carbon emissions annually.For details of energy saving grants in your area, visit the NI Direct website to see what’s available. You can also access information on the Boiler Replacement Scheme in Northern Ireland as well as details of the grants and discounts availableyou want to generate your own energy.

Marie lost her mum to the horrible disease and planned to walk  walks to raise funds to support families and those with the condition locally. googletag.cmd.push Marie is about to embark on walk number  as she gets closer to her goal. Maries fundraiserhas already raised nearly pound for Alzheimers Society. Marie said: “For any of you that know me, you will be aware that I lost my lovely wee mammy in February . “Her name was Elizabeth Diamond, known as Bertha to her friends and family. My mum had Alzheimer’s disease. She was so loving and caring to everyone, decent, kind and loved a bit of craic. She lived independently with my dad in her bungalow. “However, over a number of years, this horrible disease took everything away from the person I loved. I have to admit I used to think that Alzheimer’s was memory loss and how wrong I was. “In the early stages, mum would forget dates and words and recall short-term events. She would repeat her stories quite a lot. Then it progressed to dficulty in piecing together what she wanted to say or to follow others in conversation, she lost the ability to cook and needed more and more care. “She could remember events from a long time ago when she was younger. We then experienced mood swings, sometimes irritation over the slightest things and sometimes withdrawn. In the end times, she couldn’t remember eating, food was hot and then cold or unfamiliar to her, she would have dficulty swallowing and worst of all repeating pleas for help. “My dad passed away in May  and sometimes she remembered he was gone and other times not. It was just awful but I am grateful that she knew me till the end. “I really wanted to do something positive for those suffering from this condition and for their families. So, I am doing  walks for Dementia. Why   Because that was the age my mum was when she died so one walk for each year of her le. “Mum didn’t walk herself but she lived in both the Cityside and Waterside of Derry. I’m going to walk the two bridges-Craigavon and Foyle- because it captures the city, it’s a nice walk of seven miles with lovely scenery. “I’m no athlete and whilst this would be easy for others it’s a challenge for me.  walks at seven miles per walk is  miles. However, I also want  partners to walk with me. “They can do the walk for someone they love that is or has suffered from dementia, they can do it for charity or just to support me. I’m not tied to it being the bridges, I’m also open to doing a walk that means something to my partner on the day.” For every walk, Marie will donate pound which gives a starting total of pound for the charity. “As I said, I’m definitely not an athlete but I want to do two-three walks a week. This will take me at least six months and I started at the beginning of June. “I’m conscious of some holiday time and hopefully not butany injury means I need to cut back a bit my goal is to have it all completed before my mum’s second anniversary, in February .” If you want to join Marie on her walk, either inidually, as a group or as a relay team, contact Maire via the fundraiser Facebook page:https:www.facebook WalksForDementia  To donate, go to:https:www.justgiving fundraising -walks-for-dementiaADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man told police he had arrived at address on a UFO overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a -year-old man following a drugs seizure in Derry this morningLocal NewsArrest made in drugs bust following Police raid on Derry properties overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSoftware engineer ran from police covered in mud after crashing through hedge overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sinn Feacutein MLAs Paacutedraig Delargy and Conor Murphy visit the new development site in Creggan, DerryDerry NewsNew development of  affordable houses and communityfacilitiesunderway inCreggan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SDLP Councillor, Brian Tierney said: Our schools are places of learning and we cannot allow students to be subjected to behaviour of this kind from anybody.Local NewsCllr Tierney blasts Covid- deniers after protest outside school overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Slaughtneil launch a hopeful ball into the Lavey box during the closing moments.

The concept has been created by Henderson Retail to offer shoppers even more choice from their popular food-to-go counters. Mark McCammond, retail director at Henderson Group, said the store represented all that was great and good about the local area. He added: “The people of the Waterside area are what makes it, and the local links for the new EUROSPAR Rossdowney store are second to none. “Not only do we have a team that has served the local community for decades, but we also have extensive ranges of products sourced from local suppliers which keep our food miles down. “We have researched the local shopper demographic extensively, so this store has been built with what they’re looking for directly in mind – fresh, locally produced ingredients for tonight’s tea, and on-site options, made fresh in-store for now.” Store manager, Keith Wilson, has been in charge throughout the build, and said the addition of  parking spaces, a two-pump MAXOL forecourt featuring regular grades and new % carbon offset Premium fuel grades, and a host of additional services on site made it the most convenient site in town. He added: “Shoppers can expect a wide range of services in-store including the Post Office and the extended range of products available from the butchery counter, alongside the first ever Nourish deli counter and all-new Barista Bar coffee, now serving flat whites and luxury hot chocolate and all the Barista coffee favourites. “Local is at the heart of everything we do, from our North West supplier roster which features Limavady’s Milgro and Broighter Gold, Derry’s Doherty Meats, Bonds Potatoes and McDaid’s Bakery alongside Coleraine’s Scott’s Crispy Onions and our top-class butchery serve over from Higgins Family Butchers in Castlerock. “We also have The CHEF range of home-cooked, pre-prepared meals which have recently been awarded Great Taste Awards. Our staff are all friendly faces, well-known and trusted in the area and our shoppers know they will be getting the best range, choice and value in-store.”  Bernie Friars, Lesley Ann Curry, Joyce Logan-Wilson, Grainne McLaughlin, Tina McElhinney, who have over  years of EUROSPAR experience between them, declare the all-new EUROSPAR Rossdowney officially open.  Over , big brand products have been price matched to Tesco, bringing even more value at a local level. Keith continued “We were delighted to have Foyle Search and Rescue on site for our opening day where we held bucket collections for the vital work they do locally. Throughout the year, we will raise money for the NI Children’s Hospice, EUROSPAR’s charity partner Cancer Fund for Children, and the Jack  Jill Foundation. Our community outreach work is extremely important we have donated sanitising stations to the local Dale View Nursing Home, and we’ll continue to support the team at Arc Fitness who do important work around mental wellbeing and addiction. “It’s very important for us to be a hub of the local community and we look forward to supporting all these organisations and more in the future.” EUROSPAR Rossdowney is open daily, .am – midnight and more information can be found viaEUROSPAR NI online.

Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man told police he had arrived at address on a UFO overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a -year-old man following a drugs seizure in Derry this morningLocal NewsArrest made in drugs bust following Police raid on Derry properties overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSoftware engineer ran from police covered in mud after crashing through hedge overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sinn Feacutein MLAs Paacutedraig Delargy and Conor Murphy visit the new development site in Creggan, DerryDerry NewsNew development of  affordable houses and communityfacilitiesunderway inCreggan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SDLP Councillor, Brian Tierney said: Our schools are places of learning and we cannot allow students to be subjected to behaviour of this kind from anybody.Local NewsCllr Tierney blasts Covid- deniers after protest outside school overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Slaughtneil launch a hopeful ball into the Lavey box during the closing moments.

Cllr Duffy, who represents the Ballyarnett ward, has long been involved in helping to make the road safe. Back in September, Cllr Duffy successfully lobbied for a pedestrian crossing to be installed on the Skeoge Road to help ensure that residents wouldnt have to risk being knocked down by speeding motorists in order to get across safely. googletag.cmd.push Cllr Duffy, who has also contacted the Council requesting that the main roundabout there be planted out with flowers and vegetation, said the repaired railings would not only be a safety measure for residents but that the restored frames will remove the eyesore that were the damaged ones. She said “I very much welcome the news that the Department for Infrastructurehas installed new safety railings at the Skeoge Road. “Anyone travelling up or down this road on a daily basis would have seen a number of badly damaged railings and crash barriers. “I have been liaising with DFI now for months in an effort to get these fixed not only as a safety measure for motorists and pedestrians, but they were also an eyesore on a busy route entering our city and linking into Donegal. “I am also waiting on an update from the Council regarding having the roundabout there being planted outwith flowers and vegetation to make it more attractive. “In the times ahead I will continue to pursue road safety issues in this area as a priority.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man told police he had arrived at address on a UFO overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a -year-old man following a drugs seizure in Derry this morningLocal NewsArrest made in drugs bust following Police raid on Derry properties overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSoftware engineer ran from police covered in mud after crashing through hedge overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sinn Feacutein MLAs Paacutedraig Delargy and Conor Murphy visit the new development site in Creggan, DerryDerry NewsNew development of  affordable houses and communityfacilitiesunderway inCreggan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SDLP Councillor, Brian Tierney said: Our schools are places of learning and we cannot allow students to be subjected to behaviour of this kind from anybody.Local NewsCllr Tierney blasts Covid- deniers after protest outside school overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Slaughtneil launch a hopeful ball into the Lavey box during the closing moments.

A quarterly report from Ulster Universitys House Price Index show property price rises in the council area of Derry City  Strabane District leaping from an average of pound, in the previous quarter to pound, – a jump of . per cent. googletag.cmd.push The hike is signicantly higher than any other council area in the North with the next highest rise being in Fermanagh  Omagh with . per cent. Ards  North Downs prices rose by . per cent with Belfast only having a small rise of . per cent. The Ulster University research, which has been produced in partnership with the Northern Ireland Housing Executive and Progressive Building Society, analyses the performance of the Northern Ireland housing market during the third quarter of  . The report is premised upon , transactions and reveals an overall average house price of pound, which represents a weighted annual level of growth of . per cent between the third quarters of  and  respectively. Where quarterly movements are concerned, the Index displays an increase of . per cent relative to the second quarter of . This growth remains driven by increases within the semi-detached and detached segments of the market over the quarter. Lead Researcher, Dr Michael McCord, Reader in Real Estate, Ulster University said: “The main findings of this survey indicate a market which continues to exhibit increased trading up activity and price acceleration as a consequence of strong levels of market demand coupled with supply inelasticity. “Entering into , the market displayed strong resilience, with consecutive-quarter price inflation evident, driven by high demand and optimism. “This buoyancy has continued within this quarter, with notable structural market dynamics and challenges starting to emerge, particularly in relation to the lack of housing supply. “This, compounded with the volatile economic setting posed by the precarious inflationary environment, poses some challenges ahead for the housing market.” Ursula McAnulty, Head of Research at the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, which commissions the survey, added: “The latest figures produced by Ulster University confirm the ongoing strong demand in the residential housing market during the third quarter. “The number of transactions in the sample remained well above average, and average prices continued to rise as a result. “In what is traditionally a quieter period for the housing market, that effect may ease in the final quarter of the year, but there is still some expectation of ongoing demand and price growth. “However, as the cost of living increases, the situation for both prospective and existing borrowers may become more challenging as we look ahead into .” The figures for Derry will raise a eyebrow given the widening gap between home owners in the city and those still on waiting lists for social housing. Last month, Derry City  Strabane District Council passed SDLP councillor Lilian Seenoi-Barrs motion calling for council to write to the Joint First Ministers calling on them to publish a programme for government, which includes a housing strategy.  Cllr Lillian Seenoi-Barr of the SDLP At the time, Cllr Seenoi-Barr said: “Issues around accessing housing in Derry and Strabane stretch back decades and the whole of Northern Ireland is currently in the midst of a severe housing crisis. “People are currently struggling to access social housing, prices in the rental market are spiralling out of control and many young people are unable to save a deposit to get themselves on the housing ladder. “These problems are acutely felt in Derry and Strabane which has high numbers of people presenting as homeless, on social housing waiting lists and experiencing housing stress. We simply don’t have the housing required to meet demand. “I’m glad my fellow councillors backed my motion on this important issue. We need to see a programme for government from our Joint First Ministers which prioritises housing. “Everyone has a right to a home they can be proud of and they are currently being let down by those responsible for our housing crisis.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man told police he had arrived at address on a UFO overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a -year-old man following a drugs seizure in Derry this morningLocal NewsArrest made in drugs bust following Police raid on Derry properties overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSoftware engineer ran from police covered in mud after crashing through hedge overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sinn Feacutein MLAs Paacutedraig Delargy and Conor Murphy visit the new development site in Creggan, DerryDerry NewsNew development of  affordable houses and communityfacilitiesunderway inCreggan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SDLP Councillor, Brian Tierney said: Our schools are places of learning and we cannot allow students to be subjected to behaviour of this kind from anybody.Local NewsCllr Tierney blasts Covid- deniers after protest outside school overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Slaughtneil launch a hopeful ball into the Lavey box during the closing moments.

Dr David Dobbin, Chairman of Firmus energy, said: “We very much regret having to increase our tarf however steep increases in global wholesale gas prices have forced our hand. “This is a not a Firmus issue, but a challenge faced by every local and national supplier of gas and electricity all of whom, sooner or later, will have to further increase their prices to meet the huge upsurges which have taken place in wholesale energy costs. “We know this is an unwelcome increase which will have a disproportionate effect on those of our customers who are the most vulnerable. “We have been consulting with key stakeholders and will be introducing a support scheme to be delivered through a local charity which will offer targeted help to those most in need, especially over the winter period. “The scheme will be launched in the coming weeks and will go live around the same time as the increase we announced today takes effect.

Earlier this month Mr Durkan contacted both the Department for Infrastructure and the Magee College campus of Ulster University to address the problems. The department confirmed that traffic attendants will be deployed to the area and work is ongoing to extend parkin at the former Foyle College pitch area. googletag.cmd.push Mr Durkan said: “The saga of inconsiderate often dangerous parking along the Duncreggan Road has been a bugbear for many over the years and is an issue which I’ve pushed to resolve. “The area in the vicinity of Magee University is a direct route into the city centre and is extremely busy throughout the week. “Both university staff and students regularly use the Duncreggan Road for parking. However, it is clear that parking is causing a great deal of disruption for residents, motorists and pedestrians alike. “Residents have complained that some iniduals parking in the area often block the entrance to their driveways, preventing them from leaving their homes. “In addition, this is a long established residential area with a majority of elderly residents health and safety concerns have been raised that the area is completely inaccessible for emergency services during the day. “I’m pleased that steps are now being taken by the department to employ more traffic wardens to the area and that Magee are working to extend parking provision in the area. I have also asked Roads Service to consider implementing additional measures, including double yellow lines.” A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: “Occupancy figures for theCampus car park show that there has only been one day since term began that the University’s car park has been over subscribed. We are aware that some iniduals choose to park irresponsibly in the area, and we have recently advised all staff and students to park legally and considerately and reiterated that parking permits are available to provide them with an affordable means to park conveniently and safely on campus. We have recently increased car parking capacity and we also continue to work closely with the Council, PSNI and local Residents Association and we understand that they are communicating considerate parking messages to the general public who may also park in the area to travel to work.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man told police he had arrived at address on a UFO overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a -year-old man following a drugs seizure in Derry this morningLocal NewsArrest made in drugs bust following Police raid on Derry properties overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSoftware engineer ran from police covered in mud after crashing through hedge overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sinn Feacutein MLAs Paacutedraig Delargy and Conor Murphy visit the new development site in Creggan, DerryDerry NewsNew development of  affordable houses and communityfacilitiesunderway inCreggan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SDLP Councillor, Brian Tierney said: Our schools are places of learning and we cannot allow students to be subjected to behaviour of this kind from anybody.Local NewsCllr Tierney blasts Covid- deniers after protest outside school overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Slaughtneil launch a hopeful ball into the Lavey box during the closing moments.

More than  universities in the UK were balloted by the University  College Union  with . per cent of Ulster Universitys UCU members voting for strike action. In a separate ballot askingmembers would be in favour of industrial action other than walking out on strike, . per cent of Ulster Universitys union members voted a resounding yes. googletag.cmd.push Queens University in Belfast saw resounding majorities for both ballots as well with the national UK average for all UCU members being . per cent in favour of strike action with . per cent in favour of action other than a walkout. The dispute is over pay and working conditions. The UCU have demanded a national yearly pay rise of pound for all staff as well as an end to race, gender and disability pay injustice a framework to eliminate zero-hours and other casualised contracts and meaningful action to tackle unmanageable workloads. A date for strike action for the Ulster University campuses at Magee College, Coleraine and Jordanstown has yet to be set as negotiations that may prevent a walkout are expected to take place. Cllr Shaun Harkin said: “University bosses need to take stock of the resounding vote by lecturers and staff for strike action over pay, conditions and pensions. “People Before Profit send our solidarity to lecturers and staff at  universities, including Ulster University and Queens, following their overwhelming declaration for strike action over pay, working conditions and pensions. People Before Profit fully back the UCUs demands. Wages of university staff has fallen  per cent in real terms since . “A recently published report documented a widespread workload and mental health crisis in universities. Nearly a third of staff say they feel emotionally drained from work pressure. “University bosses are acting no dferently from private sector bosses. This is about turning universities and education into factories for profit. A university shouldnt be run like a corporation focused primarily on churning out profit. “Cancellation of classes will be entirely down to the belligerence and arrogance of university bosses and their disregard for workers and students. “Cynical university bosses will look for any opportunity to ide and conquer by pitting students against staff. “It needs to be remembered that university bosses didnt lt a finger to help students or staff during the pandemic. This is why solidarity between lecturers, staff and students is key. “We encourage all students to join and support the newly formed Students Supporting Industrial Action network. Well do everything we can to back the demands of lecturers and staff. “Across every sector of society employers and government are attempting to put the burden of the pandemic onto the shoulders of workers and the least well-off. The most effective way to respond is with people power resistance and solidarity.” UCU general secretary Jo Grady added: “This result is a clear vote of no confidence in the so-called leaders of our universities, with staff telling them in no uncertain terms that they have had enough of pay and working conditions being run into the ground. “UCU members have yet again beaten the Tory anti-union laws. Alongside our pension ballot result, this means we have a big mandate to take strike action, at a time of our choosing. “It is scandalous that university vice-chancellors on overinflated salaries seem to think doing nothing on pay, casualisation and inequality is acceptable in a sector awash with money. “We truly hope that disruption can be avoided, that is what staff and students alike all want. But this is entirely in the gt of employers who simply need to end their attacks on pensions, pay and working conditions and finally demonstrate they value their staff.” Ulster University has been approached for comment.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man told police he had arrived at address on a UFO overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a -year-old man following a drugs seizure in Derry this morningLocal NewsArrest made in drugs bust following Police raid on Derry properties overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSoftware engineer ran from police covered in mud after crashing through hedge overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sinn Feacutein MLAs Paacutedraig Delargy and Conor Murphy visit the new development site in Creggan, DerryDerry NewsNew development of  affordable houses and communityfacilitiesunderway inCreggan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SDLP Councillor, Brian Tierney said: Our schools are places of learning and we cannot allow students to be subjected to behaviour of this kind from anybody.Local NewsCllr Tierney blasts Covid- deniers after protest outside school overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Slaughtneil launch a hopeful ball into the Lavey box during the closing moments.

The charity’s stores in in the city will be delighted to receive any good quality toys, in full working order and complete, as well as good quality winter jumpers, coats and other warm clothes and footwear for children, menswear and ladieswear. googletag.cmd.push In addition to pre-loved quality toys, the charity is also keen to receive donations of unused toys and games, which often prove popular in the run up to Christmas when customers are looking for presents at reasonable prices. Unused toiletries that can be used as gts for teenagers are also popular in Barnardo’s shops, as well as the usual clothing and accessory donations that the charity welcomes all year round. Paula Flood, Area Business Manager for Barnardo’s Retail in Northern Ireland said: “With preparations for Christmas getting underway, this is the time of year many people need to make space for new toys and gts, so we are asking them to keep Barnardo’s in mind and donate any of their good quality pre-loved toys, or clothes, to our charity’s shops. “It’s amazing what people unearth when they start looking in the back of cupboards and at the bottom of the toybox. “It’s a great way to clear out any toys or clothes your children and grandchildren no longer play with or wear, as well as any pre-loved clothes you are not wearing. We’re particularly keen to receive any ‘winter woolly’ type items that we can sell over the coming months. “The donated items will help to raise funds for work carried out to support local children and families who need a little bit of extra help. “We’d like to thank all of our customers and donors for their continued support, which really does make a dference to so many local children’s lives.” Any donations will be received at your local Barnardo’s store at their branches in Shipquay Street and Bishops Street, Derry.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man told police he had arrived at address on a UFO overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a -year-old man following a drugs seizure in Derry this morningLocal NewsArrest made in drugs bust following Police raid on Derry properties overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSoftware engineer ran from police covered in mud after crashing through hedge overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sinn Feacutein MLAs Paacutedraig Delargy and Conor Murphy visit the new development site in Creggan, DerryDerry NewsNew development of  affordable houses and communityfacilitiesunderway inCreggan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SDLP Councillor, Brian Tierney said: Our schools are places of learning and we cannot allow students to be subjected to behaviour of this kind from anybody.Local NewsCllr Tierney blasts Covid- deniers after protest outside school overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Slaughtneil launch a hopeful ball into the Lavey box during the closing moments.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.     Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound. Manus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins. Two versions of the film have been compiled and the BBC will broadcast the -minute ‘short version’ by Perfect Cousin Productions Ltd, in association with the BBC, Arts Council and Irish Film Board.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man told police he had arrived at address on a UFO overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a -year-old man following a drugs seizure in Derry this morningLocal NewsArrest made in drugs bust following Police raid on Derry properties overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSoftware engineer ran from police covered in mud after crashing through hedge overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sinn Feacutein MLAs Paacutedraig Delargy and Conor Murphy visit the new development site in Creggan, DerryDerry NewsNew development of  affordable houses and communityfacilitiesunderway inCreggan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SDLP Councillor, Brian Tierney said: Our schools are places of learning and we cannot allow students to be subjected to behaviour of this kind from anybody.Local NewsCllr Tierney blasts Covid- deniers after protest outside school overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Slaughtneil launch a hopeful ball into the Lavey box during the closing moments.

There can be few arguments that Glen’s maestro is the best footballer in Derry at the present time. googletag.cmd.push His growth into a leader for both club and county, and a player feared and respected in equal measure, has been remarkable. In the final two years ago, McFaul had the ball in his hands as John Joe Cleary blew the final whistle and Magherafelt celebrated beating the Watty’s by the finest of margins. On Sunday evening, McFaul stood on the Celtic Park turf with a very dferent emotion. The demons had been put to bed. A first championship was here. A dream realised. “It’s unbelievable. I remember speaking to you when we beat Slaughtneil in Owenbeg two years ago. I believed we were going to win it that year and we didn’t, we slipped up,” he said. “From that day I had nightmares. It lived with me until we heard that final whistle there and all I can say is what a feeling this is.” Malachy O’Rourke’s men were relentless and ruthless on their way to this year’s showpiece but coming up against neighbours and reigning champions Slaughtneil was always going to be the toughest challenge. “We knew it was going to be a serious battle. You’ve got Paudie Tad, Shane McGuigan, the two McKaigues, Rogers, Patsy – all them boys,” he said. “They have come down the road. We hadn’t been down that road, we hadn’t gotten over the line in a final, and we knew it was going to be a   game, but our talent shone through.  “There’s serious drive in that team. We knew we had done the work with Malachy. Other years we probably peaked too early in the league. “Malachy and Ryancame in and told us we were going to peak in October November and we did just that. We showed our class today. “We deserve it. From we were under ’s, the likes of Enda and Rooster and all them boys believed in us. We knew we had the talent, and we knew it was about sticking together. “I know a boy from Tyrone that said ‘where has this Glen minor team gone ’ but we showed today that we haven’t gone away.” St Eunan’s of Donegal will await in the preliminary round of the Ulster senior club championship. That game won’t be quite on the mind yet as the celebrations continue, but for McFaul the challenge is a welcome one. “We have nothing to lose with Ulster. Some people might say we’re favourites, but we have no right to be favourites,” he said. “On our performance today I think we probably need a wee bit more to get over the line in Ulster, but we’ll worry about that when it comes.”  WATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final  St Mary’s PS Glenview has a number of past pupils involved in Slaughtneil v Glen.

There can be few arguments that Glen’s maestro is the best footballer in Derry at the present time. googletag.cmd.push His growth into a leader for both club and county, and a player feared and respected in equal measure, has been remarkable. In the final two years ago, McFaul had the ball in his hands as John Joe Cleary blew the final whistle and Magherafelt celebrated beating the Watty’s by the finest of margins. On Sunday evening, McFaul stood on the Celtic Park turf with a very dferent emotion. The demons had been put to bed. A first championship was here. A dream realised. “It’s unbelievable. I remember speaking to you when we beat Slaughtneil in Owenbeg two years ago. I believed we were going to win it that year and we didn’t, we slipped up,” he said. “From that day I had nightmares. It lived with me until we heard that final whistle there and all I can say is what a feeling this is.” Malachy O’Rourke’s men were relentless and ruthless on their way to this year’s showpiece but coming up against neighbours and reigning champions Slaughtneil was always going to be the toughest challenge. “We knew it was going to be a serious battle. You’ve got Paudie Tad, Shane McGuigan, the two McKaigues, Rogers, Patsy – all them boys,” he said. “They have come down the road. We hadn’t been down that road, we hadn’t gotten over the line in a final, and we knew it was going to be a   game, but our talent shone through.  “There’s serious drive in that team. We knew we had done the work with Malachy. Other years we probably peaked too early in the league. “Malachy and Ryancame in and told us we were going to peak in October November and we did just that. We showed our class today. “We deserve it. From we were under ’s, the likes of Enda and Rooster and all them boys believed in us. We knew we had the talent, and we knew it was about sticking together. “I know a boy from Tyrone that said ‘where has this Glen minor team gone ’ but we showed today that we haven’t gone away.” St Eunan’s of Donegal will await in the preliminary round of the Ulster senior club championship. That game won’t be quite on the mind yet as the celebrations continue, but for McFaul the challenge is a welcome one. “We have nothing to lose with Ulster. Some people might say we’re favourites, but we have no right to be favourites,” he said. “On our performance today I think we probably need a wee bit more to get over the line in Ulster, but we’ll worry about that when it comes.”  WATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final  St Mary’s PS Glenview has a number of past pupils involved in Slaughtneil v Glen.

Speaking after Sunday’s decider in Celtic Park, midfielder Emmett Bradley also stressed there their focus lay. Their motivation came from within. It was always about the next game, and striving for a better performance. googletag.cmd.push Since coming on the senior club scene ’ or ’ years ago, Bradley remembers the narrative. Could they translate their underage promise into the biggest prize of all  Sunday was their answer. A big fat yes. “We had to work incredibly hard,” said Bradley of their journey. “We knew were up against it and especially today, with Slaughtneil being the dominant force in years. “AsCarville said in the speech, we were just trying to replicate them. They drove us on to keep working and keep chipping away.” The John McLaughlin and Seamus McFerran Cups passed through Maghera on those autumn Sunday nights, on their way to Slaughtneil. Now it’s Glen’s turn.  Hours after speaking to the County Derry Post, Bradley was one of entire senior and reserve squad that was paraded through Maghera main street in the back of goalkeeping coach Pearse McCallan’s lorry. Memories that will last a letime. Bradley hails the squad and how they shirked off any doubt their moment in the limelight would appear. Malachy O’Rourke and Ryan Porters get a generous namecheck for adding ‘a lot’ to Glen’s snowballing juggernaut. The players accepted any challenge put at their feet. Training was hard, yet smart. Every game was taken on its merits and as momentum spiralled to the steps of Celtic Park’s Tommy Mellon stand, Glen shot their way towards a . point average winning game across seven games. “Theboys worked really hard in terms of keeping themselves right. There were very few injuries throughout the year and that meant an awful lot.” “One thing I noticed this year was that the entire team bought in. “Whatever the team needed, anybody was willing to do whatever that was needed to get over the line. “It was fitting that it was Slaughtneil that we beat. As I said, they have been the benchmark.

Speaking after Sunday’s decider in Celtic Park, midfielder Emmett Bradley also stressed there their focus lay. Their motivation came from within. It was always about the next game, and striving for a better performance. googletag.cmd.push Since coming on the senior club scene ’ or ’ years ago, Bradley remembers the narrative. Could they translate their underage promise into the biggest prize of all  Sunday was their answer. A big fat yes. “We had to work incredibly hard,” said Bradley of their journey. “We knew were up against it and especially today, with Slaughtneil being the dominant force in years. “AsCarville said in the speech, we were just trying to replicate them. They drove us on to keep working and keep chipping away.” The John McLaughlin and Seamus McFerran Cups passed through Maghera on those autumn Sunday nights, on their way to Slaughtneil. Now it’s Glen’s turn.  Hours after speaking to the County Derry Post, Bradley was one of entire senior and reserve squad that was paraded through Maghera main street in the back of goalkeeping coach Pearse McCallan’s lorry. Memories that will last a letime. Bradley hails the squad and how they shirked off any doubt their moment in the limelight would appear. Malachy O’Rourke and Ryan Porters get a generous namecheck for adding ‘a lot’ to Glen’s snowballing juggernaut. The players accepted any challenge put at their feet. Training was hard, yet smart. Every game was taken on its merits and as momentum spiralled to the steps of Celtic Park’s Tommy Mellon stand, Glen shot their way towards a . point average winning game across seven games. “Theboys worked really hard in terms of keeping themselves right. There were very few injuries throughout the year and that meant an awful lot.” “One thing I noticed this year was that the entire team bought in. “Whatever the team needed, anybody was willing to do whatever that was needed to get over the line. “It was fitting that it was Slaughtneil that we beat. As I said, they have been the benchmark. It is who we wanted and it was who we needed. “You started to think that yourself that you have not being tested. “There was such a focus on ourselves and how could we perform and who we could improve.

For Malachy O’Rourke, the feeling of winning silverware isn’t quite as foreign. When he took the Glen managerial post, there was only one target in his mind – to repeat the feat he managed  years previous with The Loup. googletag.cmd.push He inherited a side that knew they were close but were reeling from a  final defeat against Magherafelt and then a quarter-final exit last year at the hands of the eventual champions, Slaughtneil. The only word for their campaign leading to Sunday was dominance. But this one was the acid test. Were they now ready to make that last step  “The boys put in serious hard work from the start of the year, and I suppose we all dreamt of a day like this that we could get over the line,” said the former Monaghan manager. “When you see how much it means to so many people, it’s a great feeling. We worked hard all year and the boys really put their shoulder to the wheel. “They were determined thatthey got the chance again that they were going to grab it, and I suppose that’s what they did.” As the championship ticked on, O’Rourke’s men only became more scintillating, free-flowing and relentless. A - to - semi-final victory over The Loup sent the loudest of warning signs. They were gearing up for a battle. “We felt that the boys were going well. They were training hard and they were really focused,” he explained.  “We had a good win in the semi-final but we always felt that there was more and we knew we would have to have more because of the tremendous experience that Slaughtneil have and their ability to win games. We knew we had to put in a big performance. “We started the game very well and I suppose we never let go of that stranglehold we got at the start. It was a great performance and I’m delighted to get through it.” The men in green and gold looked sharp from the get go, holding Slaughtneil to just one point in the opening half. Leading - to - ticking into the final seconds before the break, a lovely move involving Tiarnan Flanagan and Conor Glass was finished off by Danny Tallon to the net. It was the ultimate sucker punch. “Our display in the first half maybe merited being another couple of points in front, but we kicked a couple of wides so that goal gave us that buffer that was crucial at half-time. “I suppose it meant thatwe just kept our heads in the second half and played controlled football then it was always going to be hard for them to get back into it, and that’s how it turned out.” For Glen it may turn out that county championships are like buses – you wait so long for one then suddenly many come along. The age profile of this team and the frightening levels of talent would certainly indicate it. But for their manager, there’s no complacency, be it the upcoming Ulster campaign or the years to come. “Derry football is very strong and you can never look too far ahead. I’m just delighted to get through today and delighted to get the first championship for the club. “A lot will depend on the next couple of weeks and how the boys get on. We’ll not be putting any handbrake on them for the immediate future – we’ll let them enjoy it because that’s a big part of football as well. “We’ll assess things at the end of the week and see how we’re going, but we’ll enjoy this one.”  WATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final  St Mary’s PS Glenview has a number of past pupils involved in Slaughtneil v Glen.

Step up Neil Forester. It was a moment for guts and character, and the Oacuteg’s skipper took on the mantle as he ducked and ed his way through the opposition defence before firing over a superb leveller. googletag.cmd.push With Cahir McMonagle adding a free in added time, the title was sealed. An indescribable moment in time. “You can’t sum it up,” insisted Forester. “We’ve been chasing this for so long. It’s not just the final defeats either. We’ve been so close in semi-finals, had replays, and we’ve been knocking at the door for so, so long. “You wonderit’s ever going to happen orit is going to pass you by. Can we not deliver it for the people who have given so much to this club   “I’m thinking back of all the coaches that we’ve had that have put in serious work – Michael Heffernan, Tony Jackson, Donal McMahon. “I can’t describe it when you see people’s faces on the pitch afterwards. There’s Paul O’Hea, Darren McDaid, Aidan Cleary – all these incredible people that have given so much to the club and to do it for them just makes it so special. I can’t put it into words.” Anyone who knows Forester knows that the GAA runs in his veins. He has been a stalwart in the Oacuteg’s line-up for many years, and a former Derry defender. But the playing is only part of the story. A dedicated coach, Forester embraced teammates at the final whistle on Saturday that he himself had helped nurture. Ever the modest man, he wasn’t prepared to take all the credit. “I had Donncha , Oran , Cahir , Adam , Oran– they were all through the primary schools programme. “It’s crazy to think that that’s the hard work we started nine years ago when we started the programme, recruiting schools and coaching them a bit more intensely in the club, and it’s come to fruition. “People have put in serious effort and not just the players but the coaches, the administrators – people like Ann and Declan Lindsay who give so much to the club in the background. “Declan never misses a match doing umpire and we know how hard it is to do that. It’s the people like that - it is just amazing for them to celebrate the joy of this with us.”  WATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title  A late Cahir McMonigle free sealed victory over reigning champions Greenlough.

I was going to talk about the NI Music Prize when the predictable happens and rant on deaf ears about the unfairness of it all, but I continually vote in it, and it has been quite spot-on in the past, so, maybe I might wise up. Probably not like.

There hasn’t been enough gigs this past year to have a best live act, how they arrived at a conclusion last year is strange but then I may be misinformed. There’s obviously no new bands to speak of so it’s just the two awards this year. I suppose it’s as close to democracy as we can get, but as with everything in the parish, the archaic powers that be hold way too much influence and are too stuck in the past. I’m the guiltiest and have no real business having a say and will keep my opinions to myself from now on. Well after I say that to my ears Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic and Verse Chorus Verse’s What If We Won are the best albums on that list to me and Waldorf  Cannon’s We Are Your Government is the best single. I think we should all sit back and appreciate that Hannah Peel’s Fir Wave was recently up for the Mercury Music Prize kiss of death, sadly not winning butit was two out of two losses an outsider would be thinking that there is something really weird going on within the chambers of power up at the Oh Yeah Centre. I named the  nominators to remind myself that my taste really isn’t that important, and I should read my above statement about keeping my opinions to myself. Waiting for things to change in the parish is just something we are great at here. What next, I hear you ask, well there is a group that meets around a table and weighs up the options for the best albums, I’d like to think they do this in a fair manner and once they reach a consensus then the world, who will undoubtedly be waiting with bated breath, will get their answer The same is not true for the single, that is voted for by the public, you, and that’s why those bands were urging you to vote recently. The public vote is now closed so I suppose they know who’s won it by now but they’re not letting on. Rascals.

Here are  to choose from....enjoy! Miami Vice: Saturday, TCM @ pm Michael Manns stylish and action packed update of the famous s TV show about cops taking on drug dealers. Bristling with testosterone, its a moody grown up thriller full of suspense, action and neo-nazis getting shot in the face. Whats not to like about that  Colin Farrell  Jamie Foxx are solid as the leads but Naomie Harris steals the film with one small scene in a mobile home. The soundtrack is wicked too. googletag.cmd.push Portrait Of A Lady On Fire: Saturday, BBC @ pm In Brittany at the end of the th century a painter called Marianne is commissioned to paint a portrait of a woman calledHeacuteloiumlse who is due to be married off to an Italian nobleman. A marriage she wants no part of. Do you fancy a romance that will both uplt you and leave you in absolute shreds  Well here you go. Magnicent turns from Noeacutemie Merlant and Adegravele Haenel carry a sublime story. Rain Man: Saturday, TG @ .pm Charlies father has died and left his fortune to an autistic brother he never realised he had. To get the money him and his brother tear off on a road trip where he finds out about both his sibling and himself. Aspects of Rain Man have dated these days but its still a lovely story of discovery and reunion buoyed by a couple of memorable performances from Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise. Pawn Sacrice: Sunday, BBC One @ .am  Bobby Fischer vs Boris Spassky. . The chess game to end all chess games. Two grandmasters. West vs East. Some said it was only a game but in a time of cold war its also something far more important than that. Tobey Maguire does fine work as the tragic lead of a well crafted film riddled with paranoia and suspense while Liev Schrieber uses his trademark brooding to intense effect. Walk Like A Panther: Sunday, Channel  @ .am  Their local pub is closing and the only way to make money is toto the lycra and capes. But these folks arent superheroes, nope, they are s wrestlers and aching hips and shoulders arent going to stop them. An entertaining slice of fluff and whimsy from  that will make you feel nostalgic for Saturday morning television. Stephen Graham, Sue Johnston, Robbie Gee and Julian Sands are among the familiar faces having fun. Ladyhawke: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm Nare and Isabeau are in love but they have a wee problem. There was a curse placed on them making him a wolf during the night and her a hawk during the day ensuring they can never be together. The only person who can help is a thief called Gaston. Richard Donners  fairytale is a likable, well made, glorious looking romantic escapade. Michelle Pfefer and Rutger Hauer play the lost lovers and Matthew Broderick has a good time as their only hope. St Vincent: Sunday, Film @ .pm After an incident with his next door neighbour a grumpy old Vietnam vet begins to babysit her bullied son and soon they begin to see the best in each other. A funny, bittersweet comedy that will make you laugh and upset you in equal measures. Bill Murray in the lead is better than hes been in years and Melissa McCarthy as his neighbour does well in a role thats a lot more dramatic than her usual parts. Bridge to Terabithia: Monday, Great! Films @ .pm Jesse and Leslie become fast friends when she moves in next door to him. Soon their childhood imaginations are running riot and the kingdom of Terabithia is created. Real le is sadly never far away though. A little beaut of a movie, one full of lessons about le, both the lovely and tragic sides of it. Anna Sophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson are both amiable leads. Be warned, this could might will make you cry. Doubt: Monday, TG @ .pm A well liked priest is accused of child abuse. But did he do it  Thats the crux of the tale in an excellent adaption of the famous Broadway play. Philip Seymour Hoffmanis the priest in question and Meryl Streep is the nun investigating him. We get immense performances from both. The subject matter might be hard to take but its compelling and gripping stuff that will stay in your head for days after. Dog Soldiers: Monday, Film @ . A group of soldiers on routine training in the Scottish highlands find themselves under siege from a pack of beasts that should not exist. Neil Marshalls debut film is awesome. Hilarious, horric, quotable, disgusting and damn scary. A rare horror comedy that gets its blend just right. All this and we get a wicked cast too with Sean Pertwee, Kevin McKidd, Liam Cunningham and Darren Morfitt whos just deadly as Spoon. All The Kings Men: Tuesday, Great! Movies Action @ .am Wille Stark. A real salt of the earth fellow. Liked by all. Well...... Hes a politician, a self taught kind of guy. Hes a decent man, at least he was once, back when he hadnt sold his soul. A deserved Best Picture winner back in , this portrait of the rise and fall of a famous face mixes politics and noir to brilliant effect.Broderick Crawfordand Merceded McCambridge both put in first rate performances. Journeys End: Wednesday, BBC Two @ .pm France. . The trenches of Aisne. A young soldier called Raleigh once who once believed in the importance of war sits surrounded by his comrades in a filthy, rat infested trench as the German army only metres away get ready to attack their front lines. A powerful watch that shows us bullets make no distinctions when it comes to class and social status. Asa Butterfield, Paul Bettany and Sam Clafin do strong work. Nebraska: Thursday, Film @ .am A father and son called Woody and David are taking a trip from Montana to Nebraska to claim a prize. Woody is slowly losing his memory to dementia and David is dragged into the mess. Alexander Paynes comedy drama is a beautully written and crafted look at the complexities of family relationships. Plus it has a couple of wicked belly laughs hidden away. Bruce Dern, Will Forte and especially June Squibb are all on fire. Paths Of Glory: Thursday, BBC @ .pm The men of B-company refuse to make a suicidal run at a German hill during World War . Their general is embarrassed by his perceived failure and sets out to make someone pay. Stanley Kubricks masterful anti war film is an enraging watch, one that shows the toll military le can have on humanity even when the fighting is over. Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax has never been better while George Macready as General Mireau will make you despair. Sam Whiskey: Friday, TG @ .pm Her husband is dead and Laura has a problem. The gold he stole is sitting in a boat at the bottom of the Colorado river and she needs someone to find it andit to its rightful place. Unfortunately she hires the rogue Sam Whiskey for the job. A charming. amiable western is just what you need for a Friday evening and this one led by Burt Reynolds and Angie Dickinson is just the ticket. Youll instantly guess how its going to end but it will keep you smiling throughout. American Mary: Friday, The Horror Channel @ .pm A broke medical student discovers an unusual way to make extra money and finds herself in some very very dark places as a result. This  dark drama horror film starring Katherine Isabelle is a highly effective piece of work. Be warned though, it should probably only be watched by those with a strong constitution butyou can go with it you discover a unique little story that will open your eyes to a whole other world. The Belly Of The Whale: Friday, RTEacute One @ .pm Joe and Ronald. Two loners in a miserable, run down seaside town in Donegal. One has come home after a long time and the other is already there scratching out a miserable existence. They come together with a plan but theres someone venal in their way. A dark dark dark Irish comedy from  that went under the radar at the time but its still worth your time. Michael Smiley, Peter Coonan and Pat Shortt do nice work as three men youd cross four fields to avoid.

The area will also be power washed.Just over pound, is to be spent on other planting and landscaping schemes in the Church Street area, while there are also proposals for a new bus stop and power washing the area outside the former telephone exchange.New safety railings are to be installed outside  Church Street, while a mural will be painted on one of the gable walls at the entrance to the car park at this part of the town.There are also plans to invest pound, on new interpretation material highlighting the Tower Bell at Down Parish Church and the grave of United Irishman Thomas Russell in the church grounds.Plans have also been outlined to provide new festive lighting on the side of the Down Arts Centre and on trees in De Courcey Place.The draft plan confirms a proposal to appoint a quantity surveyor to oversee the substantial investment with hopes that the work can start as soon as the document secures approval from the steering group.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed the opportunity business and property owners are being given to revitalise what he described as a key part of the town.ldquoThe proposed Church Street investment is welcome news in a part of the town where there are a number of family-owned businesses whose links with Downpatrick stretch back over several generations, he said.ldquoThe draft plan provides a vision for the future and business owners welcome the signicant investment which will considerably help Church Street which has missed out on funding for some considerable time.Cllr Curran said the revitalisation scheme provided a firm  on which to build for the future and he hoped that business and property owners will be encouraged to spend some of their own money on their respective properties to make them even better.He is also keen to see progress on the Irish Street scheme which has not made the progress many would have hoped by this stage.Cllr Curran added: ldquoRedeveloping the former police base site and neighbouring properties will be a game-changer and act as a catalyst to secure more investment, increasing footfall which will benefit existing traders.ldquoDownpatrick is a county town and its status warrants not only a vibrant retail hub, but a place where all buildings look smart and welcoming.ldquoSignicant sums of money have been invested in other town centre streets and I am delighted that it is now Church Streetrsquos turn to benefit from some much-needed, but very welcome investment..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021_aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin make history  ","story":"AUGHLISNAFIN were crowned junior champions for the first time in their  year history after a pulsating contest with Dundrum concluded in a three-point victory at Pairc Esler on Friday night.Despite a commendable second half surge from John Clarkersquos Dundrum men, the lsquoFin showed their experience in the competition and managed to cling on to achieve intermediate status for next yearrsquos campaign.Dundrum began on the offence straight from the start, winning the throw-in and immediately attacking the opposition.This set the tone for what would be a highly paced and energetic contest, as Aughlisnafinrsquos Oran Flanagan fouled Dundrumrsquos Michael McGrattan for a free within the opening minute.However, what should have been a straight forward conversion was missed by Cormac Venney.Breannain McComiskey immediately made Venney rue his miss, as the Aughlisnafin man kicked over the bar following good build-up play from Shea Croskery for the opening score of the final.The lsquoFin kept their foot on the pedal and won the following kick-out, with Flanagan making up for his earlier foul to convert a point from play.Referee Conor Curran was kept busy throughout the game and first brandished his yellow card just four minutes in to Aughlisnafinrsquos Noel Travers after a sloppy high tackle.Following patient build up play, Croskery added his sidersquos third point of the game, with Dundrum now desperate to get on the board.It was clear nerves were playing a part in the early stages, as Venney failed to convert another free wide, this time dragging his shot right of the posts.With Aughlisnafin piling the pressure on the Dundrum defence the ball was worked back to lsquokeeper Walsh who played a fist pass out to team-mate Thomas McShane  metres from goal.However, disaster struck as the Dundrum man fumbled the ball in the danger area, allowing Flanagan to pick up the scraps and bury the ball into the back of the net to give The lsquoFin a six point lead less than ten minutes in.Michael McGrattan tried to answer for Dundrum but saw his effort drt wide before custodian Walsh finally got his side off the mark with a converted free.McComiskey replied sharply, notching his second point by kicking over the black spot from open play, although Venney did answer this with a point of his own that he desperately needed just before the water-break.At the conclusion of the opening quarter, Aughlisnafin were by far the dominant side and led - to -.On the restart Dundrum managed to find their groove and make up for earlier mistakes courtesy of successive points from Venney and McGrattan.However, Aughlisnafin would soon hit their opponents with a damaging blow as Tiernan Noadersquos high ball over the top found lsquoFin forward Adam Garland, who converted his sweetly struck shot into the top left corner for the second goal of the game after  minutes.Noade won a turnover from the resultant kick-out, but saw his effort sail wide before McGrattan replied with a point for Dundrum after winning an inidual battle with Aughlisnafin defender Sean Fitzsimmons.The contest was beginning to ebb and flow with both sets of supporters making their voices heard, as Garland dummied his man, but missed the target.Despite Noade pulling his shot wide a minute later, Aughlisnafinrsquos high balls over the top were clearly causing Dundrum all sorts of bother as their defence struggled to maintain the pressing forward line.Garland kicked over a free to give his side a - score line as Dundrum prepared to introduce substitute Odhran McKibbin to the pitch.Perhaps overeager to impress, McKibbin received a yellow card immediately following a late tackle, as referee Curran continued to show efficient officiating beyond his years.Soon after, McComiskey registered his third point of the match, but once again, Dundrum showed why they made it to the final.After overturning the ball in midfield, the ball worked its way to Dundrum captain Aidan Fegan, who played a lovely pass over the top to McGrattan.The forward found himself in acres of space and struck the ball with conviction past lsquoFin lsquokeeper Morgan Croskery and into the net.Garland replied with a free just before half time as the score read Aughlisnafin - Dundrum -.The lsquoFin began the quicker following the restart after a McComiskey lsquorsquo floated into Garland, who pointed over for the first score of the half.A series of wides took up the next five minutes of the game before McComiskey became the latest player to enter Conor Curranrsquos book, receiving a yellow for a high tackle.Travers then pulled his effort wide before his side won the resultant kick-out and forced a fantastic save from Dundrumrsquos Walsh, who stopped a certain goal.Walsh found himself at the opposite end of the pitch a minute later to kick over a fantastic free, which spurred team-mate Venney on to convert one himself in the following passage of play.This was Venneyrsquos third time raising the white flag and the last notable piece of action before the second water-break as Dundrum trailed by four.The last quarter was nothing short of dramatic, as both sets of players were clearly beginning to fatigue and yet still managed to throw everything at eachother.Dundrum really set the scene for a nail-biting last  minutes when they passed the ball neatly from one end of the pitch to the other before skipper Fegan found David McComiskey with only lsquokeeper Croskery to beat.Dundrumrsquos McComiskey duly converted make it a one-point game and now the atmosphere was beginning to reach fever pitch.John Hurley saw his chance sail wide for Dundrum before Garland kicked over a free to double his sidersquos lead.McGrattan continued to battle, winning a free out of nothing, before Walsh stepped up to send the ball over the bar.Shea Croskery received a yellow card in between two wide balls from Dundrum, as they resulted to kicking from range in the final five minutes.Walsh was forced to make another eye-catching save, this time preventing substitute Ruairi Croskery from converting.Garland managed to kick over a point a minute later to add to his impressive personal tally before Flanagan saw his long range effort split the posts to give Aughlisnafin a comfortable three point margin.With just seconds on the clock, Dundrum knew it was now or never and with the last free of the night attempted a short pass to allow an opportunity for a strike on goal.However, Shea Croskery was on hand to block the shot as Curranrsquos whistle sounded for the final time to signal it would be Dolen Croskeryrsquos men who would lt the trophy.Aughlisnafin: M Croskery J Matthews, S Fitzsimmons, S Willoughby O OrsquoToole, B McComiskey , N Travers D Steele , O FlanaganS

Catherine OrsquoConnor was in fineform and led the EDAC ladies in style.Her aim was top ten and she managed that with ease coming eighth in . for the three miles. She also got the prize for first over  as a further boost to her confidence.Leanne Spick, who has only recently joined the club, is a competent runner and game for anything so, new spikes purchased, she turned up to see what was what.She was second EDAC lady home, th overall in .. It is fair to say she looked right at home and will likely make further improvement now that she knows the drill.Nuala Taylor, coaxed into racing by her husband John, who wanted her to know how much he had suffered at Comber, couldnrsquot see what the fuss was about as she flew round in . .Wayne Giles gets a bit of teasing for being in the ladiesrsquo race due to being over  but he takes it in good part.He has even volunteered to shave his legs to help him blend in for the team photo. He was th overall .Maureen Kelly was full of beans and went off like the clappers but soon realised that she would be better setting her own pace rather than getting sucked into the speed of others.She sensibly slowed and found a more sustainable rhythm completing in . in nd place.Janine Murray has been running well but with a heavy cold and a hamstring niggle, this is one race she is happy to have behind her. She placed st in ..Alison Carroll in contrast said that this was possibly her most enjoyable cross country race ever and she was well pleased with her time of ..Sam Anderson, going from marathon distance to this shorter effort, was afraid of being last but she was far from it and has even signed up for the next event in two weeks time. Her time of . earned her th slot.With the ladies done and dusted, the men swarmed to the start area. There were nine EDAC representatives, a mix of the experienced and the first timers ready for the five laprace.Gordy Graham prefers the feel of tarmac when he is racing, but he aways commits to whatever challenge is set before him. He, like Catherine, was aiming for a top ten and by virtue of targeting runners ahead hemanoeuvred himself into a good position but had to sprintright to the line to hold his tenth place.He recorded . which is speedy for an off road run.Mackenzie Murray is  but with no junior category for this age, he decided to join in the menrsquos senior team and he proved a useful addition.He found the distance long and at one stage was doubting his ability to stay with the pace but he hung in and even passed more runners to finish th overall in a time of ..Martin Willcox loves cross country, as does Dee Murray, and as old hands they know that pacing is key.They went lap after lap, never showing the strain and finishing in . and . respectively, th and nd.Right behind Dee was Jonny Holmes. This week he was notied that he has been selected as reserve for the over  NI team in the North South Masters XC Challenge to be held this weekend in Belfast, so this was a good chance for some last minute practice.He ran strongly finishing rd in . and we wish him well for Saturday. Carl Keenan, after spectating at Comber, thought that he might enjoy trying cross country for a change and he was right.Carl loved the feel of the grass beneath his feet as well as being part of the EDAC team and ran a steady race coming th in ..Eamon Kelly, who said he wouldnrsquot be back after Comber, had a change of heart as did John Taylor.It looked like these two plus Patrick Smith were having a ball judging by the smiles as they passed or perhaps we misinterpreted their grimaces.Spurred on by the shouts of club mates, they battled to the end and all three made the top . Eamon was th , John thand Patrick th in ..With banana bread and chocolate on hand to revive them, the mood at the finish line was buoyant and the whole EDAC contingent went home satisfied with having made good use of the day.The Born  Run team are excited to be back in business after the long layoff during the pandemic.They welcomed back the runners with open arms to the first event of six in the lsquoWinter Run Forest Runrsquo series, namely the Minnowburn K and K. Both distances started at the Mary Peters Track and then headed off into the forest and then along the towpath.There were over  in the K and  in the K. East Down had two runners both doing the K, Sharon Madine and Rachel Madine .Despite her birthday celebrations the night before, Sharon looked fresh as she set off with the lead pack and she was more than able to stick with the pace throughout.While she didnrsquot particularly relish the hill at the start or the climb to the finish, she appreciated the scenery en route.Her efforts placed her third female at the finish and it is worth noting that her time of . was only a few seconds off second place.Rachel equally enjoyed both the route and the race and was pleased to come well up the field in nd place .For Rachel though, this was only part one of her weekend commitments.The annual event organised by Atlas Running on behalf of the Ballynahinch British Legion took place on Sunday morning with a K route along the back roads of the town.Even though she had already raced the day before, Rachel Madine felt that she couldnrsquot let this race go by without taking part as it is right on her doorstep.In fact she could be considered a regular as this is her third time enteringThe  odd runners who turned up were delighted to be greeted with pleasant, bright weather as last year they had to endure torrential rain and high winds.Despite the hilly course, the race was won in a speedy . by Lawrence OrsquoHara of North Belfast. Rachel finished th in a time of .. A good weekendrsquos work for her.It was cross country all the way for the EDAC juniors last weekend but one option was closer to home in Ballyclare while the other necessitated a long drive to Donegal.The home birds were running in the U- race prior to the McConnell Shield cross country in the Six Mile Water Park. It may only have been a mile but it was a tough mile.Matthew Taylor actually ran more than a mile as he arrived late thinking he was in the next race on the program and performed the quickest vest change and number putting on ever seen.He just made it to the back of the pack as the whistle blew. Undeterred he dug in and made his way through the small pack and was barely in his stride when he realised that it was time to sprint for the finish line.He couldnrsquot believe his luck when he was then handed a medal for second boy. Talk about a whirlwind experience - maybe the lack of time to consider what lay ahead was a good thing.Even though he had no time to greet them at the start, he was able to congratulate the two other EDAC runners at the end.Amelia Spick was taking on her first cross country ever and seemed to enjoy the race. Her new spikes are now duly christened and hopefully she willfor another shot at this discipline.She ran an even pace as advised and finished sixth girl and ninth overall. Ky Murray was two places behind and closing in the latter stages.Her lightning sprint brought her within five seconds of Amelia and she was placed eighth girl overall.The juniors then took on the role of supporters, cheering on the adults which was much appreciated encouragement. It is this element of whole club camaraderie that makes cross country so special.Further afield then were the Robinson brothers who had travelled to Stranorlar in Donegal for the NI and Ulster XC Championships .Despite some rain early on in Ballyclare, the athletes raced in dry, almost sunny conditions and there was very little mud to slow them down, but Oliver and Alex were not so lucky.The rain the night before made the course very boggy and although the rainbows on the day suggested it might clear, this was just a tease. Even during the dry spells the biting wind made conditions tough for the runners.Alex was first up running a distance of two kilometres in the U- race. He started safely and quickly became part of the leading pack on the course two loops around two fields.On the second lap he led the breakaway pack and looked comfortable as they disappeared into the second field.When he emerged he had ped to fth and was running with just one shoe having lost the other in the deep mud. The last m metres were heroic as he battled to hold his place only being overtaken in the last m.He was so disappointed with the outcome and on reflection said he should have ditched his shoe sooner instead of losing speed trying to keep it on.A hard lesson to learn but Alex showed his grit and has been rewarded with selection as an inidual into the U- Ulster and NI team for the All-Irelands in Gowran, Kilkenny at the start of December.He was placed sixth out of  runners in a time of ., only  seconds behind the winner. The wayward shoe was retrieved from the mud later.His brother Ollie was in two minds whether to run at all. He was nursing an injury acquired at rugby but he showed commitment by putting his vest on to line up for the U- four-and-a-half kilometre race.He knew he wasnrsquot at his best but didnrsquot want to withdraw without giving it a shot. He went out steadily, wisely treating it as a training run, but still finishing rd out of the field of  runners.When the times are analysed he may well end up at the All-Irelands as part of the county team. Either way, he did the club proud and both boys are to be congratulated on their efforts..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Make the Call helps families with £5m aid  ","story":"NEW figures have revealed that over , people across the Newry Mourne and Down area claimed almost poundm in unclaimed benefits last year.The cash was paid under the lsquomake the callrsquo scheme spearheaded by the Department for Communities.The government department said figures for the last financial year reveal that people who used the service became pound better off per week on average, with almost , accessing almost poundm in unclaimed benefits province-wide.The lsquomake the callrsquo service supports people in accessing benefits, services and supports to which they are entitled, but have not been claiming.A total of  people in Newry Mourne and Down claimed pound,, last year.Stormont communities minister, Deirdre Hargey, said her departmentrsquos scheme has helped people who lsquomade the callrsquo become, on average, pound. better off per week.ldquoDuring  , we received over  referrals from our partner organisations which helped ensure people are receiving their full entitlement to benefits, supports and services that can make a real dference to their lives, she explained.ldquoOften people donrsquot realise there is support out there to assist them during dficult times.

Enough is enough, it is time to see these projects delivered to improve the lives of local workers and families.With the approach of winter and worsening road conditions due to weather and darker evenings, Cllr Mason said visibility will become poorer.ldquoWe need to see urgent action from the Minister to address the concerns of the local community to ensure our roads are safe and up to satisfactory standard before winter hits, she contended.ldquoWinter gritting is a huge cause for concern for many in our local rural communities and the Minister needs to deliver a more effective solution to winter gritting on our rural roads with priority for those in more isolated areas who fear another winter stuck in their homes, the councillor continued.ldquoMany farmers who rely on milk collection lorries arriving daily and accessing feed supplies for their animals, need the certainty that their services and routine will not be disrupted. Those who work as frontline staff such as the emergency services and domiciliary care workers must have a safe passage to and from peoplersquos homes, while childcare services and rural schools must be able to operate smoothly.ldquoWe cannot allow ordinary people to suffer and a management plan must be implemented to ensure gritting is carried out throughout the winter period, she added, confirming that she has written to Mrs Mallon to raise her concerns.A DfI spokesman said Mrs Mallon ldquocompletely rejects these unfounded assertions and will continue to work equitably across all council areas, including South Down, to improve the condition of the road network.ldquoThe Minister is fully aware of the condition of roads in South Down and will continue to work for all communities to deliver the infrastructure they need, he said.ldquoThe fact that the Minister has increased the funding for the rural roads fund by % and allocated poundm mdash a % increase on last yearrsquos budget mdash specically for rural roads across the North, including South Down, is a clear demonstration of this commitment to rural communities. This funding is not impacted by current legal challenges.The spokesman explained that as a result of challenges to awarding resurfacing contracts earlier this year, ious schemes which the Department had intended to progress during the current financial year have been delayed in four council areas, including Newry Mourne and Down.But he confirmed the Department is taking forward a new procurement strategy and hopes to be in position to go to tender shortly and to have new term contracts in place next January to continue resurfacing programmes in these areas, including in South Down.ldquoSignicant programmes of work have been delivered across all areas in  , in particular on rural roads and while capacity to reallocate resurfacing budgets across areas is limited, every effort is being made to maximise spend across all areas, said the spokesman.ldquoIn relation to the Ballynahinch bypass, Minister Mallon provided an opening allocation of pound.m for land costs and scheme development in -. The next steps are procurement and progression to construction.ldquoProgression to construction will, however, depend on budget allocations made to the Department in future years. Subject to funding being made available, it is estimated that it would take around  months to the start of construction from any decision to move to procurement, and a further  months to construct the scheme.The spokesman explained that as part of planning for the winter gritting programme, the Department ensures that adequate staff are available, all winter service equipment is in satisfactory working order and that there are adequate supplies of salt.He added: ldquoWhile the Department generally salts the main through routes which carry more than , vehicles per day, in exceptional circumstances, roads with dficult topography carrying between , and , vehicles daily will also be salted.ldquoGrit piles are also available for use by the public on a self-help basis on selected routes not included on the salting schedule and arrangements are in place to enlist the help of private contractors and local farmers to assist in efforts to clear blocked roads in rural areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021_smell.jpg","title":"Multi agency  response call on foul smell  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has called for a multi-agency response to two issues of concern in the Dundrum area.Northern Ireland Water, the Department for Infrastructure and Rivers Agency have been asked to address recent damage caused by flood water at the Moneycarragh River, with the utility company and Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos environmental health department asked to investigate the cause of foul smelling liquid seeping from land close to Dam Lane in the village.The appeal for the ious agencies to work together on both issues has been made by Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis.In relation to the Moneycarragh River, the councillor has called for the waterway to be ldquoed to its natural state, with the appeal coming after recent flooding which led to a burst pipe resulting in a number of consumers in the area left without supply.In June, Cllr Lewis raised concerns of local farmers with NI Water after a concrete floor was installed on the floor of the river, directly under Bennettrsquos bridge which runs over it.ldquoThe work prevented water from pooling, which subsequently forced floodwater to erode stone walls and the river bank which exposed a water supply the pipe which was damaged by rocks and it burst, he added.Cllr Lewis claimed rising floodwater has also undermined the integrity of the bridge and widened the river banks which exposed the water supply pipe.ldquoPreviously, farmers were able to drive machinery down the natural land slope to collect water from the river for animals and farm use, but this access has been altered so much that a sizeable dip has been left on the river bank.Cllr Lewis said the damage was ldquopredictable and claimed that the manipulation of the riverrsquos natural flow has, over time, distorted its integrity, warning that erosion which will eventually cause the collapse of the supporting walls at the bridge and adjoining roadway.He has asked NI Water and roads officials to urgently join forces to address the issue andthe river bed to its natural state.Turning to Dam Lane, Cllr Lewis says he hopes local afgghghuthority environmental health officials and NI Water will be able to address the issue.ldquoI recently received numerous complaints regarding a foul smelling fluid which has been seeping onto the pavement at this part of the village.

Photo: Jonathan Porter   Press EyePrior to the centenary service he had expressed solidarity with his Archbishop predecessors in opposition to partition as a “perennial source of discord and stre”which he claimed during the service had “polarised people on this island” for a hundred years.These views coincided precisely with the recent claim by Simon Coveney that “partition was a terrible mistake and caused extraordinary ision on the island of Ireland” .Partition occurred because unionist commitment to the Union precluded identication with the imperatives of Irish nationalism and hence the refusal of unionists to be incorporated into an all-Ireland state.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Contrary to the tacit import of the Archbishop’s address, unionist opposition to ‘Home Rule’ from the late nineteenth century was based on entirely rational and legitimate grounds.They did not identy themselves as part of a Gaelic nation in which being Catholic was considered essential to being authentically Irish.Unionists were distinct from Irish nationalists with respect to the religion, culture and political aspiration which grounded their deep-rooted loyalty toward Britain and their entirely legitimate demand to remain within the Union. Unionist apprehensions that Home rule would degenerate into ‘Rome rule’ were prescient and well founded.After  the southern leaders set about constructing a Gaelicised and confessional Catholic state in which the Catholic church was given responsibility for health and education and a ‘special position’ in de Valera’s  constitution.Catholic moral values were all-pervasive: orce was not permitted, birth control outlawed, literature advocating contraception banned, films and books censured and the Ne Temere decree was applied to mixed marriages. Protestants in the Free State Republic were enclosed within a society dominated by a nationalist understanding of history and the pervasive political and moral power of Catholicism.The Protestant population rapidly declined having been subjected in - and again in  to intimidation, vicious attacks and sectarian murder as in the case the Bandon Valley murders in .But during the first seventy years of partition the Catholic population of Northern Ireland increased while their co-religionists in the Free State Republic fled in their hundreds of thousands to the British mainland to escape poverty and the cultural deprivations of a theocratic dominance that itself spawned the horrors of the orphan homes and the Magdalene laundries.The Archbishop’s reference to the ‘sadness’ and ‘loss’ that he claimed his community and tradition had experienced as a result of partition can be reasonably understood as expressive of what has been ironically referred to as the MOPE mentality of the ‘mostoppressed people ever’.The simple fact of the matter is that the benefits of the Union were made available to all the citizens of Northern Ireland: social security and welfare, educational opportunity, health provision and the availability of public housing. Despite claims to the contrary by the civil rights activists, Catholics were in fact over-represented in public housing. The system of local government franchise was outdated and should not have been retained after it was reformed in Britain in .The local government franchise did not apply to Stormont or Westminster elections. This meant that the Catholic population was not disenfranchised contrary to the intended and successful propaganda of the NI civil rights slogan ‘one man, one vote’ – in fact the local government franchise actually disenfranchised more Protestants than Catholics.The Archbishop’s comments expressed a nationalist antipathy to partition. But his comments also crucially amounted to a moral indictment of unionism.Here is why.Partition is the perennialsource of stre. Unionists secured partition. Therefore unionists are ultimately responsible for the ‘stre’ which the Archbishop attributed to partition.That is a morally and historically perverse perspective. The truth is that the decades of terrorism originated and was sustained from within the community and tradition with which the Archbishop identied.The terrorism of the IRA was driven by a nationalist fanaticism and an ideological blindness to the integrity and validity of the unionist commitment to the Union.• Patrick J.

Dual carriageways were constructed for much of the distance between the M at Lisburnand Newry.However, from the s the southern section of the intercity road has been upgraded in stages to motorway, and completed as such in .Suddenly the northern part of the road, the A, was noticeably inferior. The route around Newry was a twisting single carriageway with a high fatality rate, and the dual carriageway sections had deadly gap junctions, in which cars have to cross the central reservation amid fast oncoming traffic to make a right turn.Much of that basic dual carriageway remains in place today.The infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon has approved an upgrade scheme that will replace most of the A gap junctions with flyovers. This is welcome, but it has been a tortuously slow process, with construction not even under way some  years after the southern motorway reached the border.Part of the problem is that the Irish authorities used tolls to help fund their world-class motorways, whereas populist Stormont politicians are almost always reluctant to ask the public to help pay for services.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

We will continue to monitor this situation closely and will update our guidance to pet owners should the situation change. ”Dr Katherine Russell, consultant medical epidemiologist at the UK Health Security Agency, said: “Covid- is predominantly spread from person to person but in some situations the virus can spread from people to animals.“In line with general public health guidance, you should wash your hands regularly, including before and after contact with animals.”Cat or dog owners who have Covid- should avoid their pets while infected, experts warned a few months ago.Scientists in the Netherlands found that coronavirus is common in pet cats and dogs where their owners have the disease.While cases of owners passing on Covid- to their pets bring negligible risk to public health, the scientists said there is a “potential risk” that domestic animals could act as a “reservoir” for coronavirus and reintroduce it to humans.Covid-ScientistsSurreyWeybridge  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularPSNI treating republican poster on Enniskillen Cenotaph as hate incidentNI road closed after road traffic collision - ersions are in placePUP Deputy Leader Dr John Kyle: Both sides have sabotaged centenary celebrations for Northern Ireland - unionists should broadcast our successesPatrick J Roche: Archbishop’s comments a moral indictment of unionismRepublic of Ireland in discussions with senior Biden advisor over UK Article  plans for NI ProtocolMost PopularWhen is Children in Need : Date for Pudsey Day, this years theme and how you can get involvedIn Pictures: Military service of veteran Dennis Hutchings ‘remembered and respected’DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson reiterates threat to withdraw from StormontNI Protocol not dealt withNI High Street Voucher: How long can it take to get spend local card and what to doyou havent received itFive suspects captured on CCTV after thefts from hardware stores in Lurgan, Portadown and Lisburn                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

To be focusing on negatives or potential problems is self-defeating. The same attributes that contributed to these successes can be refocused on overcoming the socioeconomic problems that loyalist and republican communities both grapple with.” Furthermore, the EU now acknowledges the NI Protocol must be changed.“Much more is needed but the momentum is with us and movement is in the right direction. We must also scrutinise the opportunities which the protocol could offer Northern Ireland.”He concluded that an economically vibrant and culturally rich NI is “the best counter argument” to a united Ireland. “A home place characterised by partnership, equality and mutual respectis the most persuasive argument for Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom.” Sinn Fein was invited to comment.MORE NEWSPSNI treating republican poster on Enniskillen Cenotaph as hate incidentMan whose body was found in alleyway had suffered  stab wounds and two broken legs, court hearsNI Vet speaks from hospital bed to remind others Covid- is not overNI High Street Voucher Scheme: How to check balance on spend local card and what to doyou need a refundA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

So, without these measures, fewer people will attend those venues, fewer people will attend those events, certainly the people that speak to me.\"After the vote, health minister Eluned Morgan said the Covid Pass scheme had produced positive feedback from businesses and event organisers.ldquoI am pleased the extension has been agreed today following the vote,\" she added. \"Covid has not gone away and cases remain high and we need to continue take steps to Keep Wales Safe. The NHS CovidPass is one measure among many to help to keep businesses open while also helping to control the spread of the virus.ldquoThe decision to introduce them has not been taken lightly and the venues that will be covered are indoors and see large numbers of people being closely together for prolonged periods of time.\"The new rules will be in force from Monday, November . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

He has been a very valuable asset to our union and will be sadly missed.Mr Pricersquos contribution will be acknowledged at the Annual Glamorgan County Dinner that is being held at Cardfrsquos Angel Hotel on Friday November .More than  guests and dignitaries will attend the black-tie dinner, with glasses raised to the Glamorgan first team who beat Devon last month at Long Sutton Golf Club in the final of inter-county league.It had been a long wait since , but the convincing - victory in Somerset - which came after Glamorgan topped their group with just one defeat in the entire season - was the perfect way for Mr Price to bow out of the role.As well as the first team, Price has assisted in running the junior teams and the seniors team. In his time working across these generations, he has steered the union on to a more secure financial footing, attracting new sponsorship and promoting all aspects of the game in the county.OTHER NEWS:Backed by a streamlined executive committee, Mr Pricersquos influence has seen coaching notably improved at all age groups.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityLast week I joined my fellow Labour MP Ruth Jones, along with Vale of Glamorgan Member of the Senedd Jane Hutt and others, to speak at the s Women of Wales rally in Cardf Bay.The group continues to campaign for justice on their pensions, calling for fair and fast compensation from the UK Government, following the summer finding by the Parliamentary  Health Service Ombudsman that the Department for Work and Pensions should have given more notice of their decision to raise the womenrsquos state pension age.I met group members outside the Senedd, many of whom have faced great hardship as a result of the DWPrsquos actions, and I will continue to support them in their fight for justice.Irsquove recently heard from many constituents about sewage pollution. It is shocking that the UK is ranked th out of  European countries for coastal water quality and only % of waterways meet good ecological status.As a regular open water swimmer myself and someone who loves our beautul rivers, lakes and coastlines, Irsquom deeply alarmed at the ongoing revelations about sewage discharge and other pollution incidents.After UK Conservative MPs tried to block efforts to improve the situation via an amendment to the Environment Bill, the House of Lords emphatically voted to send back the amendment to end the routine discharge of raw sewage into rivers. Unsurprisingly the Government then voted to weaken that amendment.They are simply in the wrong place environmentally and politically ndash which is deeply concerning in the week of COP. We need bolder, more urgent actionwe are to address the climate and nature crisis.While the regulation of water and sewers is generally reserved to the UK Government, here in Wales there are powers to regulate undertakers whose areas are wholly or mainly in Wales ndash and Irsquom pleased the Welsh Government is committed to tackling pollution by using these powers.This year marks  years of Remembrance as we know it, as the Royal British Legionmarks its centenary..removeAs we approach Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday, it was an honour to plant a stake in the first Parliamentary Constituency Garden of Remembrance, to remember all those from Cardf South and Penarth who have served and paid the ultimate sacrice.It brought to mind the huge sacrices of our armed forces across the years and to this day. We owe them all a huge debt of gratitude. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The rough clftop path between bushes resembled a river after previous heavy rainfall and paddling their way along it, a deviation into fields for a quick stop for morning refreshments as overhead there were traces of blue in between the clouds.Crossing a sticky muddy ploughed field brought them to the dismantled railway line where at last the sun made an appearance and following Fort Road and crossing the busy Lavernock Road, a gate led them into Cosmeston Lakes Country Park beside the Medieval Village.A lush green meadow above the Sully Brook brought them to a stile leading into the Community Orchard, planted by volunteers in  and then through a gate into Cogan Wood, where squirrels were bounding and delicately prancing along the ground seeking food before scurrying up into the trees. Reaching Mile Road they continued towards Old Cogan Hall Farm to enter the churchyard of St Peterrsquos where lunch was taken whilst soaking up the sunshine that felt more like May than November.Refreshed they walked on through what had been the deserted medieval settlement of Old Cogan which relates to the th century when the church was built. It appears buildings were set within gardens on either side of a sunken lane and there was a village pond or a well with a mill and leat set to the south of the village..removeA narrow track brought them into woodland at the rear of Myrtle Close to hop across the Sully Brook into the lovely open green space of St Cyres Park with deep blue skies overhead. Then onto pavements taking them through Penarth town by way of Glyndwr Road, Elfed Avenue and across Redlands Road, through Mountjoy Crescent and more open parkland to the lovely upgraded Golden Gates Park and past the Grade II listed St Josephrsquos Church, which took seven years to build as work was interrupted by the Great War.By lane to reach Dingle Road and across the railway footbridge just as a train was approaching and then across the A Windsor Road into Windsor Lane, across Plassey Street to Plassey Square open space and along Harbour View Road to Queen Street. Here they heard the oldest reference to Penarth goes back to Osbert a Norman Knight that granted land there to St Augustinersquos Abbey in Bristol. The land was then taken by King Henry VII and leased out to local well to do families like the Herbertrsquos, Windsorrsquos and Lewis families.This area to the north of Penarth is known as The Bowery and was a poor area without access to education, doctors or a good standard of living. Many of the Irish navvies that came over to build Penarth Docks lodged in this area which became known as lsquoDagger Townrsquo and fights, prostitution, opium dens and gambling along with no doubt a murder or two was re. The Irish making the journey by boat often arrived starving and disease riddenthe journey had taken longer than expected. Whilst to the south of Penarth, it was a dferent story as the middle and upper class residents were better dressed, had moral values and enjoyed wealth and all the other things their counterparts in the north of the town lacked. A lane between houses built into the hillside at the rear of Paget Road brought them to Steep Street for the short walk back to their start, this time with sunny views across Cardf Bay and beyond.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.

A support scheme is to be set up amid fears that the price rises will lead to an increase of people living in fuel poverty. The rise will take effect from December ,  and affects firmus customers in Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Banbridge, Coleraine, Craigavon , Limavady, Derry Londonderry, Newry and more than  other towns and villages in the surrounding areas. firmus say wholesale global gas prices have increased by % from a year ago and by % since the previous tarf review that came into effect on the st October. The change in tarf means an extra pound. per week on to the average household bill. Dr David Dobbin, Chairman of firmus energy, said: We very much regret having to increase our tarf however steep increases in global wholesale gas prices have forced our hand. This is a not a firmus issue, but a challenge faced by every local and national supplier of gas and electricity all of whom, sooner or later, will have to further increase their prices to meet the huge upsurges which have taken place in wholesale energy costs. We know this is an unwelcome increase which will have a disproportionate effect on those of our customers who are the most vulnerable. We have been consulting with key stakeholders and will be introducing a support scheme to be delivered through a local charity which will offer targeted help to those most in need, especially over the winter period. The scheme will be launched in the coming weeks and will go live around the same time as the increase we announced today takes effect. If any of our customers feel that they require further support, they should contact us directly to see how we can help. Customers seeking advice on their natural gas bills or direct debit payments should contact the firmus energy Customer Services team on   . Our telephone lines are open  hours a day,  days a week.
