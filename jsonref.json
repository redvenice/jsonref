Aziz Ansari was spotted getting cozy with a mystery woman at the US Open on Sunday           DailyMail.com can reveal the woman is 29-year-old Serena Campbell, from Denmark, and is currently studying for a PhD at London\u0027s King\u0027s College          Campbell shared an article last year titled \u0027Literally, Why Can\u0027t I Say #MeToo?\u0027 in which the author says she struggles to identify as a victim despite her experiences\u0027Yes, it is my daughter, but I don\u0027t want to say any more,\u0027 she said.Campbell is a researcher studying for her PhD at London\u0027s King\u0027s College, one of the world\u0027s top-ranked universities. She is specializing in plasmonics, the study of electromagnetic fields.And Campbell is also a mentor to a British project to launch a satellite which will seek to find out the weather patterns on planets outside the solar system using the ultra-violet light spectrum, part of her expertise.Last year she she told her Facebook friends she was traveling from London to South Korea in July last year for what\u0027s dubbed the world\u0027s leading conference in her field.A day later, friends told her how proud they were when she posted pictures from the event, with one commenting: \u0027Proud of how far you have traveled in your life. Well done.\u0027 Another called her a \u0027superstar\u0027, saying: \u0027Looks like an amazing event and we\u0027ll (sic) done on all your years of learning to get you there.\u0027Ansari, 35, did not appear intimidated by her academic achievements as the pair were pictured smiling and laughing, with the Master of None star whispering in her ear and waving at the crowd at the U.S Open last Monday – indicating he appears to be moving on from controversial sexual misconduct allegations earlier this year.    Scientist Serena Skov Campbell is a researcher pursuing a PhD in plasmonics, the study of electromagnetic fields          Campbell traveled from London to South Korea in July 2017 for what\u0027s dubbed the world\u0027s leading conference in her field, according to her Facebook           Campbell has an impressive academic resume, according to her research page, which details her work in plasmonicsThe physicist also seems to be unfazed by the allegations leveled against her new beau and was seen holding hands with him in New York City in early August.Campbell often shares pieces of her academic work on her Facebook page, and ironically, she once shared an article questioning the the MeToo movement, a few months before Ansari was  himself accused of sexual misconduct.In October 2017, she shared an article titled, \u0027Literally, Why Can\u0027t I Say #MeToo?\u0027 by Total Sorority Move, in which the female author says she struggles to identify as a victim because she feels her own experiences with sexual misconduct, are not \u0027bad enough.\u0027 In January, Ansari was accused of sexual misconduct when an anonymous 23-year-old woman from Brooklyn claimed he ignored her verbal and non-verbal cues and repeatedly tried to pressure her into having sex with him after they went on a date last September. The accusations were made in a story on Babe.net, where the woman, under the pseudonym \u0027Grace\u0027 alleged that she had felt \u0027violated\u0027 by the comic\u0027s overly-aggressive gestures.Meryl Streep leads a host of A-list celebrities including...The spectacular fall of Les Moonves: The chilling claims of...Share this article    The pair were spotted canoodling as they watch the tennis match.

I guess it\u0027s because they can\u0027t answer the question or make it go away, so they try to make us go away.\u0027 Sir Derek has claimed the dramas were written by Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, who hid behind William Shakespeare because, he said, a nobleman could not be seen as a common playwright.Sir Mark has previously pointed out that details about Italy in the plays are \u0027exact\u0027 and the Earl had widely toured the country.He added the \u0027big thing\u0027 in the Earl\u0027s favour was his wide knowledge of Italy where 14 of of Bard\u0027s plays are set. But Elton has said he \u0027loathes conspiracy theories\u0027 around Shakespeare and added there was a \u0027massive amount of proof\u0027 suggesting he was the true author.He also compared the row over Shakespeare\u0027s authorship to rejecting climate change and said \u0027fact denial\u0027 was a \u0027threat to society\u0027.The episode airs on BBC2 tomorrow at 8.30pm. Mark Rylance ridiculed by upstarts over comedy of errors | News | The Times"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/11/09/5005CC4400000578-6154285-image-a-9_1536654538862.jpg","title":"Raheem Sterling fools ball pit family day out","story":"    The Manchester City player appears in the video alongside his fiancée Paige Milian and children Melody and Thiago          Raheem is filmed by Paige, 23, with Thiago scaling a climbing wall – and then tumbling to the padded floorThey are then seen attempting to enter the Sea Life centre at Manchester\u0027s Trafford Centre before erting to a Lego store because the queue was too long.The two children are shown excitedly choosing toys in the store before the action cuts to the Infla Nation indoor play centre.Celebrity Big Brother: Ryan Thomas is crowned WINNER as he...Top art dealer Oliver Hoare who was Diana¿s lover and...Share this articleRaheem – struggling to keep his tracksuit bottoms above his waist – is filmed by Paige, 23, burying giggling Thiago in a sea of purple balls, zooming down a slide with the tot before scaling a climbing wall – and then tumbling to the padded floor.He was also filmed swimming across the sea balls in the ball pool before the family is captured back in the car for the journey home.

Vanselow, pictured, has \u0027inconsistencies\u0027 in his version of events, according to a doctor, including what side of his son\u0027s head was injuredDr Aung added: \u0027I was concerned about the lack of obvious emotional response by the parents during the interview.\u0027The boy cannot be named nor any photograph used by court order.Vanselow and Wilkins have each denied inidual counts of assaulting the baby with intent to cause grievous bodily harm on September 22, 2016.They have also pleaded not guilty to alternative counts of assaulting him causing grievous bodily harm without intent. These charges relate to the head injuries.The parents have also denied causing or allowing a child to suffer serious physical harm to a child between his birth on July 2 and September 23 that year.Wilkins alone has pleaded not guilty to assaulting the baby causing actual bodily harm between August 31 and September 3.

The penal system was a rehabilitatary one and self-supporting, a far cry from the Western, capitalist notion of prison.\u0027The aim was to correct and change the ways of criminals. If it couldn\u0027t be done in 10 years, it couldn\u0027t be done at all.Labour split deepens as Corbyn refuses to protect MPs...Brexit\u0027s no Picnic!

Relatives of those murdered in the gulags shamed the students on Twitter - pointing out that their loved ones had perished in the institution they were defending          Another relative of someone murdered in the gulag told the students they need to be educated in the realities of Stalin\u0027s Russia          Anne Applebaum, a respected historian who has written about gulags, said the description on the controversial tweets was \u0027not even close\u0027 to being the truth (file pic)Kora Persefona wrote on Twitter: \u0027My grandmother was sentenced to 15 years in GULAG for being a daughter of \u0027enemies of the people\u0027 and a christian, was freed after 10 due to pregnancy. \u0027I can\u0027t believe, what I\u0027ve just read. They shamelessly lie about my culture and my history.\u0027And another Twitter user going under the handle Earlsfield Girl, wrote: \u0027You disgust me. My great grandfather was sent to Siberia to die in a gulag in the Soviet era. \u0027You either have 0 education in history (a very poor reflection on your institution) or you know you are lying and are therefore quite evil. \u0027Apologise or choose which you are.\u0027The Goldsmiths account later deleted the tweets after being met with the fierce backlash. A spokesman for Goldsmiths, University of London said: \u0027Goldsmiths has a erse and inclusive community with many people caring deeply about trans rights. \u0027In this exchange, the language used was clearly inappropriate and we support the decision of the Students\u0027 Union to suspend the student society with immediate effect.

Since the crash in 1996, Mr Reed\u0027s healing process has left him with thin, patchy hair  The one-day, six hour process involved around 3,000 hair follicles being removed from the thick-growing back of his head and transplanted into the required areas\u0027Undergoing a hair transplant is expensive but as far as I\u0027m concerned it was worth every penny.\u0027The crash occurred when Mr Reed was just 21, and enjoying a night out with friends. He had decided not to drink and instead drove out to a pub in Pontefract, West Yorks in his Peugeot 306. Mr Reed was driving home when his vehicle struck a patch a black ice, resulting in him losing control and flipping the car over.As the Peugeot careered towards a halt, Mr Reed\u0027s head touched the road removing around half his scalp. Firefighters took two hours to cut him free, and Ant was then rushed to hospital in Wakefield. Surgeons set to work to repair what he describes as a \u0027wedge shape\u0027 chunk in the middle of his head around the hairline.Silicone implants had to be placed in the front, top and back of his head and a saline solution was then pumped into a tube to bring Mr Reed\u0027s head back to a normal shape.          Although Mr Reed miraculously survived the impact he claims he was left looking like the \u0027Elephant Man\u0027 and his scalp had to be pieced back together using a graft from his legMr Reed added: \u0027I remember setting out in my car and then nothing until I woke up in hospital the next day. My car had landed on its roof and the doctors knew from my injuries that my head had come into contact with the road.\u0027I had no brain injuries and I felt lucky to be alive, but I\u0027d been left with quite serious damage to the front and top of my head. An area in the middle just below where the hairline starts had suffered and I was told my scalp was too badly damaged to repair itself.\u0027My car was a total write-off but that didn\u0027t seem too important in the context of lying injured in hospital. I was young at the time and you really don\u0027t want issues with your hair, but that was what I was faced with.\u0027My scalp was too badly damaged to repair itself and so the medics took a skin graft from one of my legs and put that onto my head. They then cut some skin from the side of my head and put this around to the front of my forehead because there was nothing there that could be saved either. I put myself in their hands but I knew there would be more surgery to follow.\u0027          Mr Reed said: \u0027I\u0027m very happy with the procedure and though I\u0027m a little thinner than I was in my younger days, my hair is substantially better than it was before I had the transplant\u0027\u0027The saline process was very painful, it was like having your head set on fire. The implants worked, although one silicone bag split through the skin and even today my right eyebrow is at a slight angle due to not being stretched sufficiently.\u0027The accident also left me with whiplash, from which I suffered for next eight months. Overall, I felt I looked like the Elephant Man when the silicone implants were at their biggest.\u0027  Mr Reed with his wife and children after the transplant, which he is \u0027very happy\u0027 with\u0027When I was 21, no-one had heard about hair transplants and if they had, then it was only mentioned in a jokey kind of way.\u0027It was definitely not something to be taken seriously, especially for a man, it wasn\u0027t really something they were expected to consider.\u0027But I\u0027d receded to the point where there was about an inch in the centre of my forehead that stood out, it was like a little strip right in the middle. I also had some scars at the side of my head, although they weren\u0027t as much of an issue.\u0027I thought about what could be done and so decided to look into my options quite seriously. Cheaper options were available but I knew which one came with the likelihood of the best results and I was happy to go with that.\u0027Dr Farjo said: \u0027People come to us for all kinds for reasons, but Ant\u0027s story was a little different to those we normally hear. When someone begins to lose their hair, it can have quite serious implications on their mental wellbeing.\u0027And in Ant\u0027s case, his situation was complicated further by the fact that the skin grafts he\u0027d received following the crash had also impacted on his natural hairline.\u0027We\u0027re delighted that Ant has had a positive reaction to the surgery and we\u0027d urge anyone in a similar position following head trauma to seek professional help.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/11/12/5006BBDB00000578-6154899-image-m-13_1536665573701.jpg","title":"Paramedics Spalding Lincolnshire left note ambulance 5 note coffee","story":"    A mystery neighbour posted this note on an East Midlands ambulance when it parked on their drive to help save a patient on Sunday           The ambulance service was so touched they posted a picture of the note on their Twitter Fury as traffic wardens slap £130 parking tickets on...Mother accused of seriously injuring her baby ¿told nurse...Share this articleThe East Midlands Ambulance Service tweeted a picture of the note with the caption: \u0027Lincolnshire Paramedic Julie Wade \u0026amp ECA Catherine Whitehouse were attending a patient in Spalding yesterday when they had a #bluelighthappy moment. \u0027When they left to take the patient to the ambulance they were greeted with this #EMAZING note.\u0027          Pictured: Catherine Whitehouse of the East Midlands Ambulance Service was one of the medics who was given £5 by the mystery neighbour The crew admitted they didn\u0027t have time to buy a coffee as they were rushing the patient to hospital but would make up for it later in the day.This isn\u0027t the first time ambulance crews have found a thank you note for them.One of the Tongham Ambulance Crews for South East Coast Ambulance Service found a note on their ambulance while attending to a patient on a 999 call in Camberley in the early hours of August 27.The note read: \u0027Just wanted to say a massive thank you for being out at all hours of the day and night and being true heroes.\u0027I can\u0027t begin to imagine how hard your job must be so have some breakfast on me!

It is also the surname both princes used during their time in the military. However, upon marriage to Kate Middleton, Prince William became the Duke of Cambridge meaning that his three children will likely follow the tradition of using the father’s title as the surname. This means that should the Duke and Duchess follow the Royal Family tradition, their children will use their father’s title, Sussex as the surname.In the same way, Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice use the surname York, after their father’s title Prince Andrew, the Duke of York.Since 1960, the Queen’s children and her descendants would also be allowed to use the surname of Mountbatten-Windsor. However, the Royal Family website confirms: ‘For the most part, members of the Royal Family who are entitled to the style and dignity of HRH Prince or Princess do not need a surname, but if at any time any of them do need a surname (such as upon marriage), that surname is Mountbatten-Windsor.’Bachelor in Paradise: Are Kevin and Astrid back together after finale break up?Who is Daniel Zhang?

The MAC was asked by the Government to carry out analysis of the impact of international students on the UK\u0027s education system, economy and societyWhile the lowest quarter of British masters graduates had average earnings of £20,500, the figure for those from outside the EU was just £15,400. The MAC said many responses to a call for evidence wanted a more generous post-study work regime.Currently, PhD visas allow students to remain in the UK for four months after expected course completion, although to an extension scheme that permits a year of work.Masters students also have up to four months, except those in a pilot programme allowing six months.The MAC recommended that PhD students automatically get one year\u0027s leave to remain after finishing their courses.It proposed an extension to six months for all Masters students, but called for a \u0027more thorough\u0027 review of whether this is appropriate.In a finding the Committee acknowledged would disappoint the higher education sector, it did not recommend a separate post-study work visa scheme.On the Government\u0027s net migration target, which has never been met, the report said removing students \u0027would be difficult technically and, if done correctly, would make almost no difference to the net migration figures\u0027.However, it suggested there may be an \u0027image problem\u0027 fuelled by \u0027repeated discussions\u0027 of students in the net migration target.\u0027If there is a problem with students in the net migration target, it is with the target itself rather than the inclusion of students in that target,\u0027 Prof Manning said.\u0027Summarising migration policy through the net migration target may give the impression that the government seeks to reduce the net migration of all types of migrants including students.\u0027 The report pointed out that other countries did not calculate equivalent net migration figures that were used to set targets.It added: \u0027The net migration target is a political target and the IPS net migration figure does not have to form the basis of the government\u0027s net migration target.           The report was commissioned last year by then-Home Secretary Amber Rudd (pictured), who was leading the campaign in Cabinet to persuade Mrs May to back down\u0027The government could choose to use other data sources to set targets related to migration, such as visa or settlement statistics. Or it could choose not to have a target at all and summarise its ambitions on net migration in a different way.\u0027The Committee also concluded international student numbers should remain uncapped.Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of campaign group Migration Watch UK, welcomed the \u0027excellent\u0027 report.He said: \u0027The MAC endorsement of the inclusion of students in the migration statistics should put this issue to bed. It is also right that the post-study work regime should remain carefully policed.\u0027A Home Office spokesman said: \u0027As this report makes clear, international students play an important and positive role in our education system, economy and society.\u0027We are committed to ensuring we continue to attract the best international students.\u0027Professor Dame Janet Beer, president of Universities UK, said: \u0027While the report recognises the enormous contribution international students make to life in the UK, we are disappointed with its main recommendations.\u0027We agree that the Government and the sector should continue to work together to grow the number of international students, but growth will only be possible if we have an immigration system that encourages talented international students to choose the UK.\u0027    "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/11/16/4FDC941A00000578-6155781-image-a-2_1536679079862.jpg","title":"Who Daniel Zhang Alibaba CEO replacement revealed Jack Ma reveals stepping down","story":"    Zhang will succeed Jack Ma as executive chairman of the Alibaba Group in September 2019Who is Daniel Zhang?Daniel Zhang is a businessman slated to take over as executive chairman of Alibaba, succeeding Jack Ma.He was born in Shanghai, China on January 11, 1972.After studying finance at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, Zhang served as the chief executive officer of the Chinese video game company Shanda Interactive Entertainment and also as a high-level manager at PricewaterhouseCoopers’s Shanghai office.Zhang joined Alibaba subsidiary Taobao in 2007 as its chief financial officer.

During the 16th and 17th centuries it belonged to the Snede family, being the dower house for Keele. It is believed some 22 members of that family were born here.In the middle of the 18th century it was bought by a lawyer, John Sparrow, who became the first chairman of the Stafford quarter sessions, famously preventing a massacre of Stafford residents at Radford Bank. He was also High Sherriff of the county, a position later held by Cecil Stafford Northcote whilst at Bishton.Upon John Sparrow’s death, ownership passed to his eldest daughter, Charlotte. She never married but is still remembered today by the children of Colwich school which she founded. She added the east and west wings of the house in about 1820.The Stafford Northcotes moved here in 1946 and made it into St Bede’s School. Many pupils have gone on to lead distinguished careers taking with them a unique experience of family-orientated school life and fun. There have been five babies born at Bishton Hall.

Since the crash in 1996, Mr Reed\u0027s healing process has left him with thin, patchy hair  The one-day, six hour process involved around 3,000 hair follicles being removed from the thick-growing back of his head and transplanted into the required areas\u0027Undergoing a hair transplant is expensive but as far as I\u0027m concerned it was worth every penny.\u0027The crash occurred when Mr Reed was just 21, and enjoying a night out with friends. He had decided not to drink and instead drove out to a pub in Pontefract, West Yorks in his Peugeot 306. Mr Reed was driving home when his vehicle struck a patch a black ice, resulting in him losing control and flipping the car over.As the Peugeot careered towards a halt, Mr Reed\u0027s head touched the road removing around half his scalp. Firefighters took two hours to cut him free, and Ant was then rushed to hospital in Wakefield. Surgeons set to work to repair what he describes as a \u0027wedge shape\u0027 chunk in the middle of his head around the hairline.Silicone implants had to be placed in the front, top and back of his head and a saline solution was then pumped into a tube to bring Mr Reed\u0027s head back to a normal shape.          Although Mr Reed miraculously survived the impact he claims he was left looking like the \u0027Elephant Man\u0027 and his scalp had to be pieced back together using a graft from his legMr Reed added: \u0027I remember setting out in my car and then nothing until I woke up in hospital the next day. My car had landed on its roof and the doctors knew from my injuries that my head had come into contact with the road.\u0027I had no brain injuries and I felt lucky to be alive, but I\u0027d been left with quite serious damage to the front and top of my head. An area in the middle just below where the hairline starts had suffered and I was told my scalp was too badly damaged to repair itself.\u0027My car was a total write-off but that didn\u0027t seem too important in the context of lying injured in hospital. I was young at the time and you really don\u0027t want issues with your hair, but that was what I was faced with.\u0027My scalp was too badly damaged to repair itself and so the medics took a skin graft from one of my legs and put that onto my head. They then cut some skin from the side of my head and put this around to the front of my forehead because there was nothing there that could be saved either. I put myself in their hands but I knew there would be more surgery to follow.\u0027          Mr Reed said: \u0027I\u0027m very happy with the procedure and though I\u0027m a little thinner than I was in my younger days, my hair is substantially better than it was before I had the transplant\u0027\u0027The saline process was very painful, it was like having your head set on fire. The implants worked, although one silicone bag split through the skin and even today my right eyebrow is at a slight angle due to not being stretched sufficiently.\u0027The accident also left me with whiplash, from which I suffered for next eight months. Overall, I felt I looked like the Elephant Man when the silicone implants were at their biggest.\u0027  Mr Reed with his wife and children after the transplant, which he is \u0027very happy\u0027 with\u0027When I was 21, no-one had heard about hair transplants and if they had, then it was only mentioned in a jokey kind of way.\u0027It was definitely not something to be taken seriously, especially for a man, it wasn\u0027t really something they were expected to consider.\u0027But I\u0027d receded to the point where there was about an inch in the centre of my forehead that stood out, it was like a little strip right in the middle. I also had some scars at the side of my head, although they weren\u0027t as much of an issue.\u0027I thought about what could be done and so decided to look into my options quite seriously. Cheaper options were available but I knew which one came with the likelihood of the best results and I was happy to go with that.\u0027Dr Farjo said: \u0027People come to us for all kinds for reasons, but Ant\u0027s story was a little different to those we normally hear. When someone begins to lose their hair, it can have quite serious implications on their mental wellbeing.\u0027And in Ant\u0027s case, his situation was complicated further by the fact that the skin grafts he\u0027d received following the crash had also impacted on his natural hairline.\u0027We\u0027re delighted that Ant has had a positive reaction to the surgery and we\u0027d urge anyone in a similar position following head trauma to seek professional help.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/11/13/50061AD200000578-0-image-m-46_1536668554721.jpg","title":"Remote Scottish Highlands home private beach sale 750 000","story":"    Very big house in the country: The vast estate, which is perfect for those seeking solitude or just a break from the rat race, is on a picturesque peninsula in the Highlands often described as \u0027Britain\u0027s last wilderness\u0027.

The MAC was asked by the Government to carry out analysis of the impact of international students on the UK\u0027s education system, economy and societyWhile the lowest quarter of British masters graduates had average earnings of £20,500, the figure for those from outside the EU was just £15,400. The MAC said many responses to a call for evidence wanted a more generous post-study work regime.Currently, PhD visas allow students to remain in the UK for four months after expected course completion, although to an extension scheme that permits a year of work.Masters students also have up to four months, except those in a pilot programme allowing six months.The MAC recommended that PhD students automatically get one year\u0027s leave to remain after finishing their courses.It proposed an extension to six months for all Masters students, but called for a \u0027more thorough\u0027 review of whether this is appropriate.In a finding the Committee acknowledged would disappoint the higher education sector, it did not recommend a separate post-study work visa scheme.On the Government\u0027s net migration target, which has never been met, the report said removing students \u0027would be difficult technically and, if done correctly, would make almost no difference to the net migration figures\u0027.However, it suggested there may be an \u0027image problem\u0027 fuelled by \u0027repeated discussions\u0027 of students in the net migration target.\u0027If there is a problem with students in the net migration target, it is with the target itself rather than the inclusion of students in that target,\u0027 Prof Manning said.\u0027Summarising migration policy through the net migration target may give the impression that the government seeks to reduce the net migration of all types of migrants including students.\u0027 The report pointed out that other countries did not calculate equivalent net migration figures that were used to set targets.It added: \u0027The net migration target is a political target and the IPS net migration figure does not have to form the basis of the government\u0027s net migration target.           The report was commissioned last year by then-Home Secretary Amber Rudd (pictured), who was leading the campaign in Cabinet to persuade Mrs May to back down\u0027The government could choose to use other data sources to set targets related to migration, such as visa or settlement statistics. Or it could choose not to have a target at all and summarise its ambitions on net migration in a different way.\u0027The Committee also concluded international student numbers should remain uncapped.Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of campaign group Migration Watch UK, welcomed the \u0027excellent\u0027 report.He said: \u0027The MAC endorsement of the inclusion of students in the migration statistics should put this issue to bed. It is also right that the post-study work regime should remain carefully policed.\u0027A Home Office spokesman said: \u0027As this report makes clear, international students play an important and positive role in our education system, economy and society.\u0027We are committed to ensuring we continue to attract the best international students.\u0027Professor Dame Janet Beer, president of Universities UK, said: \u0027While the report recognises the enormous contribution international students make to life in the UK, we are disappointed with its main recommendations.\u0027We agree that the Government and the sector should continue to work together to grow the number of international students, but growth will only be possible if we have an immigration system that encourages talented international students to choose the UK.\u0027    "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/11/17/2BAEED9C00000578-6156049-image-a-60_1536682397116.jpg","title":"Chancellor Philip Hammond hints fuel duty rise Budget","story":"    Answering questions in the Commons today, the Chancellor said he would be looking again at findings by officials that the benefits of the fuel duty freeze outweighed the costs          Any move to increase duty will spark fury from motorists, with pump prices already running at the highest level for yearsAny move to increase duty will spark fury from motorists, with pump prices already running at the highest level for years.Answering questions in the Commons today, Mr Hammond said: \u0027To support British households, the Government has frozen fuel duty for eight successive years.\u0027By April 2019 these freezes will have saved the average car driver £850 compared to the pre-2010 escalator and the average van driver over £2,100.\u0027But it is important that we remember the other side of this coin, the fuel duty freezes since 2011 have meant the Exchequer has foregone around £46billion in revenues through to 201819 - and a further £38billion will be foregone over the budget forecast period as a result of these previously announced freezes.Official review attacks May\u0027s \u0027tens of thousands\u0027...So much for keeping quiet!

During the 16th and 17th centuries it belonged to the Snede family, being the dower house for Keele. It is believed some 22 members of that family were born here.In the middle of the 18th century it was bought by a lawyer, John Sparrow, who became the first chairman of the Stafford quarter sessions, famously preventing a massacre of Stafford residents at Radford Bank. He was also High Sherriff of the county, a position later held by Cecil Stafford Northcote whilst at Bishton.Upon John Sparrow’s death, ownership passed to his eldest daughter, Charlotte. She never married but is still remembered today by the children of Colwich school which she founded. She added the east and west wings of the house in about 1820.The Stafford Northcotes moved here in 1946 and made it into St Bede’s School.

As a child, Piano would marvel at the ships, which he likens to moving buildings. “That’s part of the reason my buildings are always flying vessels,” he says. His first design project was indeed a boat. He built it in his father’s garage, only to discover it was too big to get out – they had to break the garage doors.Piano is hi-tech architecture’s high priest, renowned for buildings such as Paris’s Pompidou Centre, Kansai airport, the New York Times headquarters, the new Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Shard, London. His buildings are not always conspicuously visually “iconic” but this respectful exhibition brings home just how experimental the Italian architect’s career has been. The best of his work combines efficient, lightweight engineering and a love of putting materials together with a sense of social, even spiritual purpose. “You become an architect to change the world not to seduce,” he says, though it helps that he is thoughtful, cultured, softly spoken and charming.The nautical influences were evident in Piano’s breakthrough “flying vessel”: the Pompidou Centre – still one of the most audacious structures in modern architecture, with its industrial, inside-out concept. Even in sketches here, it looks the stuff of sci-fi comics (by way of Archigram) rather than real life, but he clearly learned his lesson from the boat-in-the-garage episode: the Pompidou worked brilliantly, and still works. Piano was just 34 when he and Richard and Su Rogers won the design competition in 1971. The rest is history.Two rooms of this exhibition are devoted to 16 of Piano’s “greatest hits”, each soberly presented on its own white, square table, neatly laid out with drawings, photographs and models. Larger models and mock-ups hang from the ceiling like natural history specimens: skeletal structural systems and rounded, sculptural forms.That experimental boldness flows through the works – the heroic, 1.7km-long terminal of Kansai airport, built on an artificial island in Osaka Bay (it was recently flooded by Typhoon Jebi but is now reopening) the undulating grass roof of the California Academy of Sciences the Menil Collection in Houston, Texas, whose curving concrete louvres control light and heat, and give the minimal building a distinctive identity. A fair few Piano buildings have ided opinion, such as the Shard (there are some planning documents on display here), and with more than 100 projects to his name, there are certainly a few bland and unloved Piano buildings out there – the garish Central St Giles Court in central London, for example – but there is no mention of those here.In a third, darkened central room, Thomas Riedelsheimer’s 17-minute film – a relaxed conversation with the architect – plays on two walls. The centrepiece is a huge plywood model of an imaginary island, whose bays and hills and valleys are dotted with mored than 100 white plastic scale models of Piano’s works – a Pianotropolis, if you will. Aficionados can have fun playing “name that Piano”. The Shard is the size of a small candle, near the centre. His “Diogene” one-room cabin (situated at Vitra’s campus in Weil am Rhein in real life) I initially mistook for a stray speck of polystyrene.For those familiar with his work, there is a wealth of depth and context to e into here, illuminating Piano’s design process. However, novices might have to work harder to get a sense of the finished buildings. Architecture is always difficult to communicate within the confines of a gallery exhibition, and, if there’s a complaint with this one, it’s that knowledge of the finished buildings is assumed more than conveyed. There is some sensual colour in the form of discreet sound installations triggered by proximity – orchestral noises for the Parco della Musica concert hall, jet engines at Kansai airport – but many of the photographs are little bigger than postcards.My personal favourite Piano building, for example, is the Jean-Marie Tjibaou Cultural Centre in Nouméa, New Caledonia, which I am never likely to see in real life. It is an evocative collection of beehive-like wooden pavilions, combining modern engineering and traditional building techniques, that seem to melt into the air as they rise (a recurring Piano trope). I came away with a sense of how it was made, but, despite the tropical bird sounds, not what it was like to be there.On the upside, many of the artefacts from Piano’s studio are appreciable on their own merits. A component from the IBM Travelling Pavilion (another ahead-of-its-time structure) is a thing of beauty: a chunky, machined steel joint spliced into a curved strut of striped, laminated wood. Or best of all are the large-scale sections hand-drawn by longtime office member Shunji Ishida, which he has subtly populated with colleagues and famous figures. There’s Albert Einstein and Leonardo da Vinci in the longitudinal section of the IBM Travelling Pavilion, and there’s Claudio Abbado conducting the orchestra in the Parco della Musica, with Piano on cello.One of Piano’s architectural tenets is that his often austere structures are animated by the human activity that takes place within them, but, apart from Piano’s presence in the film, that human element is sometimes lacking here. Visitors may have to provide it themselves.• Renzo Piano: The Art of Making Buildings is at the Royal Academy of Arts, London from 15 September to 20 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f659326284f5bdbfecbfcfa61c8c5478b25aca9/3_0_960_576/master/960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f18150a6d1137882e9b3395fe3e9e8ba","title":"the clock review christian marclay tate modern london","story":"Christian Marclay’s epic work – a clock created from film clips that tells the actual time – ought to be bleak. But time really does fly when you watch this 24-hour miracleIt’s 8.10am and I’m late for my appointment at Tate Modern. I watch the faces of passengers as the train pulls into London Bridge. It’s a Monday and the time is going too fast. One man sweats as he checks his watch. On his way to a bank heist, perhaps.I didn’t think any of that on my train at the time, though. I revisited my journey after sinking into a white sofa and watching The Clock, Christian Marclay’s epic montage of film clips featuring clockfaces that tells the actual time. Only then, gazing at the cinema screen that’s been built at Tate Modern, did I understand that everyone on a rush-hour train is united by something magical: we’re all sharing the same instant in time.Time as we know it is a humanising fiction that binds us together. It is community. This is the life-affirming message of The Clock and, surely, the reason why it has become such a well-loved classic of contemporary art, ever since its creation eight years ago.When the screen says 8.23, I check my phone and find it’s telling the same time. A gaggle of clips from the 1950s and 60s signals that it’s time for the first cigarette of the day. Ashtrays full from the previous night are getting fresh ash tapped into them. Meanwhile, in a clip from the 1993 film Falling Down, Michael Douglas is in his car in a traffic jam, face tense and twitchy as he heads for a crazed rampage. And Richard Burton as a cockney gangster serves his mum breakfast in bed in a clip from – I think – the 1971 film Villain.All these moments contain clocks – digital clocks, grandfather clocks, watches, alarm clocks or just the time on a TV newsflash – and that time is the same as the time your watch says. The Clock is a highly reliable clock. I am sure there is an art collector somewhere who owns a copy and projects it in the kitchen on a permanent loop to tell the time.This concordance of fictional and real time has subversive consequences. When Jimmy Cagney checks the time as he nervously waits for a big jail break, and he has the same time as you, the barrier between fiction and reality is broken. There’s an instant of empathy. You and he are in the same predicament. We are all prisoners of time.Shouldn’t that be a bleak thought? One crackling monochrome clip shows a sinister figure with a sickle. In art, the passing of time was traditionally a memento mori, a reminder of death. Hourglasses and clocks in Renaissance paintings are doom-laden symbols. The Clock, however, is not a downer at all. It’s an upper. And I use that word advisedly for the longer you watch it, the more addictive it becomes. There will be several 24-hour screenings in its Tate run, and they deserve to be packed out because time really does fly when you’re watching The Clock.This is partly due to the pleasure its sheer ingenuity inspires. The Clock is a 21st-century answer to the elaborate mechanical clocks premodern artisans built for the town halls of central European cities. Just as those ancient clocks amaze with their sculpted wooden figures that rotate on the hour as chimes resonate on cobbled squares, so we marvel at Marclay’s technical achievement. How many hours of watching films, rewinding, freezing, isolating and grabbing brief glimpses of timepieces, went into this miracle of digital craft?One question does arise about Marclay’s film. Entrancing as it is, does it actually say that much about time? Isn’t it a bit pre-Einsteinian in the way it portrays time as a single universal flow of moments? After all, modern physics sees time as non-linear. The idea of a single clock measuring out all our lives is a myth. After all, not all clocks tell the same time. Hours and minutes are a useful fiction, not an absolute.In fact, The Clock reveals this in subtle and seductive ways. Its rhythm is emotional. As the moods of different scenes and sequences change, time itself seems faster or slower. You slow to the pace of a stopped train or speed to the ticking of a time bomb.The Clock is a chronicle of cinema, a history of the modern world and a meditation on the mystery of time. It is above all a great work of art that touches the truth of being human. We fear time, but it makes us who we are. We tick to the same beat.• The Clock is at Tate Modern, London, from 14 September to 20 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae1ff472cb9cd8026e45e9b6468bf6bdc7d01cee/280_492_1960_1176/master/1960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ce76ac111aa2c69c12cb27888047afc","title":"van dycks portraits future charles ii sister sale","story":"Works estimated to fetch £2.6m-£3.8m are highlights of London auction at Sotheby’sTwo works by Van Dyck, the artist favoured by Charles I for his unfailingly flattering portraits of the short, bandy-legged king, are to be auctioned for the first time in almost a century.The portraits are of the Stuart king’s eldest children, the 11-year-old Prince of Wales, who would become Charles II, and his nine-year-old sister Mary, who would become mother of the future king William III.Estimated to fetch between £2.6m to £3.8m combined, they are among the highlights of Sotheby’s Old Master evening sale in London on 5 December, and are being sold from a private collection.They are among the very last works that Van Dyck painted for his royal patron, and were completed shortly before the artist’s death in December 1641 at the age of 42. It is possible that they are the portraits listed as the Prince and the Princess which were recorded as being among the possessions left in the artist’s studio in Blackfriars, London, on his death.The Portrait of Charles II when Prince of Wales (estimate £2m-£3m) depicts the future monarch standing in armour with the ribbon of the Garter, with his left hand on the hilt of his sword and his right on the head of a stick.The Portrait of Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange (estimate £600,000-£800,000), was painted shortly after her marriage, aged nine, to Prince Willem of Orange.Van Dyck’s royal patron would survive him for just eight years before being executed for treason outside the Banqueting House in Whitehall on 30 January 1649.Alex Bell, co-chairman of Sotheby’s Old Masters department, said: “Van Dyck was responsible for creating enduring images of Charles I and his court, and in these exceptionally well-preserved portraits of his two eldest children we see the artist use his painterly skill to acknowledge both the youth and the status of his royal subjects. “The tumultuous history of the Stuart court has always captured people’s imagination and with the additional interest sparked by the fascinating exhibitions in London this year, it is particularly timely for these royal portraits, which are extremely rare to the market, to come up for sale.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/562bfbbfe921ef78cd2982f20924dc52cdc47685/0_636_3543_2125/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93d5d8cc9a210f35129cb2ae74555199","title":"memorable monuments to american modernism in pictures","story":"Photographs from the Pioneers of American Modernism exhibition of works by the outstanding American architectural photographer Ezra Stoller – on at the Lumiere Brothers Centre, Moscow until 2 December.

Thankfully, Peter Astbury’s award-wining health tech wristband now offers a stylish solutionPerimenopause – also known as the menopause transition – is experienced by millions of women every year. The months or years leading up to the menopause can have very similar symptoms to the menopause itself, although some of these symptoms may change or disappear over time. “The most common symptoms are hot flushes and night sweats, but there are also other symptoms that are less thought about,” explains Dr Louise Newson, who specialises in treating women going through the perimenopause and menopause. “Migraines, palpitations, memory problems, low mood, anxiety, joint pain, muscle stiffness, poor sleep, reduced libido,” she adds.It’s the more obscure symptoms – migraines, low mood, tiredness – that many women fail to identify as part of perimenopause, something Newson partly puts down to the “big taboo” of the menopause itself. This lack of knowledge can have a severe impact. Not realising that symptoms are part of a bigger picture, many women fail to seek appropriate treatment. Newson cites examples of patients who falsely believe their memory loss is due to dementia, or who are incorrectly prescribed high doses of antidepressants by doctors who haven’t taken hormonal changes into account. But there may be other options. The Perimenopause Challenge is a category in the AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You Awards that aims to find technologies that can help women track the symptoms of perimenopause – enabling them to get better support and information. The Grace Wristband, developed by designer Peter Astbury and 2018 winner of the category, operates by easing one of the worst symptoms of the perimenopause – hot flushes. At the onset of a hot flush, says Astbury, the hypothalamus (the part of the brain that regulates body temperature) is falsely triggered. The Grace Wristband contains a set of sensors that detect this reaction, activating a “cooling tile” that delivers “intense cooling to the wrist”. The goal is to “use this sensation to signal to the hypothalamus that the body should retain heat” – a response directly opposite to a hot flush. This could, says Astbury, prevent women from waking up in the night with hot flushes, alleviating many of the sleep-related issues faced during perimenopause. Astbury describes one woman going through perimenopause who, waking up sweating 15 or 20 times a night, would get up and run her wrists under cold water to cool down. “I realised at that point that creating a product that could deal with night sweats was just as important as helping with hot flushes during the day,” he says. Astbury started developing Grace when he was just 22 and attending Loughborough University – a time when, perhaps unsurprisingly, he knew “next to nothing about menopause”.During his research, Astbury heard stories from many women – and it was these that left the biggest impression. “I regularly receive messages from women desperate to be involved as research participants so they can use Grace as soon as possible,” he says. As Newson – who was one of the judges for the Perimenopause Challenge category – points out, women’s health issues are not always discussed in an open or comfortable way something Astbury hopes will change.“In the UK, and the west in general, we have developed an environment where people don’t feel comfortable talking about things like perimenopause because of associations with ageing,” he says. “Many cultures don’t suffer from the same taboos as us – one study of Mayan culture found that the menopause was associated with freedom and status, and was therefore a positive milestone in life.”The design of the wristband, says Astbury, is an attempt to break down this stigma. “The aim is for women to wear Grace with confidence – the hope is that more people will feel they can openly talk about menopause.” Astbury is hopeful that a change is taking place: “Women are increasingly talking openly about menopause and its effects,” he says. “I hope that this change gains traction and that our culture continues to evolve and become more and more open about all health-related topics.”We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream.

At Bocketts Farm in Surrey, she was minding her one-year-old and newborn baby when another mother came running past, frantically searching for her more mobile six-year-old. He had wandered off on his own, no one knew where he’d got to, and there was no way to contact him. Wong thought: “Why can’t we be more connected to our younger children?”Enter the Gator Watch, a wearable tracking device with call functionality for kids who are too young for a smartphone but old enough to want a little more independence. Wong had researched her idea and found that while there were similar products already on the market in other countries, such as China, there was nothing quite like this. And nothing at all in the UK: the market was desperate for something that filled this communication gap for five- to 10-year-old children. “When I talk to parents, everyone is in agreement,” says Wong. “No one wants to give their kid a smartphone before secondary school, they just feel there’s nothing in the market for what they want, which is pure connection.”The watch can make and receive calls from 13 trusted numbers, it has an SOS button, and if your child wanders beyond defined safe zones you’re alerted as it happens. After eight months working with a manufacturer, Wong brought the watch to market, and this year her company, Techsixtyfour, which is staffed by working mums, won the AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You Award for the Staying Independent with Tech Challenge. The category was set up to discover technologies that facilitate monitoring and emergency contact between caregivers and their charges.Last Christmas, Dave Housley bought the watch for his son Freddie, an eight-year-old kart-racing driver who spends a lot of time travelling to and from races: clocking up hundreds of miles is not an unusual way to spend a weekend for the Housley family. “At a kart race weekend, the kids are outside, they’re playing in the woods and doing stuff that kids should do. With this watch, we’ve got more confidence to let them do that because we can track them and we can get hold of them. It gives us a lot more confidence to let a kid be a kid in today’s world it gives you more confidence in letting them out of your sight.” The watch fulfils Housley’s need to know his son is safe, and it also works for Freddie. “He loved the whole concept of it,” says Housley. “It has that element of fun to it. He’s talking into it like it’s a James Bond watch.”The device has been a roaring success, and not only for reasons Wong predicted. It was always her plan to have the watch disconnected from the internet and social media, simply because she felt children should be able to have a childhood away from the glow of screens. But it wasn’t until she heard a policeman’s feedback that she realised it was solving a much bigger, and newer, societal problem.“He had bought the watch for his eight-year-old daughter because they live on an estate, and he was just afraid for his daughter to go outside,” she says. “But as a police officer, he knows that it’s far more dangerous for a child to stay at home and play on their screens. Parents might fear that allowing their children to go outside would mean they’d get kidnapped, but the amount of danger online is actually far higher – that parents are getting this wrong has been an eye-opener.”Wong has also found another vital use for the Gator Watch: helping older people. Ingrid Ehrlich’s husband, now 85, was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s two years ago. “A year and a half ago he went for the newspaper,” says Ehrlich. “He did it every morning, and one day he didn’t come back. It was an hour before he went into the newsagent and bought the paper. Nobody can find out what he did in that hour.”Since getting the watch, Ehrlich has stopped locking the doors of the house in case her husband wanders off. He comes and goes as he pleases, while she monitors a map on her computer. “It’s the only thing he does on his own, so I encourage it. He just feels that he has much more freedom.”We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream. Innovations in health technology are transforming the way we care for our minds and bodies.

Beyond advances in the manufacture of clothing, the whims of fashion, and the occasional fad – who remembers Levi’s twisted seam? – cotton has remained cotton, and polyester is still polyester.But an award-winning Italian design duo is trying to realise the potential of smart technology in clothing to improve lives.Emanuela Corti and Ivan Parati, who met while studying at the Polytechnic University of Milan, have developed Sensewear, a collection of smart clothing and accessories for people who suffer from SPD. Also known as sensory integration difficulties, SPD can affect the way people, particularly those on the autism spectrum, process everyday stimuli, from light to touch.Their innovative work won Corti and Parati an AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You Award as part of the AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You programme, which aims to identify inidual champions, innovators and organisations that are creating exciting and pioneering health tech. In addition to winning awards, Corti and Parati’s work has also gained the attention of research academics and manufacturers in Italy.“If it is not treated effectively, it can result in clumsiness, behavioural problems, anxiety, depression or failure at school,” says Corti, a product designer specialising in textiles and furniture. She says hypersensitivity is often part of SPD, which can result in an enhanced sensitivity to sounds, smells and physical contact. “The textures, stitches and labels in regular clothes can cause unsustainably painful reactions,” she says. Left untreated, these symptoms can be disabling, leading to social isolation, anxiety and low self-esteem.The couple, who now have a young daughter, started with comparatively low-tech solutions, looking at the potential for 3D knitting processes, for example, to reduce potential rubbing points. They also looked at ways to redesign – or to build into clothing – some of the specialised toys and medical accessories already available. “Our focus was on incorporating those therapies into everyday objects that would not stigmatise the user as a disabled person,” Corti says. “We wanted to create invisible magic.”But the designers also wanted to think big. What if the elements of a wardrobe could talk to each other? For this, Corti and Parati looked at some of the smart clothing that is starting to become available, typically now targeted at the fitness market, such as Nadi X smart yoga leggings, which pulse on different muscles to encourage correct positions, and the sports vests that measures an athlete’s heart rate and position.“Our smart T-shirt will collect vital data – such as heart rate, breath frequency and movement – which is processed by an app to indicate the stress level of the wearer. It can then trigger the functionalities of other garments in the collection,” says Corti.One such garment is an inflatable pullover, capable of delivering a targeted “hug” to a wearer in need. “Deep pressure or deep touch pressure therapy (DTP) is a firm, tactile sensory input that can consist of firm hugs, stroking or cuddling,” says Corti. “It can have a calming effect on children and adults. Many people affected by autism refuse physical contact with others, but might be happy with a mechanical surrogate.” Other Sensewear innovations include Biteme, a biteable silicon necklace that measures pressure, and an aromatic scarf that can emit familiar, comforting scents.“This is a visionary concept that materialises ideas initially described by Mary Temple Grandin,” says Cesare Furlanello, head of the research group at the Bruno Kessler Foundation in Trento, and an expert in the way machine learning can be applied to biomedical and environmental data. Grandin, now 70, is a US professor of animal science and campaigner for autism awareness. She specialises in the emotional as well as physical welfare of livestock, and also invented a mechanical “hug box” for humans, after noticing how confined cattle calmed down before being inoculated.“As a child, I craved to feel the comfort of being held, but I would pull away when people hugged me,” Grandin wrote in 1992 in a description of the machine, a sort of pneumatic cocoon with pressurised padding that allowed her to control her own hugging. She suffered panic attacks throughout her teenage years before building the device in early adulthood. “Gradually, my tolerance of being held by the squeeze machine grew. Knowing that I could initiate the pressure, and stop it if the stimulation became too intense, helped me to reduce the oversensitivity of my nervous system.”Medical vests that replicate this mechanism have already been developed, but Corti’s priority is to make smart clothing that looks cool. “If you have a difficulty you don’t want people to stare at you, right? You don’t want to feel different,” she says. This summer, a team including Furlanello will introduce some of the Sensewear range to children with autism, to explore its potential to make their lives easier. “Patients are very often reluctant to ‘wear’ cumbersome and ugly scientific devices,” says Furlanello, “but we expect Sensewear smart clothes will be much more acceptable, which will help researchers to collect data and expand the context of the study.”Corti now hopes that the ideas behind Sensewear’s smart clothing might one day find broader applications. “We would like to expand our philosophy to furniture, interior design and objects,” she says. “We think that everyone faces a certain degree of discomfort, so we are also thinking about people who just live in a hectic urban environment and might want protection from overwhelming sensations or stresses.”Imagine having a slow, firm hug, administered automatically and invisibly, on a delayed, crowded commuter train. There might well be a market for that.We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream. Innovations in health technology are transforming the way we care for our minds and bodies.

The shop is profitable and would have made an estimated £30,000 in a sale, but Morris said he wanted to give someone else the chance to realise their dream of running a bookshop. Over the last three months, anyone who spent more than £20 was eligible to be entered into a raffle to win it.The name of the winner, Ceisjan Van Heerden, who is from the Netherlands, was drawn out of a hat containing 59 others at a ceremony last week, as Abba’s The Winner Takes It All played to a crowd.Morris, who worked in the book industry for years before he opened his own shop, told the  that he had chosen to take early retirement at 52 after his osteoarthritis worsened.Van Heerden wasn’t at the prize draw, said Morris. “So I left him a message, and, when he phoned back, he said he’d had to have a sit down and a cup of coffee.”Van Heerden told the Tivyside Advertiser that he was “so shocked” when he heard he had won. “I love books and read a lot and just happened to be in the shop when a TV crew was making a film about Paul’s decision to raffle it off and I bought a ticket,” said Van Heerden.He officially takes over the shop on 5 November and said he is planning to run it with a friend from Iceland, who is now moving to west Wales. Although the pair have been friends online for nine years, they have yet to meet face to face. “It might sound strange, but we are sure we can make it work. It is just an amazing opportunity,” he said.Morris said that a number of his customers had said that they had always fancied running a bookshop. He got into the business after stumbling across a retired bookseller selling around 18,000 books on eBay. “I thought it sounded fantastic. He’d moved the contents of his bookshop into his house, and wanted everything to go to the same person. We did a deal, and a friend and I drove a lorry to Great Yarmouth to collect them all.” If it wasn’t for his osteoarthritis, said Morris, he would still be running Bookends. “I always wanted to have a bookshop, but I’ve had my stint, and now it’s time for someone else to take over,” he said.

The brands, with fictitious names like Redmere, Woodside and Willow, are expected to be sold in Jack’s.More recently it has replaced its cheapest “Everyday Value” brand with generic names like Bay Fishmongers, Ms Mollys and Butcher’s Choice, which would also fit the bill.There is also a new Jack’s branded grocery range. In Chatteris it was possible to see Nestlé and Cadbury’s chocolate on the shelves.Shore Capital analyst Clive Black expects the Jack’s chain to encompass 100 stores, including around 60 of its small “” supermarkets, some of which are struggling.“Tesco has a cohort of problem stores where the traditional Tesco offer is a square peg in a round hole,” he explained. “They have got low footfall and low income hinterlands and Aldi and Lidl are taking everyone’s legs away.”During the summer months, Tesco started recruiting staff for a “new store format” in Chatteris. The premises have been empty for four years since Lewis put the brakes on openings when he took charge in 2014.Tesco has 2,659 stores in the UK, a sprawling estate that includes 172 s. It is thought that Tesco s in St Helens and Edge Hill, Liverpool are among those destined to be converted to the Jack’s brand.It is not the first time one of the mainstream supermarket chains has tried to fight back with a discount chain of its own.Sainsbury’s joined forces with the Danish chain Netto in 2014 to launch a UK discounter, but the venture closed its 16 stores two years later after struggling to make a profit. In the mid-noughties Asda experimented with the Asda Essentials chain but gave up after less than a year.Tesco previously tried the discount route in the 1980s with Victor Value , but the move was abandoned after four years because the management team at the time feared it might undermine the main brand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3a8a3f1339218e365ff10ed29b1289fd916ec25/0_0_2961_2966/master/2961.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d95e2c081c921391b473feb2abe8a0b6","title":"i tried soylent silicon valleys favourite foodstuff its everything thats wrong with modern life","story":"The founder of the meal-replacement drink company believes eating is an inefficient use of time. But how does it taste?Never let it be said that I do not suffer for my art(icles). I have just poisoned myself in the name of research. I have downed a dram of Soylent that I found in my cupboard and realised a little too late that 1) I bought it several years ago and it is now horribly out of date 2) it was horrible to begin with 3) it is the embodiment of everything that is wrong with modern life 4) it is possibly made out of people.Let me start from the beginning. Soylent is a meal-replacement beverage. Media outlets have described it as tasting like everything from “licking stamps” to “a protein shake with sawdust in it”. Despite these less-than-glowing reviews, Soylent has become a darling of Silicon Valley. The company, founded by wunderkind Rob Rhinehart and launched in 2014, has raised more than $72m in funding and amassed a cult following. Having won the hearts and guts of the US, it is coming for Britain the drink will launch in the UK on Wednesday. Perhaps you are still confused. I don’t blame you. Unless you are a tech-bro who thinks eating is inefficient, Soylent is somewhat befuddling. Rhinehart developed the products when he was 24 because he thought food was an outdated concept chewing took too much time and kitchens were terrifying. In his blog (which has now been deleted), he wrote: “I think it was a bit presumptuous for the architect to assume I wanted a kitchen with my apartment and make me pay for it. My home is a place of peace. I don’t want to live with red hot heating elements and razor sharp knives.” So he invented Soylent. A meal you could swig from a bottle, without using any razor sharp knives. A meal that would allow you to spend less time living, and more time being productive. And, because we live in a world obsessed with efficiency, the venture-capital money rolled in. Despite, you know, the fact that the product’s name is inspired by a 1973 post-apocalyptic sci-fi thriller called Soylent Green where humans eat a foodstuff made out of people.Hang on a sec, you may be thinking. I have heard of this whole meal replacement thing before. Isn’t that what SlimFast is? Well, yes. But that’s a foolish drink targeted at foolish women. Soylent, meanwhile, is disrupting food and changing the world. That, you see, is the genius of Silicon Valley. It takes ideas that already exist and rebrand them as amazing innovations, aimed at cool tech types.I normally detest anything to do with Silicon Valley, but when I first heard about Soylent, several years ago, I was intrigued. I hate cooking and I am a sucker for lifehacks. I thought Soylent might change my life. So I bought 24 bottles of the stuff. I took one sip and retched. Reader, it tasted like nostril. Disappointed, I put the remaining 23 bottles in a cupboard and forgot about them. Until I got a bottle out to remind myself what it tasted like and inadvertently poisoned myself.I am not sure how much time I have left on this earth, so I want to leave you with two thoughts. First, beware VC-funded futuristic food and just stick with the good old-fashioned chewable stuff. Second, if this expired Soylent does finish me off, then please let it be known that my last words were: “Omigod, I’m literally dying.”One of the actors in a new Hollywood movie called The Predator is, it turns out, a real life sexual predator. Sorry, one of the actors who was in it.Steven Wilder Striegel had his part in the movie cut after it transpired he was a registered sex offender. In 2010, Striegel pleaded guilty to exchanging sexual emails with a 14-year-old girl. Striegel was in his late-30s at the time. He spent six months locked up.Despite being a convicted sex offender, Striegel was given a job on a major movie because his longtime friend, Shane Black (Lethal Weapon, Iron Man 3), was the director. Black thought his buddy deserved a second chance, but apparently did not think his cast deserved to know they were working with a sex offender. When Olivia Munn, who shared a scene with Striegel, found out, she was understandably upset and complained to Fox Studios, who cut the scene. According to Munn, she was shunned after she complained. “There are people who get very mad at you for not just helping them bury it,” Munn recently told the Hollywood Reporter.Munn is far from alone in being ostracised after speaking out. For all the talk of #MeToo turning into a witch-hunt against men for past behaviour, it seems that the only people getting seriously burned are those who are protesting against abuses of power. Munn’s account is a depressing reminder that doing the right thing – advocating for a safe and equitable workplace and making a stand if necessary– is not always rewarded.And this is something most minorities and women know only too well. You have to choose between alienating your peers and putting up with predators."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4a0f5602f5967868bdb53ff36e63056eabac911/95_164_1798_1079/master/1798.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f681714f46be486d5ef4c2e61c653d50","title":"the guardian view on idlib nowhere left to go","story":"Fresh disaster is looming in Syria. It is unlikely to stay there. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, had warned that Idlib, the last hold-out against Bashar al-Assad, could become a lake of blood. Now he writes that Syrian civilians are not the only ones who will pay the price a regime assault would create serious risks for\u0026nbsphis country, Europe and beyond.Idlib is home to 3.5 million people, half of whom have fled there from recaptured cities. They are already in dire straits, many in overcrowded camps lacking even basic amenities. And they know exactly what they face families are improvising gas masks from children’s party cups with cotton and charcoal, knowing how inadequate such preparations are. They have nowhere left to go.Bombing raids have already displaced 30,000 people within the enclave estimates suggest there could soon be 700,000 on the move. The UN says that this could be the century’s worst humanitarian crisis so far. Russia and Iran, Mr Assad’s backers, dismissed Mr Erdoğan’s attempts to broker a ceasefire. But the fall of Idlib will not mean an end to seven years of conflict merely a new\u0026nbspphase of instability, chaos and suffering.The death toll in Syria is estimated at 600,000 people. Ten times more – half the population – have fled. The chilling Russian description of Idlib as “this festering abscess that needs to be liquidated” gives every indication of how an assault will be conducted. It is nonsense to present this, as Damascus and Moscow do, as an anti-terrorist campaign. Committed jihadist fighters are a small proportion of the population, probably fewer than 10,000. Previous attacks on rebel-held areas have shown not merely total disregard for civilians, but deliberate targeting of them. The UN says four medical facilities around the province have been bombed in the last week one was on a deconfliction list, meaning that the regime and Russia had been given its coordinates.Donald Trump’s admonishment to Mr Assad and his supporters – “Don’t let that happen!” – was swiftly followed by Russian airstrikes on western Idlib. However necessary, the warning that the US, Britain and France will have a “much stronger response” to another chemical attack by the regime sounded, in the current context, worryingly close to tacit acceptance of other atrocities. Proposals for “humanitarian corridors” towards regime areas are an absurdity to civilians who saw what the regime did even before it felt this sense of utter impunity.The border with Turkey is closed it has already taken 3.7 million refugees, more than the rest of Europe. So the only plausible route out of Idlib is to the Turkish-controlled swathe of northern Syria. It will be hard for Mr Erdoğan to maintain that he is the protector of innocent Syrians if he denies them shelter in what is, after all, Syria. But he will need support to meet the vast humanitarian need.Whatever happens, we will see more repression, more trauma, more geopolitical struggle. Idlib is where everyone’s interests converge but far from aligning, in many cases they clash. Mr Assad’s backers have agendas. Only a husk of a state remains in this shattered land. Hatred, trauma and simple material need will fuel the instability the security implications for the region and for Europe are evident, as Mr Erdoğan implied. While the US-backed coalition fighting Islamic State says the attack on its last redoubt in Syria has begun, the loss of its “caliphate” has altered rather than eradicated its threat. But it should not take self-interest to make us pay attention when tragedy is waiting to happen.

I once walked into the office of a production company to work on the second episode of a comedy panel show. They’d booked me (and several people who are now household names but will here remain nameless, to protect the guilty) to record a series, the first of which had been broadcast the night before. I hadn’t seen it because I\u0026nbspwas out gigging and Twitter didn’t exist, which made it harder for strangers to tell you something had gone disastrously wrong with your life and career.So I didn’t know why the producer was apologising until someone explained. There were two women and three men on the show, which was (and still is) unusual. We had recorded about an hour for a half-hour programme. It had gone well. We had made each other laugh. But somehow, between the recording and the broadcast, the editors had managed to cut every single thing I’d said and all but one sentence of what my female colleague had said. They had kept in plenty of footage of us smiling and laughing. But somehow they hadn’t noticed that they had cut out all our words. In fact, they never did notice: the channel controller called to ask what the hell had happened, and only then did they realise what they’d done.It was one of several bracingly hurtful experiences that week alone. I still cherish the memory of offering an idea for a segment in the pitch meeting the following day. The producer literally ignored me, as though I hadn’t spoken at all, although I was sitting right by him. A\u0026nbspfew minutes later, one of my fellow (male) comedians made the same suggestion, and the producer leapt on it and said he loved it. To his enduring credit, my friend calmly pointed out that I had said the same thing a few moments ago – but there had apparently been too much oestrogen in the air, so it had gone unheard.You can see how women get silenced in these environments even when our male colleagues are looking out for us, as my friend was. Sometimes it’s\u0026nbspcareless misogyny, as happened to me: the producers liked the guys and didn’t notice they were silencing the women.Sometimes it’s a structural thing. If a show has a regular host and team captains, there’s an expectation that audiences are tuning in primarily for them. So anyone hoping to shine on Mock the Week or 8 Out of 10 Cats or Would I Lie to You? has to stand out in less time than is allotted to the regulars. And most of those regulars are men: Toksvig became the first woman to be the the regular host of a mainstream British panel show when she took over QI in 2015. I was the only regular panellist on three series of Wordaholics on BBC Radio 4, and it really takes the pressure off to know you’ll be included.And sometimes it’s an issue of style. A very brilliant surreal comic once told me that he would make one joke at the start of a recording, and then ensure that virtually everything else he said referenced it. It made it very hard to cut him (unless they silenced him altogether, which he hadn’t thought possible until I told him my experience).The solution to all these problems is the same: employ more women – on camera and behind the scenes – so the idea of women talking doesn’t seem weird. And then they’ll keep the gags that work, no matter who makes them.• Natalie Haynes is a writer, broadcaster and comedian."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea90fa8a78ce668746256515b35d8f16829a443c/25_0_5198_3120/master/5198.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61c321edf1e9e603a4484cb2490bda98","title":"freshers guide what to take to university","story":"Forget a printer – a bumbag, fancy dress and a brolly need to be on every new student’s packing listStudents preparing to head off for university already know they need a laptop, bedding and a corkscrew … but what else might come in useful? We asked some seasoned undergraduates.Johnny Day 21, is studying pharmacy at the University of Bradford. “Take your driving licence, or get a provisional one if you don’t drive, as you will get asked for ID for all sorts of things, including setting up a bank account and entry to clubs. A lost driving licence is cheaper to replace than a passport.”Conor Murphy 26, is studying sports strength and conditioning at the University of Gloucestershire: “Bring a bicycle – free transport and super convenient.

And don’t pack brand-new text books – you can get these second-hand from the year above or in the library.”Alice Battle 20, is studying history at the University of Birmingham: “Bring all the fancy dress you own – you’ll be asked to dress up for obscure themes for nights out. Bring speakers – it’s a rarity when music isn’t playing in a fresher flat. A simple cookery book or app means you don’t have to call your mum every time you make a meal, and stops you exclusively eating pasta. I bought chocolate and biscuit\u0026nbspselection boxes – an inviting way to make friends.

My parents made me bring clothes pegs, supermarket loyalty cards, framed family photos, a pack of cards and an extra set of cutlery – and I have to admit they’ve all been really useful too.”Niamh Roberts 21, studying tourism management at the University of Chester: “Student accommodation has little ventilation and distinctive cooking smells. I use my room diffuser or air freshener. Don’t forget flip-flops – you’re likely to be sharing a bathroom, and they’re handy when the fire alarm goes off in the early hours because one of your housemates is trying to cook after a night out. Don’t bother bringing a printer – most work is submitted electronically, and the library has cheap printing.”Loria-Mae Heywood 32, is studying law at the University of Hull: “As an international student I can’t get home easily so pictures and sentimental things from home make that a bit easier. I also have a map of South America, where I’m from, on my wall to remind me of home.”Daniel Whitt 20, studying physics at University of Hull: “Bring a travel mug – if you sleep in, you can make a quick coffee, walk out the door and arrive at your lectures on time. For crockery, bring two of everything. You don’t need a full set, it’ll just mean lots of pots piling up that you need to clean.”Aaron Thornton 29, is studying marketing and advertising at Kingston University: “I use my juicer non-stop – making my health a priority was important for university.

Another England header.31 min: Gavranovic takes a long ball on his chest and somehow manages to bustle past Tarkowski and Alexander-Arnold. All of a sudden, he’s through on goal. But the angle’s tight and Butland’s able to ert his close-range shot behind for a corner.30 min: Zakaria clips a pass down the inside-right channel. There’s a big gap down that side of the England defence and Gavranovic is able to scoot clear. He’s forced a little wide, though, and ends up settling for a corner, which comes to nothing.28 min: Alexander-Arnold fires the free-kick straight at Sommer.27 min: It turns out Switzerland are no better at playing out from the back than England. They give it away and Lichtsteiner has to bring down Rose. The Swiss right-back, who receives a booking, is furious with his team-mates. He has enough of this at Arsenal.26 min: Rashford shoves Alexander-Arnold aside and wafts the free-kick over the bar. Get Trippier on.25 min: Rose’s free-kick is headed away. England keep pressing, though, and Rose wins another free-kick when Zakaria trips him 30 yards from goal.24 min: Ruben Loftus-Cheek hasn’t really seized his chance so far. If nothing else, his start to this game increases my feeling that he needs to leave Chelsea. Does anyone know how good he is? Most opinions are based on a handful of good games for Crystal Palace last season and a decent cameo against Tunisia. But here he is, winning possession deep on the right and winning a free-kick off Akanji, who is aggrieved to be penalised for his slide on the England midfielder. It looked like a fair tackle.20 min: Football’s coming home again, they chant, but it was better in Russia. This is very drab. Understandable, though. There’s quite a big drop-off between England’s first and second teams.18 min: Danny Welbeck has as many goals as Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang this season.

Alexander-Arnold swings in a flat, low ball and Dier stoops to glance wide.14 min: Switzerland are dominating possession. England haven’t had a touch for a while. Grant Xavi is bossing this.12 min: There isn’t much happening for England in midfield. They need a Granit Xhaka.10 min: Nothing comes from the corner.9 min: Shaqiri’s cross from the left takes a deflection and spins behind for a corner.7 min: England mess about with it at the back again. They haven’t learnt their lesson. This time Butland rolls a pass to the edge of the area for Tarkowksi, who’s immediately set upon by Gavranovic. The Swiss striker wins possession, turns and sends Shaqiri through on goal. The forward should score. Instead he fires wide of the left post with his right foot!6 min: England mess about wit it at the back. Walker knocks a pass to Butland, who almost Cechs it into his own goal! The ball dribbles across his own six-yard box and England manage to scramble it clear. What a farce.5 min: Harry Maguire does not score from the corner.4 min: England probe down the left.

England, kicking from left to right, get the game underway. They’re kicking from left to right in the first half and are in their white shirts and navy shorts. Switzerland are in red shirts and white shorts. They’ve never beaten England here, but they did beat Iceland 6-0 in the Nations League the other day.We’ve had the anthems.

Joe Cole!England have made nine changes after losing to Spain on Saturday. Only Harry Maguire and Marcus Rashford keep their places. Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Fabian Delph, bit-part players respectively for Chelsea and Manchester City so far this season, start in midfield. That highlights a problem for Gareth Southgate, who spoke again recently about the diminishing pool of English players in the Premier League.Three consecutive defeats, a first in a competitive fixture at Wembley since 2007, a losing start to the Nations League campaign ... there’s no doubt about it, Gareth Southgate has to go! Bring back Sam Allardyce, or Roy Hodgson, or give QPR a quick call to see if Steve McClaren fancies coming back. Just do whatever it takes to get Southgate out. The summer’s over and it isn’t coming home any more. Sorry. You’ve had your fun.Well, that’s one way of analysing the stats. A more considered take, however, might be that England have no reason to be ashamed about losing to Belgium, Croatia and Spain. No need to panic. The only reason to lose your head is if England’s run to the World Cup semi-finals made you think they really as good as the very best sides. The truth is that their exploits in Russia proved nothing of the sort. Some of the old frailties were still there – the tendency to rush in possession, the lack of poise in attack, the inability to hold on to leads – and they were highlighted again during Saturday’s 2-1 defeat to Spain in their Nations League opener. For all their strengths, England are still a work in progress. They aren’t quite there yet.But that’s okay. Now the Age of Hubris is over, the hope is that this young side will be able to grow and mature during the next few years, especially when the next batch of promising youngsters are welcomed into the senior squad. Just as importantly, meanwhile, Southgate’s side have found a way to reconnect with supporters who had fallen out of love with them this time last year. That means there should be a celebratory and encouraging atmosphere at Leicester City’s King Power Stadium for this friendly against Switzerland, who reached the last 16 of the World Cup. It should be a decent test for England. That said, Southgate will have to go if he oversees a fourth consecutive defeat.

When you test the skills of those people you actually see that those people don’t have the kind of skills that would be associated with a university degree.”The OECD director was speaking at the London launch of the OECD’s annual Education at a Glance survey for 2018, which compares educational systems and attainment in countries around the world.Though the UK has succeeded in opening up access to universities, with more than half of young adults now going on to higher education, the report points out that tuition fees in England – which now stand at £9,250 a year – are higher than any other OECD country apart from the US.“We have no indication that the UK economy does not need more advanced skills. The question is more about, how can we ensure that every university degree gives young people the kind of skills that they have paid for.”Schleicher called on the government to provide greater quality assurance for students.“I do believe that a government that asks students to pay significant fees should also have a hard look at the quality of the services that are being provided to deliver for those students.”The education secretary, Damian Hinds, said the studyhighlighted the strengths of the UK education system, placing it among the top three countries for education spending as a proportion of gross domestic product. On universities, he said the UK offered some of the most generous support for students in OECD countries.“The result of this is that, as the report recognises, we have high levels of young people in education or employment, the financial gains from going to university outstrip the cost, and people are more likely to continue learning throughout their lives.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38c729633ddf6c1287349ed273e25a603212a452/1133_410_1939_1163/master/1939.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f931c5d503d9a33502e32c775343aef5","title":"take me back to india my fathers last journey","story":"Conducting funeral rites at his ancestral home in Punjab,  Navtej Singh Dhillon sifts through the layers of his identityThe liver took the longest to burn. That’s where the disease had likely lodged itself, the maid’s six-year-old grandson explained. I was carrying my father’s remains. The boy walked beside me, already a veteran of the funeral pyre.Only hours earlier, he had ridden his rickety bicycle to the front door of my ancestral house, which was an act forbidden in normal times. Sweat dripped from his palms his face and ears looked hot. It was not yet time to return, he said, his voice almost out of range. The boy lived on the outskirts of the village near the cremation ground. He seemed to know something I didn’t: the body can burn for a long time.Dressed in white, men and women from low castes arrived and congregated in our courtyard. We drank tea from the same cups. They had promised not to wail, giving the occasion a western sensibility. So we waited, mostly in silence, except occasionally a relative would walk over with specific advice. An aunt handed me a white cotton bag. “Ash can be heavy,” she said. “Hold it from the bottom like a full grocery bag.”This was Punjab in 2013, where in villages such as Khanpur, a seven-hour drive from Delhi, a variation of feudalism has remained intact. The villagers considered the entire place my family’s jagir, a land reward we had received from Maharaja Ranjit Singh in the early 1800s, placing us at the top of the hierarchy. Farmers and workers called my father Sardar, their lord. For three generations, the men in my family had lived primarily in the west, but had returned to Khanpur toward the ends of their lives.“Take me back to India,” my father had said to me on a rainy London evening as we drove home after his last hospital appointment, bumping along Fulham Road, whose bends had become familiar. Deciding where to die was a test of his immigrant loyalties, and he chose India. He was unfazed by the fact that essentials such as oxygen tanks and nurses were unavailable in rural parts of the country. Morphine shortages risked turning a cancer death into a brutal ordeal.So from spring to summer, I relocated to Khanpur. I resented the disruption this posed to my career and personal life. I worried mostly about what my father’s sickness might reveal about me.As I waited for the pyre to cool down, I escaped to the rooftop, from which, as children, my sister and I used to peek into other people’s homes. A tight world of rooftops, some lit, some eclipsed by shadows. You could still hop, climb one wall and jump off another. We sensed the asymmetry then, in the height and sizes of homes, between our world and our neighbours’.Around midday, the boy returned with an update: the earth was cool enough to collect the remains. I grabbed the empty white bag and walked out the front door. The women stayed behind and the men followed me.I walked down an uneven path that cut through the village square. I reached the village periphery, turned on to an unpaved path and walked past a school largely built by my family. I could see the dusty imprints of children’s feet.When I arrived at the cremation ground, a dry patch of land surrounded by verdant fields, the maid’s grandson was sitting on a low-hanging branch. He had remained there until dawn, watching my father’s body burn slowly and keeping the vultures away. Now he watched me as I took a stick and sieved through the ash, discovering a layer of pale gray powder first, and then some of my father’s nails.The scent of sandalwood and ghee rose from the ground. Tractors roared in nearby fields. I was glad for the noise. Relatives and village elders stood around, awkwardly waiting for me to invite them to pick the remains, to turn this into a communal act. “Come,” I said, and they all stepped forward.I went off toward the lower body, squatted and dug my hands into the pile of residue. The ash was paste-like, thick and soft, altered by the gallons of butter we had poured on the pyre. Even in the gentle breeze, it adhered to the ground.At the right arm I found my father’s silver bangle, the one he had worn most of his life. “Mr Singh, could you please remove that,” the nurses would say to him back in London during each treatment.It was a short walk back. Family and villagers had gathered in the village square. My aunt explained that the house was empty so I could complete the last ritual. I would take my father’s remains back to the house, walk through every single room, and ask him to come with me. “Speak to him loudly and tell him it’s time to leave the house,” she said.I entered the house with one hand on top of the bag and one on the bottom so the sediments wouldn’t blow in the wind. Three crows sat on the outer wall. It was quiet.Standing alone in the courtyard, as I was about to whisper the words, I stumbled. This place, seemingly at the edge of the world, had been an important nexus between India and the west for my family for more than a century first, for my great-grandfather, who emigrated to the US in the early 1900s then for my grandfather, who left for England and finally, for my father. I was up against the multiple legacies of my ancestors, who had gone abroad and returned to die here. This property, where I now stood, had been their cure to what Edward Said called “the crippling sorrow of estrangement”.I reminded myself of my other life. I wasn’t a sardar, and the US was my home. I was in a same-sex relationship, and the fact that my partner was a Muslim American whose parents were born in Pakistan meant the Indian authorities would not readily give him a visa. In fact, he wasn’t at my side now for this very reason.I began to close the bedroom doors, the wooden doors with rusted nails, unsure as to how and when I would ever return.Our house in Khanpur was built in two phases. The older part, a red brick tower with arched windows and stained glass built in the early 1920s, was designed with specific purposes: to showcase the family wealth, to place the men of the house so high that others would need to look up, and to encase the women of the house so they could gaze out but not be seen.Growing up, I heard stories about its construction: how the brick had come from Multan, the peacock murals from Amritsar, and the stained glass from Delhi. Most importantly, the money was sent from some rural farm in Yuba City, California, where my great-grandfather, Puran Singh, worked as a peach farmer. He was among the first south Asians to set foot on American soil in the early 1900s.As our house was constructed, people travelled on foot from nearby towns and villages to marvel not only at the building but at the abundance and opportunities a brush with the US could bring. For a long time, our house was known as Amerika-wallan da Kar, the house of the Americans.The second part of the house was built in the late 1950s with my grandfather Bawa Singh’s earnings from his work at a Dunlop factory in Coventry, in the British West Midlands. Just as the dollar-funded tower was tall, the sterling-funded house was sprawling, as if my grandfather were saying to his father: You built high, now I will build long. Soon our house became England-wallan da Kar, the house of the English.I was six years old when I first came to Khanpur, in 1984. Faced with old age and early dementia, Bawa Singh had asked my father to take him back to India. He obliged, and since my mother didn’t want to leave us behind, the entire family relocated from Coventry.I remember walking into the courtyard and meeting a woman who was sitting cross-legged, cleaning her glasses with the ends of her dupatta. She was my step-grandmother, and this was the first I learned of her existence. A short, fierce woman, she married into the family in the 1930s. She bore no children, and was left behind after the rest of the family emigrated to England. So when we showed up on that hot summer’s day, exhausted by the travel, it was no surprise that she didn’t get up to offer us even a glass of water.We called her Mataji, meaning “respected mother”. That was how she had been known to the village for so long that even my parents couldn’t remember her actual name. She didn’t like the adults we came with, but she took to my sister and me. During our seven-year stay in India, we attended a boarding school several hours away from Khanpur. When we returned for summer holidays, Mataji would stand at the doorstep of the house, ready to pour a few drops of mustard oil by our feet to ward off evil spirits, welcoming us as if we had returned from a long exile.This role, of waiting and welcoming, was familiar to her. The story of this house and of Punjab, she would say, is not about the men who left but the women who stayed behind.Through those long years as the sole occupant of the house, night after night, she was the one who lit the oil lamps and left them by the door. She would climb the tower every day and gaze out of the stained-glass windows, updating her mental map of the village. She built a wide network of patronage, slotting each person into their deserved role.As a child, I had this sense that the world was fractured. Every day, people showed up at our front door with their troubles. This desperation, which unfolded on our doorstep, was often met with benevolence, but was never to be mistaken for intimacy or trust. We were not them, and they could never be us. I could play with the children of the village, but I was prohibited from eating with them, from drinking milk from their cows, from ever talking about my family. And they were never allowed into our courtyard and bedrooms. “Some people have you in their prayers, most have you in their curses,” Mataji would remind me every time I struck up a friendship with a kid from the village.My father was 16 when he got on a plane to England, in 1962, but no one came to receive him on the other side. He searched the airport for hours, looking for an uncle who should have been waiting at the terminal. Two pounds was all he had in his pocket – a customary amount that newcomers from the subcontinent carried. He also had the address of a distant relative who lived in London.He followed the crowd out into the damp night and stood outside long enough to realise the black cars that came and went were taxis. He got into one and arrived at the only address he knew. When the door swung open, a Jamaican man asked my father his name, and informed him that the relative was at work and would return in the morning. My father waited. The next day, he sent a telegram to his parents, asking them to come and get him. An uncle eventually showed up. In a borrowed Morris 1100, my father arrived a week later in Coventry, the town that supplied Jaguars to the world.I’ve often wondered if that was the moment when his relationship with this adopted country soured. Dislocation of time, of place and language, experienced so acutely on arrival. To have waited and watched the quiet agony in the faces of arriving immigrants gaining a foothold in a strange land. To have told himself he was different: that it was ambition, and not desperation, that had compelled him to get on that plane. After all, although he was a worker here, he was the son of a lord back home.England was not a place with which one fell in love instantly. Coventry, one of the English cities most bombed in the second world war, was still recovering. The terraced house on Coronation Road, where my father lived with his parents and two brothers, along with a roster of newly arrived immigrants, was shockingly underdeveloped. There was no central heating in the house a fireplace in the living room was the only source of heat. My father quickly realised that outer appearances mattered in achieving assimilation, so he cut his hair and dispensed with his turban.One day, at the age of 21, he came home to learn that his marriage had been arranged. My mother would soon arrive from India. She was light-skinned and from an equal family. They had not met before. It was to be a marriage among migrants, a bet on two outsiders finding their own solace.Success meant full adaptation at every important milestone. Unable to find a venue willing to host his religious wedding ceremony, he picked a pub instead, clearing the smell of booze with incense and convincing a priest to bring the holy book to a bar.With the rise and fall of the British car industry – the golden age of the 60s, the slump of the late 70s – career trajectories changed. There were promotions in our family. My father became a foreman, another uncle a supervisor, and there was movement within isions from the assembly line to managerial work.However, in these turbulent political times, my father’s interior life was largely inaccessible to the rest of us. My family emulated the three-tiered structure of British life: the home, the factory and the pub. These domains rarely overlapped – except on a warm July day in 1981, when Charles and Diana got married. My father had the day off, and aunts and uncles came to our house to watch the wedding, wearing their finest clothes, as if they were invited. It was a rare day when we seemed to belong to the same reality as our English neighbours.As the family became confidently middle class, my father’s turban reappeared. By the early 90s, he and his brother ran a grocery store. Because this was a family business, it became a family space, and I got to see my father interact with the rest of British society. It was mandatory for the children to spend a few hours in the store after school, stacking shelves, counting produce and ordering inventory.It all seemed to be going well until one day, at the age of 13, I happened to be alone with my father at the store when a teenager kicked the door open. His name was Danny. He was a council estate kid who wore a gold chain around his neck. He scouted the lanes, picking up a few items here and there as my father tried to keep an eye on him he had stolen before.Danny placed two packets of Opal Fruits on the counter and waited for my father to ring him up. “Take out the chocolates from your jacket pocket,” I remember my father saying, his voice calm but firm. “Fuck off, Paki,” Danny said before he ran out.The two of them brawled outside the shop. My father’s turban unravelled. I watched him fall to the ground and wished he would pick himself up, fast, before someone from my school saw him. Danny bolted in the direction of the estates. My father returned to the shop with a Cadbury’s bar in his hand, reclaimed from Danny. The chocolate had broken in two it was damaged goods. He ate one piece and then he went to the back of the shop to fix his turban. Soon the front door opened and we moved on to serving the next customer. We never once talked about the incident.We never spoke about race because we believed that class could erase our exclusion. We couldn’t change the colour of our skin, so we worked harder to become more prosperous.Strategies for class mobility were my father’s area of expertise. He turned up for every national and local election. He signed my sister and me up for the Labour party, asking us to pay our dues because a day would come when we would need representation. He lauded the British for their industriousness, marvelled at how small they were in size as a country and how large an empire they had ruled. Nevertheless, every time a newly elected British prime minister visited India, he would register his usual lament: “Will they ever apologise for their colonial crimes?” English pride and Indian nationalism went hand in hand: although he was a “midnight’s child”, born in 1947 in a free India, the British loomed large in his psyche. They were the masters, and they had taught him that power itself was a value, worthy of respect, even if it was grudging.Surely this was ordinary interplay between real and imaginary homes, the kinds of conversations that took place in every immigrant household. Nearly all my uncles at some point considered returning to India, but none had followed through.I had expected my father to be similarly pragmatic. I didn’t realise his attachment to his original home was so deep that one day he would be willing to accept a more painful death over remaining in England.Fifty years after his first arrival, three months before he died, he was back at Heathrow airport, bidding farewell to England.Coming out to my parents in Punjabi had proved nearly impossible. The words for it didn’t exist in the language. Resorting to English would make my sexuality feel like a western construct. When parts of myself were translated into different tongues, a wedge seemed to be driven through me.But duality was not unfamiliar to my father. It had seeped into his parenting. He would moralise in Punjabi and transact in English. He didn’t care how I chose to live my life in the west. He was mostly concerned about India, that nothing would come in the way of its enduring pull. It was only after his stage-four cancer diagnosis that something changed: each time I left the UK or spoke to him on the phone, my father would say in English and in Punjabi, “Be happy,” and, “Don’t worry.”Acceptance was not immediate. For a short while my father thought my partner, Muneer, a law professor, had all the markings of a Muslim terrorist. An avid newspaper reader, he started saving specific types of articles. One such clipping traced the journey of a UK-born, Ivy League-educated Muslim man involved in a terrorist plot.I told my father I was sure of one thing: Muneer was not into blowing himself up. A few months later he mentioned another story he had read, about a same-sex couple becoming parents. “You should have a child,” he said to me one day, as I accompanied him to his chemotherapy treatment. “In fact, have twins, since you are starting so late.”In 2012 my father asked me to visit India and to bring Muneer with me. I resisted London would be easier, given India’s restrictive visa policy for anyone with ancestral ties to Pakistan. He pushed, and we relented, aware that we were being asked to demonstrate how this relationship would not hinder my heritage.We waited for several months, but the visa never arrived. I called my father to give him the bad news. “With your education, I’m confident the two of you can find a way,” he said, taunting us.We arrived late on a warm, humid afternoon, and my parents were standing at the door. I watched nervously as they hugged Muneer. My father’s face lit up as he heard Muneer speak in Hindustani. They hugged again.The next morning, over breakfast, my father pointed in the direction of the Wagah border, about 100km from the village. In good times, one can take a taxi from Amritsar to Lahore. He asked Muneer if he would be willing to meet a few people, to talk about his work and share his impressions of Punjab. So far our visit had been an intensely private affair and I wanted to keep it that way.But here was my father, living his true life, and it proved hard not to respond to that. Over the years, he had become an important powerbroker, collaborating with local politicians and businesses to mobilise investments from the Punjabi diaspora.We found ourselves walking into a cantonment in Nawanshahr, dotted with offices once occupied by the British army and civil services. Unbeknown to Muneer and me, in one of the offices, 10 journalists and three TV crews were waiting. At the front of the room, a long table was arranged with four chairs.We watched more press pour into the room. My father tapped the table. The room fell silent. He turned to his right and introduced Muneer – professor of law, expert in immigration and first-time visitor to Punjab – kicking off the press conference. The local press rarely had a chance to interview someone with roots in Pakistan. They dwelled on what it felt like to be a visitor in Punjab, and how different or similar it was to Pakistan. I watched Muneer shuffle in his chair, clear his throat and answer in Hindi, bending the language, reverting to English and occasionally turning to me for help finishing his sentences. He’s an American, I wanted to say. But that would have been lost on the press. To them he was a Pakistani, both foreign and familiar.“These kids need to see peace in their lives,” my father interjected. The message seemed intended for the local policymakers.The day we left, he handed us a binder full of clippings from the local newspapers. “You are always welcome here,” he said to Muneer.A week before his death, in his hazy state, my father told me about a box in his closet he wanted me to have. I took it as an invitation and walked straight to his bedroom. I found an old cardboard box on the bottom shelf, covered in a layer of dust.“Dad, these are old registries,” I said. Engraved on the first page was the face of King George VI, the pink lips and bright eyes of the last emperor of India. Below, in thick black ink, Urdu script ran in long symmetrical lines, documenting debts owed to the family and proof of land ownership.Underneath the registries, I discovered a letter in Urdu. “America 1933,” it said on the top left corner. I asked Nina, a family maid from Bihar, to go around the village and find me an Urdu reader. But such was the legacy of partition: there was no one left in our Punjabi village who spoke the language of my great-grandfather.From the rooftop, I could see the fertile fields and the dark soil, the kind of topography my great-grandfather Puran Singh would have encountered in the Sacramento Valley. Farming methods developed in the fields of Punjab were in demand in California’s newly arable land. These immigrants could harvest in the scorching heat. They also knew fruit-picking needed delicate hands. It was easy to bruise a peach.The money they saved arrived back in India through the imperial postal system. Letters carried promises of families reuniting and making the US their home. But the California Alien Land Law of 1913 prohibited immigrants from buying land. A 1920 report from the California State Board of Control described Indian workers as unfit for association with American people. Three years later, the supreme court ruled that Indian men were ineligible for naturalised citizenship.In 1946, Congress passed legislation that made the first wave of Indian immigrants eligible for US citizenship. Had he been alive, Puran Singh would have shared in the triumph, but also grieved its terms. The India League of America had argued that Indians belonged in the US because they “are anthropologically of Caucasian race”.Erasing a part of yourself would be the only kind of progress available time and time again.In our house in the US, we talk about the house in India. I tell my four-year-old son about the peacocks that visit our rooftop in Khanpur, and how one day we will make oil lamps and leave them by the wooden door. Hundreds of people will visit him and they will send him any animal he wants. It’s that kind of place: beautiful, but deeply unequal.“Who lives there?” my son asks. I’m thrown off by the question, unsure how to explain the hold of an uninhabited place.In the middle of my night, text messages arrive from people in the village. The banisters have cracked. The village temple needs a generous donation. Nina’s back is crooked and she might return to Bihar.My mother tells me there is a special kind of blessing my son can only receive if he visits the land of his ancestors.We make plans to visit as a family but we falter. Muneer would have to submit his passport for an unknown period and wait for the Indian authorities to respond. Also buried in my resistance is not wanting to submit a visa application for my son. The application will ask if one of his parents or grandparents was born in Pakistan, perhaps prompting the Indian authorities to treat him as a Pakistani American, marking him for ever and limiting his access to India. Or perhaps realising that he has two fathers, they will be inclined to recognise only me, his Indian American father. Our visit is either a process of denying who we are, or comes at the risk of banishment.My mother often says I’ve changed the course of my son’s life by hyphenating his last name, by adding Ahmad, a Muslim surname, to Dhillon, a Sikh surname. The first time she saw my son’s passport she didn’t speak to me for days. “They won’t like it in India, they won’t like it in America,” she said.‘I always want you to be well,” Puran Singh wrote in a letter to his son, penned from a rural farm near Yuba City in June 1933. “This is to say I wrote you three letters. Did you get them? If you did why have you not replied?“You may have heard, I hurt my leg so I am walking with a stick. I think in five to six months I will return home. These days work is very slow. It’s only hand to mouth.“How are the people in the village? Send me an update on them. I want to know if everyone is healthy.“If Sham Singh had not tried to come to America it would have been better. One he suffered losses and second my 2,000 rupees got lost in the process. I had to come and go quite a few times which was expensive and he hasn’t got anything from it.“Answer me soon. I am reminding you. Answer me quickly. Write back.“Where did you do your second marriage?“Your well wisher, Puran Singh from America.”I had carried the letter back to the US.

Salzburg would be “a staging post in exit negotiations”, her spokesman said in a briefing for reporters.The spokesman added that May told the cabinet she hoped to “build on the constructive engagement of the summer” by “underlining the importance to both parties of remaining the EU’s closest ally” after Brexit.No 10 has become cautiously hopeful that a Chequers-style deal has a chance of success, trusting that the orce talks will ultimately come down to an intense period of last-minute negotiating in the runup to a final Brexit summit expected in the middle of November.Officials believe Barnier has softened his public position in the last few days. Last week, Barnier reportedly told a delegation of British MPs from the Brexit select committee that he believed Chequers was “dead”, because it would require the EU to compromise over fundamental principles on the operation of the single market.On Tuesday, however, Barnier said it was realistic to believe that a deal could be agreed within the next two months. “If we are realistic, I want to reach an agreement on the first stage of the negotiation, which is the Brexit treaty, within six or eight weeks,” he said.May’s negotiating plan remains intensely unpopular on the right of her own party. At least 20 MPs have told her to “chuck Chequers” and propose a Canada-style free trade deal as an alternative.There is particular unhappiness that the prime minister proposed that the UK share a “common rulebook” for food and goods with the EU after Brexit, which critics say amounts to the UK becoming a “rule-taker” from Brussels.Debates about whether Chequers is appropriate are expected to dominate the Conservative party conference at the end of September, which is partly why it remains critical for May to ensure that EU leaders do not summarily reject the proposals in Salzburg.May will leave Salzburg after a Thursday morning discussion on chemical weapons, with the remaining EU leaders staying to discuss the Chequers plan.Responding to the row between Raab and Barnier over the 27 letters, an EU official said: “We are working for the withdrawal agreement, which is a deal to avoid a no deal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/severin_carrell_140x140.jpg?width=140\u0026amp;height=140\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1468af93933fd7f03e0e755afc8e7c3c\" alt=\"Severin Carrell","title":"labour would introduce biggest extension of workers rights uk has ever seen as mcdonnell politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenHere are the main points from Philip Hammond’s evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee.The situation this autumn is complicated by the fact that there are some very significant political events, including potentially one the timing of which is, as yet, indeterminate - the continued speculation that there may be a special European council in November. Clearly that makes it difficult to fix the date of another event in our own political calendar.Last year, giving his annual evidence to this committee in September, Hammond used his appearance to announce the date of the budget in November. But he said he could not announce the date this year because of the Brexit complications.He assumes that there are no additional non-tariff barriers to trade between the UK and the EU in a no deal scenario, which is frankly not plausible.And then for financial service, he assumes that an equivalence arrangement delivering a similar affect to passporting will exist between the UK and the EU in a no deal scenari, notwithstanding the fact that we have heard very loud and clear noises to the contrary from some of our near European neighbours who have other aspirations about our financial services industry.So I’m afraid I find I’m sure his model is very effective. But the assumptions that he makes are wildly out of line with assumptions that are used by other economic models and frankly I believe are not sustainable.There are undoubtedly legal obligations that we have to the EU on exit. The quantum of those obligations may be open to discussion, even dispute, and would ultimately in the normal course of even be resolved through some arbitration which may take quite a long time ...If we were to say we are going to sit on our hands and pay nothing we would probably expect a very hard-nosed response from the other side.There is merit in having quite a bit of detail. But clearly we don’t have enough time to negotiate a full draft legal text in what will be quite a complex future partnership agreement.Asked if this document would contain enough detail to explain what the “common rulebook”, as set out in the Chequers proposal, would actually mean in practice, Hammond replied:On something as central to the proposition as that, we will need to spell out what it means. That’s all from me for today.Thanks for the comments.Scottish ministers have set aside £27m to cope with the administration and parliamentary costs of Brexit, but faced heavy opposition criticism for giving Holyrood few details about their planning.Mike Russell, the Scottish government’s constitutional relations secretary, told MSPs today the money was being erted to departments most affected by coping with Brexit. He said the Scottish parliament faced an unprecedented number of technical pieces of legislation, known as statutory instruments, to prepare Scottish legislation for Brexit. Russell did not spell out much detail, leading to attacks from both Labour and the Scottish Greens for being too vague.Holyrood sources say Russell has told them he estimates the devolved parliament will need to scrutinise about 100 statutory instruments. It remains unclear how much work or parliamentary time those will involve. Some will be complex and important, covering farming, policing and medicines. Legal experts say there could be hundreds of others which may involve only minor bureaucratic changes, while many could also be dealt with at UK level by Westminster on Scotland’s behalf. Russell said that, faced with the chaos of a no-deal Brexit and the continuing need for continuity after exit day, his government was duty bound to prepare for a blind Brexit and a no-deal outcome. The SNP would continue arguing for the UK to remain within the single market and customs union “whilst fulfilling our duty of protecting Scotland as best we can from the threats of a Brexit – any Brexit - that we do not want, and that we did not vote for.”Neil Findlay, Scottish Labour’s Brexit spokesman, said it was right that ministers planned for every eventuality. “But the reality is the SNP has provided scant detail on the nature of its preparations, focusing instead on spin and rhetoric over substance,” he told Russell.Forsyth wraps up by thanking Hammond for his time, and telling him his grasp of detail is “astonishing”. He is referring in particular to the way Hammond, a former transport secretary, answered questions about HS2, surprising peers with his knowledge of the engineering problems thrown up by the need to build a tunnel in London, and in particular what happens to the spoil.I will post a summary soon.Q: Do you agree that something needs to be done about the audit market, and the dominance of the big four providers?Q: What is happening about putting a cap on the amount of money people have to pay for their own social care, as Andrew Dilnot proposed?Hammond says the government is clear that everyone must have accesss to the support and care that they need, but also that people should contribute to the care they need.The green paper will address options for capping the amount people have to pay.Q: Options on the size of the cap? Or will having a cap be an option?Hammond says having a cap will be an option. It will be a consultative paper.Q: When will it be published?Later this year, Hammond says.Hammond is now talking about social care.He says the government is working on a green paper looking at means of making social care sustainable for older people in the long term.There are two challenges he says the care of older people and the care of adults with disabilities who are living longer and will need care as they grow old.The needs of the two groups are very different, he says. He says the first group have assets the second group don’t.While Hammond continues to give evidence to peers, his Labour shadow, John McDonnell, is addressing the TUC. Here are some of the lines that journalists have been tweeting from the speech, which started a few minutes ago.Q: We have heard evidence that senior civil servants are being labelled as apprentices, for example when they enrol on MBAs. Doesn’t that show how targets are being misused?Hammond says he cannot say that has never happened. But he has not heard this concern.Lady Harding of Winscombe, a Conservative, goes next. She asks about apprenticeships.Hammond says there has been a shift from level 2 to level 3 apprenticeships. Put bluntly, he says that now people are using their own money to fund apprenticeships, they are choosing higher values ones. But that generates more benefit for the economy, he says.Q: There was a report in the summer saying HS2 could cost £90bn. And there is an increasing argument for improving transport links east to west, as much as north to east. Isn’t there a case now for focusing on other projects instead?Hammond says small projects can be useful, but there is a need for strategic projects too.He says he is not aware of the supposed cost increase, although he says by the time the project is over inflation will make the costs seem higher.And government should be able to work on eastwest links as well as northsouth links, he says.Asked about the Brexit “orce bill”, Hammond says the UK has legal financial obligations to the EU. If the UK left without a deal, this matter could go to lengthy arbitration, he says.Lord Kerr, the former diplomat credited with drafting article 50, goes next. He invites Hammond to comment on the EFT report saying the UK would benefit from leaving the EU and trading on WTO terms.He says the Minford model makes no allowance for differences in quality and safety in imported goods.He says Minford assumes that would be no new non-tariff barriers to UK-EU trade in a WTO scenario.And he says Minford also assumes that an arrangement similar to passporting would apply in relation to financial service in a WTO scenario, even though EU countries would not accept this. Q: What did Michel Barnier mean when he said both sides would have to be “realistic” for there to be a deal?Hammond says that might mean different things to different people.Alistair Darling, the former Labour chancellor, goes next.Q: How detailed will the political agreement about a future trade deal have to be?Hammond says it will have to be specific enough to satisfy both parliaments, and it will have to be specific enough for the negotiators on both sides to be able to work up a text.It will be the equivalent to a heads of terms in a commercial agreement, he says.UPDATE: Here is a transcript of this section. This is from the Times’ Philip Aldrick.Hammond says long-term forecasting is easier than short-term forecasting.A peer challenges this. Would he say the same about weather forecasting.Yes, says Hammond. He says he can confidently say that in December we will be in winter. But he does not know what the temperature will be next week.Forsyth asks about the accuracy of the Treasury forecasts.Hammond says the Treasury forecasts about the immediate impact of a vote for Brexit assumed no fiscal response, no monetary response and the immediate triggering of article 50. But there was a fiscal and a monetary response, and article 50 was not triggered immediately."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9062838da983c2d2303c2f500fae1ea61ada924/0_399_3894_2336/master/3894.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a292d578125f69f22d1526275aad643c","title":"italian children kept off school due to confusion over vaccine policy","story":"Coalition government’s new rules risk unvaccinated children endangering othersChaos has marred the start of the school year in Italy because of widespread confusion about the government’s policy on vaccines.In Bologna about 1,000 children with impaired immune systems will be forced to stay away from school on Wednesday due to uncertainty over whether their classmates have received vaccines against viruses including measles.There have also been cases across the country of parents falsely claiming that pre-school children have been vaccinated.Legislation introduced by Italy’s previous leftwing administration made 10 vaccines mandatory for children enrolling in state-run schools, and required parents to provide a doctor’s certificate.But in August this year the current government – made up of the far-right League and the populist Five Star Movement (M5S), which in the past has said, despite scientific evidence to the contrary, that vaccines are dangerous – passed an amendment allowing parents to self-certify instead of providing a doctor’s note. A final vote on that measure later this month is likely to postpone the obligation to provide proof until March 2019.Last week – under pressure from regional authorities, parents’ groups and the Italian National Association of Principals (ANP) – the health ministry scrapped an earlier amendment that said unvaccinated children could still attend school, but it maintained the self-certification measure until next year.“Parents can self-certify until March, during which time there is the danger of them making false claims,” said Antonello Giannelli, the president of ANP. “But the main danger is that we will oblige children who cannot be vaccinated because of health reasons to go to school with children who are not vaccinated because of ideological reasons.”Pre-schoolers must be vaccinated, although their parents are not required to provide proof from a doctor. But children aged six to 16 are allowed to attend school even if they have not been vaccinated and their parents are fined up to €500 for not doing so.The story of an eight-year-old boy from Treviso in northern Italy, who is recovering from treatment for leukaemia, made headlines on Tuesday after a doctor posted a message on Facebook saying he is not attending school due to fears his health will be compromised by five unvaccinated classmates.“This is a moment of great confusion, which is very bad as this is a field that needs clarity,” said Roberto Burioni, a professor of microbiology and virology at the Vita-Salute San Raffaele University in Milan.“People need to be confident of the fact that vaccines are safe, and are for the health of the community – to attend a gym in Italy you need to present a certificate of good health, so why should this be any different? With vaccinations you are gambling with lives. And making false claims is a crime.”Burioni is a prominent pro-vaccination campaigner who this summer received threats from a small but virulent anti-vaccine movement which has been buoyed by the rise to power of the populist coalition.“I really don’t know what the government’s strategy is, as things change from one day to the next, or why this confusion is being created … but maybe they are trying to be a bit nice to anti-vaxxers, who are few but very noisy, so they are able to scare others,” he added.The mandatory vaccine law was brought in to boost immunisation coverage after a surge in the number of measles cases in the country. Last year Italy recorded 4,885 instances of the highly contagious disease, second in Europe behind Romania. So far this year there have been 1,700 cases and four deaths.Italians’ perception of the safety of vaccinations was heavily influenced by now discredited claims of a connection between the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccination and autism.M5S politicians have previously claimed that vaccines can be as dangerous as the diseases they protect against, although before general elections in March the party toned down its message, saying it was not anti-vaccination but against obliging parents to have their children injected. Meanwhile, Matteo Salvini, the leader of the League, said in July that the requirement for 10 vaccines was “too much”.“They very quickly change the political content of their platform according to changes in public opinion, and think there are no consequences, but of course this is not the case,” said Massimiliano Panarari, a politics professor at Luiss University in Rome."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fda463802520400b641c1c8d9f8858fe356e1ce7/34_0_2372_1423/master/2372.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af13da9095ef808529e5e77ca36b2b96","title":"premiership rugby agree selling majority share not preferred option","story":"Ian Ritchie, chairman of Premiership Rugby, confirmed that a number of other interested investors have come forward since news of CVC’s offer emerged last week but that they would be seeking a minority investment and plan to move fast.“The majority sale is something that’s not the preferred option because again we think that control is something that by and large we would want to keep within the clubs,” said Ritchie. “But we would look at minority stakes, people who are either investors or who can bring added value to that, and again there was a good unanimity around the table of wanting to pursue that further.”Last week Premiership Rugby’s chief executive, Mark McCafferty, suggested that the organisation could become a billion-pound business within 10 years and there was also a feeling among some owners that CVC’s offer was too low. Ultimately however, losing too much control proved the stumbling block. The sale of a controlling stake would also need to be approved by the Rugby Football Union, who would likely have grave concerns over a third party effectively taking control of England’s elite players."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0275f84b6b5da9441fd4e0cb321c004ccc43e0f2/0_116_3504_2103/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a821295fe110d5fe00d404e448c5c145","title":"roaring lion odds on favourite irish champion stakes","story":"Roaring Lion has gone odds-on for Saturday’s Irish Champion Stakes after the latest entry stage, when it became clear that he will face a maximum of nine opponents.

On behalf of all the OBO writers, thanks for your company and emails throughout the summer. See you at 4am sharp for the first ODI in Sri Lanka, eh.James Anderson and Alastair Cook are quite a double actCook “God knows how many he’ll end up with. It’s been a pleasure to watch him work and share so many good times with him.”Anderson “As I tried to say before, he’s such a solid bloke, he’s been there for me all the time. I’llk miss that shoulder to … well, actually cry on. And it’ll be nice to get somebody at first slip who can hold onto a few. The hole he’s leaving isn’t just at the top of the order – it’s the whole package in the dresssing-room. What he’s brought to the team and done for English cricket is above and beyond.”Cook “Someone’s got to tell him to bowl a bit fuller. That’s been my job for the last seven or eight years. ‘Jimmy, do you want to bowl a bit fuller?’ And then I get the daggers.”Alice Cook is still at the ground, still wondering if she’ll ever go into labour. When the third Cook child grows up, he or she will hear quite a story about their birth.England take a team photo with the Pataudi Trophy, then wait for Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid to run off before spraying champagne everywhere. England 4-1 India may be a slightly deceptive scoreline, but it’s still a darned impressive one.Here’s Joe Root “It’s very gratifying. It’s been a very tough series – India have played some exceptional cricket and there’s been some special stuff from our guys as well. It shows Test cricket is still in a really good place. There were a few nerves this afternoon. The two lads played out of their skin. Credit to our guys for holding their nerve.“Alastair’s been an exceptional player for so long, a huge part of our dressing-room in the way he goes about things and sets the standard. There’s still a lot left from Jimmy, and to achieve what he has today is unbelievable. The scary thing with Jimmy is that in my opinion he’s the best he’s ever been.“The team is growing all the time. We’ve got some good experienced players and some young guys who have really stood up. We’re in a good space but we still have a lot of improving to do. To perform as we have in this series is really pleasing.”“We missed quite a few opportunities. But we have no regrets in terms of the way we played in the series – both teams played fearless cricket so there were never going to be draws. I’m not saying the scoreline is unfair because they played better than us and deserved to win, but we’ve been competitive in every game apart from Lord’s. We can take a lot of hear from that. But we need to learn to the things we didn’t do right.“Sam Curran made very important contributions in two really important Tests (the first and fourth). That’s something we can learn from – being fearless and smart at the same time.“There should be exciting pitches all over the world and both teams should be willing to go for a result. That’s where the excitement of this format lies. I don’t think any time should play safe cricket as soon as they go ahead in a series.“Sorry, just one word for Alastair as well – you had a great career and I wish you well and I want to congratulate you for doing what you’ve done. I wish you all the best for your future endeavours, whatever they might be. All the best.” India’s Man of the Series is the immense Virat Kohli, who has got nothing to say (because he’ll be interviewed in a minute when they speak to the captains).England’s Man of the Series is Sam Curran “It’s nice to be involved in a great series and to contribute to the team – I tried my best and luckily it came off in some situations. To send Cooky off like that was perfect. It’s been a great learning curve for me. I try to keep it as natural as possible. It’s awesome for me to learn from people like Jimmy and Broady who I grew up watching on the sofa. It’s pretty cool.”The Man of the Match is Alastair Cook “It’s been the most amazing week. I got a text from Beefy last night and he said, ‘Can I have my scriptwriter back?’ It was a great match as well. The shared moments in the dressing-room will stay with me, both good and bad. I feel very privileged to have worn the England cap as long as I have.“The reception to the hundred was amazing, and to see Jimmy pass Glenn McGrath’s record today was just brilliant. Him and Broady I’ve played so much cricket with, and the hardest bit is knowing I’ll never stand at first slip and drop another catch off those two again.“Jimmy and I have lived in each other’s pockets for the last 12 years, and it’s a privilege to play with who I think is England’s greatest cricketer. His skill to do it time and again… he never misses his length. You take it for granted and it shouldn’t be like that.“I won’t miss the amount of hard work which goes into international cricket, the pressure and the strain you play under, but I will miss all the rewards that you get for that hard work.The players are back out on the field for the post-match presentation. A bit of housekeeping: England go up to No4 in the world rankings, one point behind South Africa and Australia.Here’s Jonny Bairstow “They played amazingly well to get themselves into that position at tea. For Jimmy to get the final wicket is very, very special. It’s a very proud dressing-room. It’s been a tough summer and to beat India 4-1 took a lot of effort. That ball from Rash – people talk about balls of the century and that’s up there. It turned about three or four feet I reckon. It was an amazing atmosphere – the whole ground has been magnificent throughout the match. We’re all immensely proud of Cooky and there are no amount of words that can sum up his career.”Since you asked, Mick Jagger has donated £190,000 t0 Chance to Shine in this match.Moeen Ali “It’s been very emotional since Cooky told us. We were pretty sad but it’s been an honour to play with him.”Here’s Jimmy Anderson, being interviewed on the outfield. “It’s been a tough week! We’re happy to win the game. I wasn’t even thinking about that wicket. My job was to hold an end. I’m happy that Cooky was on the field to see that wicket. He’s my best mate and it’s been brill…”At this point Anderson choked up and walked away. Ah, that was thoroughly lovely.“If anyone wants to know why it is quite a big deal for Jimmy Anderson to go past Glenn McGrath,” writes Gary Naylor, “here’s why.” India don’t deserve to lose 4-1, and they will forever lament those missed opportunities in the first and fourth Tests. England have spent much of the series being criticised, yet ended it in an orgy of goodwill and with a 4-1 win against the best team in the world. It’s all very strange.Oh man, what lovely scenes these are. Cook and Anderson, whose friendship really started with that long plane journey to India in 2006, embrace in the middle. Cook leads the team off, waving his cap to the crowd and shaking hands with all the India players. The crowd know what time it is. Every delivery from Anderson is cheered like a hat-trick ball - and he needs only three balls to clean up Mohammed Shami! It burst straight through him to hit the stumps. England have won the match and James Anderson has taken 564 Test wickets - more than any quick bowler in the history of Test cricket. It’s an apt way to end a fairytale Test for England’s beloved old farts. 95th over: India 345-8 (Shami 0, Bumrah 0) Bumrah survives the last two balls of the over. And so Jimmy has to chance to break the record and win the match in one fell swoop. The match has had one hell of a cheesy script.“Is there a recent series that could so easily have ended up with a wholly different outcome?” says Thomas Hopkins. “We could well be looking at, what, 3-1 India? As it frequently does, 2005 comes to mind?”The 1998 series against South Africa will always spring to mind here, though that might be because the spat between Dominic Cork and Brian McMillan will never cease to tickle me. England are nearly there, and Sam Curran is ending a life-changing summer in style. He tempted Jadeja into a defensive push at a beautiful outswinger that kissed the edge on its way through to Bairstow. 93rd over: India 341-8 (Jadeja 9, Shami 0) Jadeja won’t want to be Anderson’s record-breaking wicket, especially not after their full and frank exchange of views in 2014. He almost becomes Test wicket No564, however, when an inside edge flashes past leg stump for four. There are 15 overs remaining.“Hello to all the writers who have pulled me in to become fascinated by the phenomenon that is cricket, in England, at the autumnal phase of the year,” writes Verona Bass. “I can tell you that it’s your writing that’s drawn me in as much as anything else. I’ve somehow sensed the enchantment and the Englishness of it all through your words rather than actually watching (only the hour catch-up at 7 pm). I am feeling elegiac, and sad that after years and years of Test cricket I’m only now being seduced by it all. Thank you for giving me a new interest, and I give praise to your efforts, all of you who beguile us with word pictures!”Ah, how kind thank you. I’ll send you a ball-by-ball video of the 2012 Nagpur Test so that you can see what the fuss is about.92nd over: India 336-8 (Jadeja 4, Shami 0) “Why not see if Cook would go for a break from all cricket from now till just before the next Ashes (with a couple of matches to get his groove back ahead of it),” says Ross Allen. “That way he gets time with family and a proper chance to refill tank, and is fresh for England rather than county cricket? Also happens to be what Christian Benteke needs...”Arf. I do think sport should look more at “performance-enhancing rest”, as Gideon Haigh so brilliantly described Shane Warne’s drug suspension. It’s too late for Cook though that well can’t be replenished.Jadeja edges a fine delivery from Sam Curran through the vacant backward point region. Don’t ask me why England don’t have a gully. Don’t ask me that. I SAID I DON’T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. Now, is Sharma out here? He was given caught behind off Curran but reviewed instantly. I’ve no idea why, mind - UltraEdge shows a thin edge and he’s on his way. Yet more splendid umpiring from Kumar Dharmasena, who has been almost flawless in this series.91st over: India 335-7 (Jadeja 3, Sharma 5) India are 500-1 to win this match *taps nose*. Anderson gets a bit of swing with the second new ball, and his delivery is a ripper that beats Sharma outside off stump. There are 17 overs remaining.Thanks Simon, hello again. When I handed over at lunch I assumed I wouldn’t be needed again,90th over: India 334-7 (Jadeja 3, Sharma 5) Runs! Sharma sweeps the ball, and with pretty much the entire England team either clustered around the bat or actually bowling, there’s nobody about to stop the boundary. That’s all from me. Rob Smyth will take you through the bit where stuff actually gets decided. Send him your finest emails here. Bye!89th over: India 330-7 (Jadeja 3, Sharma 1) No runs are being scored or sought. A fourth successive maiden, as England continue with Anderson and Rashid in partnership with the old ball.88th over: India 330-7 (Jadeja 3, Sharma 1) Rashid bowls to Sharma with six fielders clustered around the wicket, yet when the batsman is foxed by a googly and miscues his shot it goes nowhere near any of them. Another maiden.87th over: India 330-7 (Jadeja 3, Sharma 1) Dropped! Jadeja edges and Bairstow es low to his left, the ball flying into his glove but there’s too much finger and not enough palm and the ball doesn’t stick. Yet another maiden for Anderson, who walks off with a shake of the head.86th over: India 330-7 (Jadeja 3, Sharma 1) The sun has come out for the first time today, casting lengthy shadows across the turf as Rashid bowls. “If anyone wants to know why a leg-spinner needs runs on the board, this is why,” notes Gary Naylor. “Rashid took a while to find his rhythm - and burned 50 runs or so - but here he is justifying his place with clever, courageous bowling. Well done him, Joe Root and Ed Smith.” 85th over: India 328-7 (Jadeja 2, Sharma 0) A maiden, inevitably, from Anderson, who has bowled admirably since tea but been wildly upstaged. 84th over: India 328-7 (Jadeja 2) I think Pant might have started to believe his own hype there, but if his captain’s orders at tea were to launch himself wildly in search of victory I doff my cap to him.Pant-iclimax! Pant goes for another hoik against Rashid, but he doesn’t pick the googly, doesn’t get enough on it and Moeen is under it in the deep when it comes down!83rd over: India 326-6 (Pant 113, Jadeja 1) “If we’re holding the new ball back - and I think that’s right with Rashid bowling like this - surely Moeen should be on at the other end,” says Gary Naylor. Though there’s a straightforward case for resting Anderson until the new ball is taken, the fact that nobody is scoring off him is surely contributing to the fireworks going off at the other end. This is another maiden.82nd over: India 326-6 (Pant 113, Jadeja 1) This is a wild, wild over. It starts with the wicket, and he gets another ball to spin wildly from a near-identical spot, but it hits Jadeja’s hand and plops to safety. Pant tries to sweep the next but misses the ball, which hits an arm and a shoulder before plopping into Bairstow’s gloves. England think it’s out, and only the fact they’ve already wasted their reviews prevents them wasting a review. An attempted reverse sweep off the next ends with Pant hitting himself in the foot and calling on the trainer. “Pant will have to play a few shots now,” notes Gary Naylor. Very droll.And Rashid takes the wicket! It’s an absolute snorter, pitching well outside leg stump and turning hard to clip the top of off! 81st over: India 325-5 (Rahul 149, Pant 113) The new ball becomes due, and England don’t take it. Instead they keep going with the old one in the hope that India hand them a free wicket in return. India aren’t giving anything away here, though, Rahul getting a single off Anderson’s first delivery and Pant leaving four of the remaining five.80th over: India 324-5 (Rahul 148, Pant 113) Pant tries to hoist the ball over midwicket but it flicks the outside edge and lands just short of the solitary slip. Then he tries again, and though it sounds like there might have been a nick the umpire gives byes as the ball flies past Bairstow and away for four. This is wild, carefree batting, and exhilarating stuff, but it also could quite easily have handed England a wicket since tea.79th over: India 320-5 (Rahul 148, Pant 113) Bairstow is at the stumps to Anderson, as he was to Broad in the last session. Rahul whips the first ball over midwicket, the ball dribbling limply into the rope before anyone can catch it. “May I be the first to say that Joe Root should not have declared leaving such a low target?” writes John Pearson. The final over with the old ball follows.78th over: India 316-5 (Rahul 144, Pant 113) What a show Pant is putting on here. He drives Rashid’s final delivery past cover for four, an excellent shot. Nine off the over.77th over: India 307-5 (Rahul 143, Pant 109) Anderson’s still going and this is an expensive over for him, costing as it does two runs. We’re in a holding pattern here, as we await the new ball.76th over: India 305-5 (Rahul 142, Pant 108) He’s at it again! Pant cracks the ball down the ground and into the stands! The next ball nearly ended it, though, as the ball flew off the inside edge and bounced just wide of the stumps.They’re back out. Rashid has the ball in his hand.There’s a new ball due in five overs. England’s hopes lie in some chaos following its arrival. Stranger things have happened, though of course when they do break this partnership, Jadeja’s next in.75th over: India 298-5 (Rahul 142, Pant 101) What a session for India! In two hours they have turned a procession into a drama, and a 4-1 final score in this series, widely assumed to be inevitable this morning, is looking increasingly unlikely. It ends with another Anderson maiden: his pre-tea spell has yielded four leg byes, and nothing else.74th over: India 298-5 (Rahul 142, Pant 101) There’s a minor lbw shout against Rahul here, which had the ball not pitched a long way outside leg, and had it not been clearing the stumps by a distance, might have been close. A single later Pant reaches his maiden Test century by planting Rashid into the stands once again. He’s faced 118 balls.73rd over: India 290-5 (Rahul 141, Pant 94) Anderson keeps going, with another maiden. There’s no shifting these two, though, and the drama, and pressure, is mounting. 72nd over: India 290-5 (Rahul 141, Pant 94) Rashid comes back, and his first delivery is beautifully battered (a long way) over long on for six by Pant, who goes down on one knee for extra leverage. 71st over: India 282-5 (Rahul 140, Pant 87) Anderson and Broad are looking a lot more likely to get somewhere than anyone else has in this session, though obviously without actually getting anywhere, and with the new ball in mind they’ll soon be rotated off again. A maiden from Anderson to Rahul.70th over: India 282-5 (Rahul 140, Pant 87) Pant works the first ball of Broad’s over to third man for four, and the last flies off his outside edge with identical results. Right, let’s get these out of the way.“I surely can’t be the first to observe that rather than just drying out (over 65), Pant’s on fire?” suggests Brian Withington.“I’m sure you’re weary about all the underwear gags about Pant, so I thought I’d take a different tack,” says Nick Parish. “Does he have a tendency to breath heavily?”69th over: India 274-5 (Rahul 140, Pant 79) And Anderson also returns. The ball hits Rahul’s thigh pad and flies away for four leg byes. Sky, meanwhile, have removed the part of their on-screen graphic which until now read “England need 5 wickets to win” and replaced it with one that reads “Target 464”. Is this actually happening?68th over: India 270-5 (Rahul 140, Pant 79) Broad’s back, and his first delivery bursts out of the rough with a puff of dust, flies off the wrong bit of Rahul’s bat and flies safely away. Next ball Pant tries to clear Jennings at midwicket and only just does so, the ball flying just beyond the fielder’s grasp and away for four. That’s already a lot of action, and the over’s only two balls old. Four dots follow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1b2619b53a87b951f4687e04d4557972f2497d3/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eea6fdd52384cbce5fce99fb25f33897","title":"for his bounty theatre world pays tribute peter hall","story":"Events at Westminster Abbey and National Theatre honour RSC founder who died last yearExactly one year to the day after his death, Peter Hall has been given a double-headed, star-studded tribute, first at Westminster Abbey and then at the National Theatre.As the two buildings, one spiritual and the other secular, rang with his praises on Tuesday, one got a strong sense of the titanic achievement of a man who, as director, producer and impresario, did more than anyone to shape postwar British theatre.What struck one about the thanksgiving service at the abbey was the sheer aesthetic beauty of the proceedings: something you felt Hall himself would have appreciated. The London Philharmonic Orchestra played Tippett’s Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli with sublime grace. The voices of the Monteverdi Choir seemed to float from the heavens as they sang Bach. But there was also puckish humour as Sir Thomas Allen ended the Serenade from Mozart’s Don Giovanni with a gentle caress as if ardently seeking his loved one.Hall’s passion for music came eloquently across but there were also tributes from David Hare and Trevor Nunn. Hare hymned Hall’s endorsement of living dramatists – especially in his tenure as the first director of the National Theatre – and reeled off a long list of admittedly “male, pale” writers who benefited from his support. As Hare pointed out, in any conflict between the world at large and the artist, Hall was always to be found on the side of the artist.Nunn, who said he became a disciple of Hall when he heard him lecture at Cambridge in 1960, cunningly adapted Hamlet’s speech on “What a piece of work is man”.But perhaps what moved one most was the sight of some of the great actors who had worked with Hall. When Dame Judi Dench read Cleopatra’s paean to the dead Antony and cried “For his bounty, there was no winter in it”, she made the words echo through the abbey like a tribute to Hall himself.Vanessa Redgrave, in a passage from Corinthians, reiterated the word “love” as if it were the source of life. And David Suchet did not so much read as storm, with some fruity Olivier cadences, through the passage in Amadeus where Salieri realises he has heard the voice of God issuing through the obscene child that is Mozart.I can’t believe anyone emerged from that experience in the abbey without feeling enriched by the power of words and music which is what Hall would have wished.The second part of the celebration, which took place in the Olivier theatre, was a mixture of pictorial record, public performance and personal reminiscence. But the most powerful presence was that of Hall himself when captured on film. At one point, he was seen in an interview angrily combating the doom-mongers and nay-sayers who predicted the National, when it opened in 1976, would be a disaster.“It’s there for good,” cried Hall. “Imagine England without Westminster Abbey.” At that point the audience, most of whom had been in the abbey that morning, broke into spontaneous cheers.Among others, Richard Eyre spoke about how Hall changed his life and about the impact, on a theatrical innocent like himself, of the 1960s production of The Wars Of the Roses. Bill Kenwright, who as a commercial producer worked with Hall on and off for a decade, spoke of their relationship as if it were a romance and explained how he would barter with Hall over casting like a carpet-seller in a Moroccan souk. Thea Sharrock as a director and Dan Stevens as an actor also testified to Hall’s constant encouragement of the young and willingness to listen to their ideas.Sometimes these tributes to the theatrical dead can seem mawkish and overblown. That was not the case here because the evidence of Hall’s legacy lies all about. It is there in the National itself – “the house that Peter built” as the current director Rufus Norris called it – and in the endurance of the Royal Shakespeare Company, which Hall founded.It is there, too, in the acceptance by the government, however unwillingly, of the principle of subsidy of the arts. And it is there in the record of productions Hall created. To watch, in one afternoon, Alan Dobie and James Laurenson in Waiting For Godot, Greg Hicks in The Oresteia and Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart in No Man’s Land – a Pinter play that Hall pioneered – was to be reminded of one simple fact: though often attacked in his lifetime as a Machiavellian politician, Hall was a visionary who wanted the best in all the arts to be available to the widest possible number."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39730d701ffefc0b4b3296399d725a1a4258be19/0_159_5607_3365/master/5607.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b432850f5a0004bcf55bcc48dffc553d","title":"the great british bake off 2018 episode three live","story":"Bread.

Forecasters predict it will make landfall late on Thursday.Currently rated as a category 4 storm – the second most powerful on the national weather service’s (NWS) classification system – Florence would be the first storm in recorded history to make landfall at that magnitude so far north if it remains on its most likely track.In its latest advisory on Tuesday morning, the US national hurricane center (NHC) said the storm is close to category 5 in strength, and had slightly increased in speed as it headed toward the east coast. It is expected to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane ahead of its potential landfall.“The bottom line is that there is high confidence that Florence will be a large and extremely dangerous hurricane, regardless of its exact intensity,” the hurricane center said.The NHC, which is based in Miami, said the storm’s center was located about 410 miles (660 kilometers) south of Bermuda and about 975 miles (1570 kilometers) east-southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina.If you have been affected by Florence you can tell us about your experience using our encrypted form, or by sending your pictures and videos to the  securely via WhatsApp by adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.

When responding please make sure you put your safety and the safety of others first. Extreme weather events can be very unpredictable and carry very real risks McMaster ordered the evacuation of coastal areas to start at noon on Tuesday as Florence approaches. He said the storm surge could reach as high as 10ft (3m) and estimated that 1 million residents would be leaving the coast.“We know this evacuation order I’m issuing is going to be inconvenient,” McMaster said of the decision. “But we’re willing to suffer some inconvenience.” He added that the disruption was worth the effort to save lives.“This is a big, big hurricane,” McMaster said, noting that wind speeds are predicted to be more violent than in either of the the region’s two most damaging storms of the past 30 years.Virginia’s governor ordered a mandatory evacuation for some residents of low-lying coastal areas beginning on Tuesday morning. State officials say 245,000 people live in the affected area, but officials warned the storm could affect the entire state.McMaster declared a state of emergency on Saturday. The governors of Virginia, North Carolina and Maryland have done the same. The designation gives officials the power to order evacuations, establish shelters, prohibit travel and impose curfews.“Take steps now,” said North Carolina governor Roy Cooper over the weekend. On Monday he said: “We do know that we’re in the bull’s-eye.”On Monday afternoon, Donald Trump cancelled a scheduled appearance for Friday in Jackson, Mississippi, where he was due to campaign for Senate candidate Cindy Hyde-Smith. He sent a volley of tweets, calling on east coast residents to “be safe”.The NWS is predicting “life-threatening” storm surge and inland freshwater flooding, with some models predicting upwards of 2ft of rainfall. With winds of up to 150mph forecast, Florence will likely fell tree limbs and trigger power outages.Some forecasters are concerned that the storm appears likely to slow dramatically at about the time of landfall, like 2017’s Hurricane Harvey, which stalled out Houston, dropping huge amounts of rain over several days. That storm brought $125bn in damage last summer, mostly in Texas.Florence stands a significant chance of joining 2017’s Harvey and Irma as just the third storm to make landfall on the US mainland at category 4 strength (or higher) since 2005. When storms of that magnitude hit the lower 48 states, they usually travel through the warmer waters of the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico and rarely make landfall so far north up the eastern Atlantic coast. The last storm to hit the Carolinas as a category 4 was Hurricane Hugo nearly 30 years ago in 1989.Florida governor Rick Scott, whose state experiences the most hurricane-force storms in the US, pledged resources, expertise and guidance to the three states in which emergencies have been declared.Officials in North Carolina had already issued mandatory evacuation orders for coastal Dare county and Hatteras Island over the weekend. On Tuesday those orders were extended to Pamlico and Tyrell counties. The governor also waived certain restrictions for trucks and heavy vehicles to help farmers harvest crops and move livestock before the storm, officials said.“North Carolina is no stranger to hurricanes,” Cooper said Monday, at least partially alluding to the devastating effects of Hurricane Matthew, which struck the Carolinas as a category 1 storm in October 2016 killing 34 in the US, after cutting a vicious path across the Caribbean, killing more than 1,000 in Haiti.Off the state’s coast, large sea swells and dangerous rip currents were already apparent over the weekend, foreshadowing the storm’s arrival. Beachgoers have been warned to avoid the ocean, and ferries that service the state’s coast have been canceled.In Virginia, home to the world’s largest sea base, the US navy has ordered all ships to sea in preparation for the storm, where they can more safely ride out the violent wind and waves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d5643355b7d64df7778c251c35dc65601561ec9/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=098c5349265893e6ef8cb7074253e688","title":"florence hurricane path where is storm surge heading latest maps","story":"Florence could bring storm surges and heavy rain to Virginia, and North and South CarolinaHurricane Florence became a category 4 storm on Monday, sustaining winds of close to 130mph (195kmh) on its path toward the US east coast where it is forecast to make landfall on Thursday. The National Hurricane Center is warning that a life-threatening storm surge along the coast of South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia is likely. Forecasters are also warning of heavy rainfall which could cause life-threatening flooding further inland.Based on historical forecasts, the NHC track forecast cone, or “cone of uncertainty”, is the probable path of the centre of a tropical cyclone. The cone increases in size over time to indicate the greater areas of uncertainty about its path. The majority of flooding from the storm surge is caused by a phenomenon known as the Coriolis effect. The Earth’s rotation causes storms in the northern hemisphere to rotate anticlockwise, meaning a hurricane’s winds are deflected toward the right of the storm’s centre. Storms in the southern hemisphere behave the opposite way."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoIf you want to torture people, send them to A\u0026ampE\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash southern nurses hit out at lack of planParties react to uncertainty surrounding president\u0026rsquos planned trip to IrelandLeo Varadkar due to meet mother of young Donegal woman murdered in IndiaShorter carriages on more frequent services blamed for lack of capacity, overcrowdingMichael Fitzmaurice says aspiring candidates would address group and its members would then voteSir Keir Starmer says no deal would be \u0026lsquocatastrophic\u0026rsquo for IrelandDepartment and local authorities \u0026lsquoneed to do more\u0026rsquo on emergency housing, says EnglishOrganisers \u0026lsquohonoured\u0026rsquo that Higgins will attend match in memory of late playerJudge imposes order which requires youth to apologise to school principalOECD report paints mixed picture of Ireland\u0026rsquos education systemIrish government said visit in November has been \u0026lsquopostponed\u0026rsquo for \u0026lsquoscheduling reasons\u0026rsquoAlliance says it will organise a day of mass action against housing and homelessnessEmployers\u0026rsquo lack of awareness is preventing spouses of professionals from securing workRebecca Carter (18) from Wexford in danger of losing place to study veterinary medicine this year, court toldFood Safety Authority of Ireland issues order due to concerns over production siteMan who died following jet-ski incident in Co Fermanagh lake has been namedBaby discovered by mother with cord around neck when she went to check on her in Cork homeGarda\u0026iacute in Athlone appeal for witnesses to fatal collision on Tuesday morningVicky Phelan, the woman whose case revealed controversy, says finding is a \u0026lsquowhitewash\u0026rsquo"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

The US wants Kim to proceed with denuclearisation first, but North Korea wants its security guaranteed and a peace agreement to formally end the Korean War of 1950-53. North Koreans wave flowers at Kim Jong-un as he surveys their procession from a balconyHowever, the stalemate has been showing signs of softening in recent days. On Friday President Trump told reporters on Air Force One that a personal letter from Kim Jong-un was going to be delivered soon. “I think it’s going to be a positive letter,” he predicted. Earlier the president had tweeted his thanks to Kim for his “unwavering faith” in him, adding “We will get it done together!” in reference to denuclearisation. Flare-up: aeroplanes forming the number 70 fly in formation “Kim and Trump are trading gestures to appease the US Congress and show to the world that the deal is on. And, indeed, the deal is on but Kim will not fully denuclearise,” North Korea analyst Loretta Napoleoni told The . Analysts have repeatedly warned that despite the current thaw on the Korean Peninsula, Kim has never committed to fully surrendering his nuclear weapons.  Jeffrey Lewis, a nonproliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, tweeted that the understated nature of the Pyongyang parade indicated that North Korea “wants a version of the Israel deal.”He explained: “They don’t test nuclear weapons or show them off at parades we pretend they don’t exist.”According to reporters at the scene, the parade was split into two sections, civilian and military. The military segment featured soldiers wearing uniforms from different periods of national history, then switching to civilian groups, ranging from nurses to construction workers alongside colourful floats. Kim Jong-un clasps the hand of Chinese envoy, Li Zhanshu during the paradeKim surveyed the procession from a balcony in Kim Il Sung square, at times locking hands with Li Zhanshu, a senior envoy sent by Xi Jinping, the Chinese president. Foreign delegations from Russia, Syria, Vietnam and African nations reflected Kim’s concerted push this year in terms of promoting his own personal diplomacy and trying to cultivate a more statesman-like image.French actor Gerard Depardieu was in attendanceIn a break from recent tradition, he did not address the crowd. Instead Kim Yong-nam, the country’s ceremonial head of state told the audience that North Korea had achieved status as a military power, and would now pursue efforts to strengthen its economy.A gala was held on the eve of the 70th anniversaryThe anniversary celebrations also mark the revival of North Korea\u0027s iconic mass games after a five-year hiatus. The mass games involve tens of thousands of people performing precisely choreographed dancing in a symbol of national unity.  This year\u0027s spectacle - tickets start at just over $100 and go up to more than $800 per seat - also has a strong economic theme.Low police pay award is a \u0026#39punch in the nose\u0026#39 for officers, say Met chief Simple urine test for ovarian cancer which could radically improve survival rates on the horizonNotorious hate preacher Anjem Choudary to be released from prison despite remaining \u0026#39genuinely dangerous\u0026#39Robo-trousers to give elderly bionic strength designed by British scientists Soviet labour camps were \u0026#39compassionate\u0026#39, \u0026#39educational\u0026#39 institutions, say trans rights campaignersChancellor hints at fuel duty rise to fund NHS as campaigners warn struggling families will be hitDonald Trump cancels trip to IrelandAustralian cartoonist hits back over criticism of \u0026#39racist and sexist\u0026#39 Serena Williams sketchComment: Boris Johnson attempts to woo his next conquests: the Minford SistersNational Gallery accused of paying £1.3m over the odds for first painting by a woman bought in 25 years Pharmaceutical pollution linked to rise in superbugsOne in nine going hungry globally as climate change increases food insecurityConman duped dementia patients out of life savings to buy himself a £10,000 hair transplantComment: Never mind that character – has Bodyguard killed the period drama?Second case of rare viral infection monkeypox confirmed in the UK, health bosses confirmComment: There\u0026#39s nothing wrong with paying for private school so your children can afford a JagWhere were you?  readers share their memories of 911China restricts online coverage of burning incense and praying in religious crackdownRussia\u0026#39s National Guard chief challenges opposition leader Alexei Navalny to a duelWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"george w bushs 911 candid new pictures show president dealt","story":"Before the storm: President George W.

He was said to be in a stable condition.Dr Mike Beadsworth, clinical director of the Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit, confirmed they are now treating a second patient who has tested positive for monkeypox. He said: “The patient is being cared for on our specialist infectious and tropical diseases unit, by highly trained staff who are experienced in dealing with a variety of infectious diseases.“All necessary precautions are being taken by specialist staff and there is currently no risk to other staff, patients or visitors.“We ask that people continue to use our services as normal and that people only come to our emergency department if their condition is serious andor an emergency.”Monkeypox is a rare viral infection, similar to smallpox but not as deadly.

Thousands perished in the process, from starvation and ill-healthGoldsmiths, University of LondonStudents at a leading London university have been condemned as blind to reality after defending the system of Soviet Gulag labour camps where thousands perished as “compassionate” places of rehabilitation.Trans rights campaigners at Goldsmiths University described the Gulags as benign places where inmates received education, training and enjoyed the opportunity to take part in clubs, sports and theatre groups.In fact most historians agree they were a brutal network of labour camps used by Stalin’s Soviet dictatorship to incarcerate internal opponents and so-called ‘enemies of the state’, resulting in the death of more than an estimated 1.05 million people.During a bizarre exchange on Twitter the LGBTQ group at Goldsmiths Student Union described life in the Gulags as “rehabilitatory” and “educational”.Paradoxically the thread was written as an apparent justification for an earlier post by the same group which threatened to send a political opponent “to the gulag”.The threat was made against Claire Graham, a special education needs teacher, who wrote objecting to LGBTQ Goldsmith’s threat to target feminist academics who they claimed were prejudiced against transgender iniduals.Tans activists refer to these women by the derogatory term TERFS, claiming they are guilty of hate crimes for their opposition to allowing men undergoing gender transition to use women’s toilets and other female only spaces.In its Tweets, Goldsmith LGBTQ said: “The ideas of TERFS and anti-trans bigots literally *kill* and must be eradicated through re-education.”Ms Graham said: “I said that I thought their choice of language, in talking about lists and purging people was intended to shut down debate about trans people and the law. I then received unpleasant and dehumanising threats about being sent to the Gulag. I feel bad for other trans people because this kind of response by some makes them seem so extreme and intolerant.”Goldsmith LGBTQ subsequently attempted to justify the threat to send Ms Graham to the Gulag by stating that “sending a bigot to one is actually a compassionate, non-violent course of action.”The original Twitter thread from Goldsmith LGBTQ, since removedThe Twitter thread went on to state that the CIA had spread “lies” about the Gulag system, adding: “First myth to debunk: ‘u work until u die in gulags!’ The Soviets did away with life sentences and the longest sentence was 10 years. Capital punishment was reserved for the most heinous, serious crimes.“The penal system was a rehabilitatory one. The aim was to correct and change the ways of criminals.”It added: “Much like wider Soviet society, everyone who was ‘able’ to work did so at a wage proportionate to those who weren’t incapacitated and, as they gained skills, were able to move up the ranks and work under less supervision.“Educational work was also a prominent feature of the Soviet penal system. There were regular classes, book clubs, newspaper editorial teams, sports theatre and performance groups.”In contrast, mainstream historians have concluded that the gulag system, which reached its peak under Joseph Stalin\u0027s rule, was a system of forced labour camps used to incarcerate a wide range of convicts, from petty criminals to political prisoners - including Stalin’s left-wing, Trotskyist opponents and gay men and women.The rest of Goldsmith LGBTQ\u0026#39s Twitter thread justifying the Gulag systemAleksandr Solzhenitsyn, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, who survived eight years imprisoned in a Gulag incarceration, brought its horrors to the world\u0027s attention in his 1973 book The Gulag Archipelago.Soviet files show that 1,053,829 people died in the camps between 1934 and 1953, mostly as a result of deliberate starvation.The historian Anne Applebaum, author of Gulag: A History, said: “It was an incredibly brutal system designed to eliminate Stalin\u0027s’ enemies and terrorise the wider population. Most of the inmates were innocent of anything we would regard as a crime.”Ms Graham said: “The LGBTQ group’s interpretation of the history of the Gulag system is madness.”Goldsmiths Students’ Union has now suspended the group and withdrawn its support for its activities, saying the Gulag threat - and subsequent refusal by the group to apologise for it - clearly breached the students\u0027 union code of conduct.In a statement backed by Goldsmiths University the students’ union said: “We condemn the abhorrent content of the tweets and they are in complete opposition to the views and values of the Students’ Union.”Members of Goldsmiths LGBTQ refused to comment when approached by The Daily .Goldsmiths, University of LondonLow police pay award is a \u0026#39punch in the nose\u0026#39 for officers, say Met chief Simple urine test for ovarian cancer which could radically improve survival rates on the horizonNotorious hate preacher Anjem Choudary to be released from prison despite remaining \u0026#39genuinely dangerous\u0026#39Robo-trousers to give elderly bionic strength designed by British scientists Chancellor hints at fuel duty rise to fund NHS as campaigners warn struggling families will be hitDonald Trump cancels trip to IrelandAustralian cartoonist hits back over criticism of \u0026#39racist and sexist\u0026#39 Serena Williams sketchComment: Boris Johnson attempts to woo his next conquests: the Minford SistersNational Gallery accused of paying £1.3m over the odds for first painting by a woman bought in 25 years Pharmaceutical pollution linked to rise in superbugsOne in nine going hungry globally as climate change increases food insecurityConman duped dementia patients out of life savings to buy himself a £10,000 hair transplantComment: Never mind that character – has Bodyguard killed the period drama?Second case of rare viral infection monkeypox confirmed in the UK, health bosses confirmComment: There\u0026#39s nothing wrong with paying for private school so your children can afford a JagWhere were you?  readers share their memories of 911China restricts online coverage of burning incense and praying in religious crackdownRussia\u0026#39s National Guard chief challenges opposition leader Alexei Navalny to a duelFuture of Europe: Justin Huggler answers your defence questions We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/09/11/TELEMMGLPICT000174161626_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqvWdfq-a34Yz0x6lFPidU73BN7wquremafcWvM6jFD-I.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"telegraph readers share memories 911","story":" readers have shared their stories from September 11th 2001 On 11th of September 2001, the world came to a stand still as it watched the events of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon unfold in real-time.To commemorate the 17th anniversary of 911,  readers have shared their stories of the moment the news broke and the lasting impact it had on them.\u0027The ripples of 911 had a profound effect on us as a family not only emotionally but financially\u0027\u0027There was an exhibition in St David\u0027s Cathedral in Wales. It was our first holiday since my six month old son had been born and I vividly remember people discussing what had happened and thinking that it was a bad joke. I remember a lady who was exhibiting her work saying that it was true and that a plane had flown into the World Trade Centre.\u0027It was only when I saw it on television later that day that the enormity of the situation hit me. I remember feeling that the world had gone mad and worrying about my baby and my husband who happened to be an airline pilot. The ripples of 911 had a profound effect on us as a family not only emotionally but financially.\u0027Airlines lost passengers and revenue because people were too scared to fly and many pilots lost their livelihoods which severely impacted in their families. People were rightly concerned about the victims of 911 and the heroic rescue efforts but many more innocents were caught up in 911.\u0027\u0027Pack your bags, we\u0027re off to war\u0027\u0027I was stationed at RAF Bruggen in Germany and remember seeing the live footage and thinking ‘pack your bags, we’re off to war.’ Two tours in AFG later. The horrors of that day are terrible and when you add the collective loss of life, both military and civilian, from then to now it all seems endless.

We were watching the news report as the second plane crashed into the tower. That night, we stayed glued to the TV and wept for the people we saw falling out of the buildings like rag dolls. We gasped when we saw the people running for their lives as the towers collapsed.\u0027Even though I have been to New York several times since, I could never bring myself to visit the site.\u0027\u002717 years later and it\u0027s still fresh in my mind\u0027\u0027I was 11 years old. I still remember that day clearly and my parents being glued to the news.

Rigby had come up with the idea for Manchester’s first gin distillery when he was working as a film lecturer. He quit his job and tried running a bar, then realised he hated pushing a mop around.\u0026nbspIt was 2013, not long after Sipsmith had overturned an archaic\u0026nbsplaw preventing people setting up small distilleries. Gin distilling was on the rise. Rigby decided he wanted to make gin that captured the independent spirit of Manchester, but it took him two years to find a venue.\u0026nbspIncrease in regulations means small firms will struggle, trader warnsRBS to face no action over GRG small business lending scandalWith a year to go until Brexit, small businesses have big concerns“I almost gave up,” Rigby says. “It was almost impossible to find a place to start a business in Manchester City Centre. The railway arch we found in Redbank was the last roll of the dice.”His railway arch in the resurgent Green Quarter is now surrounded by small traders, from breweries and bars to a fitness studio and dry cleaners. Though arches can frequently be damp, awkward spaces, Rigby spent time turning his into the perfect place for small batch gin production. He enlisted his dad to help build all of the interiors by hand, including a mezzanine with a tasting area and a bar.\u0026nbspManchester Three Rivers\u0026nbspis in one of thousands of railway arches being sold off by Network Rail as part of a plan by the publicly owned company to concentrate on running the railways. Network Rail has said tenant leases will transfer to the new owner unchanged. But tenants like Rigby and his colleagues are facing months of uncertainty as Network Rail finalises the terms of the deal.Many tenants tell the same story. They moved in looking for a space near to city centres and cheap rent, and spent time adapting to the awkward shape of the properties and installing basic amenities like electric sockets and toilets. In recent years, Network Rail has put up rent across many properties, sparking fears that it is inflating the value of the estate in the run up to the sale. \u0026nbspNetwork Rail denies that rent increases are linked to the sale. It says it is selling the estate to invest in the railway. But the sale\u0026nbspcomes as Network Rail grapples with spiralling debts, which increased by £5.6bn to £50.4bn in 2017-18. The Office of Rail and Road, the industry regulator, has warned that Network Rail will run out of money to borrow in 2018-19.\u0026nbspSarah Arnold, a researcher at think tank the New Economics Foundation, has calculated that businesses in the railway arches being sold off by Network Rail contribute over £725m to the UK economy every year. “Every day we speak to small business owners who have had to shut down or relocate because of massive in-year rent increases, often leaving arches vacant for years,” Arnold says. “When you look at how much these arches businesses contribute to our economy, it doesn’t make any sense to put all of that at risk.”Danny Lennon is looking to move his business Footprint Scenery from three railway arches in Peckham, south London, after challenging Network Rail over rent increases of up to 100 per cent.Footprint moved to London to make props and scenery for television shows like Spooks and Hustle, with one eye on the 2012 Olympic Games. After London won the bid for the games, Footprint was recruited to make over 1000 props for Danny Boyle’s opening ceremony, from costumes\u0026nbspto books\u0026nbspto name placards for the athletes’ parade.“We started advertising the fact that we had done the Olympics\u0026nbspand it helped grow the business,” says Lennon, who started his career making props for children’s TV. The success of the 2012 opening ceremony has led to work making props for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and puppets for the 2015 European Games.Footprint grew\u0026nbspinto two and then three arches as it took on more work and more staff. But recent rent increases have taken their toll. “We had to lay off staff. Three full time staff that have gone, that’s coming in to half our full time workforce, which has increased the work on me and Agnes,” he says. “We’re looking to move.”Lennon has\u0026nbspappealed to\u0026nbspSouthwark Council for help finding a new property. Tenants in Hackney have been working with Philip Glanville, the mayor of Hackney, who wrote to Chris Grayling, secretary of state for transport, on their behalf in June.\u0026nbspGlanville called for the sale to be paused and the estate to be ided up into smaller lots to allow for alternative offers. He also offered to discuss the potential for local authority investment.Jo Johnson, the transport minister, agreed to consider alternative proposals at a meeting in July arranged by s of the Arches, a campaign group set up by tenants including Manchester Three Rivers Gin and Footprint Scenery. But as the sale reaches its final stages, there are fears his response may come too late.Tenants caution that a single, remote and commercially driven landlord could lead to even more aggressive rent increases as the buyer recoups the cost of the sale, which is expected to come to £1.4bn. The bidders are said to include Blackstone, the world’s largest real estate investment manager, and CK Asset Holdings, an infrastructure investor founded by Li Ka-shing, Asia’s richest man.\u0026nbspNhi Chu co-owns Chu’s Garage, which has been running out of the same arch in Hackney for 30 years, since her family escaped from Vietnam as refugees. In that time it has built up trust in the community and a loyal customer base. But recent rent increases have put the business on the verge of bankruptcy.“We have a simple request of the government,” Chu says. “Intervene in this sale and show that you really do support independent traders and entrepreneurs.

The truth about toddlers’ cough medicines“This review indicates that, despite being one of the most common causes for seeking medical advice in primary care, there is no beneficial treatment for subacute cough,” they said in the British Journal of General Practice.“Considering the problem of overtreatment, spending time with the patient to explain the illness might be crucial for patient satisfaction.”In the UK persistent cough\u0026nbspcosts the economy £979m a year in lost productivity and sick days, with a further £104m cost to the NHS from lost doctors appointments, despite the little they can do for most coughs.For the study Dr Speich and his team only looked at clinical trials, which have randomly allocated patients to either receive a medication or a placebo treatment – therefore minimising the chance of any effects being a coincidence.They considered any type of drug that had been tested in this format, though they chose to discount traditional Chinese medicines, and looked at patients who had their cough between three and eight weeks.\u0026nbspDrugs that were\u0026nbspput to the test included common asthma inhaler\u0026nbsptreatment salbutamol, and another containing codeine.“No treatment option was associated with a clear benefit on cough recovery or other patient-relevant outcomes in any of the studies” after two weeks or one month, the authors write.Additionally, 14 per cent of patients experienced unwanted negative side effects, including headache, nausea, chest pain and in some cases even a worsening of their cough.The findings come after Public Health England recommend patients take honey and hot drinks for sore throats\u0026nbspinstead of asking their doctor for antibiotics.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/11/17/monkey-pox.jpg","title":"monkeypox virus nigeria africa lethal symptoms infection cornwall blackpool spreading","story":"Created with Sketch.Nigerian outbreak in 2017 has left pockets of disease which \u0027could affect travellers\u0027Click to followThe IndependentHealth officials have warned a second person\u0026nbsphas been identified with the rare and potentially life-threatening infection monkeypox, just days after the first ever case in England was identified in Cornwall.The infections are thought to be unrelated and Public Health England (PHE) is trying to contact anyone who might have come into contact with either of the\u0026nbsppatients, who have both recently\u0026nbspvisited Nigeria.The new patient\u0026nbspis believed to have picked up the infection while visiting the country and it was diagnosed at Blackpool Victoria Hospital when they returned home and fell ill.Health officials said\u0026nbspinfection is usually mild and the condition does not spread easily, but\u0026nbspsevere cases can be fatal and the patient has been transferred to a specialist infectious disease unit at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital.“We know that in September 2017 Nigeria experienced a large sustained outbreak of monkeypox and since then sporadic cases have continued to be reported,” said Dr Nick Phin, deputy director of PHE’s\u0026nbspNational Infection Service.“It is likely that monkeypox continues to circulate in Nigeria and could therefore affect travellers who are returning from this part of the world, however, it is very unusual to see two cases in such a relatively short space of time.”Monkeypox: the factsMonkeypox occurs primarily in remote parts of central and west Africa, near tropical rainforests.It is similar to human smallpox, which was eradicated in 1980. Although monkeypox is much milder, it can be fatal.The virus is mostly transmitted to people from wild animals such as primates but can spread from human to human.The fatality rate is between 1 per cent and 10 per cent.Initial symptoms include fever, headache, aching muscles, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion.A rash can also develop, usually starting on the face before spreading to other parts of the body. It eventually forms a scab that falls off.Dr Mike Beadsworth, clinical director of the Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit at the Royal Liverpool\u0026nbspUniversity Hospital, said: “We are treating a patient who has tested positive for monkeypox.“The patient is being cared for on our specialist infectious and tropical diseases unit, by highly trained staff who are experienced in dealing with a variety of infectious diseases.”Over the weekend it was reported that a Nigerian citizen staying at a naval base in Cornwall had been diagnosed with the first ever case of monkeypox in England and PHE was trying to trace other people who may have shared their flight as a precaution. The first case, believed to be a\u0026nbspnaval officer, is being treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London.The disease, which was first identified in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, has mostly been spread on the\u0026nbspAfrican\u0026nbspcontinent through the handling of infected monkeys, Gambian giant rats and squirrels, with rodents being the most likely source of the virus.Eating inadequately cooked meat from infected animals is another possible risk factor, according to the World Health Organisation.Healthcare staff or people who may have come into contact with either infected person\u0026nbspshould contact PHE\u0026nbspfor health advice.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2015/03/07/20/27-Elgin-Marbles-Getty.jpg","title":"elgin marbles parthenon sculptures ancient greece british museum brexit","story":"Created with Sketch.The Parthenon Sculptures have been the subject of debate for more than 200 years.

But, following a letter from the Greek government to Jeremy Wright,\u0026nbspthe culture secretary, that is exactly what is now happening. Lydia Koniordou, Wright’s Greek counterpart, has asked for dialogue with Britain over the antique sculptures known as the Elgin Marbles.Brought to Britain in the early 1800s by Lord Elgin, the artworks – more properly known as the Parthenon Sculptures – have aroused excitement and controversy ever since. They first went on display in London in 1807, then from 1817 they reached an international audience from a new home in the British Museum. Everyone from Canova to Rodin declared them to be among the most exceptional sculptures ever made. Over two centuries later, they remain one of the British Museum\u0027s most popular displays.Not everyone was happy that Elgin shipped the sculptures to Britain. Lord Byron famously lamented: “Dull is the eye that will not weep to see \u0026nbspThy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed \u0026nbspBy British hands.” But few put his panegyric into context. Byron was a Romantic, who wanted the monumental art of ancient Greek civilisation to crumble poetically as decayed vestiges of lost perfection. He was also making a one-off point rather than speaking from principle, as he personally imported Greek antiquities to Britain and sold them privately.Nevertheless, Byron\u0027s mixed attitudes towards ancient Greece\u0026nbspexpress some of the challenges inherent in questions of cultural heritage, which often see a feverish mix of emotion and romance meet a hard wall of reality.“For me, the Parthenon Sculptures raise some of the biggest questions of cultural property, ownership and where works of art ‘belong’,”\u0026nbspexplains Mary Beard, professor of classics at Cambridge,\u0026nbspThe timing of Greece’s recent letter could not be more significant. Theresa May\u0027s beleaguered strategy to deliver Brexit will ultimately require the consent of all 27\u0026nbspEU members. That means inidual rounds of diplomacy with each country. Greece is taking the opportunity – quite understandably – to probe for a possible quid pro quo, which it hopes will include the Parthenon Sculptures.There have been similar requests from Greece in the past, notably in a campaign by former Greek culture minister Melina Mercouri in the 1980s. However, consecutive British governments have consistently rejected all such requests, although an unexpected door was opened in June when Jeremy Corbyn announced that any government led by him would make it a policy to give the sculptures to Greece.Corbyn\u0027s statement was based on his conviction that the sculptures “belong” to Greece. He referred to them as “stolen” and “looted” by Britain. Many share this view, including members of the British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles, or BCRPM – one of the key groups formed in the UK to press for the sculptures to be given to Greece.The British government\u0027s view goes back to 1816, when a UK Parliamentary Select Committee interviewed witnesses – including Elgin – who had been in Athens at the time, and concluded that Elgin had obtained all necessary permissions from the Ottoman authorities in Athens to remove the sculptures and transport them to England. The Select Committee then voted, 82 to 30, to acquire the sculptures for the nation, before presenting them to the British Museum for public display, scholarship, enlightenment and enjoyment.In many circles, however, there are misgivings about Britain claiming ownership over antiquities that manifestly were not made in Britain. This feeling is tinged with even more awkwardness as the sculptures were acquired during the age of Empire: a period not known for its cultural sensitivity.However, these are generalities. The Parthenon Sculptures have a well-documented and unique history which sheds important light on the controversy.Around 480BC, Athens was entering its Golden Age. It had finally seen off Persia, and the philosophers and playwrights we revere as the founders of western civilisation were starting to tread its sun-hardened streets.Pericles, the city’s leader from around 461BC, decided to mark the city’s new influence and affluence with a vast building project. One of its highlights was to be a magnificent new temple to Athena the Maiden (Parthenos) built on the Acropolis, the city\u0027s highest hill. To ensure the temple was the envy of all, Pericles commissioned one of the city’s sculptors, Pheidias, to decorate the sacred building with a scheme of sculpture that would transport visitors from earth up onto Mount Olympus itself.The artisans in Pheidias’s workshop hacked and smoothed the white marble until eventually the pieces – once vividly painted – were hoisted up onto the great temple. Onlookers were agog, and anyone looking at the sculptures today will know why. The bodies throb with life. The skin appears warm and real to the touch. The gossamer drapery flows as if in natural motion. And the drama of the scenes is charged with an ethereal tension and electricity that is almost unparalleled in art. There are few major sculptors in the last two hundred years who have not looked on them and felt cowed.Once the classical world of mercurial gods and goddesses faded and the era of Christianity dawned, the sculptures began to suffer. Around AD500, the citizens of Athens defaced many and hacked off others in order to convert the Parthenon into a church. This systematic iconoclasm was the single largest act of destruction in the sculptures\u0027 history. Further damage occurred in 1687 when an invading Venetian force bombarded the Acropolis with mortars and scored a direct hit on the Parthenon, which was being used by the ruling Ottomans as an explosives store.The Ottomans – who had conquered Athens in 1456 – are a key player in what was to happen next. In 1799, Thomas Bruce, seventh Earl of Elgin, was appointed Britain’s ambassador to the “Sublime Porte” of the Ottoman Empire at Constantinople. According to some sources, inspired to allow the people and artists of Europe to enjoy the wonders of ancient Greek art, Elgin spent his own money on commissioning artists and sculptors to draw, paint and take casts of the Parthenon Sculptures and other statuary and stonework in Athens.When Elgin\u0027s men arrived in Athens, they found the Ottomans had turned the Acropolis into a military garrison, and soldiers were using the sculptures on the Parthenon for firearms target practice, and hacking bits off to sell to the growing throngs of tourists on the Grand Tour. By this time the Parthenon had only around half of the sculptures that Pheidias originally placed there, with many in poor condition. Mary Beard explains: “The Acropolis was then a rather sordid Turkish military base, and it would have been easy to convince oneself – rightly or wrongly – that the sculpture was better off out of there.”Elgin’s men then began overseeing the removal of the sculptures. Over the course of 10 years, they used local labourers to take down around half of the sculptures on the building (a quarter of the originals), which Elgin shipped back to Britain.Those\u0026nbsp10 years, 1800-10, lie at the heart of the whole Elgin controversy. Opinions ide. Some say Elgin was a hero and conservator who saved the sculptures for the world. Others, like Paul Cartledge, professor of Greek Culture emeritus at Cambridge, differ: “I believe,” he says, “Elgin had purely self-aggrandising reasons for seeking to acquire – for himself and his own personal display – as many of the Marbles as he could.”The 1816 UK Parliamentary select committee concluded otherwise. After examining witnesses and records, it noted that in 1801 Elgin had obtained a firman – an Ottoman legal permit – which, according to a translation shown to them, permitted Elgin to make drawings, create casts and take away “any pieces of stone with inscriptions or figures”.The BCRPM and other reunificationists stress that Parliament did not see the original firman, and so the permit\u0027s specific terms remain unknown. Moreover, they say, even the translated version does not explicitly envisage the wholesale removal of so much sculpture. Elgin was, they say, guilty of mission creep.Whichever view is right, another angle to the question is that Elgin, as ambassador, had the power of the British state behind him. Britain had just defeated Napoleon, who was also an enemy of the Ottomans. Britain was therefore in good odour at the Ottoman court, and Elgin was in a position to ask for favours. “Elgin,” Paul Cartledge believes, “certainly unquestionably exploited the fraught international situation c. 1800, whereby Britain was the enemy of the Ottoman Sultan\u0027s (French) enemy and therefore the Sultan\u0027s ‘friend’.”Those who view Elgin in a more kindly light point to the fact all this removal work was not done covertly or surreptitiously. It was carried out over a period of 10 years, in broad daylight, in central Athens, using hundreds of Greek labourers, under the noses of the authorities, and was even revalidated by a second firman in 1810 when the work was complete and French diplomats tried to hold up the last shipment\u0026nbsp(the French were hoping that they might get some of the sculptures for the Louvre).\u0026nbspThis leads to one of the central disagreements in the whole debate. Greece – aided by allies, including Britain and British philhellenes who had been inspired by seeing the Parthenon Sculptures in London – overthrew the Ottomans in 1832 and restored Greek government. The BCRPM therefore asks how the Ottomans can have given Elgin valid authority to remove the sculptures when they were an illegitimate occupying power.However, the lawyers don’t see it this way. When the Greek government instructed Amal Clooney and Geoffrey Robertson to advise them in 2014, the Syriza government eventually decided that the route to gaining the sculptures was political and diplomatic rather than legal. This came as a surprise to no one. In 1985, Professor John Henry Merryman of Stanford Law School, a leading authority on cultural property, examined the case for restitution and concluded that the modern state of Greece had no legal, moral, or ethical claim to the sculptures.Archaeological treasures of Ancient GreeceThis golden death mask was discovered in the ruins of ancient Mycenae in 1876 by Heinrich Schliemann after he went looking for the palace of Agamemnon, a central figure in the Trojan War.

The figures’ heads are in AthensA wall painting from a house in Akrotiri, Santorini, which was covered with ash from a volcanic eruption in about 1,500BC. It shows swallows swooping among clusters of red lilliesOne of the reasons for this is that by the time Elgin’s men arrived in Athens in 1800, the Ottomans had ruled Greece for almost 350 years. Countries are forever changing hands, and the Ottomans were, in fact and law, the internationally recognised government of the day. Who else, many ask, should or could Elgin have requested for permission to remove the sculptures to safety?When Elgin got back to Britain, he was suffering from catastrophic debt. He estimated he had spent around £73,600\u0026nbsp(around £3.5m in today’s money) bringing the sculptures to Britain. Parliament offered him £35,000 for the lot, which he accepted. The sculptures went to the British Museum. “It is a myth that Elgin profited hugely from \u0027getting\u0027 the marbles,” Mary Beard explains. “His wife walked out, and he faced bankruptcy, which prompted the sale to the government.” Elgin moved to France, where he died, broken and bankrupt.Once on display in London, the sculptures caused a sensation and started waves of fashion for Greek art and civilisation. “The marbles in London were a vital catalyst for 19th-century Europe\u0027s passion for Greek culture,” explains Dr Greg Sullivan, a leading sculpture historian. “The marbles got into the bloodstream of contemporary 19th-century art. If you attended the Royal Academy art schools or the Derby Mechanics Institute, or if you visited Oxford, Cambridge or Wisbech art galleries, you would be greeted with copies of the statues or casts from the Parthenon frieze.“Flaxman, Westmacott, Gibson, Chantrey. Leighton and Alma-Tadema all acknowledged their influence. It demonstrates how passion for European culture has been a key part of Britishness for centuries, Plaster casts by the British artists Westmacott and Brucciani were given or sold all over Europe to courts and art schools in Germany, Italy, Spain and elsewhere, accelerating the passion for Hellenic civilization. Henning’s miniature relief copies of the frieze were sold and pirated in Paris, Rome, Munich and Vienna.”The sculptures Elgin left in Athens did not fare well. Pollution from the oil refinery at nearby Eleusis eroded many into furry vestiges of their former glories, and a restoration from 1895-1933 by Nicholaos Balanos stapled the sculptures with iron bars which expanded, shattering sections of marble. Fortunately, the casts commissioned by Elgin preserved the details of these sculptures, and have enabled replicas to be made. The British Museum also came in for criticism for an overly abrasive cleaning program in the late 1930s, when it was fashionable to make antique sculptures gleam bright white. However, it was nothing that was not being done at the time to artefacts all over the world, including in Greece. The British Museum subsequently conducted a full investigation, held a conference, and published all results.Looking at all the evidence, Mary Beard concludes: “We must not turn a blind eye to all the problems here, but we should put them in their historical context, without whitewashing or demonising Elgin.”The Elgin Marbles controversy does not, of course, begin and end with Elgin and the wording of his permits. A broader question – which is an increasingly important one – transcends the legal technicalities and asks whether an increasingly culturally sensitive world should be engaging in a general amnesty of cultural artefacts.It is now a real question whether museums should – as a moral act – send objects to the places they were made.\u0026nbspThere can be strong arguments in favour. Some were looted in war. Some would bring tourism to their home regions. Some have ongoing cultural meaning. “To me, the legality of the matter is the least important thing,” says Paul\u0026nbspCartledge. “We don\u0027t actually know what the Sultan\u0027s firman actually permitted Elgin to do. The most important thing is to see what remains of the sculptures – from the British Museum and elsewhere – reunified where they properly can be best appreciated, in the New Acropolis Museum of Athens.”However, against this view is the inevitable sense of loss the world would feel if its principal museums were emptied out. These great “encyclopaedic” or “universal” museums – largely products of the age of Enlightenment – offer a unique opportunity for everyone to experience the interrelationship of all things. In these museums\u0027 vast collections – in Paris, Berlin, St Petersburg, London, Athens and elsewhere – visitors gaze into other cultures, not just into a reflection of their own. They are museums of humanity.Dr Tiffany Jenkins, expert in museums and cultural property, sees strong reasons for artefacts remaining spread around the globe. “The question we should ask is, where is best for the object, in terms of truth, access and preservation? The present situation – where half the remaining sculptures are in Athens and the rest are in London – is a good one. It means the marbles can be seen and understood both in Athens, in the Acropolis Museum close to where they were created, and in London, where they are placed within a universal collection of artefacts from multiple human civilisations.” It is a powerful alternative vision to the idea of restitution, aimed at promoting a wider appreciation of the sculptures.” Jenkins continues: “Like time machines, these museums provide historical context and cross-cultural insight.”The idea of returning objects to their place of origin can also be a challenge if history has moved on. Greece, for instance, did not exist when Pheidias made the sculptures. The Parthenon was a resolutely Athenian project, with the temple used as a treasury for protection money Athens collected from the other Greek city states in the Delian League. Dr James Campbell, fellow in art history and architecture at Cambridge, notes: “It is worth remembering that the Parthenon itself was built on the proceeds of war and taxation and came to be seen by many parts of the Greek world as a symbol of Athenian oppression. It was filled with goods stolen and looted from other cultures.” The Delian League evoked such resentment that it prompted a civil war in which Sparta supplanted Athens as most influential power in the region. So although Greece is unarguably the place where the sculptures were made, they were never a symbol of Greek unity, ancient or modern.“Throughout history, goods have passed across borders and moved from one place to another. Much art fits into this category,”\u0026nbspCampbell continues.\u0026nbsp“Our galleries are full of Italian Masters, Dutch landscapes, French Impressionists. No one is suggesting that every Italian Master belongs to the Italian government. Why, then, do we think the Elgin Marbles belong to the Greek government? Or indeed that the Elgin marbles should be swapped for a better Brexit deal?”Allied to the question of geographical heritage is yet another, more philosophical, perspective. It asks what an object is, and whether an artefact can have more than one identity or tell more than one story. Seen this way, Pheidias\u0027s carvings are simultaneously the Parthenon Sculptures and the Elgin Marbles, and who is to say that both stories should not be told?Dr Tiffany Jenkins elaborates further. “The sculptures have been discarded as well as venerated, seen as historical documents as well as artworks. In the early 19th-century, the Royal Academician Ozias Humphrey, thought them a\u0026nbsp‘mass of ruins’. Most recently at the British Museum they were the centrepiece of a superb exhibition that shed light on the sculpture of Auguste Rodin.”The future of the Parthenon Sculptures is undeniably a decision for Parliament. The British Museum is governed by statute and has no power to give away objects in its collection unless they are duplicates or unfit for retention. Museums also have little interest in the heated and politicised aspects to these debates. On a day-to-day level, museum curators in London, Athens and around the world share with each other and with the public their research, knowledge and an overwhelming love for the objects they care for.16th century Spanish sculpture hit with botched restoration attemptChristo\u0027s latest sculpture weighs 600 tons (and it floats)North Korea displays ice sculptures of ballistic missileHowever, as the recent Greek overture for negotiations shows, one day Parliament may be called upon to make a decision in the case of the sculptures, and perhaps that day will be soon. But the complex, multidimensional questions raised by the Parthenon Sculptures will need to be appreciated in all their shades and nuances. It will simply not do, as Corbyn has done, to fire from the hip and label them as “stolen” property. Neither can the consequences for universal museums be brushed aside, as if the Parthenon Sculptures go, there will inevitably be calls for a mass resettlement of holdings from across the world.“Today, most school children do not learn Greek,” says James Campbell. “Perhaps the sad reason we are even contemplating giving the contents of the British Museum to the current Greek government is that so few British people understand what the Elgin Marbles are, or care.”Any decision on the future of the Parthenon Sculptures should be a reasoned and responsible one. It is unarguable that more people have seen and fallen in love with Greek sculpture and ancient Greece in the free-to-enter British Museum than in the museum in Athens. The sculptures’ future must be assessed for the good of the world. The Elgin Marbles do not belong to the Conservative Party, and they must not be reduced to a cheap chip in the chaotic poker game of Brexit.Dr Dominic Selwood is a historian and barrister.

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1824 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain.

But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system.

The scientists tracked a star about as big as our sun as it was pulled from its normal path and into that of a supermassive black hole before being eaten up. They then saw a high-speed flare get thrust out, escaping from the rim of the black hole. Scientists have seen black holes killing and swallowing stars. And the jets have been seen before.But a new study shows the first time that they have captured the hot flare that comes out just afterwards. And the flare and then swallowed star have not been linked together before1724 Dog-sized horned dinosaur fossil found shows east-west evolutionary ide in North AmericaA British scientist has uncovered the fossil of a dog-sized horned dinosaur that roamed eastern North America up to 100 million years ago. The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1824 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific parts of the brain do show sex differences, but inidual brains rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits. Some characteristics are more common in women, while some are more common in men, and some are common in both men and women, according to the study1924 Life on Earth appeared hundreds of millions of years earlier than previously thoughtLife may have come to earth 4.1 billion years ago, hundreds of millions of years earlier than we knew. The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.2124 Earth could be at risk of meteor impactsEarth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occur2324 Researchers discover \u0027lost world\u0027 of arctic dinosaursScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”2424 A team of filmmakers in the US have made the first ever scale model of the Solar System in a Nevada desertIllustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.What they found surprised them. The different types of genetic data they obtained seemed to match very distinct groups of people within the cemetery.Those buried in their finery, surrounded by extravagant grave goods likes swords and shields for men and jewellery for women had genetic\u0026nbspancestry commonly found in modern northern and central Europeans.Meanwhile, those bodies buried without masses of grave goods had genomes that more closely resembled southern Europeans.“This appears to suggest that these particular communities contained a mix of iniduals with different genetic backgrounds, that they were aware of these differences, and that it likely influenced their social identity,” said Professor Patrick Geary of the Institute for Advanced Study, one of the paper’s senior authors.The discovery of these two different groups appears to confirm the theory that the Longobards migrated to the region from central or northern Europe – while the southern population were probably local residents.“Our current results are consistent with the idea of barbarians migrating from north of Danube and east of the Rhine, which would suggest we are observing the invasions previously described by the Romans,” said Dr Krishna Veeramah, a geneticist at Stony Brook University.“It is also likely that social organisation was based around large high-status male biological kinship groups, and these were key to establishing communities following the migration into Italy.”Their analysis found evidence of family relationships stretching back generations, with related iniduals buried together in groups.“It looks like both these cemeteries organised themselves around one or two large groups of biologically related kin, with the vast majority of these iniduals being men,” said Dr Veeramah.Having established a team that covers many disciplines, the researchers want to use their skills to investigate more ancient burial sites and learn about family and social structures from the distant past.“There are thousands of medieval cemeteries out there for us to look at. This is hopefully just the beginning of our work,” said Professor Geary.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/05/17/hawa-son1.jpg  width= 750  height= 586  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/05/17/hawa-son1.jpg","title":"emergency passport mohamed bangoura british boy uk home office entry belgium latest","story":"Created with Sketch.Government came under pressure to resolve six-year-old Mohamed’s case\u0026nbspafter The Independent revealed the family’s plight last weekClick to followThe IndependentBritish boy blocked from returning to UK after summer holidays reunited with mother after being granted emergency passportA British-born boy who was blocked from returning to the UK after a holiday has arrived home after Britain agreed to grant him an emergency passport.Six-year-old Mohamed Bangoura shared an emotional embrace with his mother on arriving at Manchester airport on Monday evening after being stranded in Brussels for more than two\u0026nbspweeks. He had been prevented from boarding his initial flight under Home Office orders on 26 August.The UK government came under pressure to resolve the issue after The Independent revealed the family’s plight last week. Following intervention by a number of politicians, immigration minister Caroline Nokes authorised the issue of emergency travel documents.On his arrival, Mohamed was greeted by his mother Hawa Keita, 29, along with his aunties and young cousins, who ran to embrace him when he walked through the arrivals gate.Speaking to The Independent after her son had arrived, Ms Keita said: “I’m just happy to see my son again and that’s the most important thing for me.“The last week has been very hard for me. We’ve been speaking on the phone every day.”Critics have branded the case “truly shocking” and said the act of blocking a UK-born child from returning home was “shameful” and “exactly one of the effects” of the government’s hostile environment policy.Immigration lawyers said the case highlighted serious problems in UK nationality law.Hawa Keita embraces her son Mohamed at Manchester airport (Helen Hoddinott)After being blocked from boarding his flight, Mohamed had to stay with family friends in Brussels. His mother was unable to travel to see him because she doesn’t currently hold a passport.Abdoul Diallo, a friend of Ms Keita with whom Mohamed had been staying with in Brussels, and who accompanied the child on the flight, told The Independent the process of trying to resolve the issue had been “frustrating” and “exhausting”.Mr Diallo, who works as a political adviser for the EU, said: “We’ve been going from the police, to the embassy, to the Belgian home office, to the Belgian authorities responsible for children.“It’s been terrible, it’s been exhausting, it’s been frustrating. I never, ever, in my whole entire life, believed I would be encountered with such a situation. But I’m very glad that today that this boy has been able to be reunited with his mum.“Some specialists were telling me that it might take more time and that Mohamed should even go to school in Belgium in the meantime.Mother of British boy refused entry to UK says she is ‘dead inside’ British boy refused entry to UK on return from holiday“Whatever has happened has to be sorted out here in the UK. It was shocking for me that the government, based on fundamental principles of human rights and values, has committed such a massive mistake. But I’m also very glad that they corrected the mistake swiftly.”Asked what the experience has been like for Mohamed, Mr Diallo said: “He’s been frustrated, especially when the kids in Brussels had to go back to school. He was alone. I was busy trying to sort things out so he had to stay with my mum who’s an elderly lady.“He was always asking questions: why am I still here? Why am I not back in Sheffield? Why can’t I see my mum?“I don’t wish any kid at all, on this planet, to go through what Mohamed has gone through.”Hawa Keita)Ms Keita, who is of Guinean origin and lives in Sheffield, said last week that the situation had made her feel “dead inside”. She denied Home Office claims that she received a letter in March stating her son’s passport had been revoked.The letter, which Ms Keita said she saw for the first time by email on 28 August, states that the child’s claim to British citizenship was no longer valid because it had “come to light” that the man she was married to at the time of his birth was not settled in Britain.But Ms Keita said that this man was her Guinea-based ex-husband whom she was in the process of orcing. She explained that she had moved to the UK and was living with another partner a British man and the father of Mohamed.UK news in picturesAlastair Cook celebrates his century in his last ever innings playing for England during the fourth day of the fifth test cricket match against India at The Oval.

But neither the Department for International Development (Dfid), which has provided the charity with £6m in funding over the past three years, nor the Charity Commission were made aware of the allegations\u0026nbspuncovered by The Independent\u0026nbspuntil two months ago.Despite the revelations, Dfid\u0026nbspsaid it would continue to fund Restless Development.The allegations come\u0026nbspin the wake of the Oxfam scandal –\u0026nbspin which the organisation covered up predatory sexual behaviour following the Haiti earthquake\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspand subsequent criticism of the charity sector’s lack of transparency.The latest accusations\u0026nbspare specific to Restless Development’s operations under the International Citizen Service (ICS) – a government-funded programme which offers overseas placements, typically three months long, for 18- to 25-year-olds. Working in countries including South Africa, Tanzania and Bangladesh, ICS volunteers help set up schools, improve access to safe water and educate locals on health and hygiene.But young British people who volunteered in South Africa in 2012 and 2016 – after raising £800 of funding themselves – claim\u0026nbspstaff and other volunteers were involved in sexual relationships. They also said\u0026nbspthey were forced to stay in unsafe living quarters, told to travel with drunk drivers, and exposed to “unprecedented” violence between feuding taxi gangs.Those who raised the alarm say management\u0026nbspdismissed their concerns and “swept them under the carpet”.In 2016, two male volunteers in Libode, South Africa, allegedly engaged in relationships with female pupils they had been teaching in an ICS-associated school.Restless Development was made aware of the incident only when its London office was alerted\u0026nbspby a British volunteer’s parent. The charity admitted the students involved were taken back to the volunteers’ host homes\u0026nbspbut claimed no sexual activity took place. It\u0026nbspsaid\u0026nbspthe pupils were over the age of consent and had not been based\u0026nbspat the ICS school.\u0026nbspThe two male volunteers were subsequently dismissed.During the same placement – which was based in three towns in south-east South Africa – it was also alleged\u0026nbspa team leader had relationships with a string of volunteers, breaching the charity’s code of conduct.A staff member was additionally accused of sexual relations with a female British volunteer, while a\u0026nbspfield officer reportedly asked volunteers for money so she\u0026nbspcould buy alcohol. When not working in the community, volunteers are alleged to have repeatedly left their host homes to get drunk – despite being warned the area was dangerousRestless Development denies the allegations of sexual misconduct.\u0026nbspWorld news in picturesAn Indian man makes his way through floodwaters from the overflowing Panchanai River in Siliguri.

Voters will have to choose from 11,000 candidates to elect 272 members of the Parliament for the next term. These elections are the second in Pakistan\u0027s history in which a government was able to complete its term to make way for another government after being ruled by military dictators for half of the 71 years of its existence since its founding in 1947A woman reacts as she tries to find her dog, following a wildfire at the village of Mati, near Athens, Greece.  At least 60 people are thought to have been killedA house is threatened by a huge blaze during a wildfire in Kineta, near Athens. More than 300 firefighters, five aircraft and two helicopters were mobilised to tackle the extremely difficult situation due to strong gusts of wind, Athens fire chief Achille Tzouvaras saidIn 2012, volunteers in South Africa were forced to stay in accommodation that had been broken into, with windows left smashed, despite reporting the incident to the charity and police. Restless Development said it subsequently strengthened its security protocols.Four years later, safety concerns were raised again – this time relating to dangerous transportation in Libode. Volunteers were expected to travel in taxis involved in violent feuds between rival drivers\u0026nbspthat saw a number of fatal shootings in the area. Volunteers said they were not told in advance about the risks. On two separate occasions, they were allegedly told to travel with a drunk taxi driver, though the charity says the issue was “resolved” at the time.Restless Development said “immediate action” was taken to address the “unprecedented” violence between taxi drivers and subsequently decided to stop bringing volunteers to the area.One British volunteer who worked in the charity’s Tanzanian office told\u0026nbspThe Independent that safety in general is a concern across the entire ICS programme – despite the mitigations put in place.Volunteers from 2016 also claim their concerns were dismissed by senior staff in South Africa, who put complaints down to a “failure to adapt” to circumstances. The volunteers said grievances were repeatedly “brushed under the carpet” and insist the London head office was alerted only to the most serious incidents.Issues with handling of complaints were not restricted to South Africa – one volunteer in Zambia “felt that volunteers were encouraged by staff to keep incidents to themselves so as to not scare the other volunteers”.Restless Development said it has phone lines set up in London and overseas specifically for volunteers to report concerns.But a former Youth Stops AIDS (YSA) employee who worked with Restless Development’s London team accused the organisation’s head office of “a lack of professionalism” and said they were not surprised by the allegations.A former UN employee echoed a similar sentiment, saying\u0026nbspthat the complaints made against Restless Development are not uncommon within international development.“Similar abuses occur in international development, some of which I, unfortunately, observed although to a much lesser degree,” he said. “The cases vary from minor abuse of authority to outright harassment.”Vicky Browning, CEO of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, admitted it was impossible to eradicate the sort of incidents seen in South Africa under Restless Development.“Sadly we cannot guarantee zero incidents,” she said. “What we can do is make sure there is zero tolerance. We will not accept or allow it, we will not hide it – and we will deal with it.”\u0026nbspAFPGetty)The ICS scheme, which has provided placements for more than 17,000 British volunteers since it began in 2012, received £145m from the government – 90 per cent of its budget – between 2011 and 2018. Separately, Dfid\u0026nbsphas provided Restless Development with £6,392,267 over the past three financial years.Having been alerted in July to the allegations uncovered by The Independent, the Charity Commission said the “safeguarding related incident in South Africa in 2016” is now “being considered as part of our wider assessment to ensure that appropriate action has been taken.”Restless Development, however, claims it found no evidence to support any allegations of sexual misconduct or breaches of safeguarding. It said a “small number of volunteers” were disciplined for alcohol consumption, while an intern field officer who asked for money for alcohol was dismissed for inappropriate behaviour. On accusations of a lack of professionalism, it said: “Professionalism is built into our work and our values, and they are core to who we are and what we do.”Restless Development said: “We have in place a rigorous process to deal with incidents and complaints when they are raised and actively encourage our volunteers to report anything they have any concern or unease about. We have worked hard to take action in response to these concerns raised by volunteers, which included detailed action plans on improvements that we had already made and which we continued to implement based on their feedback.This included recommendations to strengthen the safety and security of our ICS programme to improve training for volunteers to better prepare them for ICS and to improve the quality of our ICS programmes in certain areas.We never want volunteers to feel their concerns and views are being ignored. In fact, their feedback is an essential part of our culture and has proven crucial to improving the work we do. If any volunteers past or present have concerns or feedback we urge them to get in touch.”Department for International DevelopmentEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log in"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/01/22/john-mcdonnell.jpg","title":"url workers rights uk gig economy labour party john mcdonnell uber deliveroo","story":"Created with Sketch.Shadow chancellor promises \u0027biggest extension of inidual and collective rights our country has ever seen\u0027 - but says\u0026nbsphe is \u0027embarrassed\u0027 by his own \u0027mediocre\u0027 spending plansPolitical Correspondent, in ManchesterClick to followIndy PoliticsJohn McDonnell said Labour\u0027s plans would \u0027transform irreversibly the workplace and our working lives\u0027A Labour government would give\u0026nbsptemporary workers and those on\u0026nbspzero-hours contracts\u0026nbspthe same rights as full employees, John McDonnell has said.The shadow chancellor told the TUC\u0026nbspCongress\u0026nbsphe\u0026nbspwanted to give workers in the gig economy\u0026nbspbasic\u0026nbsprights such as sick pay and parental leave as part of a plan\u0026nbspto deliver the\u0026nbspbiggest extension of inidual and collective rights our country has ever seen.Gig workers are paid only for the work they do and miss out on\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspprotections awarded to those\u0026nbsplegally considered to be employees.Firms such as Deliveroo\u0026nbspand Uber have faced legal\u0026nbspaction from\u0026nbsptrade unions\u0026nbspover their treatment of gig workers.Mr McDonnell said Labour would change the law to\u0026nbspshift the\u0026nbspburden of proof\u0026nbspso temporary\u0026nbspworkers are automatically treated as employees\u0026nbspunless an employer can prove they should not be.\u0026nbspSpeaking at the TUC\u0026nbspCongress in Manchester, he\u0026nbspsaid: Just because you don\u0027t work regular hours doesn\u0027t mean you can afford not to work when you are sick.Just because you work several jobs doesn\u0027t mean you can afford to lose one of them without warning.And just because you value the freedom of independence or the convenience of flexibility, it doesn\u0027t mean you have to forgo basic\u0026nbsptrade union\u0026nbsprights.He said\u0026nbspsolutions for helping people in temporary jobs\u0026nbspwon\u0027t be found in the government\u0027s Taylor Review into modern working practices.Referring to a pledge\u0026nbspmade by then Labour leader John Smith in 1993, Mr McDonnell said: We will fulfil the late John Smith\u0027s promise that all workers will have equal trade union rights from day one, whether they\u0027re full time, part time, temporary or permanent.He added:\u0026nbspWhen the balance of power shifts so dramatically away from workers, as it has done today, it\u0027s time for us to tip it back in the direction of the workers.What we\u0027re about to see when\u0026nbspLabour\u0026nbspgoes into power is the biggest extension of\u0026nbspinidual and collective\u0026nbsprights our country has ever seen.His plans would\u0026nbsptransform\u0026nbspirreversibly\u0026nbspthe workplace\u0026nbspand our working lives, he added.Mr McDonnell also\u0026nbsppromised\u0026nbspLabour would\u0026nbspset up\u0026nbspa new Department\u0026nbspof\u0026nbspEmployment within its\u0026nbspfirst 100 days in government.\u0026nbspUK news in picturesAlastair Cook celebrates his century in his last ever innings playing for England during the fourth day of the fifth test cricket match against India at The Oval.

Corbyn\u0027s biggest policies explainedLabour is committed to leaving the European Union but would have different negotiating priorities to the Conservatives. It has said it would have a “strong emphasis” on staying in the single market and the customs union.The party would drop “bogus immigration targets” but move to a managed system of migration favoured by many leave voters. It has said this “may include employer sponsorship, work permits, visa regulations or a tailored mix of all these”.Labour’s manifesto commits to balance government spending with the amount raised by taxation, which can mean little more than significant tax increases. The greatest burden will fall on higher earners but they cannot meet demand on their own. No one earning under £80,000 would pay any more in national insurance or income tax.Labour has promised more money for GP services, free hospital parking for patients, staff and visitors, and to take a million people off NHS waiting lists by guaranteeing treatment within eighteen weeks.The party has pledged to abolish university tuition fees and reintroduce maintenance grants and give free school meals to all schoolchildren.Labour’s manifesto commits to building 1m new homes, and would introduce controls on rent rises for private renters.Labour would ban fracking, but, crucially, also supports new nuclear projects.Its manifesto says it is committed to the NATO target of 2 per cent spending on defence. It is also committed to the renewal of Trident, even though Jeremy Corbyn has spent a lifetime campaigning against it.Labour is committed to leaving the European Union but would have different negotiating priorities to the Conservatives.

The result is that for the first time shareholders now take a greater share of national income than workers.“The massive growth in zero hours contracts and the gig economy have produced a workplace environment of insecurity not seen since the 1930s. The decline of collective bargaining has meant that workers also now have little say over the key decisions taken by their employers over the future of their companies.Labour MPs who criticise Corbyn should quit party, McCluskey saysBacklash after Iranian state TV allowed to film Labour Party meetingArchbishop of Canterbury speaks out on Labour antisemitism rowPhilip Hammond, the chancellor, dismissed Labour’s plans.“This is Labour’s record on workers: the last Labour government left over half a million more people out of work and every Labour government leaving office with unemployment higher than when it started,” he said.“Under the Conservatives, there are over 3 million more people in work with the security of a regular pay packet, unemployment is at an all time low and the lowest paid have seen the fastest rise in pay for 20 years thanks to our introduction of the national living wage.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/11/12/ethiopia-eritrea-0.jpg","title":"ethiopia eritrea border leaders abiy ahmed isaias afwerki reconciliation peace","story":"Created with Sketch.Former bitter rivals make\u0026nbspstunning reconciliation to\u0026nbspimprove transport links between two countriesClick to followThe IndependentEritrea\u0027s president and Ethiopia\u0027s prime minister arrive for an inauguration ceremony marking the reopening of the Eritrean embassy in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in JulyCelebrating their dramatic diplomatic thaw, the leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea on Tuesday officially opened the border where a bloody war and ensuing tensions had ided them for decades.\u0026nbspEthiopia\u0027s reformist new prime minister,\u0026nbspAbiy Ahmed, and long-time Eritrean\u0026nbsppresident,\u0026nbspIsaias Afwerki, visited the Bure Front along with members of their militaries to mark the Ethiopian new year, Mr Abiy\u0027s chief of staff Fitsum Arega said in a Twitter post.\u0026nbspThe two then opened the border post for road transport connectivity and would shortly do the same at the Serha-Zalambesa crossing, Eritrean Information Minister Yemane Meskel said on Twitter.\u0026nbspPhotos posted by both officials showed Mr Abiy in camouflage and sunglasses walking alongside Mr Isaias in olive drab, while civilians lined a road with the countries\u0027 flags in hand.\u0026nbspThe former bitter rivals have made a stunning reconciliation since Mr Abiy, weeks after taking office in April, announced that Ethiopia would fully embrace a peace deal that ended a 1998-2000 border war that killed tens of thousands.At the time, he announced that the countries would celebrate the Ethiopian new year together: We want our brothers and sisters to come here and visit us as soon as possible.\u0026nbspEmbassies have reopened, telephone lines have been restored and commercial flights between the capitals have resumed as some long-separated families have held tearful reunions.

Other airports like Richmond and Norfolk, Virginia, as well as Savannah, Georgia.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLocations covered vary by airline and it is best to check with the airline\u0027s website for the special Florence waiver. Generally the dates covered include 11 to 1617 September.\u0026nbspIn North Carolina, a particularly at-risk part of the state are the barrier islands of the popular holiday destination, the Outer Banks.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspGovernor Roy Cooper ordered an evacuation of the islands, the first-of-its-kind for the area.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspGenerally, local governments are responsible for such orders, but Mr Cooper felt Florence would be so fierce he decided the state should do it so people would listen and leave.\u0026nbspWhile the storm is expected to mostly impact south of the region,\u0026nbspWashington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser has just declared a state of emergency for the district as Virginia Governor Ralph Northam and Maryland Governor Larry Hogan join suit.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMaryland and Virginia have low-lying coastal areas to the east and south, particularly prone to flooding if Florence is expected to make landfall at its current strength.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHospitals in the region have been put on high alert and the emergency authorisations allow the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) to assist financially and otherwise.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAmtrak, the rail system running up and down the eastern corridor, has cancelled all trains along the seaboard and waiving charges for those requiring a change in ticket.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspForecasters are predicting that Hurricane Florence may take a cue from 2017\u0027s Hurricane Harvey, which stalled over Texas and unloaded torrential rains on the area.\u0026nbspFlorence could linger for several days, forecasters predict, which could bring between 15 and 20 inches of rain to areas in the Carolinas and Virginia. In some isolated areas, residents could see as much as 30 inches of rain during that time.\u0026nbspThe NHC says that could produce catastrophic flash flooding.\u0026nbspHere\u0027s how Harvey played out last year: In August of that year, the storm made landfall in Texas on San Jose Island before slowing its roll to a glacial pace and essentially stopping over Houston. That brought the most significant rainfall event for a US city in recorded history, with some parts of the Houston area receiving nearly 33 inches of rain during that period of time.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOnslow County, North Carolina, has issued a mandatory evacuation order ahead of the landfall of Hurricane Florence. The order is set to go into effect on Tuesday morning.\u0026nbspThe declaration for the county — which contains Jacksonville and has a population of over 186,000 — marks the latest coastal county in the state to tell residents and tourists to get away from the coast where deadly storm surges could wreak havoc.\u0026nbspOther counties in the state with evacuation orders of varying degrees\u0026nbspinclude Carteret County, Hyde County, Pamlico County, North Topsail Beach, and Dare County.Myrtle Beach Mayor Brenda Bethune said traffic out of the South Carolina city has more than quadrupled as residents and visitors evacuate ahead of Hurricane Florence — but she wants even more people to leave the coast.\u0026nbsp“We are seeing people leaving town. We have a four- to six-time increase of traffic heading out of Myrtle Beach, but it needs to be much more than that,” she told CNN.“Even though Hurricane Florence is still almost 1,000 miles away from the coast, tides are already running over a foot above normal in parts of North Carolina as the ocean begins to swell in advance of the storm.\u0026nbspThis is even leading to some coastal flooding in extremely low-lying areas.Florence has sustained winds of over 130 mph and before it dies the storm may stall over the Carolinas, leading to “exceptionally heavy” and sustained rains, experts said.The storm’s first effects were already apparent on barrier islands as dangerous rip currents hit beaches and seawater flowed over a state highway.\u0026nbspStates of emergency have been declared in\u0026nbspNorth Carolina,\u0026nbspSouth Carolina, Virginia and Maryland.“The Storms in the Atlantic are very dangerous,”\u0026nbspDonald Trump\u0026nbsptweeted Monday. “We encourage anyone in the path of these storms to prepare themselves and to heed the warnings of State and Local officials.

I lost all my dining chairs, my living room set and a lot of my clothes, but I’m not worried about that, as long as I could find something to wear.

Governors in North and South Carolina, as well as Virginia and Maryland, have declared states of emergency — freeing up emergency funds to handle hurricane response and recovery operations.It is likely that, wherever the hurricane comes ashore, the area will be devastated — and landfall is expected to be followed by days of torrential rain and damaging winds if the storm stalls over the Carolinas and Virginia.Scientists fly into eye of Hurricane Florence as it approaches USUS East Coast faces \u0027life-threatening floods\u0027 from Hurricane FlorenceHurricane Florence filmed from space as it rampages towards USHurricane season brings Florence and Olivia barreling towards USThe particulars of this storm — which is currently projected to hit the coast as a category 4 storm but could potentially strengthen before then — could mean this storm is of historic proportions.“All of our computer models that we really like, that we say these are the accurate ones, are all lining up and saying this thing’s going to explode, this thing’s going to move West and then eventually Northwest,” Jon Cash, a meteorologist, told\u0026nbspCBN\u0026nbspNews.“The key really is this thing is going to be a huge storm when it threatens the coast and this is just something that\u0026nbspdoesn’t happen every day when you see things lining up as they are,” he continued.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/03/07/gettyimages-951829602.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/03/07/gettyimages-951829602.jpg","title":"china muslims uighur reeducation islam xi jinping communist party xinjiang","story":"Created with Sketch.Communist Party denies unfairly detaining Muslims\u0026nbspbut crackdown\u0026nbspdescribed as brainwashing by critics and witnessesClick to followThe IndependentReleased detainees say they were forced to listen to lectures, sing pro-communist hymns and write \u0027self-criticism\u0027 essaysInside China’s ‘re-education centres’ where Uighur Muslims are pressured to give up IslamOn the edge of a desert in far western China, an imposing building sits behind a fence topped with barbed wire.Large red characters on the facade urge people to learn Chinese, study law and acquire job skills. Guards make clear that visitors are not welcome.Inside, hundreds of ethnic Uighur Muslims spend their days in a high-pressure indoctrination programme, where they are forced to listen to lectures, sing hymns praising the Chinese Communist Party and write “self-criticism” essays, according to detainees who have been released.The goal is to rid them of devotion to Islam.Abdusalam Muhemet, 41, said the police detained him for reciting a verse of the Quran at a funeral. After two months in a nearby camp, he and more than 30 others were ordered to renounce their past lives. Mr Muhemet said he went along but quietly seethed.“That was not a place for getting rid of extremism,” he recalled. “That was a place that will breed vengeful feelings and erase Uighur identity.”This camp outside Hotan, an ancient oasis town in the Taklamakan Desert, is one of hundreds that China has built in the past few years. It is part of a campaign of breath-taking scale and ferocity that has swept up hundreds of thousands of Chinese Muslims for weeks or months of what critics describe as brainwashing, usually without criminal charges.Though limited to China’s western region of Xinjiang, it is the country’s most sweeping internment programme since the Mao era – and the focus of a growing chorus of international criticism.China has sought for decades to restrict the practice of Islam and maintain an iron grip in Xinjiang, a region almost as big as Alaska where more than half the population of 24 million belongs to Muslim ethnic minority groups. Most are Uighurs, whose religion, language and culture, along with a history of independence movements and resistance to Chinese rule, have long unnerved Beijing.After a succession of violent anti-government attacks reached a peak in 2014, Xi Jinping, chief of the Communist Party, sharply escalated the crackdown, orchestrating an unforgiving drive to turn ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities into loyal citizens and supporters of the party.“Xinjiang is in an active period of terrorist activities, intense struggle against separatism and painful intervention to treat this,” Mr Xi told officials, according to reports in the state news media in 2017.In addition to the mass detentions, officials have intensified the use of informers and expanded police surveillance, even installing cameras in some people’s homes.Human rights activists and experts say the campaign has traumatised Uighur society, leaving behind fractured communities and families.“Penetration of everyday life is almost really total now,” said Michael Clarke, an expert on Xinjiang at Australian National University in Canberra, Australia\u0027s capital. “You have ethnic identity, Uighur identity in particular, being singled out as this kind of pathology.”China has categorically denied reports of abuses in Xinjiang. At a meeting of a UN panel in Geneva last month, it said it does not operate re-education camps and described the facilities in question as mild corrective institutions that provide job training.“There is no arbitrary detention,” Hu Lianhe, an official with a role in Xinjiang policy, told the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. “There is no such thing as re-education centres.”World news in picturesParticipants wave flowers as they march past a balcony from where North Korea\u0027s leader Kim Jong Un was watching, during a mass rally on Kim Il Sung square in Pyongyang.

Their accounts were echoed in interviews with more than a dozen Uighurs with relatives who were in the camps or had disappeared, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid government retaliation.The Times also discovered reports online written by teams of Chinese officials who were assigned to monitor families with detained relatives and a 2017 study that said officials in some parts of Xinjiang were indiscriminately sending ethnic Uighurs to the camps to meet numerical quotas.The study, by Qiu Yuanyuan, a scholar at the Xinjiang Party School, where officials are trained, warned that the detentions could backfire and fan radicalism. “Recklessly setting quantitative goals for transformation through education has been erroneously used” in some areas, she wrote. “The targeting is imprecise, and the scope has been expanding.”The Xinjiang government issued “de-radicalisation” rules in 2017 that gave vague authorisation for the camps and many counties now run several of them, according to government documents, including requests for bids from construction companies to build them.In government documents, local officials sometimes liken inmates to patients requiring isolation and emergency intervention.“Anyone infected with an ideological ‘virus’ must be swiftly sent for the ‘residential care’ of transformation-through-education classes before illness arises, a document issued by party officials in Hotan said.The number of Uighurs, as well as Kazakhs and other Muslim minorities, who have been detained in the camps is unclear. Estimates range from several hundred thousand to perhaps one\u0026nbspmillion, with exiled Uighur groups say the number is even higher.China bans \u0027extremist\u0027 Islamic baby names in Muslim provinceThousands protest China\u0027s plans to demolish mosqueChina\u0027s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedInternational community silent as China continues religious crackdownChina \u0027forced Muslims to eat pork and drink alcohol\u0027The Chinese government says it is winning a war against Islamic extremism and separatism, which it blames for attacks that have killed hundreds in recent years. Information about such violence is censored and incomplete, but incidents appear to have fallen off sharply since 2014.Still, many who have emerged from the indoctrination program say it has hardened public attitudes against Beijing.“It was of absolutely no use,” Omurbek Eli, a Kazakh businessman, said of his time held in a camp in 2017. “The outcome will be the opposite. They will become even more resistant to Chinese influence.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/11/08/qr-code.jpg","title":"china uighur muslims xinjiang province qr codes security crackdown hrw","story":"Created with Sketch.Officials\u0026nbspcollect\u0026nbspbiometric data including DNA and voice samples,\u0026nbspformer residents sayClick to followThe IndependentA government official scans the code outside a home in Xinjiang provinceChina is installing QR codes on the homes of the\u0026nbspUighur\u0026nbspMuslim community in order to get instant access to the personal details of people living there, according to a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW).\u0026nbspThe development comes as part of a mass security crackdown on\u0026nbspminorities in Xinjiang province, the charity said,\u0026nbspwhich includes arbitrary detentions, daily restrictions on religious practice and “forced political indoctrination”.\u0026nbspOfficials reportedly scan the “smart” doorplates with mobile devices before entering homes to monitor the inhabitants.Inside China’s ‘re-education centres’ for Uighur MuslimsChina must ‘immediately’ free Muslims from alleged camps, UN saysChina’s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedSophie Richardson, China director at HRW, said: “The Chinese government is committing human rights abuses in Xinjiang on a scale unseen in the country in decades.“The campaign of repression in Xinjiang is a key test of whether the United Nations and concerned governments will sanction an increasingly powerful China to end this abuse.”Authorities claim the codes – which in some locales feature on every home – help with population control and delivery of services.\u0026nbsp“Starting from spring 2017, in every home where one enters there’s a QR code,” one former resident who left Xinjiang, in the far west of the country, told HRW.\u0026nbspFormer residents said authorities are also collecting biometric data, such as DNA and voice samples, when people apply for passports or ID cards,\u0026nbspor during police interrogations.\u0026nbsp“They did take our DNA samples\u0026nbspand iris scans when we applied for the passports,” a middle-aged woman who left Xinjiang last year said. “For those who can read, they read out from a paper but for those who cannot, they said, ‘You can sing a song or tell a story and we will record you’. You aren’t in a position to argue with them.”\u0026nbspShe added people were even forced to walk back and forth at\u0026nbsppolice stations so\u0026nbspofficials\u0026nbspcould record their gait.\u0026nbspThe United Nations human rights panel in August said\u0026nbspChina is believed to be holding up to one\u0026nbspmillion ethnic Uighurs in a secretive system of “internment camps” in Xinjiang, where they undergo political education.Beijing has denied such camps are for “political education”, insisting\u0026nbspinstead they are vocational training centres, part of government initiatives to bolster economic growth and social mobility in the region.China has said\u0026nbspXinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tensions between Uighurs who call the region home and the ethnic Han Chinese majority.Uighurs and other Muslims held in the camps are forbidden from using Islamic greetings, must learn Mandarin Chinese and sing propaganda songs, according to former camp detainees interviewed by HRW.People in Xinjiang with relatives living abroad in one of 26 “sensitive countries”, including Kazakhstan, Turkey and Indonesia, have reportedly been targeted by the authorities and are often held for several months, without any formal procedure.World news in picturesAn Indian man makes his way through floodwaters from the overflowing Panchanai River in Siliguri.

We have always maintained this is a witch hunt.Mr Kov\u0026aacutecs added: \u0026ldquoInstead of leaving, which many would probably like to see, we would rather demonstrate for the EPP that our stand, our perspective, is something that would help the EPP to remain the strongest political \u0026hellip group in the European Parliament.His government published its own 109-page \u0026ldquoinformation sheet taking issue with the report, which was approved by the European Parliament\u0026rsquos civil liberties committee.Mr Orban was elected for a fourth term in April for his anti-immigrant nationalist policies.Austria\u0026rsquos chancellor Mr Kurz has close ties to Hungary\u0027s Prime Minister, a fellow immigration hard-liner.The Austrian Chancellor has said he hopes to use those ties to build bridges between western EU member states and eastern ones that have clashed over immigration and other issues.But it appears Mr Kurz has turned on Hungary. He said: The Austrian conservative lawmakers will vote in favour because we believe that there can be no compromises on the rule of law and democracy and it is therefore important that the accusations that have been made against Hungary are cleared up.Mr Kurz appeared to suggest that other Eastern European countries should also face an Article 7 procedure.He said: It is ... not only necessary to take a closer look at Hungary but also when we look at the situation in Poland, in Hungary, in Romania, in Slovakia, where there was recently a murder of a journalist, there too it is necessary to look very closely.Austria\u0027s five conservatives are a tiny fraction of the two-thirds of votes needed in the 750-seat assembly for the so-called Article 7 procedure to pass. That would set in motion a process that could lead to sanctions such as a suspension of Hungary\u0027s voting rights.Mr Kurz\u0027s People\u0027s Party is in the same conservative bloc in the European Parliament as Mr Orban\u0027s Fidesz. Austria also holds the rotating presidency of the European Union until the end of the year.Mr Orban was due to address the European Parliament on Tuesday ahead of a vote on the Article 7 procedure later this week.His Fidesz party won a parliamentary election last April by a landslide, buoyed by migration policies including a refusal to take any resettled asylum seekers from the Middle East and North Africa after a wave of arrivals in Europe that began in 2015.Mr Orban has put pressure on courts, media and non-government groups since he came to power in 2010. Though the EU has often protested, it has largely failed to stop him in what his critics denounce as a growing authoritarian drive.

But the British won’t do that.One Brexit red line that Theresa May is adamant that she will never cross is her insistence that no British PM could sign the EU’s proposed text on the Irish border, which would see Northern Ireland become part of the customs territory of the EU.But the two sides need to sort this issue out. For the alternative is no deal, a scenario that neither side is prepared for.One Cabinet minister tells me that “no deal would be almost a state of economic war” between the UK and the EU.This is an exaggeration. But it does show the tensions it would lead to. No deal would also result in the kind of Irish border that both sides say they are keen to avoid.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, is prepared to ­produce a de-dramatised ­version of the backstop.This would concentrate on the 16 areas where the EU thinks there would need to be checks between Britain and Northern Ireland.The hope is that the dry, technical nature of this ­document will make it less controversial.But the UK will still struggle to sign up to this backstop.Why? Because it would still leave the threat of a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the country. The Government COULD accept some regulatory checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. But it COULD NOT accept Northern Ireland being part of a different customs territory to the rest of the country.Senior figures on the UK side are instead mulling an approach where the checks are split three ways between the UK, Northern Ireland and the Republic.Their thinking is that the point of the backstop is to keep the Irish border as it is today but not to create a back door into the EU for goods.If the responsibility for that was split three ways with the UK doing regulatory checks on goods going into Northern Ireland and the Republic taking care to ensure that all goods from the North exported via its ports are properly declared, then you would have a solution that was acceptable to the UK.The EU will be very wary of this idea. It doesn’t want the Irish to have to carry out any additional checks.It also wants to keep the UK in a customs union with the EU, and the Northern Ireland question helps them in their attempt to do this.But the UK should point out that if disagreement over the Irish border prevents any kind of deal, then there will have to be a hard border.The Government is hopeful of making some progress on a deal with the EU at the Salzburg summit later this month. One of those closely involved in the negotiations tells me: “Salzburg won’t be dramatic. But look for a shifting of the plates. They need to give her something to stand up and point to.”What May must avoid is being faced at the end of the negotiations with a choice between staying in a customs union or no deal.A customs union would send Britain out into the world with one hand tied behind its back while no deal would cause real problems in the short-term.BORIS Johnson has received multiple ­communications from the Tory inquiry into his newspaper column on the burka.I understand that the former Foreign Secretary received an initial letter asking him if he wished to say anything in his defence. Those with knowledge of the inquiry say that he responded to that with a vigorous defence of free speech and the need for politicians to be able to take part in these debates.Johnson’s response was met with a further ­communication from the party asking him if he wanted to say anything about his particular ­comments about people wearing the burka ­looking like letter boxes and bank robbers. My information is that Johnson has not responded to this letter. The Tory inquiry simply says that it does not ­comment on ongoing investigations.In truth, this absurd exercise should be dropped. The Tories having an inquiry into the newspaper column of a backbench MP is ridiculous. If it is still dragging on by conference, it could become yet another thing that causes trouble there.Of course, the reason so much attention is paid to Boris Johnson is his status as the members’ favourite to be the next Tory leader. Since quitting over Chequers, he has enjoyed a resurgence in popularity with the party rank and file.Oddly, though, his status as favourite might help Theresa May if a vote of confidence in her was called. As one Cabinet minister explains: “At the moment, there’s a majority against Boris having the top job. So you have to vote for Theresa as you can’t risk him being in the final two.”IN the event of no deal there would be 12 weeks of disruption at the border, ministers will be told on Thursday.Ministers will be summoned to Number 10 for a two-hour Cabinet meeting on no-deal planning.Originally, it had been expected that this meeting would take place at Chequers. But it was then pointed out that this would look like a crisis summit and the idea was shelved.It will be emphasised to ministers that no deal means no deals. In other words, don’t expect a series of workarounds to be agreed between Britain and the EU to keep things ticking over.At best, the Government is hoping for a couple of bilateral deals in areas that are of overwhelming importance to the EU. If no deal does become the most likely scenario, I am told no-deal readiness will become pretty much the sole activity of the civil service.Ministers will also get to discuss a Treasury forecast of the short-term economic impact of no deal. But, rather absurdly, these papers won’t be circulated until Tuesday.THE police and intelligence work that has enabled two Russian operatives to be identified as the lead suspects for the Salisbury attack is impressive.But we shouldn’t kid ourselves that this public exposure will put a stop to Russian mischief.The very decision to use Novichok in the attacks shows that Moscow really didn’t care if it was traced back to Russia.I AM told that the Budget this autumn will not be a dramatic affair.With better than expected tax receipts, Chancellor Philip Hammond should be able to fund an increase in NHS spending without raising the headline rates of tax.However, other tax changes – including to the Enterprise Investment Scheme – are being discussed.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Many of them need to listen to Sir Christopher Meyer, a former Remainer who is now looking forward to a brighter future free of the EU’s iron grip.It is crucial that everybody involved in these next vital months of negotiations is genuinely ambitious about what Britain can be as a truly independent country.We have the fifth-largest economy in the world and we’re a “soft-power” titan.There might be people in Brussels who think we are doomed to failure once we leave — but there shouldn’t be any ­sitting on our side of the table.If the Government prepares us properly for a clean break over the coming months, we’ve no reason to be scared for the future. It will strengthen our hand in negotiations, too.So get on with THAT, Prime Minister.THE Russian bear is roaring, and we don’t seem ready to defend ourselves.Today a respected intelligence expert suggests our border control could have been hacked by Russian spies in the run-up to the Salisbury attack.The Prime Minister has been admirably tough with the Kremlin, even if Jeremy Corbyn and other useful idiots have attempted to undermine her and our ­national security at every turn.But there is no room for complacency.

I wouldnt necessarily interpret it as helping May.However, the news was welcomed by Eurosceptics who have repeatedly called on Member States to pressurise the hard-line Commission to compromise.Henry Newman, director of the Open Europe think tank and a former advisor to Michael Gove, said: This is long overdue.The EUs only offer is a trade agreement for just Great Britain, essentially annexing Northern Ireland in a separate regulatory and customs regime. Impossible.Even if he is, Theresa May must not follow suit.The Chequers offer is already so over-generous it has triggered Cabinet resignations and Tory mutiny. If Barnier now wants to make it work for fear of a No Deal, it is a signal for us to realise the EU is on the back foot and to extract more concessions.Mrs May must not give an inch over free movement or anything else. Nor commit a penny of our divorce bill without tying it to a decent deal.It would be fatal for her. Chequers looks almost dead as it is. Even if Barnier breathes life into it, many Tories are still vowing to vote it down.Barnier has been overplaying his hand for two years.

YEEEEES!”And for what?Stacey Dooley, that’s what. Star of BBC3’s box office smash Stacey Dooley Investigates: Second Chance Sex Offenders and now Stacey Dooley investigates how many people had to Google her name on Sunday morning.She is by no means, though, the most anonymous of the new batch on the 16th series of Strictly, which was quick to remind us of its past triumphs, and equally swift to jog our memories about all the things that remain wrong with this show.Bruno Tonioli is still there, for starters. So’s Tess with those links that all seem to have passed through about ten light-entertainment BBC sub committees, where they’re vetted for any hint of spontaneity.“Swapping the radio studio for the dance studio.”“Swapping the newsroom for the ballroom.”“Ditching the cricket balls for the glitter balls.”Devotees of the show don’t care about these details, of course, and nor do floating viewers if they throw us a single high-profile comedy bone, in the Ed Balls mould, who can transform Strictly Come Dancing into the funniest show on television.Much like last year’s box-ticking frenzy, though, something has gone badly wrong with the booking process again and the class of 2018 has no maverick entertainer, just a lot of people you might vaguely recognise off the telly.Among the slightly more famous contestants there’s dance-trained Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts, Steps’ Faye Tozer, Lee Ryan out of Blue, Kate “The Silverback” Silverton, from BBC News, cricketer Graeme Swann and Susannah Constantine, who seemed to have got lost on the way to the Loose Women studio and mentioned “the menopause” before she’d even done her Mrs Overall impression in that group dance.Once through that lot, though, you’re into Stacey Dooley territory with Danny John-Jules, a Paralympian, some bloke called Charles off Casualty, who warmed the nation’s heart by referring to himself in the third person, and comedian Seann Walsh, who confirmed: “I’m not here to make anyone laugh.”A statement that should be all over Seann’s Edinburgh Fringe poster every year.The two bookings that irked me most, though, were local radio DJ Vick Hope, whose only recognisable feature is her perfume  and internet vlogger Joe Sugg, whose presence really did flag up TV’s general failure if 13million people are logging on to watch this bloke put cling film over his mate’s toilet bowl.It also told me, without much competition from The X Factor, Strictly’s got complacent and rather full of itself.The solution would seem obvious, though. Rip up the flat fee booking system, drop the salaries of the makeweights and spend the excess on a marquee booking like Richard Madeley, Prezza, Eamonn Holmes, Cherie Blair or Farage, who’d empty Britain’s streets with his jive.This is not just my opinion, obviously. Almost everyone who’s looked at this year’s Strictly line-up has concluded it’s not good enough.You can be pretty damn sure then the BBC will take the criticism on board, channel the opinions through a thousand sub-committees and conclude that, yes, unequivocally what this show needs is same sex couples.We live in nutty times.The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “JFK: Remembering Jack is a book about which man?”Emma: “Pass.”Bradley Walsh: “2017, The Queen’s Sapphire Jubilee, marked how many years on the throne?”Emma: “100.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which UK Prime Minister starred in the 2003 episode of The Simpsons?”Mikayla: “Winston Churchill.”Bradley Walsh: “In the 1930s, Caroline Mikkelsen became the first woman to set foot in what continent?”Barrie: “Australia.”A CRACKING new series of Celebrity Island with Bear Grylls was immediately transformed into Fantasy Island on Sunday night, thanks to the arrival of Roxanne Pallett, who made an early promise/threat.“If someone gets stung by a jellyfish,” she claimed, earnestly, “I would wee on them.”And if they didn’t get stung? Roxanne would probably p*** on them from a great height anyway.You feared, then, for the latest selection of male celebs, James Cracknell, Anthony Ogogo, Martin Kemp, Towie’s Pete Wicks and star of The Specialist Eric Roberts, an obvious Hollywood casualty who still boasted: “I’ve been nominated for an Academy Award and three Golden Globes, and I’ve had so much fun I can’t see straight.”Yeah, can’t see straight, can’t stay awake and can’t remember anyone’s name either, so he started calling Martin Kemp “Colin”. Eric’s fantastic entertainment, though, and unlike the others has the gifts of honesty and intuition, so he was having none of Roxanne’s Penelope Pitstop routine.First she succumbed to “trench foot”. Then she was rescued from the water after her leg became dangerously entangled with the voices in her head, and finally Roxanne had to be evacuated from the island when the camp fire ignited long-buried memories of a teenage house fire.A tale of the unexpected that earned her a fond farewell from the other islanders and a muttered aside from Eric.“That story. When’s the movie coming out?”About the same time as The Specialist II.Alan Shearer: “After two defeats, Fulham have got a win and a victory.”Matt Murray: “If England had gone on and got that second goal, they’d have gone on and got it.”Neil Warnock: “The bookies are never wrong, but they weren’t right last year.”Lee Dixon: “You can sing about England’s midfield about as long as the cow’s come home.”THERE will be no more lift-exiting or corridor- charging for Keeley Hawes after BBC1’s Bodyguard killed off her Home Secretary Julia Montague on Sunday night.A revelation that may have one or two of you screaming: “Thanks for the spoiler alert,” but tough luck. The rest of us are fed up putting everything on hold for stragglers who think the world revolves around their schedule.And anyway, codes of silence should exist only for those truly great dramas, like The Sopranos or ER, which understand you have to earn the right to kill off one of your main characters and jumping that gun smacks of arrogance.As popular as it’s been, Bodyguard clearly isn’t in this bracket.It’s far too full of plot holes and box-ticking to be anywhere near Sopranos class, in fact, and Richard Madden’s Sergeant Zoolander character doesn’t begin to look capable of carrying the show on his own.Don’t, however, rule out the possibility of a last-minute redemption.If Bodyguard really is as edgy, risk-taking, different-from-the-herd and brilliant as writer Jed Mercurio seems to think, then it’ll conclude the person responsible for the explosions, death and every other misery visited on humanity wasn’t a white, middle-class man.I’m not exactly holding my breath here, though.On Friday’s This Morning, Eamonn Holmes announces: “Next, masturbation, we’re getting stuck into that.Martin Lewis is here at 10:45, Matthew Wright’s popping in at ten past 11 . . .”And if Jamie Oliver appears, we’ve got a whole studio full of them.THIS week’s winner is Kim Woodburn and Mata, from The Emperor’s New Groove.Emailed in by James McGuire.

By contrast, the average FTSE 100 boss earns £4million a year — more than 140 times the average worker.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The first night will culminate in a “festival and funfair”-themed party where 500 guests including Naomi Campbell, George Clooney and Kate Moss will ride dodgems and play on coconut shies as Robbie Williams and Ellie Goulding perform.So far, so OTT.And good for her! If Princess Eugenie wants a Big Fat Royal Wedding, she should have one. Why not get Gypsy Wedding stitcher Thelma Madine to team up with Chanel and make a £50,000, 20st, glow-in-the-dark dress?Why doesn’t Eugenie ride to the church in a giant horse-drawn orb like Katie Price or say her vows on golden Beckham-style thrones?It is beautiful Eugenie has found love — she should celebrate however she wants. But where Eugenie’s special day crosses into outrageous is in expecting the public to pay her gigantic security bill.Eugenie’s insistence on being paraded through the streets of Windsor like Marie Antoinette means security is now going to cost us, the taxpayers, an astronomical TWO MILLION POUNDS.Officers on overtime rates will be drafted in, with dozens required to search the procession route in advance.Hard-working Brits who have struggled with eight years of austerity and been exhausted by endless police cuts will bear the brunt of that extra policing so we might catch a glimpse of Eugenie sashaying past in her open-top carriage.Is this what Eugenie meant when she said in a recent interview that she wanted to “share our world” with us?There’s nothing more tasteless than asking other people to pay for your extravagant wedding.Recently a story went viral about a bridezilla called Susan who’d demanded her friends cough up towards her £47,000 bash.Yet Eugenie’s demands make small change of that. As her guests romp on dodgems and get hammered on cocktails, we’ll be hoping we don’t get stabbed or sprayed with acid on the way to the shops because there probably won’t be many cops to help us.Extreme? Maybe not when we hear — as we did last month — that a third of bobbies on the beat have been axed in the past three years, while crime has shot up.Some fed-up villagers have even started paying for their own security firms.You hear that, Eugenie? Paying for their own security!Indeed, we might ask why Eugenie’s dad, Prince Andrew, worth some £65million, isn’t dipping into his reservoir of cash to pay the security bill?It is he who is apparently so keen for Eugenie to make a carriage-drawn arrival at church. Just as Andrew was adamant his daughters should retain Princess status in the face of Prince Charles’ worthy attempts to slim down the monarchy.Perhaps Eugenie’s groom Jack Brooksbank — the great-grandson of Sir John Spencer Coke, the son of the 2nd Earl of Leicester — might stump up some cash?Or Eugenie herself could contribute? Even if it might mean troubling her £3.6million trust funds or taking one fewer holiday this year?In an interview with Vogue Eugenie spoke with her sister Beatrice about wanting to be seen as “real”.Yet in some ways, “real” is exactly what Eugenie is. A marginal royal, she has no official royal function.She is not responsible for carrying out any royal engagements or public duties. For us, then, she does nothing.For Prince Harry, it made sense to indulge in a whistles-and-bells Royal Wedding .People like Harry, you see. Harry performs royal duties . He has served in the Forces and established the Invictus Games. An psos Mori poll this year had him and his gran — aka the Queen — as the world’s most favourite royals. For us Brits he was the favourite.But we can’t and shouldn’t roll out the platinum carpet for every minor royal who ties the knot. To do so makes a mockery of the royals’ claims they want to modernise.It reinforces the dated and offensive notion that the aristocracy are born to deserve better than us.In that Vogue interview Eugenie spoke about how she wanted her wedding to be plastic-free. How very woke.I just wish this supposedly modern royal was as conscious of social inequality as she is of the environmentOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nor commit a penny of our divorce bill without tying it to a decent deal.It would be fatal for her. Chequers looks almost dead as it is. Even if Barnier breathes life into it, many Tories are still vowing to vote it down.IT’S easy to dismiss Boris Johnson’s call for tax cuts as a ruse to distract from his personal difficulties. But he is right.The PM and her wet-blanket Chancellor have swallowed the group think about imposing new taxes to fund the NHS.Not only is it wrong, it plays into ­Corbyn’s hands. What’s the difference, voters will wonder, between Labour and the Tories if both will raise my tax?The overall burden is at a 30-year high. We should cut income tax, capital gains tax and stamp duty. It is a sure way to boost growth. Bizarrely, it can sometimes increase the sums raised.Donald Trump’s cuts to tax and regulation put rocket-boosters under US growth. We should do the same — and put more money in pockets . . .Not drain more life out of the economy.PARLIAMENT’S seats must be reformed to make elections fairer. The logic is ­unassailable. MPs must not reject it out of self-interest.It’s not a plot by the independent Boundary Commission against Brexiters. Nor is it against Labour, who ­routinely end up with more MPs than they deserve because they need fewer votes to win safe seats than the Tories.Each vote must carry the same weight.So boundaries must change and constituencies must be evened up, regardless of the upheaval — or the senior politicians inconvenienced. It would have been done years ago had the Lib Dems not ratted on a deal in Coalition.Reducing the number of MPs makes sense too, not least to save taxpayers money.

Boss Amyas Morse said: “There are signs that forces are already experiencing financial strain and struggling to deliver effective services.If the Home Office does not understand what is going on it will not be able to direct resources to where they are needed, with the risk that the situation could get worse.Despite the police’s £12.3bn overall budget, the watchdog revealed overall funding to forces - made up of central government grants and council tax - has fallen by 19 per cent since 2010-11.Forces have maintained the squeeze with job cuts - with the number of PCSOs, police staff and officers down 40 per cent, 21 per cent and 15 per cent respectively since 2010.Home Secretary Savid Javid has vowed to prioritise police funding in the next spending review.Labour’s Shadow Policing and Crime Minister Louise Haigh said it was clear cops don’t have the resources they need to carry out their jobs properly.She blasted: “Ministers haven’t got a clue whether or not forces are financially sustainable.”A Home Office spokesman said: Our decision to empower locally-accountable Police and Crime Commissioners to make decisions using their local expertise does not mean that we do not understand the demands on police forces.In addition, the report does not recognise the strengths of PCCs and Chief Constables leading on day-to-day policing matters, including on financial sustainability.We remain committed to working closely with police and delivered a £460 million increase in overall police funding in 2018/19, including increased funding for local policing through Council Tax. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I couldn’t say goodbye to anyone.“They had me in a taxi and were following me, then I was dropped off in the town where the bus station is.”Harriet is now staying with her dad in Oxford while she recovers from her ordeal and says she still hasnt been contacted by Italian police.She said: “They’ve reimbursed me for my flights and the rest of my wage as if I’d finished my contract.“But I want them to recognise what went wrong and then tell me how they’re going to improve it if it happens again. Something needs to change – it’s not acceptable.“To be in a foreign country and have no support whatsoever is scary.“I’m resilient, but for someone who is already terrified of what happened, their lack of reaction would just shut them up. That can’t be allowed to happen.”Thomas Cook confirmed the alleged offender had been suspended.A spokesman told The Sun Online: “The safety and wellbeing of our customers and staff is our first priority and we have been supporting Harriet since this incident was reported, and arranged counselling for her since she returned home.”Polizia di Stato, the Italian state police, have been contacted for comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000421103091.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"how many people are unemployed in the uk and what is the unemployment rate in uk cities","story":"According to the Office for National Statistics, the number of people without a job is at its lowest level for over 40 years.There are currently 1.36 million unemployed people in the UK.The figure has fallen of 55,000 since July and 95,000 since the same time last year.There were 32.40 million people in work, little changed compared with February to April 2018 but 261,000 more than for a year earlier.The employment rate - the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 years who were in work - was 75.5 per cent.That was slightly lower than for February to April 2018 - 75.6 per cent - but higher than for a year earlier - 75.3 per cent.The ONS said job vacancies rose by 14,000 in the period to 833,000 - a record high.But the unemployment figure could be set to rise as the number of people claiming benefits for being unemployed rose in August.The claimant count, which includes people on Jobseekers Allowance and the unemployment element of Universal Credit, rose by 8,700 to 918,800, around 118,500 more than a year earlier.The unemployment rate - the number of unemployed people as a proportion of all employed and unemployed people - was 4.0 per cent.Last time the figure was that low was between December 1974 and February 1975.The number of people classed as economically inactive rose 108,000 to 8.76 million in the last three months, giving a rate of 21.2 per cent of the workforce.They include including students, those on long-term sick leave, taken early retirement, or who have given up looking for work.The number of self-employed workers decreased by 46,000 to 4.8 million.The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Esther McVey, said: Since 2010 we have delivered significant growth in jobs, and in the last six months weve seen real terms wage growth.We havent had a lower unemployment rate for over forty years and Im especially proud that youth unemployment is at a record low, falling by over 45 per cent since 2010 - opening up career opportunities for our next generation.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That really would pile pressure on Mr Corbyn in Liverpool.The tone during the debate of Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite and the major union leader closest to Mr Corbyn, was much more nuanced.Yes, really.

In February last year, Unilever received an unwanted 143bn takeover approach from Kraft, the US consumer goods giant still notorious on these shores for its \u0026#16311bn takeover of Cadbury just under a decade ago.,targeting:\" data-targeting-strnativekey=\"\" data-targeting-platform=\"\" data-tag=\"\" data-component-name=\"sdc-site-mpu\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" id=\"mpu-inline-mobile\" data-tolerance=\"2\"Kraft\u0027s interest was easily repelled, but the move gave Unilever\u0027s board the shock of its life, immediately sparking big changes in the way the company is run.Becoming a purely Dutch company will protect Unilever from future bids like Kraft\u0027s because Dutch firms enjoy greater protection from takeovers than British ones. That, UK investors suspect, is the real reason for this reorganisation.Unilever has also argued that there is greater turnover of shares in Unilever NV than there is in Unilever plc - making the Dutch class of share the obvious one in the reorganisation.That overlooks the fact that the London stock market is substantially bigger than its counterpart in Amsterdam and that the greater number of shares in Unilever NV actually change hands in London.What makes this decision really interesting is that Relx, the Anglo-Dutch business information company, has just carried out a similar simplification of its shares.The only difference is that Relx, formed in 1992 from the merger of British publisher Reed International and Dutch firm Elsevier, has opted for Relx plc shares to be the sole class of share going forward. Meanwhile, Royal Dutch Shell, the other big Anglo-Dutch corporate giant, has its company headquarters in the Netherlands, but the primary listing for its shares is in London.This issue has attracted far more attention in the Netherlands than it has in the UK - because the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, has eased the way for Unilever by proposing to abolish the country\u0027s 15% withholding tax on company dividends.Ironically, this merely brings the Netherlands into line with the UK\u0027s taxation regime, but is widely regarded as having helped influence Unilever\u0027s decision.However, it has also kicked up a political stink in the Netherlands, with many people unhappy at what they see as a generous tax cut to big business. It is possible Mr Rutte may yet fail to get the legislation through the Dutch parliament."},{"url":null,"title":"never miss update things you","story":"NewsNever miss an update on the things you care about - sign up for newsletters from the MirrorGet updates straight to your inbox - whether you like Politics, football, showbiz gossip, travel or want to know the latest breaking newsShare\u0026nbspByNicola OakleyHead of Audience16:17, 22 AUG 2018Updated14:44, 7 SEP 2018NewsOn the go?

The boss of Jaguar Land Rover said he had no idea whether his plants would be able to operate after Britain leaves the EU on March 29 next year.

Brexit is due to happen on the 29th March next year.  Currently I do not even know if any of our manufacturing facilities in the UK will be able to function on the 30th, Speth said.  The boss of JLR, which built nearly a third of Britain\u0027s cars last year, was speaking ahead of a speech by the Prime Minister.  Mr Speth also said long-standing issues around low productivity in Britain could be compounded by a Brexit agreement which made the country less competitive. It is thousands of pounds cheaper to produce vehicles for instance in eastern Europe than in Solihull and what decisions will I be forced to make if Brexit means not merely that costs go up but that we cannot physically build cars on time and on budget in the UK? he said. He added: “What decisions will we be forced to make, if Brexit means not merely that costs go up, but that we cannot physically build cars on time and on budget in the UK?”  He warned: “Six months from Brexit and uncertainty means that many companies are being forced to make decisions about their businesses that will not be reversed, whatever the outcome, just to survive.” "},{"url":null,"title":"john mcdonnell insists labour now","story":"NewsJohn McDonnell insists Labour is now in \u0027exactly the right position\u0027 on anti-SemitismThe Shadow Chancellor claimed the party had come through its \"soul searching\" - as he urged members not to make it easier to deselect MPsShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor15:21, 11 SEP 2018Updated15:27, 11 SEP 2018NewsJohn McDonnell has traditionally been Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s closest ally \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLabour has come through a heart-rending anti-Semitism row but is now in exactly the right position, John McDonnell claimed today. The Shadow Chancellor - traditionally Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s closest ally - insisted there was a lot of soul searching before the party U-turned and agreed a full internationally-recognised definition and examples of anti-Semitism earlier this month. In a wide-ranging briefing to journalists, Mr McDonnell also said it was completely unacceptable for Iran\u0027s Press TV, banned from UK screens, to film a deselection vote against the pro-Israel MP Joan Ryan. The Shadow Chancellor refused to deny whether he personally intervened to try and stop the vote, saying: I don\u0027t want to go into private conversations that I\u0027ve had, to be honest. And he warned Labour members off forcing through the mandatory reselection of MPs at this month\u0027s party conference - saying he valued the current system.  Mr McDonnell said: These last couple of months have been frustrating and on the antisemitism issue it\u0027s been heartrending as well. A lot of soul searching has to take place, we\u0027ve come out of that now, I think we\u0027re in exactly the right position. He said MPs would naturally be held to account by their members over genuine differences of policy and that is incredibly helpful. But he added: It doesn\u0027t have to spill over into any form of unacceptable behaviour. On Press TV filming the Joan Ryan meeting, Mr McDonnell said: That was unacceptable. We said that very clearly.  You cannot film a meeting without people\u0027s permission - at those sort of meetings, people want to have the confidence of having an open and honest discussion, so it was completely unacceptable. The MP accepted there may be changes to Labour\u0027s selection rules. Currently sitting Labour MPs face a trigger ballot where each local branch, union branch and affiliated society branch in a constituency gets a single block vote on whether to keep them before a general election. Only if they lose this block vote do they face a full-scale selection vote, pitted against rival candidates. It\u0027s suggested Labour could effectively skip straight to this step before each election - giving MPs no upper hand if they\u0027re already in Parliament.

It’s heartbreaking. “From low pay to sky-high childcare costs, this government isn’t on the side of working families.”  The average age for women to become mums is now 28.8. Ms O’Grady said: “The idea that it is all about young career women putting off having children until their 30s is nonsense. The work we’ve been doing on this is with young blue collar workers. “It came across really strongly that they can’t even think about having a family. They want children but just cannot afford it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tory chancellor told apologise telling","story":"NewsTory Chancellor told to apologise for telling 86-year-old MP Dennis Skinner to get a hearing testPhilip Hammond dished out the insult to 86-year-old Dennis Skinner - the firebrand \"Beast of Bolsover\" who\u0027s well-known for issuing cutting remarks himselfShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByRichard WheelerDan BloomOnline Political Editor15:41, 11 SEP 2018Newsthis.style.display=\u0027none\u0027\"/Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror/news/politics/video/tory-chancellor-tells-86-year-13226984,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-M3TH25P,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Tory Chancellor faced a call to apologise today after telling Westminster\u0027s oldest MP to have a hearing test.

He ignored Labour\u0027s call to apologise, even after the Commons Speaker said the remark probably wasn\u0027t the best chosen. It came after Mr Skinner complained about why Tory-led Derbyshire County Council was proposing changes to library services if the government had money to burn.

Adris Ali, 22, caused \u0026pound8m-worth of damage to stock and the premises when he used a cigarette light to spark the blaze on November 4, 2017. Stafford Crown Court heard he was angry after being refused time off by his team leader to sort out his love life. More than 1,200 staff were evacuated after the flames tore through the 700,000 sq ft warehouse in Rugeley, Stafforshire.  CCTV and rota records identified Ali as the prime suspect and showed him working in the aisle where the blaze started. Ali, from Walsall, West Mids, admitted arson with intent and was jailed for four years today. Darron Whitehead, prosecuting read witness statements to the court which described the large flames quickly growing and spreading between aisles and flames stretching from floor to ceiling. Staff attempted to put out the fire but within five minutes the decision was made the evacuate the warehouse. Robert Cowley, defending, told the court that Ali\u0027s actions were out of character and said he admitted guilt early in the investigation.  Mr Cowley added: It was a huge loss sustained but the defendant did not intend this level of loss. Judge Michael Chambers said the Amazon ‘picker’ had “put lives at genuine risk” by starting the fire last November. He said: You put a lot of people at risk and caused a lot of damage. A fire such as this puts lives at genuine risk. Detective Constable Andrew Shorthouse, of Staffordshire Police said it was lucky that Ali\u0027s actions didn\u0027t have more grave consequences. He said: This was a serious fire which has destroyed millions of pounds of stock, but we are glad that no one was harmed that day. Ali can now reflect on his actions in prison. We welcome this sentence which reflects the seriousness of Ali\u0027s actions.

Michael Severs was armed with a shovel when he entered the house in Hull, but claimed he could not recall getting there.  It comes less than a decade after he threatened to rape and kill members of a man\u0027s family after breaking into a house in 2009, Hull Live reports.  Fearing for his family, the homeowner grabbed a Samurai sword that Severs had brought into the home and used it to slice off part of Severs\u0027 ear. He was later charged with causing grevious bodily harm but walked free after a jury found he was acting in self-defence.  Despite suffering serious injuries, the incident was not enough to deter Severs from crime and he has once again ended up on the wrong side of the law after burgling a flat. In the 2009 case Severs, along with Michael Smith, had gone to the man’s home in Brough armed with weapons and demanded he hand over \u0026pound5. When the man refused, they threatened him with a knuckle duster, spade and Samurai sword, threatened to rape his partner, burn his house down and kill his family. However, when Severs dropped the sword, the homeowner picked it up and sliced off his ear. He was later acquitted by a jury of causing grievous bodily harm on the grounds of self-defence after a year-long battle.

People have always loved the cheeky prince, and having a glamorous, strong and successful woman by his side has boosted his popularity even more. But having a popular partner isn\u0027t always good news for the royals, and it can mean the public become far more interested in them than the prince - which is exactly what happened to Prince Charles and Diana. It seems Meghan has come up with a clever trick to stop this happening, and seems to be using some of her drama school techniques to make sure she doesn\u0027t steal the limelight from Harry.  The former actress is often seen placing her hand in the small of Harry\u0027s back, and gently nudging him forward.  Body language expert Judi James told Cosmopolitan : It\u0027s quite a theatrical-based technique.  She\u0027s well aware that Harry is the star and popular among royal fans so, as a former actress, she\u0027s very cleverly trying not to up-stage him. By pushing him forward ever so slightly, she boosts the prince\u0027s ego and profile, making him feel more of an alpha male in the situation.   This week Meghan and Harry have delighted fans by announcing more details of their autumn tour to Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand.  The couple will spend 16 days travelling around the countries on their first overseas tour, which is very similar to the trip Prince Charles and Diana made shortly after their wedding.

Fazana Ayoub shimmied up to the man on the dancefloor of a city centre club, prompting one of his friends to step in and deflect her attention.  Seconds later the trainee beautician\u0027s glass shattered against Emma Kelly\u0027s raised hand, sending shards flying into her face, reports the Liverpool Echo.  Liverpool Crown Court today heard Ayoub had been out with friends in February, drinking cocktails in the city centre before heading to nightclub Maya.  Victim Ms Kelly and her partner were in the same club after visiting the theatre with friends on their first night out together since they had become a mum and dad. Summing up what happened next, the sentencing judge, Recorder David Potter, said that, as the victim\u0027s partner stood with his back to Ayoub, the mum-of-two shimmied up to him and put an arm around him in an apparent attempt to get him to dance. This led to one of his friends moving between the pair in an effort to deflect Ayoub\u0027s attention.  Moments later, CCTV inside the club captured Ayoub standing over Ms Kelly, who had been seated nearby throughout the incident.  The pair were thought to be speaking to each other before Ms Kelly stood up. Judge Potter said Ayoub was seen to move or stumble back before she launched the glass you were holding in your hand towards the other woman. The glass shattered on impact with Ms Kelly\u0027s hand, which she raised to protect herself, sending shards flying. The victim needed four stitches to a cut to her forehead and suffered a broken finger.  Ayoub had claimed she feared she was about to be attacked when she threw the glass - but the judge said he had seen no evidence to back up that claim. Kenneth Grant, prosecuting, said that while the injury had not been severe, it had left Ms Kelly suffering a lack of confidence, feeling reluctant to go out into Liverpool city centre and feeling the need to cover the scar she had received with make up every time she left her home. The court was told Ayoub had 13 convictions for 27 offences, including robbery, battery and assault. Tom Watson, defending, said his client was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident, wished to apologise and added: I do submit the court can be satisfied there is genuine remorse here. He said she had suffered a traumatic childhood and was gaining qualifications, with her main concern being her children. Ayoub, who is training towards a career in the beauty industry, was cleared of wounding with intent at a trial over the incident, but admitted unlawful wounding. Highlighting Ayoub\u0027s regular breaches of previous court orders and her substantial history of alcohol fuelled violence, Judge Potter said he felt he had no choice but to jail her. Ayoub, of Toxteth, was jailed for 12 months, a sentence reduced by 104 days for the time she has spent on curfew.

Keith Langham was left with blood pouring from a head wound after helping wife Karen, 61, with the interview for her Personal Independence Payments. She was told that people like her ‘needed to learn to help themselves’ amid ugly scenes at her first appointment. It was carried out on behalf of Independent Assessment Services, formally known as ATOS, in Carlisle, Cumbria. At the second interview, Keith, who is 5ft 5in tall and 10-and-a-half stone, had to be taken to hospital after he was grabbed by powerfully-built six footer Chris Bryan, then aged 30.  He pushed him into a door then held Keith in a headlock so that he struggled to breath. The incident was recorded on Keith’s phone before police were called to the centre in Newcastle Business Park. Grandfather-of-two Keith had seven stitches in a head wound. He and his wife then faced the ordeal of giving evidence against Bryan, a ‘Boxercise’ personal trainer who was found guilty of assault by beating in May this year. Semi-retired Keith, a services manager said: “He was a very large guy, I would say he was about 6ft 4in tall and 16st, heavily built, shaven headed. He said he was security and we had to leave the building. But he was not wearing any ID. “I asked who he worked for and he told me he did not have to tell me and we had to leave. We were heading towards the reception when one of the nurses said ‘get them out through the fire doors’.”  He added: “I felt his breath on the back of my neck, he put one hand between my shoulder blades, the other in the small of my back and launched into me, pushing me into the door frame. “He then had me in a choke hold and you could hear me on audio saying ‘I am calm can you let me go’. It was unnecessary, cowardly, and disproportionate.”  Karen, who suffered a series of strokes in 2002 and walks with a stick, “went into meltdown”. “I was screaming at him to let him go,” she said. “He had him in a chokehold for about two minutes.” The couple, of Haltwhistle, Northumberland, now realise the second appointment had been ‘flagged’ by the assessors due to problems with their staff at the first interview, and the security guard was brought in as a result.  “The whole process is insensitive to put it mildly, these checks are incredibly cruel.” added Karen. “But this was disgraceful.” Northumbria Police were called to the incident on Aug 18, 2017. Keith was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle, where he received seven stitches in the head wound. Bryan, of Birtley, Co Durham, was found guilty of assault at North Tyneside Magistrates court after a trial. He was given a 12-month community order, with 150 hours of unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay \u0026pound620 in court costs, a \u0026pound85 victim surcharge, and \u0026pound150 compensation to Keith. He has appealed against conviction, and that is due to be heard before Newcastle crown court on Sept 28. He declined to comment. “My concern is the crown court case,” he said.

Parents Elizabeth Wilkins and Erick Vanselow have gone on trial accused of cruelty after their son suffered critical injuries in an \u0027incident at home\u0027, the jury was told. One nurse told the trial the calmness of the mother was not normal. She said the mum told her that she could watch as medical staff drilled into the bone of the boy - because she was used to watching Holby and 24 Hours in A\u0026ampE.

But the Crown Prosecution Service, opening the case, said that neither the head injuries, nor the rib fractures could have been caused accidentally. Jo Martin, QC, said that the baby was assaulted by either mum, dad or both parents on several occasions two years ago at the former couple\u0027s home in Plymouth, Devon. Vanselow, now 30, was then studying for a masters in International Relations at the University of Plymouth. Wilkins, 23, was also about to start the final year of a law degree at the university. They have both been named after a judge lifted a court order.  The court has heard the boy was taken to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, 17 days before his admission, with bloodshot eyes. An expert has already told the court those injuries were mostly likely caused by the chest being crushed. Sister Sophie Brock, nurse in charge of the section of the A\u0026ampE department which admitted the boy, said Wilkins was very calm when the ambulance arrived at about 4.30pm. She added that staff struggled to find a vein to insert an intravenous drip into the child and so had to drill into the bone marrow. Mrs Brock described the procedure as distressing to watch. She added that it was not fair for a parent to stay and so Wilkins was asked to step outside. Mrs Brock said: Her reply was that she watched Holby and 24 Hours in A\u0026ampE, which was a little bit of a strange thing to say. Piers Norsworthy, for Wilkins, asked the witness: When you are presented with a very sick baby, one imagines the worst thing you could see is a panicky, distracting mother? Mrs Brock replied: It does not help but it is normal and we are able to deal with that. Derriford consultant paediatrician Thynn Aung said that she spoke to the parents together to get a history of what had happened that day. She said that Vanselow told her he had dropped the baby so the infant had hit the left side of his head against a plastic kitchen counter during a feed at 4am that morning. An ambulance paramedic had earlier told the court that the father had said he dropped the boy about a foot.

George Smallwood\u0027s Bee Eco Shed won the top spot in the annual competition. The handmade structure is a self-watering and self-sufficient home for vegetables, herbs and insects. Mr Smallwood, from Sheffield, said winning the 2018 title and a \u0026pound1,000 cash prize was a welcome surprise.  We hope our shed will inspire others around the UK to create spaces for wildlife in their gardens, he added. We\u0027re so proud that our shed has become a habitat for nature in a small urban garden, showing you can always do your bit for making a home for nature. There were eight categories, including eco-friendly creations, budget outbuildings and historic-like structures.  Among the innovative buildings were a Legoland-inspired haven, a black cab converted into an outdoor bedroom, and a structure made out of glass bottles. Competition founder Andrew Wilcox said: The competition was extremely tough this year, from a musical shed on the water, to a taxi, to an authentic Irish pub. George\u0027s shed stood due to its impressive, handmade structure but also because of its unique story and special purpose.

Kaylee Hollister says the 26 year age gap between her and lover Matthew Taylor is no obstacle, saying they have insane chemistry. But not everyone is convinced about the relationship, with some labelling the older man a \u0027paedophile\u0027. Kaylee, a jewellery designer and bar tender, says she was \u0027instantly attracted\u0027 to Matthew and that they have \u0027insane chemistry.\u0027 Her boyfriend, meanwhile, who is an IT administrator and artisan, says he was attracted by \u0027her confidence and poise and also her honesty. She is so genuine and kind.\u0027  Kaylee and Matthew initially met on Facebook via a \u0027friend suggestion\u0027 and chatted as friends for several months. At first Matthew just saw her as an online pal. He said: She was young and involved and had a kid with someone, so I had no aspirations for her at that time. I found her attractive - what man wouldn\u0027t? - but I never had any ideas that we\u0027d be anything more than casual acquaintances with shared interests. However, fate intervened when the pair attended the same local gig.  Matthew said: I remember being there and standing next to a couple of friends watching one of the bands play when this feeling came over me, telling me to look to my right. There she was! I actually felt her walk into the room! I walked over to her, said \u0027hi!\u0027 and we started talking. I was fascinated with her. Her bright smile, her dark hair, her light demeanor.  We talked about our mutual interests and seemed to enjoy each other\u0027s company very much. We spent about the next hour hanging out and talking to each other and other mutual friends. He added: She left me with a sort of glow that I carried with me for the rest of the night. Kaylee was equally smitten, saying: It was in our very first meeting that we both knew we would be in each other\u0027s lives. After the gig Kaylee messaged Matthew and the two soon became inseparable, with Kaylee drawn to his perceptiveness, intelligence and the fact that he is unconditionally himself.  She said: There will always be a part of me that feels there was some type of divine intervention that allowed us to come to be. But not everyone has been as thrilled about their relationship as the couple themselves, with some people calling the 50-year-old a paedophile and others accusing Kaylee of having daddy issues. Matthew said: I\u0027m actually thankful for these comments because these were people who I believed were my friends and now it\u0027s become clear that they aren\u0027t. So I, in turn, was able to cut them off.  Although he rarely responds to such accusations, calling them \u0027invalid and irrelevant\u0027, when he does he says he reminds people that \u0027she is an adult in her 20s with a child, just like a few of them were at one time, and how they would probably have considered themselves adults as well.\u0027 Kaylee says the negative comments don\u0027t bother her much. She explained: I\u0027ve had younger guys say things to me in some sad attempt at making themselves look better, or women telling me that \u0027I must have had daddy issues\u0027 in order to be this way.  But what I take from it is that happy couples are a pretty rare thing because people are so shallow and that some people will try to pull the good energy out of those that radiate. Although the couples\u0027 families are now close, Kaylee\u0027s mother initially struggled to accept the fact her daughter was dating a 50-year-old, not least because the two are close in age. Kaylee said: I also feel she wanted to make sure I was safe and secure with this person. Matthew added: Her dad was fine with it. He was just happy that she was being taken care of by a responsible man. Her mom wasn\u0027t very good about it at first but she and I are cool now that she\u0027s had some more exposure to me.

Environmental groups from around the world have voiced their outrage at the proposal, and called for further protection to be given to the animals. Activists claim that in spite of the ban - which has been in place for more than three decades - endangered whales are still being slaughtered in their thousands.  The controversial move comes after widespread condemnation of continued killings by whalers from Japan, Norway and Iceland.  Last month devastating pictures showed a whale foetus being dragged away to the trash after its mother was butchered in Iceland.  Activists have branded whaling - which sees the animals harpooned at least once before they die - as unnecessarily cruel. Officials from the International Whaling Commission in Brazil will this week decide whether the ban - which has been in place since 1986 - should be lifted. Japanese delegates claim many types of whale are not endangered and can be harvested sustainably. Since the ban was brought in, the Environmental Investigation Agency  claims more than 38,500 whales have been killed by whalers from Iceland, Norway and Japan. Japan claims it hunts for dolphins in order to carry out scientific research, which is legal under the 1986 ban.  Hunted whales are impaled with a grenade-tipped harpoon and towed to the shore with a rope so they can be butchered. Critics have branded the slaughter barbaric and called for sanctions against countries which allow whaling to take place. Charity ORCA, which works to protect whales and dolphins, blasted the whalers. Head of science and conservation, Lucy Babey, said: Subjecting them to this indescribable pain and suffering can only be defined as sickening inhumanity it is quite simply heartbreaking. A statement from the EIA said: Despite the global ban, Japan, Norway and Iceland continue commercial whaling.

I think it might be good for both of us.”While Kamara has remained in Scotland this week for treatment, Kallman is off on international duty, though not with the full squad.But while, after winning his first full cap earlier this year, he appears to be dropping a level as he joins the U/21 squad for two vital Euro qualifiers, he’s happy.The 20-year-old is very much of the opinion that his near-certain involvement against Denmark and Poland will be a case of taking one step back to make two forward.The Dens loan signing from Turku doesn’t hide from the fact he would love to have competed at the higher level.For him, though, time on the park is what matters most and that’s why he’s more than happy to be representing his country in the younger age group.“Of course you always want to go forward and I heard back in Finland they were looking to put new players into the team and the manager said I was one of the options,” he said.“However, then again you have to think about that. Now I am in the U/21s and we have two qualifier games.“I’ve played with them all the time and am going to play as the first striker for them. You have to know which are the best moments to go to the first team because, if I go to the U/21s, I’ll get playing time and we have two games to try to qualify with them.“For that reason I think it might be better to be with the U/21s to get playing time. If I got called up to the first team, yes, I would be there but how much playing time will I get, I don’t know.“It’s easier to say afterwards because you don’t know how much time you will get but with the U/21s I know I am guaranteed playing time.”And the benefit to Dundee of his trip back to the continent should be the competitive nature of the action he sees.Not only are the opposition he’ll face of a decent standard, there’s plenty of stake in the fixtures.If the young Finns can win both, they would still be in with a chance of qualifying for the Euro finals, though the history of the group so far does suggest they will have their work cut out.When they faced the Danes at home last year they were on the wrong end of a 5-0 drubbing, so to beat them in the away tie will be a big ask.Kallman, though, is up for the challenge and is determined to do all his can to at least extend Finnish interest in qualification.“These will be a tough two games. They are the deciders for us because teams are four and five points ahead of us in the table with Poland first and Denmark second.“We have to at least not lose these game to still have a chance to proceed.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b9637ddc723d.jpg ","title":"chrissie hynde backed after calling for monstrosity block next to dundee va to be torn down","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPretenders singer Chrisse Hynde has been backed after calling for a controversial office block next to V\u0026ampA Dundee to be \u0026#8216torn down\u0026#8217.The star said the under-construction site \u0026#8220distracted\u0026#8221 her from her performance at Slessor Gardens on Sunday.Hynde told BBC Scotland: \u0026#8220In the daylight I noticed this quite beautiful building in the background, which I didn\u0026#8217t realise is the V\u0026ampA building, and this horrible carcass going up in front of it.\u0026#8220It was actually distracting me from what I was trying to do.\u0026#8220I was walking down Union Street there and I saw the V\u0026ampA again, a really beautiful vista of it and this monstrosity that\u0026#8217s totally obliterating the view of that beautiful building.\u0026#8220I would have it torn down.

We missed two penalties and we were always in the game until the last two goals went in later in the second half.“So, I think the score was harsh on us in the end but you still don’t want to lose five goals in any game and you want to defend better.”Looking forward, he suspects Alloa will not be much changed from the side that drew with United in the Championship last weekend“I think they don’t have a massive squad so it could be similar to the league game against us on Saturday. They are a good, fit and organised outfit. It will be a hard game.”As was the case in the first-round victory over St Johnstone Colts last month, the United ranks at Tannadice on Saturday are likely to be bolstered by several first-team men.And young midfielder Archie Thomas is back in contention for a starting place.He was injured in the first minute of the first-round victory but returned for half an hour of Monday’s game.United have set the entry price for Saturday’s game at £10.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b618c05b50b5-923x564.jpg ","title":"csaba laszlos new boys are showing some promise at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt remains early days so far as judging new-look Dundee United goes but there is no question Csaba Laszlo’s team are getting to know each other.After a sticky start to the season, there have been definite signs over the last three, unbeaten, Championship outings that the team is coming together.And the Tele takes a look and how the new men have contributed, so far.Matej RakovanAfter joining up on the same day as fellow-goalie Benjamin Siegrist, one of the big questions going into the campaign was which of the pair would get the nod. It was the Slovakian and, so far, he’s justified the faith shown in him with a string of impressive performances. He did make an error for the goal lost against Partick, but by then the game had been comfortably won.Frederic FransThe Belgian was added to the squad to provide steel in central defence and the fact he had experience of the Scottish game from a spell with Partick made him a sensible addition. So far he’s lived up to expectations and looked a strong and calming influence.Paul WatsonProbably the most low key signing, at first it seemed doubtful if the man who was a squad player at Falkirk would feature too often. Given his chance at Queen of the South last month, the powerful centre-half grabbed the opportunity and impressed in each of his three league games to date, scoring three goals in the process. With the arrival of Rachid Bouhenna, he still faces a challenge to keep his place.Christoph RabitschThe Austrian has had a robust start to his United career and a couple of rash tackles when he was already on a booking have seen him subbed to prevent the team being reduced to 10 men. The 22-year-old was publicly slapped down by Csaba for that. He appears to have taken it on board and there’s no question his ability to get in about opponents is an asset.Adam BartonCaptured from Partick Thistle just before the Betfred Cup games kicked off, the tall Englishman has added to United’s new-found aerial strength. Most of his appearances so far have been in midfield, so he’ll face a challenge once skipper Fraser Fyvie returns from injury, but he’s also been used in central defence and that versatility has given the manager more options.Fraser AirdOne of the first signings of the summer, the Canadian has added pace in the wide areas. He earned his move on the strength of performances against United for Dunfermline last term and, so far, he might just have been the best of the new bunch.Yannick LoembaThe winger was an unknown quantity who hadn’t had much football in the last year or so. However, there’s been no evidence of that and he’s made a lightning start to his time with United. The 28-year-old always wants on the ball and his eagerness to get forward has made him a fans’ favourite.Pavol SafrankoThe loan signing from Aalborg marked his debut with an excellent goal in the win at Queen of the South and has looked the part since. Well-known to the manager from their time together in his native Slovakia, Safranko looks to be the centre-forward United have been crying out for.Craig CurranA dead leg picked up in pre-season delayed his involvement until the opening league game when Dunfermline won at Tannadice. As his fitness has improved after that injury, Curran has shown himself to be a hard worker and chipped in with a goal against Partick.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/09/Driver-steering-wheel-stock.jpg ","title":"driver reported after honda car speeds at 145mph on local road","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA driver has been reported after a Honda vehicle reached 145mph on a local road.Police reported a motorist to the Procurator Fiscal after a car was seen driving at double the speed limit on the A92.Officers observed the silver vehicle at around 10.50pm on Friday September 7, between the Redhouse and Bankhead roundabouts in Glenrothes.Officers stopped the vehicle and a 24 year old man has been reported for dangerous driving.This follows another driver being reported, after the Safety Camera Unit detected a red Volkswagen driving at 141mph on Sunday September 2 near Cowdenbeath.Inspector Andy Mather of Fife Road Policing Unit said: \u0026#8220Speed limits are in place to assist in making our roads safer.\u0026#8220Driving at speeds which are grossly in excess of the maximum speed limit is simply dangerous.

I reckon Dundee have a real gem.“He went on to the pitch and scored straight-away, which was a terrific way to introduce himself.”There was little time to rest for the 19-year-old signed from Huddersfield in January.On Monday, he was in action for the Dark Blues’ second string as they chalked up a 4-0 success over Rangers in the Reserve League.He came off the bench to score after replacing Sofien Moussa, who also got on the scoresheet.Elton Ngwatala and Jean Mendy got the other goals.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b8e4d427df01-507x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united must win dirty games laments csaba laszlo","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIn the wake of Saturday’s 1-1 draw at Alloa, Dundee United boss Csaba Laszlo still cuts a frustrated figure.The Terrors, and Csaba, had been on a high after comfortable wins over Queen of the South and Partick Thistle saw them, seemingly, turn a corner.United controlled and managed those matches well but all their good work came undone as they laboured to a point at the Indodrill Stadium at the weekend.Csaba had spoken at the start of the season about his side’s need to start grinding out results if they want to win the Championship.And his disappointment and anger was evident as they couldn’t dictate what he called a ‘dirty game’ in Clackmannanshire.“It was a dirty game but one which really, if you want to make the top league, you have to manage all the time and finish,” he said.“This is not about dominating the game, it’s about winning the game.“It is clear for us that this was an artificial pitch and even it was seven, eight yards shorter than usually.“So I wait for my team and it’s clear, in this case, you have to circulate the ball quicker, you have to move the ball out quicker to have the possibility to move up the pitch.”United had opened the scoring in the second half through a Paul Watson header on 71 minutes, his third goal in two games, and it could have been more.Yannick Loemba had what would have been his first strike for the Tangerines ruled out for offside and Csaba felt 18-year-old Declan Glass could have played in fellow-sub Callum Booth to put the game beyond doubt.As it transpired, the kid gave away possession and Alloa broke to win the free-kick which Iain Flannigan curled home on 82 minutes to earn the Wasps a point.It was no less than the home side deserved but Csaba couldn’t help scrutinise his team’s game management.“We were in front, you have just to keep the ball and keep the result,” he added.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"i was looking to see if i could go elsewhere ex celtic kid paul mcmullan back from the brink at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWinger Paul McMullan has revealed there was a real chance of him leaving Dundee United before the transfer window closed a week ago.And the former Scotland U/21 international can’t rule out being on the move when the next window opens in January.However, between now and then, the former Celtic kid, who was brought to Tannadice by Ray McKinnon before the start of last season, insists his only focus will be on winning back a regular first-team place.That fight will continue in today’s Irn-Bru Cup second-round clash with Alloa, a game McMullan concedes he might not have been involved in.“The speculation last week, it was true. I was having a look to see if I could go elsewhere because the playing time here has been limited,” he said.“In the end there wasn’t anything that I felt attracted me more than Dundee United did, so that’s why I’m still here.“The club had made it pretty clear to me that, if I wanted to move on, they weren’t going to stand in my way, they’d let me go.“Between now and January I’ve got to get my head down and try to get time on the park.“And when it comes to January I will re-evaluate because I will only have six months on my contract left. I will have to look at it.“Right now, though, I’m just doing my best to try to get back into the team and see how that works. I’m not looking at anything else, I’m just focused on getting in the team and contributing.”With that in mind he is not looking at tomorrow and the Irn-Bru Cup, a competition United have made clear is not a priority this term, with any sense of disdain.He sees it as another chance to show manager Csaba Laszlo, who’s likely to be watching from the stand as reserve manager Craig Easton takes charge of the team, he should be in the starting line-up every week.For fans turning up, history suggests McMullan’s presence could mean they will be in for another late show.When the teams met at the same stage this time last year, he and Willo Flood struck deep in injury time to earn United victory.And in the first round this season, it was McMullan’s last-gasp strike that secured a remarkable comeback win over St Johnstone Colts, who’d been two up late on. This time he’d settle for the winner to come a little earlier than that.“I’ve done that a couple of times with late goals in this cup,” he added.“Hopefully, we don’t leave it until that late again and the boys can do well and get into the next round.“It would be nice to have a more straightforward victory but it is going to be a hard game and we saw at the weekend how tough it is playing against Alloa.“We just have to take it as it comes and see how we get on.”With Alloa expected to be along the same lines as when they lined up against United in the Championship last Saturday, McMullan knows making the third round could be a big ask.“I wouldn’t think they will make too many changes but it’s an opportunity for us to show what we do and we will try to take it.“It will be a good learning process for the younger ones in our team and a good test against seasoned pros who know what the game is all about.“For me, it’s an opportunity to show what I can do and that’s what I have to keep on doing.“I feel I’ve done OK, it’s just the chances haven’t been there for one reason or another and there’s not a lot I can do about that.“All I can do is stay patient and, if an opportunity comes, do all you can to make sure I take it as best I can.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b963815b248d-769x564.jpg ","title":"return of fraser fyvie provides fizz as youthful dundee united exit irn bru cup","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Irn-Bru Cup might not matter to Dundee United but Saturday’s second-round clash with Alloa at Tannadice might just prove to be one of the most significant days in their season.Craig Easton’s mix of kids and fringe players showed guts and character but just fell short as they lost the lead late on before exiting on penalties.As was signalled by less than 1,000 home fans turning up, however, few connected with the Tangerines will be bothered about that.What was both important and a massive positive, was the sight of club captain Fraser Fyvie making his long-awaited return from injury.Fyvie hadn’t been seen on Tannadice since two days before Christmas when a serious knee injury ended his season.Given the difference in results with and without him last term, it could be strongly argued the minute he went down clutching his knee also effectively killed off the campaign for the team as a whole.Now he’s back, manager Csaba Laszlo will be hoping he has the same influence as during his opening months at the club.Encouraging as the sight of him running on was, he will, of course, still need time to get up to speed in terms of match sharpness.Accordingly, the plan is for a few reserve outings to build strength and stamina before he returns to the full first team for the all- important Championship action.For Laszlo and the fans that time can’t come soon enough but those who turned up on Saturday were at least given glimpses of just how much he has to offer.There were a couple of passes from deep that turned defence into attack in an instant and a thunderous free-kick that provided the final action of game time and would have seen his return capped with a dramatic winner had it not be for a fine save from Neil Parry in the Alloa goal.Indeed, in a strange 90 minutes that saw the visitors dominate possession at times, but for Parry, Easton could have been looking forward to the third round.Over the piece, Alloa did more of the attacking but lacked the quality up front to finish off the good approach work.Often hitting on the break, United were able to create clear chances but found Parry in top form.After a crisp Matty Smith strike had given United the lead against the run of play on 15 minutes, Parry was soon denying the same player with an excellent stop, though somehow Greg Aitken failed to spot his touch and awarded a goal kick.Parry’s ability was recognised before the interval when he then made a superb stop to touch a Paul McMullan free-kick round the post.And he was the hero in the opening minutes of the second period as he plucked a Declan Glass 18-yarder out of the air, then did very well to beat away an Archie Thomas strike.For all that, Alloa continued to look a threat and when they were finally given a clear chance, from the penalty spot, Alan Trouten made no mistake, sending the ball past Benjamin Siegrist for the equaliser.If Jim Goodwin’s team fancied their chances of going on to get a winner in 90 minutes, they had further cause to be grateful to their goalkeeper as he denied Thomas and Fyvie in injury time to take the tie to a penalty shootout.It saw nine of the 10 spot-kicks expertly despatched via the use of power, only for the otherwise excellent Thomas opting for placement instead, giving Parry his most routine stop.It was the deciding moment, but for once a defeat included a bigger positive than the negative of losing.That came on 70 minutes when Fyvie strode out on the pitch.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b45cc3d57c90-e1531308229935.jpg ","title":"revealed these are the men dundee fans want in charge if neil

But hopes that work would start in June floundered when a council officer and Historic Environment Scotland voiced disquiet over proposals for a rebuild that would have been lower than the original building.Although talks are still ongoing regarding the rebuild, planning officers using delegated powers have now given permission for the demolition on the condition the stones are numbered and stored for the rebuild.Central ward councillor Bet McAllister who will attend a meeting with other councillors, officials and the\u0026nbspowners tomorrow\u0026nbspis confident of a solution and hopes the project will be completed by this time next year.\"I would like to see work start before the end of this year and then once the better weather comes in March or April to have it rebuilt next year unless they hit any other snags,\" she said. \"That would be my dream.\"She also insisted that the building should be reinstated to the same height.\"We will stick to our guns on that,\" she said. \"It has to be done to what we want.\"Cllr McAllister said a compulsory purchase order could be an option if a resolution was not forthcoming.\"Hopefully, it will not come to that,\" she said. \"I am confident the owners will play ball and that everything we have asked them to do will be done.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA council spokeswoman confirmed discussions were continuing regarding a rebuild and expected details of the project\u0027 programme to be released next week.Asked whether the council was considering a compulsory purchase order if the talks and proposals failed, she replied: \"All options remain under consideration which will enable the High Street being restored to full use.\"Pat Hayden, chairwoman of Crown and City Centre Community Council, said work should start as soon as possible and felt a more contemporary design for the rebuild should be considered if it would speed up progress.\u0026nbsp\"Time is being wasted,\" she said. \"If it is too difficult to rebuild as it was, let\u0027 forget it.

Our friendship was further cemented as a result of my involvement in Grassroot Soccer – an organisation founded by Bobby’s son, Tommy.“I’m so pleased that the club has honoured Bobby in this way.“Not only was he a Dons and Scotland goalkeeping legend, but he has been an inspirational coach and a positive driving force for the game across the USA.”Former Aberdeen manager and footballing legend Sir Alex Ferguson, said: “First of all I must thank Aberdeen FC for recognising one of their greatest players of all time, Bobby Clark.“His abilities as a goalkeeper were obviously recognised throughout the country and, when I managed Aberdeen, I was privileged to benefit from his loyalty and honesty.“His work as a coach was a tremendous asset to the Club where his discipline and knowledge were highlighted by the emergence of the likes of Neale Cooper, Neil Simpson and Eric Black.“I followed Bobby’s career as a coach, which was success after success, and had the privilege to spend time with him at Notre Dame where the fine job he did was recognised by everyone I met there. Well done Bobby and congratulations on a tremedous achievement.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"great charter dinner approved","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA civic dinner will be held next year to mark a medieval agreement between a king and the people of Aberdeen – despite concerns from opposition councillors.The 700th anniversary event, which was approved by councillors yesterday, will mark the creation of the Great Charter, granted by King Robert the Bruce in 1319. It was signed after the city sheltered him during his days as an outlaw from the English.Lord Provost Barney Crockett, who called for the council to hold the event, said the “momentous anniversary” should be marked by a “dinner in the first instance”, with citizens from all of the city’s 13 wards invited.He added: “It’s important we do it in a way that echoes our past.“Our link with Robert the Bruce is an important one and we should mark it in a dignified way.“Our citizens may want to do other things that might be part of a general celebration but we should have a dignified event.”SNP group leader Stephen Flynn instead called for council officers to provide options for an event that will be accessible to “all people in Aberdeen”.He said: “There’s a real danger with a dinner that it becomes exclusive and not inclusive.“We may end up with the same ‘well kent faces’ and I don’t think that would be the best thing in this situation.”Liberal Democrat group colleagues also expressed concern over the plans.Group leader of the party Ian Yuill said: “I agree it’s very important that we do celebrate the anniversary. Our concern is that a dinner, while nice for those that attend, is very transitory and would have no lasting benefit to the city and its citizens.”The most lasting legacy of the charter is the city’s Common Good Fund, which is used for a number of charitable causes every year.Robert the Bruce gave Aberdeen the Forest of Stocket, now the Midstocket area of the city, in return for a yearly rent.As a result of the finances generated from the forest, the Common Good Fund was created to benefit the people of the city. The fund helped to create Marischal College and assisted citizens during the 1640 plague.Other recognised Aberdeen institutions also benefited from the funds, and cash was given to Aberdeen Art Gallery, the Central Library, Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and the purchase of Hazlehead Park.Aberdeen City Council co-leader Douglas Lumsden said he was “confident” the event would include members of the community who “do so much to make the city what it is”.He added: “For me this is just part of what next year will be as a celebration year and there might be other events we could do to mark the occasion.”Members voted 22 votes to 22 with Mr Crockett having the casting vote in favour of holding the dinner.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most individual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

Joe Chapman, 23, is taking part in this September’s Great Scottish Run following the tragic death of his pregnant wife, Holly Chapman, to cystic fibrosis when she was just 23 years old. Holly was aged just one and a half when she was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and although she was in and out of hospital regularly, it was something she kept very private to those around her. Joe said: “Holly and I met at the school we both attended down in England. “We started going out in 2010 and got married in August 2015. “I only found out she had the condition after about eight months of us being together. It wasn’t something she really spoke about, she just dealt with it. “It was probably around 2012 that we noticed her health slowly deteriorating. “She would be in hospital around two to three times a year for a two-week period to go on an IV drip to boost her immune system and clear chest infections. “Every year since then she would be in hospital more and more.” Due to Holly needing IV drips more frequently, Joe and Holly’s Mum received training to give Holly IV drips from home, rather than being in hospital for long periods at a time. On November 27, 2017 Holly found out she was pregnant, but at the same time her health was beginning to deteriorate at a much faster rate. Joe said: “Holly was needing to be in hospital for around six to seven weeks at a time. “I remember her being let out for six days at Christmas but she really couldn’t do much herself, she got too out of breath. “I had to carry her up and down the stairs and help her get dressed. She was also permanently on oxygen.” This continued through until March 8 this year, where Holly had a fit at home and was taken away in an ambulance to Ayr Hospital. She was transferred to a specialist unit in Glasgow, where her health got slightly better over the next couple of days. Joe added: “The specialist advised if she didn’t improve, that we should consider aborting our baby. On March 13, Holly became so ill that we decided it was time to let her be at peace and we made the decision to turn off her ventilator. Holly left the world far too young due to this horrible disease. “Cystic fibrosis is a really common disease but not many people know much about it which I why I decided to take part in the Great Scottish Run, to raise awareness and also raise vital funds for the trust.” You can sponsor Joe via his JustGiving page: https:www.justgiving/fundraising/joe-chapman9Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr HospitalCystic FibrosisCharityAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayrs station hotel undergo 24","story":"NewsAyr\u0027s Station Hotel to undergo 24 hour rescue operation aimed at re-opening platforms to ScotRail trainsThe crumbling building is the subject of a large exclusion zone which has rendered much of Ayr station a no-go zone.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson16:43, 11 SEP 2018NewsStation Hotel in Ayr \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA painstaking mission aimed at re-opening parts of Ayr railway station is to get underway. Safety teams will work 24 hours a day to try and get the hub moving again. Work, which begins this Saturday, is expected to last until mid-October. Council bosses hope their move will reduce the extended exclusion zone which has paralysed the town\u0027s train station. Services to Glasgow Central are currently restricted in size with all six carriage trains halting at Prestwick Town. All trains south of Ayr are cancelled. Contractors are now set to move in with the aim of reinstating those lost services. Council chief executive, Eileen Howat, said: The extended exclusion zone at the train station – and its impact on rail services – is far from ideal, but we’ve had to take this action to keep people safe and that’s something we cannot, and will not, take any chances with. Our priority right now is to do what’s needed to allow the extended exclusion zone to be reduced when safe to do so and for rail services to get back to normal, and that’s exactly what we’re doing.  Once that has been achieved, we will continue to progress the wider programme of public safety works as well as the works to complete a structural survey, which will help inform the next steps with regards to the building’s future.   Andrew Mackie, Transport Scotland’s Head of Rail Franchising, added: In the longer term, any solution identified must contribute to the economic prosperity of the town centre and the communities south of Ayr currently without a train service.  This means we need to explore all the available options for dealing with the Station Hotel property which, in its current state, presents a significant safety risk not only to the railway line but also the immediate vicinity.  Only by continuing to work in close partnership with the relevant agencies and the local community can we reach an effective solution for everyone concerned - particularly those passengers, the local community and businesses directly affected.   ScotRail Head of Service Planning, Dave Smith, said: The beginning of the works to remove the extended exclusion zone is a fantastic step forward and until then we are working flat out to keep our customers moving.

A glass pane at Belleisle pro Richard Gordon’s shop was smashed in the 4am raid. Titleist and Wilson clubs were taken, in addition to Richard’s Ping bag and clubs. Police told the pro there’s been around 25 similar thefts in Scotland since April. And they are working with the Scottish Professional Golfers’ Association to track down raiders. “It’s absolutely gut-wrenching,” said Richard, 45. “The bag and clubs were presented to me in April in Phoenix, Arizona,” he said. The pro was given the accolade of being named Ping Custom Fitter of the Year for Scotland. His precious set of clubs includes a titanium driver, along with a three-wood, hybrid clubs, a full set of irons and a putter. All are high-end, high-value clubs - as are the other makes taken in the raid. Richard and his staff moved into the new South Ayrshire Council shop facility around two-and-a-half years ago. “It’s fully alarmed, and has CCTV cameras,” he said. “Security is excellent, but these raiders are prepared to go to any lengths.” It’s been reported, in other raids, that thieves have smashed through metal shutters, and even brick walls. The pro shop at Dundonald Links, between Troon and Irvine, was also targeted in a recent raid. Richard praised the way the police are conducting their inquiries. “They’ve been highly forensic in their investigation - even trying to get DNA,” he said. “The CCTV shows hooded figures, but it’s something the police are still looking at,” he added. Richard has been associated with Belleisle for 25 years, and has been head pro for 11 years. Richard’s wife Vikki works with him in the business, and Lee Hughes is his assistant pro. Richard said: “I love Belleisle, and it’s great that South Ayrshire has invested so much in municipal golf facilities.” “I think South Ayrshire runs the best municipal golf course in Britain if you exclude St Andrews.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrGet into GolfAyr NewsSouth Ayrshire CouncilSt AndrewsTroonDundonald"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13191066.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_290818CHAMPION_11JPG.jpg","title":"hundreds flock welcome back inspirational","story":"NewsHundreds flock to welcome back inspirational world record breakerPupils, parents and teachers surrounded the car park of Kyle Academy to show their appreciation of Gavin Drysdale, who smashed a world record at the European World Para Athletics in Berlin.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet14:05, 4 SEP 2018NewsKyle Academy pupil Gavin Drysdale \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHundreds of people flocked to a school to welcome back an inspirational hero. Pupils, parents and teachers surrounded the car park of Kyle Academy to show their appreciation of Gavin Drysdale, who smashed a world record at the European World Para Athletics in Berlin. S6 pupil Gavin, of Ayr, brought home the gold in the race running 100m category with an incredible time of 17.37 seconds. And he was given a hero’s welcome as he was led in by a bagpipe performance. He made his way round the hundreds of emotional crowd, and there was barely a dry eye to be seen. It was clear to see how much Gavin had brought the community together, and how immensely proud they were of the superstar. A teacher was even seen asking “is my mascara running?”, which summed up the emotional parade for Gavin. And it was so clear to see how delighted Gavin was with the turnout, with pupils even running over to grab selfies with him. A buzzing Gavin said: “The reception I got coming back to school was overwhelming. “I wasn’t expecting anything like that reaction I got, it was great. “Kyle Academy are always very supportive of any competition I am doing.” Gavin, 17, has cerebral palsy and has been race running for 10 years. He trains at Dam Park, and when he started way back in 2008 he was the only race runner from Scotland. Now there are over 100 competitors from the country.  He is part of the race running club which is supported by Blue Rock Insurance Brokers. The race club is a branch of Ayr Seaforth and is coached by David Phee. Gavin also trains at Red Star in Glasgow with Janice Eaglesham. And the race running has came so far since he started, and these games have helped it get well on its way to being a part of the Paralympic games. Gavin competed in a special racing trike, which has impressive Continental tyres on it. Gavin is still on cloud nine after bagging the top prize in Berlin. He said: “When I won I was totally stunned. “I felt like I had already won a gold medal just by being there, so the fact I actually won was amazing!”  All the way through Gavin’s journey, his mum Margaret and dad Peter have been there supporting him. His family and friends have helped him along the way, and his sister Natalie even had banners up at the family home to celebrate his success for when he got back. Dad Peter said: “We are just so proud of Gavin. “We were so relieved when he won the gold - as we knew how much hard work he put into his progress. “The games went great, and it’s incredible to see how well the Scottish athletes done at the games.  “We have to extend our thanks to Kyle Academy for being so supportive and for this spectacular welcome they have given us.” Gavin isn’t just a star on the track, he has just sailed through S5 picking up an impressive five highers at A and B grades. He was also a part of the Commonwealth games baton relay in 2014. Headteacher for Kyle Academy, Mary Byrne said: “The whole school is so proud of Gavin. “We are delighted that we are able to show our support for him, and everyone at the school is delighted for him.” "},{"url":null,"title":"people given say regeneration ayr","story":"NewsPeople are to be given a say on regeneration of Ayr town centreAn \u0027Olympic\u0027 class swimming pool earmarked to replace CitadelShare\u0026nbspBySarah Hilley12:46, 11 SEP 2018Updated12:58, 11 SEP 2018NewsCitadel Leisure Centre Ayr\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn “Olympic” class swimming pool is earmarked for Ayr High Street to replace the aging Citadel, writes Sarah Hilley And the recently cleared Riverside block will become a public square, radical new council proposals reveal.

We would like to speak to people about moving the swimming pool into the middle of the town.” It would be sited at the Arran Mall if the plans get the go-ahead. Deputy council leader Brian McGinley said: “There is potential for an Olympic style swimming pool. We need Ayr to be a destination. “If we move it to the town centre we will have other businesses coming in because of the increased footfall.” Replacing the High Street with an easy clean surface to get rid of chewing gum and other grime is another proposal to clean up the town. Council offices have been ruled out for good at the Riverside site after public protest over designs. Instead council staff would work at the newly refurbished old Clydesdale Bank building, other existing offices and a new archives base at Ayr Academy. Councillor Campbell said: “It will be a large public square and we want to ask people if they think it is a good idea.” Planning rules are to be changed so empty ground floor shops can be transformed into homes. Councillor Campbell said: “We need to reduce the number of shops in Ayr. One way to do that is to move residential accommodation down to the ground floor. We want to encourage residential development at the bottom of the town. We want the High Street to work 18 hours a day instead of eight. The town centre is dead at night. It is off putting. People go to Prestwick for the buzz.” Councillor McGinley said: “Retail is dead. The town centre needs to be re-invigorated.” It is hoped the empty former bridal shop at the Town Hall could house a new museum. Councillor Campbell said: “We have some fantastic artefacts hidden away. Let’s get them out in the open.” All ideas have yet to undergo public consultation.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnMuseumsSouth Ayrshire CouncilPrestwickAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"prestwick airport could used free","story":"NewsPrestwick Airport could be used as free parking base for ScotRail passengers on Ayr to Glasgow Central lineGovernment officials have pledged to examine the possibility of using the airport - which they own - for free parking relief to help ease the pain of commuters.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson16:08, 6 SEP 2018NewsPrestwick Airport could be used for free parking \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrestwick Airport could be used as an unlikely saviour in the ongoing crisis at Ayr Railway Station. Government bosses are examining a plan to utilise the flight hub - which they own - for free parking. A number of services on the Ayr to Glasgow Central line will start and terminate at Prestwick Town from next Monday. But with concerns over a lack of parking in the town, transport chiefs have begun scrambling for other options. Ayr MSP, John Scott, led calls for the move to be considered during First Minister\u0027s Questions today in Holyrood. After raising the issue with Nicola Sturgeon, he told the Ayrshire Post: This is now a crisis situation and we should be looking at all available options. Parking in Prestwick is at a premium as it is, so if the airport can provide free spaces until this situation is resolved, it is something we should look at. Responding to Mr Scott\u0027s idea in parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: It strikes me as a very good suggestion and I can\u0027t think of any immediate objection anyone would have. We know the pressure this is putting on commuters. The First Minister has pledged to explore the option with her officials. Four carriage services will continue to operate between Ayr and Glasgow, but six carriage trains will be halted at Prestwick as part of ScotRail\u0027s plan to combat overcrowding on the line. It comes as crisis engulfs Ayr station with the crumbling overhead hotel, owned by a private Malaysian businessman, subject to a large exclusion zone.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnNicola SturgeonPrestwick AirportScotrailGlasgowAyrTransportAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"stagecoach accused turning ayr street","story":"NewsStagecoach accused of turning Ayr street into \u0027deathtrap\u0027 as double deckers thunder down back roadNeighbours say double decker buses accessing the Waggon Road depot in Ayr are thundering along quiet Green Street at all times of the day and night after a route change.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson13:59, 7 SEP 2018NewsResidents protest outside the bus garage \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFurious residents claim a bus giant has turned their back street into a deathtrap.

councillors voted to allow its demolition.\nSt Aidan\u0026rsquos Church, in Gala Park, is set to face the wrecking ball after the owners, Cumbria-based Book Development, concluded that renovating the B-listed Gothic church would be uneconomical.\nAt a meeting of Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday, principal planning officer Barry Fotheringham said demolition was the only economically viable option left.\nHe said: \u0026ldquoThe building is not physically incapable of repair, therefore the overriding principle that needs to be satisfied is one of economic viability.\n\u0026ldquoThis application is supported by feasibility reports and valuations which estimate the building is beyond the point of economic repair.\n\u0026ldquoVarious options have been explored, including the conversion of the church into residential properties, though this would incur a loss of \u0026pound700,000, based on 2018 costs.\n\u0026ldquoAn alternative scheme for a development which would retain the front facade of the church and the spire was also evaluated, and this would potentially result in a loss of around \u0026pound1m.\n\u0026ldquoThe applicant provided subsequent figures that would need to be invested in order to make a profit. \u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoThese assessments conclude that in order to make a reasonable profit, 29 units would be required on site, with 24 units behind the facade and five on the site behind the church.\n\u0026ldquoIt is accepted that not all options have been explored, but it is reasonable to assume that the applicant has demonstrated that a substantial and likely inappropriate development would be required to make the scheme viable.\n\u0026ldquoI am satisfied that the viability argument has been met.\nSpeaking in favour of allowing the demolition, East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing said: \u0026ldquoI just think this is really, really sad to lose this fabulous building.

Before the official opening, our reporter Hilary Scott met up with Susan Meikle and Hazel Millen, owners of the Allotment, who stepped in to save the day following the closure of the previous Post Office on the High Street.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot ever their dream to be postal mistresses. Susan and Hazel were content running their successful store, which has been selling fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese, wholefoods, jams and chutney since 2011.\nThey had always been open to suggestions from residents on new products and ideas \u0026ndash creating a monthly cheese tasting evening, and a popular home delivery service.\nWhen news hit the town of the Post Office closure in February last year, the community fought a hard campaign to see its full-time service return.\nThe impact of the closure was felt by the Allotment and other High Street businesses. Susan explained: \u0026ldquoWhen it closed, a lot of people who previously used the Post Office started going out of the town and naturally doing their shopping elsewhere. It hit Innerleithen hard.\nThe pair had previously laughed off any suggestions by locals that they could house the Post Office within their store.\nBut one evening in late December, something moved Susan to click a link online to find out more information \u0026ndash and from this very moment, the revival of the Post Office began.\nNo-one had officially approached them to take on the Post Office, so when asked what moved them to send the application, Susan and Hazel looked at one another and mused: \u0026ldquoYou could call it insanity!\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot easily signed, sealed and delivered. There were many loop holes to jump through, including applications, interviews and trips to Glasgow for training, before they could start running Innerleithen\u0026rsquos new service from their premises.\nAnd although Susan and Hazel say they will not financially benefit by taking on this new responsibility, they feel the gain is retaining a vital service for the people of Innerleithen.\nVariety is the spice of life, and for the Allotment owners and their two hardworking members of staff Leanne and Susan, they\u0026rsquoll be juggling more than apples and pears on occasions. \u0026ldquoI hope people give us a chance. It is going to be a challenge running the Post Office and serving our valued customers, added Susan. \u0026ldquoThere are going to be times that there will be a queue and we would appreciate people\u0026rsquos patience. We are new to this. It might take a little longer for us to do things, but it will be done right.\nI on the other-hand like to think that a little festive magic played its part in the happy ending to this tale, and somewhere in this quaint town, the one request on someone\u0026rsquos Christmas list was that the community didn\u0026rsquot lose its postal service.\nAnd it wasn\u0026rsquot delivered by a postman, or a man with a white beard wearing a red suit and black boots.

last week, when retired local GP John Wilson undertook the same 87-mile cycle ride made in 1916 by the town\u0026rsquos legendary medical practitioner, Dr John Muir, at the age of 71.\nDr Muir served the medical needs of Selkirk from 1867-1928, becoming one of the local community\u0026rsquos most respected and well-loved figures.\nNot only was he a keen cyclist, he kept a meticulous record of his family life and his day-to-day dealings with the public in a series of diaries.\nIn 2014, some 40 of Dr Muir\u0026rsquos diaries were presented by his descendants to the Scottish Borders Archive \u0026amp Local History Service, and these were then transcribed by staff at Hawick\u0026rsquos Heritage Hub.\nTwo years later, at the request of Live Borders, Selkirk playwright and actor John Nichol used material from the diaries as the basis for his one-man, one-act play, Dr John Stewart Muir: The Beloved Doctor.\nTaking the title role himself, John\u0026rsquos play received a rapturous reception at its premiere in the town\u0026rsquos County Hotel in February, 2017.\nOne scene features Dr Muir recounting an ambitious cycle ride he took to Moffat in 1916, returning via Boreland, Eskdalemuir and Ettrickbridge.\nIt is this ride that retired local GP John Wilson retraced last Wednesday, following the exact route described by Dr Muir.\n\u0026ldquoI always thought it would be amazing to recreate that ride, John told the Border  this week, \u0026ldquoso I\u0026rsquom just so happy that John Wilson was able to do it.\nJust as Dr Muir had done before him, John stopped off at Moffat\u0026rsquos Buccleuch Arms Hotel, where he was welcomed by director Polly Smith, while on the return journey he stopped at the Cross Keys in Ettrickbridge, where he was given a glass of water by owner Trevor Logan.\nDr Wilson\u0026rsquos encounters throughout the day were filmed by retired Selkirk journalist John Smail, who is making a documentary entitled A Souter\u0026rsquos Year, covering all aspects of life in Selkirk and the Valleys during 2018.\nAt the end of Wednesday\u0026rsquos ride Dr Wilson, himself an extremely proficient road cyclist, said he\u0026rsquod thoroughly

nurseries for delivering increased free childcare has come in for criticism by inspectors.\nLanglee Primary School Nursery is one of seven early learning centres across the Borders trialling an increase in funded early learning and childcare from 600 to 1140 hours.\nBy 2020 the additional hours should be available across the whole Borders.\nEducation bosses at Scottish Borders Council believe Langlee Nursery is capable of catering for up to 100 three-, four- and eligible two-year-old children.\nBut experts from the Care Inspectorate found the centre, which is part of the new \u0026pound10 million Langlee Primary School, is struggling to cope.\nInspectors weren\u0027t happy with the lay-out of the new nursery and highlighted the \u0027high number of accidents\u0027 that had happened as well as a shortage of staff.\nA spokeswoman for the Care Inspectorate said: \"Providing lunch for a large number of children provided a significant organisational challenge and resulted in a poor experience for children.\n\"Staff tried hard to make lunch positive and did ensure children had something to eat and drink but opportunities for independence and children\u0027s choices were limited.\n\"On the day of our visit it was apparent that the space allocated to the nursery was not working well.\n\"The quality, layout and aesthetic appeal of play activities for children over three needed to be significantly improved.\n\"There had been a high number of accidents in the nursery and we asked senior staff to audit these to see if there was a pattern to time, event or children involved.\"\nLanglee Nursery is made up of two classrooms and a central atrium area.\nAnd most children have access to an outdoor play area as well.\nParents praised staff in their responses to questionnaires sent out by the inspectors.\nBut the inspectors also found problems with the turnover of staff and the need for bank workers to fill in.\nThe spokeswoman added: \"There were acknowledged challenges in the staff team.\n\"The nursery had increased in the number of children quite significantly in the last year and the staffing had lacked continuity.\n\"Additional staff needed to be employed to ensure the children\u0027s needs could be met and this was being addressed.\"\nWhile previous inspections of Langlee Nursery by the Care Inspectorate led to gradings of either \u0027very good\u0027 or \u0027good\u0027 the latest inspection found the quality of environment, of staffing, and of management as only \u0027adequate\u0027 with only the level of care and support still deemed \u0027good\u0027.\nA spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: \"The council has already taken significant steps following the care inspectorate visit and has addressed a number of the matters raised, for example improving lunch routines.\n\"SBC takes very seriously any recommendations made during these inspections and regularly monitors progress.\n\"We are confident that the matters raised in the report are being addressed and additional support will be provided to ensure good progress is achieved quickly.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"what-is-monkeypox-and-how-does-it-spread","story":"A second person has been diagnosed with monkeypox in England, health officials confirmed.

things\u0026#8217 belonging to his late father,\u0026#8217 Eleanor explained. \u0026#8216It turned out to be eight boxes full of artefacts that we\u0026#8217re still going through now.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s one of the best collections from the First World War that we have seen.\u0026#8217There are parts of shot-down airships, a parachute, fragments of a radiator from a zeppelin and much more.Accompanying the artefacts, are photographs, many taken by Major Struthers himself, documenting his personal life and military career, as well as the history of airships.Major Struthers, who was mentioned in dispatches, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, with two bars later added, for his missions with the Royal Naval Air Service, which amalgamated with the British Army\u0026#8217s Royal Flying Core to become the Royal Air Force in 1918.Major Struthers was recognised for flying more hours than any other airship pilot during the war.Aged 52 by the time the Second World War broke out, Major Struthers was too old to serve but he was in the Royal Observer Corps, his patch stretching from Sutherland to Machrihanish.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s local to Oban but it\u0026#8217s an Argyll story,\u0026#8217 said Eleanor. \u0026#8216Major Struthers was actually based in Cornwall during the war.\u0026#8217Diana Manning, from Drumlemble but originally from Cornwall, attended the exhibition\u0026#8217s Campbeltown opening to find out more about the Cornish history, and found it \u0026#8216fascinating\u0026#8217.During her opening speech, Eleanor said: \u0026#8216I think this is an area of World War One that people don\u0026#8217t really think about.\u0026#8216They think about later aircraft, especially in World War Two, but I don\u0026#8217t think they know the role they had in World War One.\u0026#8217Councillor Donald Kelly, who attended the opening, said he thought it was essential to engage with local school children: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s important that youngsters today know what went on in the past \u0026#8211 especially involving someone from Argyll.\u0026#8217The exhibition, which was launched in Oban in July, will be in Campbeltown until September 29, before moving on to Helensburgh and Dunoon.Councillor John Armour, Campbeltown\u0026#8217s library supervisor Christine McPhee, Eleanor McKay and

Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a different pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang returned, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924. In 1925 a christian name is inscribed for the first time, when, Bella Strang, taking her third win, was partnered by  Mr C. MacTaggart.Mrs W. McKersie and Mr C. McTaggart won in 1926 and Miss S.

Consequently, it has not been possible to derive much pathological information from these cases, which is a pain, as this is information we need to identify possible causes of death.\u0026#8216Cuvier’s beaked whales  are native to both British and Irish waters where they occur in deep waters, typically greater than 50 km offshore.

Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.

If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.

I\u0026rsquom now in my late 50s, and 60 is looming ahead of me like a cat waiting to pounce and have cruel fun. Yet I know people who are in their 30s and 40s who are much older than me, and folk in their 60s and above who are younger. My oldest daughter is in her early 20s and is already lamenting the fact she is no longer \u0026lsquoyoung\u0026rsquo.  The truth is that age is a mentality or, as is often said, \u0026lsquojust a number\u0026rsquo. Of course, deteriorating health and pain can come with age, as I have experienced, but even then, getting this far makes me very thankful despite the wear and tear.  I often say that life is like toothpaste: we use it with abandon at first and then, as we realise it\u0026rsquos running out, each squirt becomes increasingly more precious and satisfying.  \u0026ldquoA whole summer seems nothing these days, it\u0026rsquos over before you get used to it, a friend said to me recently. And indeed it is nothing if we measure it by days passed.  Yet if we measure not the passing of hours, days or years but the accumulation of memories and experiences, then time seems longer, both in quantity and quality. The trick, then, is to make those experiences and memories, and to truly live in them as they happen. This means understanding what is truly meaningful to us, and what gives genuine joy and fulfilment.  I think that is the secret to a long life, regardless of what number you reach. It\u0026rsquos not just about how much toothpaste is in your tube, it\u0026rsquos about how much you savour and use the amount you have. All of us savour key moments, of course. The first day at school for our children, our holiday time, time with friends or spent doing things we enjoy.  Yet inevitably such moments are less common than what we might call the daily routine of life. I suppose that\u0026rsquos what makes them stand out. Thus the daily routine of \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo life shoots us by, almost without us noticing. And that\u0026rsquos most of our life.  And so I am now more determined than ever to make my life \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo for as long as I may have left. This isn\u0026rsquot a commitment to hippy living in a campervan  but a conscious decision to savour every day as if it were my last. And what really helped me in this realisation was a conversation one day while waiting for a train. . .  One spring morning just before this summer, I was standing on the platform at Prestonpans station waiting for a train. I was not used to getting this early train and was surprised how busy it was. I was heading into Edinburgh to do some storytelling and so unusually sharing my journey with commuters.  It was a beautiful warm sunny morning, the herald of the heatwave soon to arrive. As I waited for the train I scrolled on my phone. Then I heard a voice behind me saying: \u0026ldquoOn your death bed, will you really look fondly back on the countless hours, equivalent to years of your life, spent scrolling on a phone? Will you remember just one per cent of that activity, or even want to?  I turned round to see who was speaking to me there was nobody. Then I noticed the hawthorn tree.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos better, the hawthorn said. It was resplendent with blossom, leaning over the edge of the side of the bridge which takes the cars below the station.  Perhaps I had seen it before, but this time I really noticed it because it had spoken to me. I studied its flowers and took in the immense beauty of it. It\u0026rsquos perfectly situated to admire, but the hawthorn seemed sad.  \u0026ldquoCan you imagine the effort it takes to get this magnificent and beautiful? it said. \u0026ldquoYet nobody seems to notice me.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure they do, I replied. \u0026ldquoNo, they don\u0026rsquot watch, insisted the tree. And so I did.  The hawthorn was right. People walked past the tree, stood next to it, but nobody seemed to notice it, and certainly nobody took any time to admire it.  \u0026ldquoBut they are busy, I said in our defence.  \u0026ldquoWe are all busy in different ways, said the tree. \u0026ldquoBut we can choose to be \u0026lsquotoo busy\u0026rsquo for some things while being busy doing others. Often you decide what is important to be busy with so you exclude what you think are the less important things.  \u0026ldquoLike looking and admiring you? I replied sarcastically.  \u0026ldquoPrecisely, said the hawthorn, perhaps not understanding a sarcastic tone.  Suddenly the train arrived. People put away their phones and I bade a hasty farewell to the tree. We all crammed into the carriage and it filled up to the brim. I saw the blazing white of the hawthorn\u0026rsquos blossom through the window. Then we headed for Wallyford.  The train ground to a halt and the doors opened. There was a crush and people calling out politely \u0026ldquoplease move up. I wondered if everyone would get on, and I think they did, but only just. Now the train felt overloaded and it literally ground its way out of the station.  When it arrived at Musselburgh, the doors opened to present a human wall made of commuters from the Pans and Wallyford. There was simply no way anyone was getting on. I watched from the privilege of my seat. Two young men with suitcases, obviously going on holiday had no chance, and didn\u0026rsquot even try.  As the train pulled away, leaving dozens of people stranded on the platform, I felt a sense of guilt at having a seat. At Waverley we were trapped in a bottleneck by ticket collectors, ensuring that none of the lucky ones who had actually managed to get onto the train would escape paying for their good fortune.  When I returned I had to cross the bridge to my car. And there was the hawthorn tree, showing off its blossom like a peacock trying to impress a mate with its feather display.  And I have noticed the hawthorn ever since. The blossom faded as summer arrived and now it bears it berries. Its haws glisten where once there was blossom, reminding me that summer has had its course, and asking the question of how I made it memorable.  I am so thankful for the hawthorn\u0026rsquos advice. It was simple but so important. The trick is to live in the moment to notice that which makes the mundane and normal extraordinary or beautiful or special.  We can pepper our daily life with simple but extraordinary moments of connection, so a day never really remains \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo. We just have to truly live in that moment, to come out of our busyness and worries, and savour it.  Maybe the hawthorn tree will speak to you if ever you find yourself at Prestonpans train station. Or maybe someone else will your child, your grandchild, your partner, friends, your grandparents, your work colleague, or perhaps your inner self.  Maybe it wasn\u0026rsquot actually the tree which spoke to me. Perhaps it was my inner self. But then again, perhaps it was a speaking hawthorn, and you have to be \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo to hear it!"},{"url":null,"title":"leader-of-councils-conservative-opposition-steps-down-after-health-issues","story":"  Councillor Brian Small, who has held the position since being one of seven Conservative councillors elected in May 2017, stood down for a brief period last year following a severe bout of sepsis before returning to the post.

The site is a popular gathering place for youths in the area and, although covered by CCTV, it has not acted as a deterrent.  There have previously been reports of vandalism and people breaking into the building.

Provost John McMillan, ward councillor, raised concerns from local constituents about dust and road washing equipment used on the site over the summer.  Charles Church, from Mactaggart and Mickel Homes, told the committee concerns had been raised about issues with the building contractors used on the site and they were looking at possible penalties for any future breaches of the agreed construction management plan.  Mr McMillan asked if it would be possible for any financial penalties paid to be put towards local community groups or projects. Mr Church told him that was a consideration, adding that Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ldquoalready has a fund called building communities where we invest in local communities.

The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland  told East Lothian Council the plans to build next to medieval Dirleton Castle, which dates back to the mid 13th century, were too \u0026ldquomodern and suburban.  The association said the new development,\u0026nbspproposed at Castlemains Farm immediately to the east of the castle, would \u0026ldquoirreparably damage the setting of Dirleton, destroying the important edges that define the village and separate it from the surrounding countryside.  And at a meeting of the local authority\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington, councillors voted by seven to four to reject the plans, which had been recommended for approval by their own officers.  Local ward councillor Jane Henderson said that the intervention from APRS had been \u0026ldquocritical as she criticised Historic Environment Scotland, which is responsible for Dirleton Castle, after it\u0026nbspfailed to formally object to the proposals.  The public agency, who were consultees on the application, told the local authority that while they acknowledged the development might have an impact on the castle, which is a scheduled monument, they considered the proposals\u0026nbspnot to have an impact of \u0026ldquonational significance.  Councillor Henderson said: \"I am particularly disappointed in Historic Environment Scotland. How they can hold that name and come through so weakly on the setting of a castle, you have to ask questions about that.  However, the agency said it had already responded to a previous application for housing on the same site which had later been withdrawn.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe were consulted by East Lothian Council on the planning application for Castlemains Farm in January 2018, on the potential impact of this application on the setting of Dirleton Castle and Gardens which is a scheduled monument.  \u0026ldquoThis second planning application addressed the concerns that had been raised when the first planning application was submitted, primarily the impact of the development on the relationship between the castle and the land to the south and east. As a result, we did not object to the application.  \u0026ldquoWe did, however, highlight a risk of impact from landscaping and lighting, and have recommended further mitigation.  Developers Queensberry Properties told the committee they had held extensive consultations with council planners and the local community but they admitted they had come to an impasse with Dirleton Village Association and had to \u0026ldquoagree to disagree.  Their spokesman told the committee that while they wanted the new houses to face outwards on the edge of the village instead of presenting visitors with a view of \u0026ldquogarden sheds and trampolines, the village association wanted the houses to \u0026ldquoturn their back on the outside world.  Architect John Finlay, who helped produce the Dirleton Expects document outlining the village association\u0026rsquos vision for its future, said: \u0026ldquoThe design is as alien as if it had landed from outer space. It even has a suburban road, with all the clutter that entails, in the forefront of the castle.  Martin White from Gullane Area Community Council said the group was opposed to the development because \u0026ldquoyou do not hide castles.  He said: \u0026ldquoDirleton Castle is one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos top five visitor attractions. It may not be of national impact but it certainly matters in East Lothian.  The council received 71 written objections and only one representation supporting the development, which cited a need for affordable housing in the village.  Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress which dates back to the mid-13th century and has been at the centre of numerous sieges. At one point it was owned by the Ruthvens, who were involved in several plots against Mary Queen of Scots and King James VI.  Councillor Stuart Currie, planning committee member, raised concerns that the development appeared to bear little resemblance to the original development brief for the site that the local authority had consulted on with the community.  However, planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire said the fact those opposing the development did not have the support of Historic Environment Scotland and the council\u0026rsquos own heritage officer led him to back the planning officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to approve it.

A rare disease caused by a viral infection.  How does it spread?  Most commonly when a person comes into close contact with an infected animal.  It is not spread easily between people.  What are the symptoms?  Infected people usually start to show symptoms between five and 21 days after infection.  These include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion.  How serious is it?  Most patients recover within a few weeks and do not need treatment, but it can cause severe illness in some people.  Why is it called monkeypox?  The disease was first discovered in monkeys kept for research in 1958. The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Where is it prevalent?  Cases have been reported in a number of countries in Africa, including Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia and Nigeria.  An outbreak occurred in America in 2003 after rodents were imported from Africa.  There was a sustained outbreak in Nigeria last year and there have been sporadic cases reported since then."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8670849.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"chancellor-invited-on-shrewsbury-pub-crawl","story":"  Normally a dry affair, proceedings were enlivened and invitations for a tipple came flooding in for Mr Hammond before the sun was over the yard arm.

The supermarket giant simply said it will be \u0026ldquosharing some exciting news but did not give any further detail.  In July, Tesco advertised for staff for a \u0026ldquonew store format in Chatteris, seeking to recruit retail assistants, retail customer service assistants and retail managers.  Media reports in July said Tesco was close to launching a chain of discount stores in Britain called \u0026ldquoJack\u0026rsquos after Jack Cohen, who founded a business in 1919 that became Tesco.  Tesco is Britain\u0026rsquos grocery market leader with a share of 27.4% while Aldi and Lidl have increased their combined share to 13.1%, according to the latest Kantar Worldpanel data.  Earlier this year Tesco announced it would form a \u0026ldquostrategic alliance with French retailer Carrefour as part of efforts to cut prices.  The long-term deal will be covered by a three-year framework and see the two companies form a \u0026ldquostrategic relationship when dealing with global suppliers.  In June, Tesco reported its 10th consecutive quarter of sales growth, boosted by its acquisition of wholesaler Booker.  Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, said: \u0026ldquoAldi and Lidl account for over 13% of take-home grocery sales and are growing at 10% each year.  \u0026ldquoStrategically, it makes sense for Tesco to consider its own discount chain and try to capture some of that growth.  \u0026ldquoThe big four now make up less than 70% of grocery sales \u0026ndash down from 76% a decade ago.

Wanda Barzee, 72, will be released on September \u0026nbsp19 after the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole determined it had miscalculated the time she previously served in federal custody, board spokesman Greg Johnson said.  Barzee pleaded guilty to kidnapping Smart and helping keep her captive for nine months before then-teenager was found and rescued.  Ms Smart, now 30, said in a statement she was \u0026ldquosurprised and disappointed to learn that Barzee will be freed next week.  She said she is exploring her options and plans to speak publicly in the coming days.  \u0026ldquoIt is incomprehensible how someone who has not cooperated with her mental health evaluations or risk assessments and someone who did not show up to her own parole hearing can be released into our community, Ms Smart said.  The board said previously Barzee would be released in January 2024 after it denied her an early parole following a hearing that she chose not to attend.  At that June hearing, the board said that Barzee had refused to take a psychological exam.  At the same hearing, her lawyer questioned the calculation of her release date, which led the Utah board to look into it.  Lawyer Scott Williams said he appreciates that the board reviewed it and agreed with his assessment.  Mr Williams said he is not concerned about Barzee being a danger to the community, but declined to say why he believes that.  He has said Barzee has been diagnosed with several mental illnesses.  Ms Smart said in an Instagram post after the hearing that she is not a vindictive person but was worried about Barzee\u0026rsquos release after learning she was still carrying a manuscript containing revelations that accomplice Brian David Mitchell said he received from God telling him to kidnap Ms Smart.  She said the manuscript also contains other \u0026ldquodisturbing and dangerous ideas.  She did not say how she knows Barzee has the book.  Ms Smart\u0026rsquos abduction from her bedroom at knifepoint by a man who came in through an open kitchen window triggered waves of fear around the country.  Ms Smart was found while walking with Barzee and Mitchell on a street in the suburb of Sandy, Utah, by people who recognised the couple from media reports.  Mitchell is serving a life sentence after being convicted of kidnapping and raping Ms Smart.  He and Barzee were married at one point.  Barzee was sent to the Utah state prison in April 2016 after finishing a federal sentence in Texas.  Ms Smart, now married with two children, has written a book about the ordeal and helped make a Lifetime movie and documentary.  She is now a child safety activist who regularly gives speeches.  She said in her statement she appreciates the support she is receiving and vowed to work to address the issue of Barzee\u0026rsquos release so the same thing does not happen again.  Barzee will be under federal supervision for five years."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8670865.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"cracking-contraption-gromit-right-trousers-project-under-way","story":"  Like the \u0026ldquowrong trousers featured in the famous Aardman animation, the wearable walking and standing aids will provide support and extra strength.  Unlike the pair worn by the hapless Wallace, they will \u0026ndash hopefully \u0026ndash be kept safely under control.  Numerous technologies have gone into the \u0026pound2 million project funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council , including smart electronics, graphene, and artificial muscles.  Within 10 years, the scientists hope to produce a pair of lightweight \u0026ldquopower trousers that can boost the strength of weakening muscles and joints by 5% to 10%.  Lead researcher Jonathan Rossiter, Professor of Robotics at the University of Bristol, said: \u0026ldquoOur dream is to make our devices ubiquitous. In six or seven years time you could go into Boots, select your trousers, try them on, and take them home. They will be safe and will help you move around.  He did, however, half seriously acknowledge the danger of \u0026ldquointernet of things hackers turning the madcap plot from Wallace and Gromit into reality.  \u0026ldquoOf course there is the question of what happens if someone hijacks your trousers, said Prof Rossiter. \u0026ldquoLet\u0026rsquos hope we can overcome that.  An estimated 10 million people in the UK have mobility problems, and 1.2 million require mobility assistance following a stroke.  The \u0026ldquoright trousers concept emerged from a brain-storming session in a hotel and feedback from focus groups made up of members of the public.  What people said they wanted was \u0026ldquomagic trousers that were easy to put on and use and comfortable to wear.  A range of \u0026ldquotrouser technologies were demonstrated at the British Science Festival taking place at the University of Hull.  They included a pneumatic device based on air-filled bubbles designed to push a seated person up into a standing position.  One of the oddest inventions was a way to drop a pair of trousers at the touch of a button and prevent accidents when trying to get to the toilet.  \u0026ldquoYou go from size eight to size 10 and your trousers fall down, said Prof Rossiter.  A more advanced concept was an electrically powered artificial \u0026ldquoorigami muscle that could be seen twitching spasmodically in a glass case.\u0026nbspFor commercial reasons, the team refused to say how it works.  Other innovations included graphene knee supports and electrical skin patches.  Professor Rossiter said: \u0026ldquoPeople are living longer, and as the world faces an ageing population it is desirable that we are kept as active and independent for as long as possible.  \u0026ldquoThe \u0026lsquoright trousers\u0026rsquo is a pioneering project which will eventually enable people with mobility impairments, disabilities and age-related weaknesses to live independently and with dignity.  The team is now bidding to work with a leading prosthetics company and has submitted a new funding request to the EPSRC.  Prof Rossiter said: \u0026ldquoSo far our trousers have cost about \u0026pound2 million. That\u0026rsquos quite an expensive pair of trousers, but the technologies have wide applications.  The global market for actuator technology alone was worth an estimated\u0026nbsp\u0026pound40 billion, he pointed out."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/7870455.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scottish-independence-movement-in-great-health-as-snp-continues-to-build-fresh-case","story":"  He also said his party is continuing to \"build the fresh case for an independent Scotland.\"  Around 500 SNP members met in Edinburgh on Sunday at a policy development forum to debate a new economic blueprint for independence.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But if Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"face-to-face-with-philip-long-the-director-of-the-new-va-dundee-on-building-the-citys-future","story":"  And what an institution. The V\u0026ampA Dundee, as well as being a show-stopping piece of architecture courtesy of the Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, is also a keynote building in the future of the city in which it is based, part of Dundee\u0026rsquos long-term plans for the waterfront .  As a result, it\u0026rsquos difficult to imagine a building in Scotland that will open with more hype, hope and razzmatazz.  \u0026ldquoThe opening of the V\u0026ampA Dundee is a big moment, agrees Long. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a big moment for the institution, but it\u0026rsquos a big moment in the life of Dundee. And I get a sense that there\u0026rsquos excitement about the project much further afield than that. So, we want to make sure that it\u0026rsquos celebrated in a pretty spectacular way.  Over and above the celebrations that will accompany the opening , the museum is also tasked with creating an economic uplift for the city, in effect Dundee\u0026rsquos very own \u0026ldquoBilbao effect. No small task in a city that has been hit in recent decades by all the typical problems blighting post-industrial cities.  When we speak the opening is still a few weeks away. Long is sitting in a Portakabin across from the museum\u0026rsquos staff entrance, discussing the past, present and future of this project. When he first came to Dundee in 2011 the city\u0026rsquos waterfront had a long way to go. Where we are sitting, he points out, was the site of the city\u0026rsquos brutalist swimming pool. He used to go himself and be \u0026ldquohorrified and exhilarated by the fumes, he says.  All change. Across the way the museum remains sealed off from prying eyes but the fit-out is complete, the installation of the exhibitions and displays very advanced and the restaurant and caf\u0026eacute ready to go. It\u0026rsquos a Thursday in mid-August. \u0026ldquoOn Monday we have all our visitor assistants starting. That is exciting, says Long.  \u0026ldquoAbout two years we sat down as a team and said what needs to be achieved by the opening day and worked back from that to see exactly what needed to happen in relation to everything else that needed to be done and who needed to do it. And we are on track with that plan.  As you would expect, Long is an articulate spokesman for his museum. Married with two boys, he\u0026rsquos a young-looking 52, who\u0026rsquos been working on this project since 2011. \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom a little greyer than I was seven years ago, he says. \u0026ldquoI need a haircut. But I\u0026rsquove been busy.  Well, indeed. The construction of the museum has been a huge financial and technical challenge. Kengo Kuma\u0026rsquos original plans had to be reined in when the tenders for the building came in much higher than expected almost double the original \u0026pound45m. And though more money was found for its construction  it still proved a complex and testing build.  Not that Long was ever in any doubt that it would be completed. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos been developed in quite a small city, comparatively, in difficult years of political complexity and economic uncertainty. And I think the prospect of a new V\u0026ampA here was such an exciting prospect that I never thought it wasn\u0026rsquot going to happen.  Now it is on his shoulders to make it a success, of course. Is he ready for the challenge? The size of it is certainly clear to him.  \u0026ldquoPreviously, I was a curator at the National Galleries of Scotland with a responsibility for managing elements of that. But I think there is not much that can prepare anybody for the scale of this project, he admits  But that, adds Long, is also the thrill of it. \u0026ldquoTo have the responsibility to develop a new design institution in Scotland that will take very seriously its role to help people understand why design is important, that is going to look at the amazing design creativity of this country, that can bring international exhibitions to Scotland in that wonderful building, and be part of the V\u0026ampA family, then that is an amazing prospect.  The question might be what does that all entail? Or, to put it more bluntly, what does a director do? He breaks his answer into pre and post opening. \u0026ldquoThe responsibility of the director during the development phase is to develop a sense of ambition and vision for the project. What is it? What is it going to be?  And, having done so, he adds, get that vision across to the people working on the building, its stakeholders and the general public.  His job will now change, Long says. \u0026ldquoThe role will be to make sure that it does fulfil those ambitions and its intention to be an institution that helps make people understand why design is important in all our lives is fulfilled, that it creates opportunities to get more people involved, and that it makes a contribution not just to Dundee but to the country more widely.  What he wants is a building that is welcoming to everyone in Dundee. \u0026ldquoMuseums can be intimidating places or seen as places for an elite. We have developed V\u0026ampA Dundee to challenge that.  In what way? Outreach programmes, talks, forming young people\u0026rsquos groups, he explains. \u0026ldquoWe have engaged with over 100,000 people since 2012 and many of those are here in Dundee.  In a parallel universe Long could have been exhibiting in the museum rather than running it. Or even building the thing.  \u0026ldquoI almost became an architect when I was at school. I had a place to do architecture so maybe doing V\u0026ampA Dundee is fulfilling some of these early ambitions, he says.  Having grown up in Edinburgh\u0026nbspLong actually studied sculpture at art school. \u0026ldquoI trained as an artist, but I very quickly became interested in museums and galleries and how they could make a difference to people.  After studying in England, he returned to Scotland where he worked for the Fine Art Society in Glasgow, before getting a job as a junior curator at the National Galleries of Scotland. He then worked his way up to a senior position.  \u0026ldquoI had a chance to create exhibitions and work with artists and get involved in some major projects, like the development of the former Dean orphanage into the Dean Gallery, now Modern Two. I also looked after the development of Charles Jencks\u0026rsquos Landform and I worked on the development of the Artist Rooms project specifically so it could be shared across the country.  The V\u0026ampA Dundee is of a different order, it must be said. Because there is so much riding on it. But Long reckons it will deliver because the city wants it to. Needs it to, even.  \u0026ldquoWhen I came here what I sensed was there was a real enthusiasm and energy for making a change. But in terms of the physicality of the city there was much to be done on that. The V\u0026ampA Dundee is a complete new development contributing to the economic future of the city.  \u0026ldquoBut what I\u0026rsquove also seen is a sort of change in energy and sense of being able to get things done. Dundee applied to be UK City of Culture. It lost to Hull. It came a very close second, but it didn\u0026rsquot sit back and commiserate.

The job becomes vacant in mid-December, when David Dimbleby hangs up his colourful tie collection and ends 25 years of pointing at slightly discombobulated audience members while attempting to describe their clothes or hairstyles without causing offence.\u0026nbsp  But first he will be in his usual centre stage spot, when Question Time rolls into the Scottish Parliament debating chamber next month, for a programme that will form part of the Festival of Politics.  The October 11 programme is likely to be the last chance for Scots to see a master chairman at work before a new, fresh-faced presenter takes over.\u0026nbsp  According to the bookies, that will probably be Wark, frontrunner among a Who\u0026rsquos Who of broadcasters linked to a role said to earn Dimbleby around \u0026pound450,000 a year.\u0026nbsp  Challenging the 62-year-old Scot is fellow Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis, BBC News Channel Newswatch host Samira Ahmed, daytime presenter Victoria Derbyshire, Channel 4 anchorman Krishnan Guru-Murthy and ex-Newsnight host Jeremy Paxman.\u0026nbsp  Read more:\u0026nbspKirsty Wark and BBC colleagues call for \"urgent solutions\" over gender pay gap  So, what are Glasgow-based Wark\u0026rsquos chances?

That, says former Scottish first minister Jack McConnell,\u0026nbsp  now Lord McConnell of Glenscorrodale, has contributed to the programme losing its way.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos deliberately moved away from a programme that expands the knowledge of the viewer, to one that has attempted to be an entertainment show in which people shout at each other.  In an age when too many media interviews are carefully controlled to produce a line for news, Question Time could play an important role. Instead, it produces zero public benefit in that context.  While reluctant to discuss his friend\u0026rsquos potential role on the programme, his vision of the next presenter is not a million miles away from Wark.  He says: \u0026ldquoThe role needs someone who has authority, who is well-researched and doesn\u0026rsquot rely on research done by a team behind the scenes.

In April, then social security minister Jeane Freeman added: \u0026ldquoThe new Social Security Scotland service will have a presence in every local authority area.  However, despite the new agency due to deliver its first benefit this week, it has offices in just two councils - its HQ in Dundee and an administrative office in Glasgow.  The figures emerged in a parliamentary written answer from Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville.  She said: \u0026ldquoSocial Security Scotland have been meeting regularly with council representatives to identify suitable opportunities for co-location ahead of local delivery services becoming fully operational. To date, offices in two local authority areas have been acquired, these being the interim Headquarters for Social Security Scotland in Dundee and an interim administrative office in Glasgow.  Ministers have not published a firm timetable for opening high street offices, but the phased roll-out of new devolved benefits means they will be vital by next summer.  However the Scottish Tories claimed the government was falling behind on a key pledge. \u0026nbsp  Tory MSP Michelle Ballantyne said: \u0026ldquoAfter years and years of complaining from the sidelines about welfare reform, the SNP is about to discover just how difficult it is to create a fair and affordable social security system.  \u0026ldquoEarlier this year, it stated every local authority area would have a local presence when it comes to new social security powers. Yet just two of Scotland\u0026rsquos 32 councils have this.  \u0026ldquoThe SNP\u0026rsquos narrative on much-needed welfare reform may have served a certain political purpose for the nationalists. But now ministers have to get on with delivering these payments, and it appears it has got off to a poor start.  Social Security Scotland is due to start its work delivering benefits today, with letters going out to around 75,000 telling them of a new automatic benefit worth \u0026pound221.  The twice-yearly Carers\u0026rsquo Allowance Supplement, which is worth an extra \u0026pound8.50 a week  on top of the UK maximum of \u0026pound64.60, will be backdated to April.  The supplement, will be worth more than \u0026pound30m a year to carers in receipt of DWP Carer\u0026rsquos Allowance on the qualifying date of April 16.  The vast majority of payments are due to be made this month, with the rest in October.  Ms\u0026nbspSomerville, said:\u0026nbsp\"From this week carers across Scotland start getting more money in their pockets as the first payments from Social Security Scotland \u0026ndash Carer\u0026rsquos Allowance Supplement - starts to be paid.\u0026nbsp  \u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoOver the course of this month in excess of 75,000 carers will receive this first additional payment to Carers Allowance of \u0026pound221 to be followed by another payment in December and every six months thereafter.  \"This is an increase of 13% and an investment of over \u0026pound30 million in our carers.

She told the trade union gathering in Manchester that, two years on, nothing had been done to stop Universal Credit cuts, tackle zero hours contracts, build enough council homes or improve wages.  \"We have a hear-nothing, see-nothing, do-nothing government, declared Ms O\u0026rsquoGrady. \"Working people deserve a better government than this one.\"  She called on Mrs May to stand down if she could not deliver a Brexit deal that protected jobs and rights and properly fund public services.  \"If you won\u0027t give us the new deal that working people demand Mrs May, stand down and take your do-nothing government with you. Give us a general election and we\u0027ll do everything in our power to elect a new prime minister who will.\"  Ms O\u0027Grady also accused Boris Johnson of \"dog-whistle racism\" over his recent controversial comments about burkas.  The TUC chief won loud applause from delegates when she said: \"A woman who wears a niqab or a burka is still our sister. We defend the right of Muslim women, and all women, to wear whatever they want.\"  Meanwhile at the Manchester conference, Gail Cartmail, the Assistant General Secretary of Unite, called for those individuals involved in the collapse of construction giant Carillion to face an immediate criminal investigation.  The public service union lead said the Insolvency Service was only just starting to investigate if laws were broken, eight months after the company went out of business.  \"This is simply too little too late, declared Ms Cartmail. \"There must be an immediate criminal investigation into Carillion and we the trade union movement must lead that call. If no laws were broken, then we need, better, stronger laws.\"  She said thousands of workers and apprentices were \"dumped without warning\" when Carillion collapsed.  \"The Government and other organisations are treating Carillion\u0027s collapse as business as normal. There is nothing normal about the biggest corporate collapse in the UK\u0027s history.  \"While thousands of workers have been thrown on the scrapheap, those responsible for driving the company into the ditch have dusted themselves off and started again as if nothing had happened.  \"If nothing criminal occurred, then we should be told how on earth it can be legal to have embarked on the policies pursued by Carillion\u0027s management team which drove it to the wall with little prior warning,\" she said.  Ms Cartmail questioned why a company losing millions of pounds was shown to be making a profit on paper.  \"I am advised not to say this was cooking the books, so I won\u0027t,\" she added.  Dave Prentis, the General Secretary of Unison, attacked the privatisation of public services, saying: \"While Grenfell will forever be associated with neglect, Carillion will forever be associated with greed.\"  The conference called for an independent inquiry into the collapse of Carillion, and into privatisation of public services.  Mr Prentis told the conference: \"Privatisation is all about taking from the needy and giving to the greedy. It\u0027s the pinnacle of vulture capitalism that leaves chaos, waste and human tragedy in its wake.  \"Thirty miles from here lies an unfinished hospital, the Royal Liverpool. A \u0026pound300 million building site abandoned by Carillion, as the company crumbled to dust. Carillion was a private company lauded by successive governments, deemed too big to fail.  \"But its collapse left workers unpaid and apprentices sacked. Thousands of workers left worried about whether they still had jobs, their security wiped out overnight as their future came crashing down.  \"The collapse of Carillion symbolises the failed dogma of privatisation.

Now, the historic church is a thriving 21st century community of people from across the globe that will mark its 375th anniversary this month.  Rev Derek Lawson, who has been based at the church since 2016, said: \u0026ldquoOn Sunday morning I look out on a congregation of around 30 nationalities. We\u0026rsquove changed dramatically.  \u0026ldquoOriginally we were primarily Scottish, but today we are about 30 per cent British, 30 per cent Dutch.  \u0026ldquoHistorically we\u0026rsquove had a lot of Americans and Canadians but now also people from Asia and Africa.  \u0026ldquoThe English Language is the common denominator \u0026ndash it may be their second, third or even fourth language.  A string of events will take place this week to mark the anniversary, culminating in a special service on Sunday which will include a sermon from the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, Rt Rev Susan Brown.  Mr Lawson, who spent many years as the minister of Redgorton and Stanley near Perth, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore celebrating the past but also looking to the future.  In the early part of the 17th century, Rotterdam was gaining importance as a port and the number of Scottish merchants and workers was increasing, resulting in calls for the city magistrates to be allowed to found a Scottish congregation in the city.  The petition was granted and the magistrates secured the use of a warehouse in Wijnstraat, while the Presbytery of Edinburgh appointed the Rev Alexander Petrie, from Perthshire, as the kirk\u0026rsquos first minister.  As the church grew, it established a school and a poor house in the city and in 1694, its congregation was recorded as more than 1000.  A year later, in 1695, foundation stones were brought over from Scotland and the first church building was erected in the heart of the city.  This church remained in use until the Second World War, which proved to be a difficult time for the congregation due to the 1940 Rotterdam blitz.  \u0026ldquoThere was virtually no contact with Scotland during the Second World War, Mr Lawson explained.  \u0026ldquoAfter a bomb destroyed the building in 1940 there was a real risk that it would not continue.  However, through the efforts of the congregation, and with financial support from Rotterdam merchants, by 1952 the then Moderator Rt Rev Johnstone Jeffrey visited the church to dedicate a new building, which is still used today.  From there it has gone from strength to strength and now boasts a diverse and growing congregation, with continued links to the Church of Scotland, as well as the Dutch Reformed Church.  In 1996, it changed its name to the The Scots International Church Rotterdam in order to reflect the changes it has gone through.  Rev John Russell, who is the Presbytery Clerk of Dunkeld and Meigle in Perthshire, was minister of the Scots International Kirk from 1963 until 1972 and will also attend the anniversary service.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe loved our time here.  \u0026ldquoThe Manse was our first home - we arrived on a cold winter\u0026rsquos night to a warm welcome 13 days after marriage.  \u0026ldquoWhen I was appointed in 1963 I was given the task to reach out to the large English-speaking population drawn from Britain, the Commonwealth and the United States and many other nationalities living throughout South Holland.  \u0026ldquoIn my ministry this outreach was carried out and the congregation became truly multinational, a tradition that has continued throughout successive ministries.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very pleased to be going back \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos very kind of the church to invite us.  \u0026ldquoOne of our sons who was born in the manse, is coming back too.  Right Rev Susan Brown said: \u0026ldquoHaving family links with the Netherlands, it is wonderful to be able to celebrate with the congregation of the Scots International Church Rotterdam on this special anniversary.  \u0026ldquoIt is a congregation which, over the years, has continually reviewed and renewed its role and vision and as such offers vibrant testimony to the faith that undergirds all it does.  \u0026ldquoMay they continue to be a blessing to all who walk in through their doors \u0026ndash people of all nationalities!  The anniversary service, which takes place at 10.30am on Sunday, will feature performances from music groups within the congregation, as well as a short pageant presented by the children of the church congregation.  Church members will then host an international lunch, featuring food from 30 different countries.  A short service of praise will then be held, led by Rev Lawson, involving the church\u0026rsquos youth group and young adult members.  A total of 16 churches of Scotland are based overseas spread across thirteen countries."},{"url":null,"title":"dementia-cure-not-an-unrealistic-goal-top-researcher-says","story":"  Professor Bart De Strooper, a world-renowned Belgian neuroscientist, became director of the \u0026pound250 million Dementia Research Institute  in 2016, and said there could be a \"standard toolbox\" for treating patients within a decade.

Mr Barnier\u0026rsquos unexpectedly upbeat tone came at a conference in Slovenia, where he said: \u0026ldquoIf we are realistic, we are able to reach an agreement on the first stage of this negotiation - which is the Brexit treaty - within six or eight weeks.  \"The treaty is clear: we have two years to reach an agreement before they leave... in March 2019.  \"That means, taking into account the time necessary for the ratification process - the House of Commons on one side, the European Parliament and Council on the other side - we must reach an agreement before the beginning of November it\u0026rsquos possible.

The chief negotiator also stressed how both sides were \u0026ldquonot far from agreement with some 80 to 85 per cent of issues already resolved.

SFA president Alan McRae said: \u0026ldquoToday\u0026rsquos announcement has been the conclusion of a four-year process to review our national stadium beyond 2020.  \u0026ldquoIt was a hugely difficult decision and I would like to place on record our thanks to Scottish Rugby for their professionalism throughout the process.  \u0026ldquoThey made a truly compelling case to move to Edinburgh and gave us a very difficult decision to make. I would like to pay tribute to the inspiration, energy and hard work of Scottish Rugby chief executive, Mark Dodson, and his chief operating officer, Dominic McKay \u0026ndash both are true leaders in Scottish sport.  \u0026ldquoThis decision is about what was best for Scottish football and our members. It is about the future of football in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoI would also like to thank everyone who has been part of this process and to recognise the enormous generosity of Lord Haughey.  \u0026ldquoFinally, it has also been a hugely challenging time for Queen\u0026rsquos Park, Hampden Park Limited and all of the people who will be directly affected by this decision. We appreciate all their efforts to reach an agreement today and look forward to working with them to shape the future and continue to develop a national stadium that we can all be proud of.  SFA chief executive Ian Maxwell said: \u0026ldquoI would first of all like to offer my thanks to Dominic McKay and his team at Scottish Rugby. They have been impressive throughout the process and I would like to continue to build that relationship. There is a lot we can learn from each other.  \u0026ldquoToday is a big day for Scottish football. Hampden Park has been the spiritual home of Scottish football for over 100 years it has been central to our sport\u0026rsquos identity in this country. But today\u0026rsquos decision is about the future, not the past.  \u0026ldquoOur mission is to inspire a nation to love the game and having a home that we can call our own is an important part of that. It will enable us to drive investment into the game and give us the best chance to improve football in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoWhile we are now committed to Hampden Park we also recognise that it needs to change. We have heard the fans\u0026rsquo views throughout the process and agree with them that we need to improve access, transport links and the overall experience. We are committed to doing that.  \u0026ldquoWith all the commitments that have been made to the Scottish FA and Hampden Park Limited throughout this process, taking ownership of the Hampden Park site will create the potential to transform the home of Scottish football for the benefit of Scottish football fans. Ownership really will change the game. We look forward to working with all interested parties to achieve an exciting and fan-friendly vision for Hampden Park.  \u0026ldquoWith that in mind, we need all of Scotland to pull together to make it Scotland\u0026rsquos national stadium. We have heard many voice their support for the stadium. We need collective action, driven by the Scottish FA, to ensure it remains the beating heart of Scottish football."},{"url":null,"title":"ineos-in-60m-grangemouth-expansion","story":"  An extra furnace will be built on its ethylene plant at the site in Scotland.

Mr Cortes has written to the Train Operating Companies, including ScotRail, and to Network Rail seeking assurances they will not support Mr Grayling\u0027s move to impose pay rises which fell below the normal Retail Price Index, which, he argued, would be an effective pay cut.  Noting how morale among overworked rail staff was low, the union chief said they were furious with the Secretary of State\u0026rsquos plan.  \u0026ldquoUnless he backs off or, better still, is booted out, industrial action including strikes this coming winter loom large, declared Mr Cortes.  He said the TSSA union would seek support from Congress to send a message to \u0026ldquothis dysfunctional Tory government, that if they try to take on rail workers, the full weight of the Trades Union movement will be behind them as they bring our railways to a halt this winter to hold Chris Grayling and this lamentable government to account\".  Mr McDonnell, whose keynote speech to Congress pledged to give workers in the gig economy the same rights as other employees, including sick pay and parental leave, said he recognised there was \u0026ldquoreal anger among rail workers.  Asked if industrial action was something he would support, the Shadow Chancellor replied: \u0026ldquoWe will see what industrial action takes place. I\u0026rsquom hoping there will be negotiated settlements. But don\u0026rsquot underestimate the depth of anger among railway workers at the moment.  \u0026ldquoIf there are ballots for industrial action and the management aren\u0026rsquot responding accordingly, I will be on the picket lines with the workers themselves.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe management in these individual companies now need to start waking up about just...what\u0026rsquos happened with railway workers\u0027 standard of living and how they feel their professionalism has been undermined.  Meanwhile, TSSA said it had notified ScotRail of a ballot of its members for industrial action in a dispute over payments for rest-day working.  The union said its members were seeking parity with ScotRail drivers, who currently received a payout of \u0026pound300 for every rest-day they worked, which it noted was significantly more than TSSA members.  Mr Cortes said: \u0026ldquoRest-day working payments are paid to staff to compensate them for giving up a day\u0026rsquos rest to keep our railway running. Our railways need more than train drivers to run. Our members in ScotRail keep trains running safely from the control room and they also make sure that passengers are safe and informed. ScotRail are treating our members as second class citizens...We aren\u0027t asking for the world, all we are seeking is parity.  The union leader noted how, without the goodwill of ScotRail staff working on rest-days, then the company would \u0026ldquofind their trains idling at the platforms because they can\u0026rsquot run them without our members authorising their departures.  Mr Cortes made clear the TSSA\u0026rsquos door was open to talks with ScotRail management but added: \u0026ldquoOur members won\u0026rsquot be putting up with second class payments for first class work any longer."},{"url":null,"title":"john-mcdonnell-dismisses-claims-hard-left-activists-infiltrating-labour-to-oust-mps-critical-of-jeremy-corbyn","story":"  The Shadow Chancellor\u0026rsquos rejection came after the Labour leader refused to intervene to prevent local activists targeting his internal party critics.

The action against the MP, who took the Kent city seat at the 2017 election with a majority of just 187 - after 99 years as a Tory stronghold - was later dismissed following an outcry from fellow MPs.

Around 70 representatives from businesses in the east of Aberdeenshire attended the agri-tourism event at Fyvie Castle, where delegates had the opportunity to hear from speakers about current industry trends and network with tourism businesses locally.                                                    In Aberdeenshire, 65% of the population is based rurally – which highlights the wealth of opportunity that exists to continue to build, expand and be entrepreneurial with rural links, to continue to attract visitors to our part of Scotland. Nationally, the value of domestic visitor spend in rural areas amounts to £633 million and equates to 2.6 million domestic trips.                                                    Chris Greenwood, VisitScotland’s Senior Tourism Insights Manager, spoke to delegates about agricultural and rural tourism insights and the impacts and benefits for Aberdeenshire and Chris Foy, Chief Executive at VisitAberdeenshire presented the new destination strategy for Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, detailing how they hope to grow visitor spend to £1 billion per year by 2023.        A new plan to develop food and drink tourism in Scotland – aiming to deliver an additional £1 billion to Scotland’s economy by 2030 – was recently launched by Nicola Sturgeon. At the event, Peter Cook, Director of Food, Drink and Agriculture at Opportunity North East, updated those attending about Opportunity North East’s work within that sector.Jo Robinson, VisitScotland Regional Director, said: “I am delighted that representatives from so many businesses in East Aberdeenshire attended this event, which hopefully gave them real food for thought on the subject of rural tourism.“This region has tremendous assets and strengths that offer visitors a range of great experiences – from food and drink to farm shops, coasts to castles and woods to wigwams. VisitScotland helps to promote these strengths to a global audience.“With 21% of domestic visitor trips being to rural areas and 22% of domestic visitor spend being in rural areas, capitalising on these visitors is so important. Hopefully events like this can help rural businesses to make the most of these opportunities.”                                                                                                        Gillian Martin, Aberdeenshire East MSP, said: “We have one of the most diverse regions in Scotland with an abundance of historical and cultural significance and interest.

The campaign is being fronted by ordinary Scots, like Gordon Hutchinson who underwent a life-saving transplant, aged just 13.      \t         “I called and was told I needed to get down to Edinburgh right away.”It was a call Nick had waited two and a half years to receive. He was born with a kidney condition that meant neither of his organs worked properly.                                                                                                         He underwent surgery at 18 months old and then went for regular checkups to monitor how his kidneys were functioning.  At a routine appointment in October 2014, doctors delivered the news that his kidneys were failing and Nick started dialysis shortly after.He said: “I’d lived with the condition all my life so hearing that I’d need treatment was a shock. “The doctor told me I’d be lucky to make it to Christmas without being on dialysis but I held on until February 2015.                                                                                                        “By the time I went on dialysis, my kidney function had dropped to eight per cent. I thought I was okay but looking back I was constantly tired and agitated. Things were a bit of a struggle.”Nick was determined the dialysis would not take over his life and kept working throughout.He said: “I was team leader at that time for an oil company – in charge of the onshore group.“I was determined to keep on working and have as normal a life as possible but it meant doing dialysis every night after work.“I’d leave home at 7am and not get back until 10pm or 10.30pm every day                                                                                                         “Dialysis was hard. I felt like my life had been put on hold but I knew the treatment was the only thing keeping me alive. “Some days were better than others the staff at the hospital got me through some difficult times.”Despite that, Nick decided to propose to Philippa and booked the wedding at the Winter Gardens in the hope she would say yes.“I left flowers by the kettle one night – happily she said yes,” said Nick.“We’d been together for ten years and she saw me through everything.“She had to put up with an awful lot – the mood swings, not going out because I was too tired all the time – but she still said yes.”The couple got married last August and were on honeymoon when Nick got the call that would transform their lives.He said: “I was really lucky – I was only on the transplant list for two and a half years.“But I didn’t get my hopes up too much until I was taken down to theatre and knew it was going to happen.“I was building myself up for disappointment until that point. It was a really surreal experience.”Happily, the transplant went ahead and Nick woke up to a whole new life.“As soon as I woke up from surgery I instantly felt better,” he said. “Nothing could have prepared me for the difference it made.  “I’d just got married and then I got the gift that I’d waited over two years for.  “To have a life free from dialysis was the best feeling and I felt amazing. I didn’t realise how ill I’d been until I had the transplant and started to feel 100 times better. It was fantastic.”Nick, an electrician by trade, has made the most of his donor’s incredible gift – enjoying life to the full and setting up his own business.He said: “It was something I always wanted to do but would never have been able to achieve on dialysis.“I now have my own electrical business and am working all over Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.“It’s made a massive difference to Philippa and me too – we can go out and enjoy ourselves now. It’s nice to have that freedom it’s a new life basically.”As for his donor’s family, Nick has written a letter thanking them for his gift.He said: “I know nothing about the person who made my transplant possible but I owe them everything. “They saved my life and are truly my hero. I want their family to know I will be eternally grateful for this incredible gift.”Nick is already on the organ donor register and hopes his story will encourage others to sign up.He added: “It’s quite possibly the most important thing anyone can ever do.”To join the NHS Organ Donor Register, visit weneedeverybody.org                "},{"url":null,"title":"scottish tradesmen it s your call to help children","story":"        Protecting children does not just fall to the police, social workers and professionals who work with them.

/                   \t      \t\tProtecting children...in the average primary class, at least two children have suffered abuse or neglect. The NSPCC\u0027s Childline is on call 24 hours a day to help children who need help.\u0027\u0027      \t         Matt Forde, the national head of NSPCC Scotland, said: “We’re not asking people to spy on families. “But when they see something, in their heart of hearts, they know isn’t right, we’re asking them to report it so that those families can get the help they need.                                                                                                        “The online course both informs and educates about the signs of abuse and neglect and what you should do if you have a gut feeling that something is not right.“We’re not trying to turn plumbers or builders into social workers.“But they do spend a lot of time in customers’ homes and it’s not an unlikely scenario that someone in that situation might gain an insight into a child’s life.“People are often unsure whether they should report it. We would ask them to look at it from the child’s point of view – or their own child’s.                                                                                                        “The police and children’s services are not in the business of getting involved, willy-nilly, when they don’t need to.“In the vast majority of cases, children are not removed from their homes but their families do get the help and support they need.“Often, parents have their own pressures and have lost sight of their child’s needs.“They’re overwhelmed with their own difficulties and have a strong instinct against asking for help.“It’s very often a burden that is lifted when they get a chance to talk about something they have been struggling with on their own for far too long.”                                                                                                        On the flip side of that coin are children who are in imminent danger.NSPCC Scotland asks the public to call its helpline – 0808 800 5000 – or the police immediately in the worst case scenarios.Last year in Scotland, the NSPCC’s helpline referred 2012 calls and emails to local agencies such as the police or children’s services.The majority were from people who were concerned a child was being neglected  followed by concerns about physical abuse , emotional abuse  and sexual abuse .Matt said: “There has been increased traffic to our helpline.“People are often unsure whether to report something – they really struggle with it.“By calling the helpline, they can talk through their concerns and decide whether it’s something that needs to be taken forward.“Our advice would be for people to consider if it was their child in that situation – better safe, than sorry.”As the NSPCC relies on donations from the public to deliver its services in Scotland, the It’s Your Call online course does cost £19 for individual tradesmen, with package deals also available for employers.But Matt is hopeful that it will become a success.He said: “It’s very early days for the It’s Your Call training but we are hoping individuals and employers will take it up.“We are not funded by the government – we raise all our own funding – so a fee is involved to cover the cost of delivering the training. “But we hope people will agree it’s a small price to pay to help children who are potentially being abused or neglected.“It’s about helping to give children a voice when they can’t speak out themselves.”NSPCC Scotland prides itself on providing a voice for children but is also keen that young people, of all ages, are able to make their own voices heard too.The charity holds special Speak Out, Stay Safe assemblies at primary schools in every local authority area in Scotland with that aim in mind.Matt added: “We help children understand what abuse is and what to do if they are affected.“We then go back two weeks later to find out what the children made of it and reinforce the message. “Children often come to Childline when they are aged 12 and above, talking about things that have happened to them for years.“So we wanted to deliver a programme for primary schools in the hope that children would start reporting issues earlier.“Teachers have been very positive about the programme as it’s a topic they often struggle with too.” The NSPCC is the leading children’s charity fighting to end child abuse and protect children at risk in the UK and Channel Islands. Voluntary donations make up around 90 per cent of its funding.Childline open 24 hours a dayThe NSPCC’s Childline service has two bases in Scotland, in Aberdeen and Glasgow.In 2017/18, Childline volunteers delivered almost 280,000 counselling sessions to children and young people across the UK on the phone and online. Based on the population of Aberdeenshire, it is estimated that volunteers delivered around 1800 counselling sessions to children living in that area last year alone.Some of them are going through the toughest times of their lives. They face issues such as mental/emotional health, family relationships and bullying. So it’s vital that they have somewhere to turn. Childline – 0800 11 11 and www.childline.org.uk – is there for them 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.On average, a child somewhere in the UK contacts Childline every 25 seconds.NSPCC Scotland’s Speak Out Stay Safe  service, which helps children learn how to recognise abuse, has now been delivered in the majority of our mainstream primary schools.Sadly, in the average primary school class, at least two children have suffered abuse or neglect.Just £4 pays for a child’s call or contact with Childline and £3 pays for the SOSS programme to reach a child. But the NSPCC relies on donations from the public to provide its services across the UK and volunteers to help deliver them.To find out how you can help the charity or to make a donation, visit the website https:www.nspcc.org.uk/what-you-can-do.

A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classification of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in if Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English. When I gave people examples they shrugged them off as \u0026lsquoCaithness Words\u0026rsquo but it is so much more than that it is \u0026lsquoCaithness language\u0026rsquo if only we put our minds and our hearts to it.With her Norn Min series workbooks Grace Hall is spreading the Norn language both within Caithness and outside of the region as well.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Norn Min series has three workbooks published and another two in the pipeline. Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked if they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook. A week later I was contacted by the World Children\u0026rsquos Book project and they offered me a contract to translate five of their books into Norn.The World Children\u0026rsquos Book project has over 200 translators making their bilingual books available in languages traditional publishes ignore such as English Igbo in Nigeria, German/Tigrinya in Ethiopia and now English/Norn in Scotland.Copies of both the workbooks and storybooks are available at John O\u0026rsquoGroats and Caithness Horizons.\u0026nbspTuesday 11 Sep 2018 9:00 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"BT exchange gets the bird","story":"CONCERNS have been raised by an animal charity after a number of birds became strangled in roof netting in Wick.An angry reader has claimed that the birds included seagulls, crows, blackbirds and pigeons, all of which found themselves trapped on top of the BT exchange in Union Street.The netting is said to be on the building for \u0026ldquosafety reasons \u0026ndash but, as the picture the reader provided shows, it doesn\u0026rsquot appear to do much for the welfare of those trapped in it.The reader, who did not wish to be named, has said that both BT and animal protection charity the SSPCA have been contacted to see what can be done \u0026ndash \u0026ldquobut to no avail \u0026ndash and is appealing to them to do something before more bird injuries and deaths occur.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove tried calling them but nothing seems to be done, the reader said.\u0026ldquoOver the year I\u0026rsquove seen around eight birds \u0026ndash seagulls, pigeons, blackbirds and crows \u0026ndash trapped on the roof netting of the BT building on Union Street.

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Tuesday 11 Sep 2018 9:00 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the individual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash if it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him returning to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Asleifarson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being knifed in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso.

These include social work, police, education, the Scottish Children\u0026rsquos Reporter Administration and Children\u0026rsquos Hearings Scotland.No new panel member begins sitting on hearings without a thorough training being delivered beforehand. For any new Caithness trainees, the training takes place in Inverness.Panel member and trainer Christine Stone said: \u0026ldquoIt has been a great privilege to serve as a volunteer on the Children\u0026rsquos Panel for over 18 years and there are others residing within Caithness who have served for more than 20 years. Caithness Children\u0026rsquos Panel volunteers come from a wide iety of backgrounds and experiences \u0026ndash all walks of life make for a good blend.\u0026ldquoThe panel is always in need of new volunteers and, to that end, we are inviting any interested persons to our open evening, to take place at 7pm at the Children\u0026rsquos Panel Office, 23 Swanson Street, Thurso, on Tuesday, August 28. Please do consider coming along!\u0026ldquoThis is an information evening, where an overview of the voluntary work will be given, which will be followed by a question-and-answer session.\u0026ldquoThis is a great opportunity to find out more and to see if this is for you. Being a panel member is hugely rewarding \u0026ndash it is a great privilege to be able to come alongside families, young people and children in crisis and help them move forward constructively to a better future.\u0026ldquoIf you are interested in applying to become a panel member, please feel free to contact me for any further information. Also, you can check out the Children\u0026rsquos Panel website where you will find more information which should help you decide if volunteering for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel is really for you.Tuesday 11 Sep 2018 9:01 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Students get on their bikes in memory of friend","story":"THREE students got on their bikes at John O\u0026rsquoGroats earlier this week and pointed their compasses to Land\u0026rsquos End in a bid to raise awareness about mental health.Fenn Newsome, Giles Themans and Alex Hayton decided upon the marathon pedal following the death of their friend and fellow Newcastle University student, Marcus Colville.Marcus, from Exeter, had tragically taken his own life last December. He was a third-year medical student who played rugby with the cycling trio and was also a talented musician. He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the lengthy cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it. We had always seen Marcus as he was at rugby \u0026ndash a strong, witty and kind gentleman. After talking with more team-mates who have opened up and described their own experiences the horrifying statistics become relatable.The cycling trio hope to be arriving at Land\u0026rsquos End in a fortnight\u0026rsquos time and are hoping to raise \u0026pound2000 for the Marcus in Mind fundraiser set up by his family.To make a donation, visit the website on: justgiving/crowdfunding/for-marcusTuesday 11 Sep 2018 9:01 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"September 11, 2018 at 4:18 pmThe junction at Wellington Street in Kirkwall connecting with Junction Road and New Scapa Road is to remain closed overnight, tonight, Tuesday, and into tomorrow.

This has made her challenge to find a way to climb the sea stack all the more unique and has presented a series of challenges in the planning stages.She will take on the climb in aid of the Calvert Trust, which supports people with disabilities through outdoor adventure.Asked why she had picked the Old Man of Hoy, Michelle laughed: \u0026#8220Because it\u0026#8217s the biggest sea stack going. I\u0026#8217d had the idea that I wanted to climb a sea stack before I was injured. It hadn\u0026#8217t really crossed my mind that I would ever be able to climb the old man of Hoy because it is notoriously difficult. I thought one day I would get it done but then I fell and I thought it\u0026#8217d never happen.\u0026#8220A friend came to me during rehab and said I needed to start setting myself goals and challenges but all my interests were based around climbing, which I didn\u0026#8217t think I could do anymore. It felt like that was totally ruled out – how can you climb without legs?\u0026#8220But they sent me some links to some really inspirational paraplegics, who were during climbing but in an adaptive way. Ordinarilly, climbing with two legs is like puzzle solving where you pick a route and decide what will work for you and that\u0026#8217s what I used to love.\u0026#8220When climbing in an adaptive way, you don\u0026#8217t get any of that puzzle solving and when people first spoke to me about climbing in that way I thought it wasn\u0026#8217t really the same so I wouldn\u0026#8217t want to do it. For me it was never about getting to the top of something, it was about the journey and figuring stuff out.\u0026#8220Climbing something in an adaptive way uses a pulley system and you haul your weight up. I thought there was no puzzle to that \u0026#8211 how wrong I was. I\u0026#8217ve not even attempted this climb yet and it\u0026#8217s been the biggest puzzle in the world. Creating the equipment has been the biggest challenge and finding people who have the ideas to make the equipment, it\u0026#8217s a never-ending puzzle.\u0026#8221To donate or find out more about Michelle\u0026#8217s challenge visit the website www.routetothesky\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He is now communicating via email with both his work coach at JobCentre Plus, and his Fair Start Scotland Adviser. Within the 12 weeks of attending Fair Start Scotland, not only can Alan now use Microsoft Outlook, but he has completed his new CV on Microsoft Word and has been applying online for employment.In all the group workshops that Alan attends, he socialises very well with the other participants and is very cheerful. He thinks the service is going very well, and is enjoying it. Alan is very happy with the progress he has made, and has noticed the improvement in his confidence.Alan seems to be talking so much more, which may have been a barrier stopping him from getting into work.

This year the entries will be narrowed down to 15 finalists who will discuss their ideas with the judges at the finals day on November 22.Last year\u0026rsquos top prize went to former Inverness College UHI student Paul Beaulieu , from Milton, Invergordon, who took home a cash prize of \u0026pound1500 and a combined legal and accountancy package worth \u0026pound2000 for an idea that could revolutionise how pipes are fabricated and fitted together.Dr Carol Langston, head of Create, said: \"Often people have a business idea, but they don\u0026rsquot know what to do with it, or who to turn to for help. That\u0026rsquos where Create comes in. We work with people to encourage them to be ambitious, bold and creative in their thinking, with the aim of encouraging innovation.\"Former winner Anna Renouf of Orrin Equestrian, is encouraging new entrants to take part in the competition.Since winning the most innovative business idea and the best engineering and technology award in 2015, she has gone on to win \u0026pound10,000 from Scottish Edge and received a Smart Scotland feasibility grant, which has allowed her to focus on the development of her innovative saddle design.Anna said: \"The University of the Highlands and Islands Business Competition represented the start of my business journey and it really gave me the confidence to take my idea forward and develop it further.\"Even now, I regularly seek advice and guidance from the Create team about the direction of my business.

When the kirk on the shores of Lochbroom was put up for sale by the Church of Scotland back in 2016, it\u0026rsquos future looked uncertain.A determined local fundraising drive saw it eventually taken into community ownership by locals who see it as a key hub in the beautiful, remote area.Celia said: \"We saw how well Donnie Mackenzie\u0026rsquos fundraiser for Clachan did and the huge boost it gave everyone involved. Sara and I thought we would enjoy getting fitter, seeing more of our country, and help Clachan at the same time. Since our local Trust became owners on June 22 we straightaway saw the difference it has made to our community. It has become a community focus right from the start.\"With the doors open more often we know there\u0026rsquos someone there and stop for a chat. For those of us living on the no-through road on the west shore of Loch Broom, we pass Clachan every time we go anywhere so it is ideal.\"\"When Clachan opened during the Lochbroom Sheepdog Trials, the trust displayed some local produce, from handloom weaving, cards, honey, handmade books and paintings, to show the range of economic activity in Lochbroom. That is the tip of the iceberg. There\u0026rsquos only a small population but there\u0026rsquos a huge number of people producing high-quality goods \u0026ndash having their work displayed in a public building helps everybody.\"Sara and I are confident that Clachan will be an asset to the Lochbroom community for many years to come so we are asking for sponsorship. This can be done at the New Broom hub in Ullapool and by emailing me at celiajcharity@me. Thank you.\"Kenneth Macleod, an interim trustee of Clachan Lochbroom Heritage Trust, said: \"I have seen the benefit that grows from rescuing a building, improving it and making it available for wider purposes. Of course Clachan continues for the usual church occasions \u0026ndash we want everyone to know that! \u0026ndash whilst extending its usefulness for other appropriate purposes.\"Tuesday 11 Sep 2018 9:01 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Today is the 45th anniversary of the coup against the democratically elected government of Salvador Allende in Chile.                British-made Hawker Hunter jets strafed the presidential palace as the army issued an ultimatum to either resign or surrender. Allende did neither and died in the office to which he was elected, shot by troops of the army of which he was head.             In the following days, then years, terror reigned in Chile. The national football stadium was filled with political prisoners, including Victor Jara whose last words were smuggled out from the stadium after his brutal execution in front of his fellow prisoners. Those citizens now living in Scotland will remember his last lines “how hard it is to sing when I must sing of horror, horror of which I am living, horror of which I am dying”.             The caravan of death which traversed Latin America using techniques taught by the CIA left Estadio Chile and travelled throughout Latin America torturing, killing and disappearing people without mercy.Coming here clandestinely as refugees from a war they did not seek or want, the Chilean citizens were welcomed to their new homes by citizens here. People like the Leal family received support from the National Union of Mineworkers, which made them feel welcome and diluted a hurt that is still felt especially today. Citizens here organised the Chile Solidarity Campaign to bring attention to the coup and to support the Chilean diaspora seeking refuge here. Christy Moore did a benefit concert at Leith town hall. Homes were found and lives rebuilt. When the SFA decided that the Scottish football national side would be the first team to play in Estadio Chile following its use as a detention and torture centre, there were citizens who protested outside the SFA HQ at Park Gardens, disgusted by the move.READ MORE: The Scotland v Chile friendly labelled the ‘match of shame’            The writer Ariel Dorfman dedicated his essay ‘The incredible unending trial of General August Pinochet’ to not just more than 4,000 killed in Chile – of which 1,002 have no date of death inscribed on the memorial wall in Cemetario General Santiago – but also to the hundreds of thousands tortured and who are not remembered on the wall. The memorial wall was created with a large empty space in the knowledge that names would be added and continue to be added as families of the disappeared slowly find out what happened to those taken from them. Families and friends will think of everyone on this date and they are not alone. In recent years, Edinburgh has held a ceilidh in memory of Victor Jara – where the guest of honour was his widow Joan Jara – to raise funds for the foundation in his name in Chile.             On the 40th anniversary of the coup, a vigil was held outside the Scottish Parliament. I hosted a night for Chilean poet and politician Pablo Neruda in Edinburgh City Chambers where the poets Ron Butlin, Michael Pedersen, Liz Lochhead, Colin Bartie, the actress Dolina McLennan and the musician William Douglas movingly interpreted his work and paid tribute to him and Victor Jara. There are citizens in Scotland who will remember the other September 11th as they directly experienced it and cannot forget. There are citizens in this country who will remember the other September 11th as they expressed and gave solidarity to those who fled terror and torture in Chile. We hope you too will remember the other September 11th.Gordon Munro is Labour councillor for Leith on Edinburgh City Council "},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4798009.1536663306!/image/image.jpg","title":"michael russell to update holyrood on scottish government brexit preparations","story":"        Constitutional Affairs Minister Michael Russell is to update MSPs on the Scottish Government\u0027s Brexit preparations.

The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the life of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27461  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nHundreds of people took part in a commemoration in Tyrone yesterday to mark the 50th anniversary of the first civil rights march to be held in the north. \nThe march retraced the steps of the original march from Coalisland to Dungannon and was attended by Sinn Féin representatives from across the north. \nIt was led by Mid Ulster Sinn Féin MP Francie Molloy, who took part in the original march 50 years ago as a steward. \nMarchers carried replicas of the posters carried by the original march, reading \u0027One man, one vote,\u0027 \u0027Equal housing now\u0027 as well as banners referring to the Caledon housing protest which was the motivation for the march. \nContemporary posters on the threat posed to Brexit to rights were also carried by marchers. \n\nIn 1968 the original march was stopped before it reached the Square in Dungannon by the RUC because loyalist protestors staged a counter demonstration. \nThis time, however, the march reached its destination where speeches were made by Francie Molloy, local MLA Colm Gildernew and Fermanagh/South Tyrone MP Michelle Gildernew. \nThe main speaker of the march was veteran republican and civil rights activist Mictchel McLaughlin. \nIn his speech, the former Assembly Speaker said tat much has changed in the last five decades and that we are on the verge of a major shift towards Irish unity. \n\"The Orange state is now gone and we now have a peaceful and democratic way forward. \n“This is a very different place than it was in 1968 and I am convinced that we are now on the verge of another seismic shift towards a new, agreed and united Ireland that will provide a prosperous and shared future for all our citizens,\" he said. \n\nBut Mr McLaughlin also warned that our rights are still under threat today from Brexit and the right wing alliance between the Tories and the DUP. \n“My deep concern is that there are still people who want to deny rights and equality to their fellow citizens today. \n\"People in the north still face attacks on their electoral and civil rights, alongside the continued denial of rights to LGBTQ couples, women, Irish language speakers, and bereaved families seeking a coroner’s inquest.\n“Today, we are experiencing an unacceptable blockade on rights, imposed by the DUP and facilitated by the British government.\n“Rights are also under threat by a right-wing Tory Brexit and there are unwelcome echoes of gerrymandering and the hollowing out of democracy by the recent Boundary Commission proposals.\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago,\" he added. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27462  ","story":"Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\n“We must specifically acknowledge the damage done by the Catholic Church to the lives of many women and children in the mother and baby homes, the Magdalene Laundries and a succession of abuse scandals and cover ups.- Michelle O\u0026#039Neill\nThe visit to Ireland by Pope Francis this weekend is an opportunity for the Catholic church to address the ongoing legacy of abuse, Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0027Neill has said. \nMichelle O\u0027Neill made the comments ahead of the historic visit to Ireland of Pope Francis this weekend to attend the World Meeting of Families which is being held in Dublin.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north.

They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27466  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\n“The policy of this government is failing the homeless, failing those renting and those who strive to own a home.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government. This is the first real test of those words. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise. So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north. Brexit threatens many hard-won rights and protections that we in Sinn Féin will continue to fight to uphold. If the Irish government is serious about joining us in this fight, then they can allocate these two new seats to the north,\" she said. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27469  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nI am calling on the IFA to respect the rights of Palestinians by cancelling this match and sending out a strong signal that the slaughter of Palestinians in the open-air prison which is Gaza, is completely unacceptable.- Sinead Ennis\nThe Irish Football Association have come under increased pressure to cancel an international friendly with Israeli which is scheduled for Tuesday 11th, September. \nThousands of people have signed a petition set up BDS Ireland is calling on the IFA chief executive to cancel the fixture.\nSinn Féin MLA Sinéad Ennis said the IFA have made the ‘wrong decision’ by hosting the Israeli soccer team and called on them to respect the rights of the Palestinian people. \n“Over recent weeks and months, many sporting, cultural and music figures have heeded calls from the BDS movement, not to perform in Israel. \n“The Israeli government must feel the pressure of the international anger at their mass killings, human rights violations and flagrant violations of international law.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a difference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such life-changing

The Ballymoney man lost his father, Mervyn Robinson, to the\u0026#160 North West 200 in 1980, while in July his cousin, William Dunlop, was killed during free practice at the Skerries 100 near Dublin.\nAll of these setbacks forced a re-think, says Robinson. My main reason for quitting the sport was my wee boy, Max, he told Chronicle Sport.\n\u0026#8220Road racing is getting very dangerous and there have been too many accidents recently, so I\u0027m not prepared to take the chance any more.\n\u0026#8220My main fear is getting caught up in something outside of my control like, like an accident happening in front of me, or a bike seizing or something.\n\u0026#8220William\u0027s death affected me big time, to be honest I felt like packing it in immediately.\n\u0026#8220The\u0026#160 circumstances surrounding William\u0027s death were just awful. The fact he left behind a\u0026#160 young daughter and Janine [his partner] had a second baby on the way made it so horrible for us all to deal with.\n\u0026#8220I thought about it and I decided I wanted to do myself some justice and finish off the season before calling it a day.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

outside belfast to pay 17 more for gas","story":"\nTowns outside Belfast will be paying 17% more for gas prices following Firmus Energy\u0026#8217s tariff hike next month.\n\n                \nTen Town areas include Craigavon, Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Banbridge, Coleraine, Limavady, Derry/Londonderry and Newry.\n\n\n\nThis is a further blow for consumers\n\nThe Consumer Council\n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFirmus Energy is to increase gas prices by 12% in the Ten Towns area from 1 October 2018. The Consumer Council has branded the increase ‘unwelcome’ and called for more gas licence holders to enter the market so create more competition.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe council is urging the 38,000 natural gas domestic and business customers to consider ways to save on household energy bills.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAn annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in the Ten Towns areas using 12,000 kWh on a Pay As You Go meter will increase from £594 to £666, an increase of £72. Whereas the annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in the Greater Belfast area using 12,000 kWh on a Pay As You Go meter will increase from £539 to £604, an increase of £65.\n\nGas prices in Ten Towns will be around 17% more expensive than Belfast, based on SSE Airtricity’s Pay As You Go tariff.\n\n“This is a further blow for consumers following recent electricity tariff increases by the three largest electricity suppliers in Northern Ireland,” said a NI Consumer Council spokesperson.\n\nRichard Williams, Head of Energy Policy at The Consumer Council, said: “This is unwelcome news for Firmus Energy customers, following a 6.8% increase in the Ten Towns area earlier this year. However, we are aware the main driver is the significant rise in global gas costs since the tariff was last set in April. From 1 October, the annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in Ten Towns will increase by £72 a year to £666. It is the sole supplier of gas in the Ten Towns. We would like to see other gas licence holders enter the market so that consumers there can benefit from competition.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8628181.1536329418!/image/image.jpg","title":"candlelight vigil in memory of cameron truesdale","story":"\nA candlelight vigil is to be held in Waringstown tomorrow night  in memory of Cameron Truesdale.\n\n                \nThe teenager  died on Wednesday night after a 20-month battle with cancer.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe vigil will begin at 8pm in Waringstown Park, in the village near Lurgan.

After the Act of Remembrance, Bro Ward laid a wreath at the Herron family memorial plaque which was unveiled on the boundary wall of Dromore Orange Hall in April 2016 and is the only tangible memorial in Dromore to the history of the Troubles.  \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nTown draper, William Herron , his wife Elizabeth  and daughter Noeline  died in the blaze after an incendiary device was planted in their Market Square drapery store in April 1976. The fire destroyed much of the shop and the family home above it, where the three victims died from suffocation. Bro William Herron was a member of Closkelt LOL 415 in Rathfriland District LOL No 3.\n\n* A series of commemorative events also took place across Northern Ireland last weekend as the Institution marked its inaugural Orange Victims Day. The Loyal Order formally remember the 335 Orangemen and one Orangewoman murdered by terrorists during the Troubles. The day, which will become an annual event, also highlighted the ongoing plight of the injured and bereaved.\n\n\n   \n                 .

It was this love of numeracy that led Timothy to establish Maths Improvement NI, a programme to support good practice in the teaching of maths. This was disseminated throughout schools in Northern Ireland with great success.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTimothy had a love for children and had their best interests at heart. He was able to engage easily with his pupils and use his talents to help them reach their potential. His sense of humour and fun was shared and enjoyed by the children of St Mary’s. Timothy instilled in his pupils many of the values that he held dear respect, good manners, fairness, courtesy and decency, to name a few!\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nTimothy was an avid supporter of Gaelic Games. He was an enthusiastic GAA coach in St Mary’s and loved the success his teams achieved at school and county level. Alongside Clann Na Banna, he established the “Gaelic League” in 1991 and its legacy continues today. Due to his influence and encouragement, many were attracted to Gaelic games, who otherwise may not have been.\n\nTimothy left a lasting impression upon all those who made his acquaintance, in both his personal and professional life. He was a true gentleman with a kind and caring heart and had the talent of making others feel at ease. Timothy made time for everyone and was undoubtedly the ‘life and soul’ of many a school outing and staff celebration. His presence will be greatly missed. His colleagues and friends cherish fond memories of the ‘yarns’ and ‘craic’ they shared. He was an inspiration to everyone and the school feels truly blessed to have know him: ‘You will be forever in our hearts.’ \n\n“He kept at true good humour’s mark, the social flow of pleasure’s tide. He never made a brow look dark, nor caused a tear, but when he died.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8629133.1536492348!/image/image.jpg","title":"ulster and ireland rugby star rory best given freedom honour","story":"\nSome of the biggest names from the world of rugby union gathered at the Archbishop\u0026#8217s Palace in Armagh to witness Rory Best\u0026#8217s conferment with the Freedom of the Borough of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon.\n\n                \nThe lord Mayor, alderman and councillors awarded the honour to the Ulster, Ireland and Lions rugby star – only the second-ever granted - on Saturday to recognise his huge contribution to both sport and the community in the borough.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nRory Best celebrates receiving the freedom of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n The ceremony, hosted by BBC rugby commentator Jim Neilly, saw Rory accept the Freedom Scroll from the Lord Mayor and sign the Book of Honorary Burgesses.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n As well as family and friends of Rory Best and members of council, attendees included rugby stars Conor Murray, David Wallace, Mike Ross and Andrew Trimble, and a host of others.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n Dr Rory Best OBE said: “To receive the Freedom of the Borough is such a great honour, particularly as it comes from the area where I grew up, where I learned my rugby and where I live. This borough has given so much to me over the years and I am thankful to everybody who has helped me throughout my rugby career so far.\n\n “I would like to thank the council for considering me for this honour and for arranging today’s very special event. I have had the privilege to take part in some memorable sporting occasions and today’s will live long in the memory with the best of them.”\n\n Earlier in the day Rory attended a special Festival of Rugby held at City of Armagh Rugby Club made up of teams from clubs across the borough including Banbridge RFC, Dromore RFC, Lurgan RFC, Portadown RFC and City of Armagh RFC, as well as rugby neighbours Dungannon RFC and Monaghan RFC.  Portadown Panthers opened the festival with an exhibition game of tag rugby, of which Rory is the club patron.\n\n Lord Mayor Julie Flaherty said: “Today has been a real celebration of Rory Best’s sporting achievements and the contribution he makes to our borough. He thoroughly deserves the Freedom of the Borough honour and we could ask for no better example for our young people to follow, both on and off the pitch.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n “The fantastic turnout from the world of provincial and international rugby is testament to the regard with which Rory is held in the professional game, as are the tributes from some of the stalwarts of the game.”\n\n Dr Rory Best OBE received the Freedom of the Borough of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon in recognition of his outstanding sporting achievements of a local man who was raised and educated in Poyntzpass and went to Tandragee Junior High and Portadown College. He played rugby for Banbridge and his wife Jodie teaches in The Armstrong Primary School, Armagh.\n\n Rory has won a raft of honours in the rugby world, including captaining Ulster, Ireland and the British and Irish Lions earning more than 100 caps for Ireland and more than 200 for Ulster leading Ireland to a third Grand Slam and Triple Crown in 2018 also leading Ireland to historic wins over the New Zealand All Blacks, South Africa and Australia and being part of the Ulster side which reached a Heineken Cup final in 2012.\n\n As part of the Freedom of the Borough celebrations, some of Rory’s most memorable items from his playing career are on display in a special exhibition in the Archbishop’s Palace in Armagh\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nItems on display include the match ball from the Ireland rugby team’s historic win over the New Zealand All Blacks in Chicago in 2016 Rory’s shirt from the Six Nations Championship Grand Slam winning game against England in 2018 the boots worn by the hooker on his 200th cap for Ulster in 2017 and his captain’s shirt from the Lions game against the Chiefs on the tour of New Zealand in 2017.\n\nThe exhibition is open until Sunday, September 16 from 10am to 5pm and 7pm to 9pm on weekdays and 2pm to 5pm at weekends, it will be closed on Saturday 8th September and Wednesday 12th September.

However, on Botanic Avenue, which is especially popular with students, business owners begin to feel the pinch as the University term ends in December.\nRichard Walker, owner of The Other Place on Botanic’s thoroughfare, said that extending the Christmas lights would not only improve trade, but also the festive atmosphere in South Belfast.\n“Botanic Avenue is usually a very vibrant and busy area, but what we have discovered over the last couple of years is that when the Christmas lights are put up and the Christmas market comes that a lot of our customers want to go down into the city centre,” he said.\n“They want to be part of the buzz and the festivities. On Botanic Avenue we notice a lull in trade around that time.\n“We are very busy with the students returning around September up until November time. As soon as it gets close to Christmas time there is a massive downturn in trade.\n“People are going into the city centre because they want to be part of the fun. The economy is very poor at the minute and a lot of restaurants are really struggling so we rely on Christmas to help our performance throughout the year, because come January when everybody has spent their money eating out is the last thing they want to do. It puts us under a lot of pressure.”\nHe continued: “Festivals and events like the Christmas market are great for the local economy, but in Botanic Avenue and the Ormeau where we aren’t part of the city festive programme we see a drop in footfall.\n“With the tourist boom that we’ve had over the summer, we’ve seen that a lot of tourists are getting off the train at Botanic train station, and with the opening of the Grand Central Hotel, they are walking up Botanic Avenue, going to the Ulster Museum and Botanic Park. I would like that to be part of the route map for Christmas, so that we can keep that going.\n“I have spoken to a lot of local traders here and they are all very much of the same mindset. We want Botanic and Ormeau to be part of the Christmas spirit –It’s good craic. My staff would certainly like to be coming to work seeing the Christmas lights and getting into the spirit. I think it’s a good idea for local traders and the local residents too.”\nBotanic Councillor Declan Boyle said that bringing the festivities to the area is “great idea”.\n“The Christmas market is  good but I think we need to spread people out to other parts of the city too,” said.\n“The business owners pay rates and they should be given a bit of help and assistance. In Botanic Avenue their market, by and large, is university students and in the middle of December when they go it’s very quiet, so it would do no harm to help out those businesses there.\n“For the rest of the year it’s a thriving place, it has a great bohemian mix, so I think the area should be assisted in the Christmas months. It’s only a small stretch of road, and it wouldn’t have a terrible expense attached to it, so I would be very much in favour of it.”\n________________________________________\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"dont deport us back to iraq","story":"\nTWO junior Iraqi doctors who fled their war-torn nation due to death threats made to one of their lives, say they hope the Home Office will reconsider its decision to imminently deport them due to complications with their visa.\n\nSpeaking from their home off Lisburn Road’s Chadwick Street, Yosra Taleb Abdalla who shares the property with her husband Usamah Ather Ali and two young children – one of whom is aged just 20 months –  explained how she and Ali had been working as junior doctors when Ali, who worked for the Ministry for Defence in Baghdad, received a threat to his life. \n\n“We applied for a visa to Dublin and then went onto Belfast,” said Yosra. “We have been here nearly three years, from the beginning of January 2016.”\n\nYosra continued: “The people here have been extremely kind to us and the children enjoy the multicultural side of life.\n\n“We feel safe here, we are safe here we feel that no-one can hurt us here.”\n\nYosra explained how the Home Office decision, which was made in late July, refused the family’s submission for asylum and to date the family have received no further correspondence as to when they have to leave the country.\n\nAs both Yosra and Ali have not successfully secured asylum neither can work, leaving the family in limbo.\n\n“We fear we will forget all we have learned in our profession,” said Yosra. “It is our hope to work.\n\n“We were doctors in our home country, we were living a normal life, and now we are here trying to live our lives. We don’t know what to expect from the future. Our  youngest is only 20 months old and our son is going to be four in November.\n\n “We want a chance to prove ourselves and return to our normal life as we are very frustrated with the way things are and for our young family. It is a extremely stressful time for us and we would ask the Home Office for further reconsideration.”\n\nSouth Belfast MLA Máirtín Ó Muilleoir, who has been supporting the family, said he would be asking the Home Office to look again at their case and allow the young family to remain in the city where they have been embraced by the local community.\n\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: “Each asylum application is carefully considered on its merits against background country information to ensure that only genuine claims are granted.\n\n“Where a decision has been made that a person does not require international protection, and there are no remaining rights of appeal or obstacles to their return, we expect individuals to return voluntarily to their home country.\n\n“The Home Office\u0026#8217s full range of country policy and information notes  is available at https:www.gov.uk/government/collections/country-information-and-guidance.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"summers bountiful harvest is celebrated in colin","story":"\n\n\nTHE strong green-fingered growers at Colin Allotments celebrated a successful end of summer harvest on Thursday by sharing the bountiful fruits  of their labour with the local community.\nThe Colin Harvest Festival brought people from all over the community together for the celebration. Visitors were treated to displays from traditional musicians, the Colin Men’s Shed, Belfast Beekeeper’s Association, and, of course, the gardeners themselves.\nThis year’s harvest produced a colourful cornucopia of fruit and veg – a beautiful, healthy and tasty reward for all of the allotment owners’ hard graft.\nMichael George, from Colin Neighbourhood Partnership, hailed their success, stating it was “the best year yet” for the allotments.\n“This is all great produce from the allotment holders themselves and we have local honey from the hives on site,” he said.\n“We have all of these different organisations here giving advice and information about growing and sustainable living.\n“This is a very important project for the Colin area because it’s helping local people grow their own vegetables, and stay healthy. We want to promote sustainable living. With Brexit coming along, fruit and vegetables are getting dearer every day.\n“I have a plot here myself and I’ve eaten the vegetables from the plot all summer. It’s a money saver, it’s organic, you can taste the difference and it keeps you healthy too.”\nHe continued: “I couldn’t get over the displays. The last couple of years have been good, but this is the best year yet. The community are really into it – it’s a great celebration.”\nBelfast’s first citizen, Cllr Deirdre Hargey, who came along to judge the stunning displays, said: “It’s a brilliant day. When you’re up here and you see the scale of the allotments in the Colin area it’s amazing. It’s brilliant for the city, it’s brilliant for the community and our young people.\n“It teaches people to grow their own food – healthier food, more natural food – and encouraging people to actually eat fruit and veg.\n“You can see that the demand for this community activity is growing too.\n“It’s particularly important when you look at the health issues in the city relating to diet including obesity. This helps change the culture of unhealthy eating.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"well not be derailed by latest mod stunt","story":"\n\nTHE\n Ballymurphy Massacre families have said that the latest ‘stunt’ by the British Ministry of Defence will not derail their much anticipated inquest into the murder of there loved ones.\n\nA preliminary inquest into the atrocity takes place at 2pm today  at Belfast’s High Court.\nLast week the MoD handed over a database containing almost 5,000 names of former soldiers to the Coroner’s Office.\n\nThe spreadsheet contains 1,366 names from the Parachute Regiment, 1,542 names from the Queen’s Regiment and eight names from the Queen’s Division. A further 1,492 names appear to be duplicates, meaning ‘when an individual has multiple regiments, or units on their Record of Service. \n\nThe Coroner’s Office had been attempting to trace former soldiers who may have  been in Ballymurphy during the three days in August 1971 when ten people were shot dead and one died of a heart attack.\nHowever, just days before the inquest was due to begin into the killings 47-year-ago the database containing nearly 5,000 names landed on the Coroner’s desk.\n\nSpeaking to the Andersonstown News Ballymurphy Massacre Families spokesperson John Teggart said: “Six working days before the start of our inquest and they  send this letter, this has been done before with the recent UVF story to attempt to delay our inquest.\n\n“Vital inquest resources are being used up here and that shouldn’t be happening, these stunts are nothing but a waste of time. We would now ask for more resources to be released on the back of this. All they  are attempting to do here is swamp the system days before we are due in court.\n\n“The families are devastated, we were and still are working towards this date, the Coroner  has been very focused in the lead up to this, she is now obliged to look at this list. We hope that it can be done in a speedy fashion.\n\n“We were prepared, we knew it wouldn’t be straight forward, when you’re working with the MoD the resources they have and the dirty deals they’ve been up to all along are well known. They’ve been sitting on their hands this entire time probably thinking they’d pull a stunt like this closer to the time [of the inquest], but to do it six days beforehand is utterly despicable.”\n\nMr Teggart continued: “Sure look at the UVF stunt a while ago, that was done to take the focus off the Paras and the Queen’s [regiment] another dirty tactic and I’d be confident that the MoD had a hand in it. \n\n“The UVF certainly weren’t out to help us that time and now the MoD have decided to swamp the inquest.”\n\nDiscussing what now needs to happen Mr Teggart said: “We need to remain focused and keep on track, we’ve had setbacks before and we’ve dealt with them, we will certainly deal with this one.\n\n“I hope there will be no delay we have a preliminary hearing on Thursday, the Coroner is demanding an explanation, she wants to know why this database has suddenly turned up and rightly so. \n\n“Our inquest is set to last 3-4 months, hopefully this database can be looked at in line with this time-frame so we aren’t setback.\n\n“When we were given a date for our inquest 18 months ago we clapped in the court, that’s unheard of. You now have good, independent people within the courts, the MoD have seen this so the only way they could try and delay this is with the dirty deals that they are doing now. \n\n“Bottom line is, the families are ready to go, the Coroner is ready to go, all the work’s done, the schedule has been set out, justice needs to be served.\u0026#8221\n"},{"url":null,"title":"ballymurphy massacre documentary maker macrae defends film as providing balance to false official narrative","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They included a priest attending to those wounded and a mother of eight.\n\nIn the documentary it heard how that mother, Joan Connolly, lay crying on the ground until she passed away.\n\nAnother man died of a heart attack following an alleged violent confrontation with the troops in the estate.\n\nThe shootings took place as the Army moved in to republican strongholds to arrest IRA suspects in the wake of the introduction of the controversial policy of internment without trial.\n\nSoldiers have long been held responsible for killing the 10 people in Ballymurphy but the accepted narrative became clouded earlier this year when former UVF members came forward to claim their organisation was also involved.\n\nInquests into the deaths are due to open in November.\n\n\n \nDate set for new inquest into Ballymurphy massacre\n \n\n\nFilmmaker Callum Macrae, rejected criticism the piece did not tell \"the whole story\" in that it did not go into the context of the major gun battles around the time or give the \"full context\" about the actions of paramilitaries including the IRA at the time.\n\nHe said: \"The description - which is widely held by people in the UK - that Protestants and Catholics were at each others throats, the Provisional IRA was an incredibly dangerous force rushing around killing people and the British Army was sent in as the patsies, the guys in the middle, trying to restore order and peace - that is the official narrative, it is accepted by almost everybody in Britain - and it is simply not true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelfast IRA men with a drogue bomb in 1987\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I tell people the Provisional IRA did not exist until several months after the Army arrived, they are astonished. Because there is a false narrative. \n\n\"So to describe what I am doing as some kind of false unbalanced narrative is just simply wrong.\n\n\"My film actually is the balance to the official narrative which is fundamentally wrong.\"\n\nMr Macrae said \"of course the IRA\" were active at the time of the Ballymurphy massacre. \n\n\"The British Army described very clearly a \u0027major gun battle\u0027, with upwards of 700 rounds being fired at soldiers. The Army, specifically in a statement to the Belfast , claimed there were 20 gunmen coming down from the top of the hill onto the Whiterock Road and the Army fought a two-hour battle involving Thompson sub-machine guns, pistols and rifles.\"\n\nHe said the reports from the time - based on what the British Army had said happened - although \"well-intentioned\" were \"transparently untrue\".\n\n\"They talk about wiping out a \u0027hardcore IRA unit\u0027,\" he went on.\n\n\"Now I have been looking into this for four years and there is not a shred of credible evidence I can find to say any of that is true.\"\n\nHe added: \"Let me be clear - I am no apologist for the IRA. \n\n\"No one can say there was no IRA present - I am certainly not saying that. \n\n\"What we can say for sure is no one can say for certain there were no armed paramilitaries present. And we do mention the UVF claim.\n\n\"We said most of the IRA had been tipped off and most of their members had left, that\u0027s what the IRA claimed.\"\n\nQuoting Gerry Adams who claimed a \"small number\" of IRA remained to offer \"token resistance\", Mr Mccrae said there were no guns found, ammunition or shells and two of those killed had been shot in the back.\n\n\"Not for a second do I deny the IRA were there,\" he added.\n\n\"What the army claim is \u0027a large number of IRA were involved with sub machine guns\u0027. I have looked very hard for four years and can not find evidence of it. \n\n\"Nonetheless - even though I can\u0027t find evidence of it, does not mean it didn\u0027t happen.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast road is most clamped street in northern ireland drivers spend 34k to","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

penalty charge notice, or against vehicles parked in urban clearways and bus lanes.\n\nA spokesman for the Department for Infrastructure said clamping had been an effective measure to prevent traffic offences.\n\nClamping was introduced for cars parked in urban clearways and bus lanes on March 5.\n\nBetween that date and the end of June 35 cars were clamped and removed for that reason.\n\nThe rule was introduced to stop motorists blocking the main arteries into Belfast by parking illegally.\n\nEnforcement is carried out for the Department for Infrastructure by contractor NSL Services Group.\n\nDrivers are required to pay a charge of £40 to have a clamp removed if the car has been removed to a nearby street, or £105 if the car has been taken to the vehicle pound .\n\nSpeaking at the time of the launch of the measure, Ciaran de Burca, Department for Infrastructure director of transport projects, said: \"Vehicles parked in urban clearway routes and bus lanes during operational hours cause significant delays and congestion for commuters and other road users, particularly during the morning and evening peak traffic hours.\n\n\"For drivers who choose to ignore urban clearway and bus lane regulations, this specially designed enforcement vehicle will carry out the removal and clamping of illegally parked vehicles, leaving main routes unobstructed during these key times and allowing other road users to continue on their journeys without the unnecessary delay caused.\"\n\nEarlier this year the issue of clamping was in the headlines after footage emerged of Sinn Fein MLA Gerry Kelly removing a clamp from his car, raising questions about the legality of clamping a vehicle in a private car park.\n\nSpeaking after the incident, legal expert Joshua Rozenberg said clamping legislation had not been updated in Northern Ireland since the 1970s and differed substantially from other parts of the UK.\n\nClamping on private land in England and Wales became an offence in 2012 under the Protection of Freedom Act, with the same law having been in place in Scotland since 2002.\n\nHowever, it remains legal in Northern Ireland.\n\nCompanies here can still hire contractors to clamp private cars on their land, although companies able to do this must be licensed by the Security Industry Authority  and are regulated by the British Parking Authority.\n\nThe maximum fee private contractors can charge to free a car from a clamp in Northern Ireland is £100.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37306839.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/591510814_2.jpg","title":"claims of health and safety breaches at belfast leisure centre pool

The situation today in Ballysillan is only the latest in a long line of concerning incidents,\" he said.\n\nHe claimed that on Tuesday employees at the leisure centre had reported that the pool had not been correctly chlorinated which had led to murky water. \n\nHowever a spokesperson for GLL rejected the accusations of health and safety breaches saying Unite had \"produced no evidence for their assertions which amount to an unfounded attack on our staff and competence\".\n\nUnite is Britain and Ireland\u0027s largest trade union and represents some members of staff at Ballysillan Leisure Centre.\n\nMr Keenan claimed that since being appointed to run Belfast\u0027s leisure centres by the council, GLL had done away with the role of plant operator which was contributing to water safety issues.\n\nThis claim was rejected outright by GLL who said that \"our staff are highly trained and contrary to Unite’s claims, we have increased the number of pool plant operators from 15 to 64\".\n\nHowever GLL did accept that there had been a fault at the leisure centre.\n\n\"A fault was reported at Ballysillan, whereupon management immediately initiated proper health and safety procedures,\" a GLL spokesperson said.\n\n“This can happen in any leisure centre swimming pool. At no time were customers put at risk.\n\n“An independent review of leisure centre operations was carried out in 2017 and no evidence was found to suggest that GLL operates outside of health and safety legislation or guidance.”\n\nA Belfast City Council spokeswoman said that council was confident that all health and safety guidelines were being followed by GLL.\n\n“Health and safety at leisure centres is a top priority for both Belfast City Council and GLL, which operates the centres on our behalf,\" the spokeswoman said.\n\n\"As part of the Council’s strategic partnership with GLL and the independent Active Belfast Board we meet regularly to review service standards and performance through a range of mechanisms, and are confident that GLL operates within all health and safety guidelines.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"final recommendations for northern ireland electoral boundary changes published","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There would be four new constituencies - Sperrin, Causeway, Mid Antrim and Mid Down.\n\n\nFlashback to 2017 General Election results: \n\nEast Belfast\n .... \nNorth Belfast \n\n\n.... \nSouth Belfast\n \n\n.... \nWest Belfast \n\n\n.... \nEast Antrim \n\n\n.... \nEast Londonderry \n\n\n.... \nFermanagh \u0026 South Tyrone\n \n\n.... \nFoyle \n\n\n.... \nLagan Valley \n \n\n.... \n\n\nMid Ulster \n \n\n.... \nNewry \u0026 Armagh \n\n\n.... \nNorth Antrim \n \n\n.... \nNorth Down\n \n\n.... \nSouth Antrim\n \n\n.... \nSouth Down\n \n\n.... \nStrangford \n \n\n.... \nUpper Bann  \n\n\n....\nWest Tyrone  \n\n\n....\n\nEleven remain with the same name, although their boundaries are altered. They are the four sets in Belfast, East Antrim, Mid Ulster, Newry and Armagh, North Down, South Antrim, South Down and Upper Bann.\n\nAnd effectively disappearing - because there would be no obvious successor in the new plans - would be North Antrim, Lagan Valley, Strangford, East Londonderry and West Tyrone.\n\nA previous proposal to reduce Belfast to three constituencies has disappeared.\n\nThe iations in the number of people living in each constituency would be reduced - meaning they would be closer in size in terms of people represented.\n\nCurrently the smallest constituency is East Antrim with 59,658 electors on December 2015, while the largest is Upper Bann with 80,218.\n\nUnder the Boundary Commission plans the smallest would become Upper Bann with 69,795 people eligible to vote and the largest, Mid Down, with 77,767.\n\n\n\nThe Boundary Commission has been working on the changes since 2013 and the final recommendations come after a large scale consultation process. Almost 10,000 petition signatures and letters were received by the organisation.\n\nThe matter will be put to parliament and debated before new legislation is put in place to enact the changes, if a vote approves the changes.\n\nDeputy Chair of the Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland, Madam Justice Denise McBride DBE, QC said: \"The Boundary Commission has determined its final recommendations after careful consideration of all the evidence collected during three stages of open and transparent public consultation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final recommendation proposes 17 constituencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Commission is grateful to all those who took the time and trouble to respond.

almost 3m more than he paid for it in 2013.\n\nBuilt in 2010, the sun-soaked deluxe pad boasts six bedrooms, a fully-equipped gym, nine bathrooms, a swimming pool and a private jetty that serves a nearby lake.\n\nThe 10,500sq ft home has been tastefully decorated in greys and beige, with a pool table in one of the leisure rooms.\n\nThere\u0027s even a putting green in the grounds where the Holywood-born golfer could take out the clubs and get in a little after-hours practice if the mood took him.\n\nRory and his American wife Erica Stoll - who hails from the same area of Palm Beach where the house was sold - have now moved into a new home once owned by golf legend Ernie Els in nearby Jupiter.\n\nRory and Erica married in April last year at Ashford Castle in Cong, Co Mayo.\n\nThe couple first met when the stunning New Yorker was working manager of championship volunteer operations for the Professional Golf Association of America.\n\nShe famously woke McIlroy up after he had slept in during the Ryder Cup in 2012.\n\nThe new owner of the former McIlroy mansion, which the golfer originally paid £7.2m for, has not been revealed.\n\nIn 2013, McIlroy sold a five-bedroom house with its own golf driving range and putting green at Moneyreagh, Co Down, for £2m. \n\nThe 14-acre estate also boasted five bedrooms and a gymnasium.\n\nIn 2014 the golfer bought a property in Holywood through Simon Brien Residential estate agents.\n\nHe also snapped up a three-storey building there, described as having been sub-divided into five apartments.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"things karen bradley never knew viral trend after secretary of state admits lack of northern ireland knowledge","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Actually, the unionist parties fight the elections against each other in unionist communities and nationalists in nationalist communities.

Police will be placing cones near the venue to maximise public safety, minimise traffic disruption and secure Emergency Vehicle Access to the venue and local communities.

We must plan for all scenarios, including an unlikely one – no deal.”\n\nMr Varadkar reminded the audience in the border town of measures previously announced, including the preparation of Irish ports and airports to “take account of a changed trading relationship with Britain post-Brexit”.\n\n\nAn Taoiseach Leo Varadkar addressing the business community in Letterkenny and Donegal \n#PresidentsLunch\n \n@campaignforleo\n \npic.twitter/R3mIApQEaK\n\n— Letterkenny Chamber  \nSeptember 11, 2018\n\n\n\n\nIreland’s Budget 2018 saw the announcement of a number of measures, including a 300 million euro Brexit Loan Scheme for businesses and a 25 million euro Brexit Response Loan Scheme for the agri-food sector.\n\nMr Varadkar said it is the Government’s desire that there will be the “closest possible relationship” between the EU and UK after Brexit.\n\n“If that does not prove possible, the backstop will be in place as part of the withdrawal treaty to ensure no hard border on the island and this will apply unless and until a better solution is found,\nagreed and implemented,” he said.\n\n“The Government has always been clear that the outcome it is seeking from the EU-UK negotiations must include the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and the avoidance of any hard border on the\nisland of Ireland.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nThe Irish Government is seeking to avoid a hard border with Northern Ireland \n\n\n\n\n“Our priority is that work continues on the conclusion of the Withdrawal Agreement, including the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which encompasses the backstop for the border.\n\n“At the same time, it is vital to Ireland’s interests that the EU’s Single Market is fully protected.

consider that offer and I will negotiate with him.\n\n“Pubs in Shrewsbury have benefited from recent cuts to alcohol duties and business rates, but of course we recognise the challenge many small businesses are facing and we will bear that very much in mind as we formulate policies going forward.”\n\nLabour MP Jenny Chapman also extended a drinks invitation to Mr Hammond, this time in her constituency of Darlington, as MPs were overheard muttering “you wouldn’t last five minutes”.\n\nShe said: “He is obviously very welcome on a pub crawl around Darlington too, and I always stand my round.\n\n“Many of us who represent towns are fighting hard to support our high streets… The situation needs urgently looking at.\n\n“Will he investigate the way in which small pubs are disadvantaged by the business rates system?”\n\nAlthough he declined to give his view on the merits of a pub crawl around Darlington, the Chancellor did offer to look at business rates again.\n\n“We all realise high streets are under pressure, primarily because the behaviour of consumers is changing,” he said.\n\n“We cannot simply turn our backs on a change which is driven by consumer behaviour but we do have to support business as they meet that challenge.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"mark carney to stay on as bank of england governor until january","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n |

We meet on a regular basis and I have a lot of confidence in him.\n\n“So, I’m pleased this will give us a bit of stability.”\n\nBut the decision to keep Mr Carney on board has drawn criticism from the likes of Andrew Sentance, who is a former member of the Bank’s interest rate setting Monetary Policy Committee \n\n“Totally contrary to the spirit and letter of 2012 Bank of England Act. A shocking abuse of procedure which totally undermines the concept of BoE independence,” Mr Sentance said on Twitter.\n\n\nTotally contrary to the spirit and letter of 2012 Bank of England Act. A shocking abuse of procedure which totally undermines the concept of \n#BoE\n independence. \nhttps:t.co/6DinJVpbqo\n\n— Andrew Sentance  \nSeptember 11, 2018\n\n\n\n\nTreasury Select Committee chairman Nicky Morgan welcomed the term extension, saying it offers more time to find a qualified replacement for Mr Carney.\n\n“This announcement provides much-needed stability and clarity during this important period,” she said.\n\n“The Government should now use the extra seven months to continue its succession planning.\n\n“It should identify a candidate in good time for the Treasury Committee to scrutinise the appointment.”\n\nMr Carney became the Bank’s Governor in 2013, succeeding Mervyn King and becoming the first non-Briton to hold the post.\n\nHe previously served as governor of the Bank of Canada from 2008 and was widely credited with helping the Canadian economy withstand the shock of the financial crisis.\n\nIt followed a stint in the Canadian government, having been senior associate deputy minister of finance, all of which came after a 13-year career with Goldman Sachs.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"speculation mounts over tesco discount launch","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The proposed Sainsbury’s-Asda merger acknowledges this decline, as did Tesco’s own acquisition of Booker, which gave it access to wholesale and out-of-home sales.\n\n“The opening of a new discount chain would be further recognition of this shift.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"unions welcome labour pledge to help gig economy workers","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

for millions in this country today, is appalling.\n\n“It is simply not right for the sixth richest country on earth to have allowed a situation to develop whereby a worker only knows if he or she will earn a wage that day when they get a text message to tell them that they have a shift.”\n\nPaddy Lillis, general secretary of the shopworkers union Usdaw, said: “We welcome the commitment to help workers on zero and short-hours contracts by requiring employers to guarantee a minimum number of hours for their staff.\n\n“It is clear that Labour fully understands the problems low-paid workers have in getting enough hours to make a weekly wage they can live on.”\n\nMr McDonnell said workers in the gig economy will be given the same rights as other employees including sick pay and parental leave under a Labour government.\n\n\n\nJust because you value the freedom of independence or the convenience of flexibility doesn’t mean you have to forgo basic rights\nJohn McDonnell\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nHe criticised the Government’s Taylor Report into employment for “ignoring” trade unions.\n\nHe said: “Even if the Government adopt every positive recommendation in Taylor, it will not be enough because the most effective way to improve the lives of working people is through trade unions and collective action.\n\n“Just because you don’t work regular hours doesn’t mean you can afford not to work when you are sick.\n\n“Just because you work several jobs doesn’t mean you can afford to lose one of them without warning.\n\n“Just because you value the freedom of independence or the convenience of flexibility doesn’t mean you have to forgo basic rights.”\n\nMr McDonnell said the burden of proof should be shifted so that the law treats gig staff as workers unless the employer can prove otherwise.\n\nHe added that the Conservatives have stripped back employment rights to a level not seen since the economic depression of the 1930s.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"marching band member goes viral playing perfect air drums during nfl game","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

the surprise decision “incomprehensible” on Tuesday.\n\nWanda Barzee, 72, will be released on September  19 after the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole determined it had miscalculated the time she previously served in federal custody, board spokesman Greg Johnson said.\n\nBarzee pleaded guilty to kidnapping Smart and helping keep her captive for nine months before then-teenager was found and rescued.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nElizabeth Smart is opposed to the release \n\n\n\n\nMs Smart, now 30, said in a statement she was “surprised and disappointed” to learn that Barzee will be freed next week.\n\nShe said she is exploring her options and plans to speak publicly in the coming days.\n\n“It is incomprehensible how someone who has not cooperated with her mental health evaluations or risk assessments and someone who did not show up to her own parole hearing can be released into our community,” Ms Smart said.\n\nThe board said previously Barzee would be released in January 2024 after it denied her an early parole following a hearing that she chose not to attend.\n\nAt that June hearing, the board said that Barzee had refused to take a psychological exam.\n\nAt the same hearing, her lawyer questioned the calculation of her release date, which led the Utah board to look into it.\n\nLawyer Scott Williams said he appreciates that the board reviewed it and agreed with his assessment.\n\nMr Williams said he is not concerned about Barzee being a danger to the community, but declined to say why he believes that.\n\nHe has said Barzee has been diagnosed with several mental illnesses.\n\nMs Smart said in an Instagram post after the hearing that she is not a vindictive person but was worried about Barzee’s release after learning she was still carrying a manuscript containing revelations that accomplice Brian David Mitchell said he received from God telling him to kidnap Ms Smart.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nWanda Barzee leaving a court hearing \n\n\n\n\nShe said the manuscript also contains other “disturbing and dangerous ideas.”\n\nShe did not say how she knows Barzee has the book.\n\nMs Smart’s abduction from her bedroom at knifepoint by a man who came in through an open kitchen window triggered waves of fear around the country.\n\nMs Smart was found while walking with Barzee and Mitchell on a street in the suburb of Sandy, Utah, by people who recognised the couple from media reports.\n\nMitchell is serving a life sentence after being convicted of kidnapping and raping Ms Smart.\n\nHe and Barzee were married at one point.\n\nBarzee was sent to the Utah state prison in April 2016 after finishing a federal sentence in Texas.\n\nMs Smart, now married with two children, has written a book about the ordeal and helped make a Lifetime movie and documentary.\n\nShe is now a child safety activist who regularly gives speeches.\n\nShe said in her statement she appreciates the support she is receiving and vowed to work to address the issue of Barzee’s release so the same thing does not happen again.\n\nBarzee will be under federal supervision for five years.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"alex odonnell appreciation","story":"\nThe death occurred on Wednesday, August 23 of veteran Derry Republican, Alex O Donnell, from the Shantallow area of the

the British Army on May 13, 1972.\n\nLike many other republicans in the early 1970s, Alex was at the forefront of protests and opposition to internment and British rule in Ireland, and when other work needed to be done Alex was never found wanting. \n\nWhen Alex came to live in the Shantallow area he immediately made himself available to the local Republican structures\n\nHis house was always open to republicans no matter what their problems - making sure those on the run had a bed when needed. \n\nHis work on behalf of political prisoners and their families was always at the top of his priorities. \n\nAlex never shied away from his responsibilities and ensured that the Republican struggle continued at a time when many might have faltered. \n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push

supporter of the Peace Process and the Good Friday Agreement. Alex will always be Remembered as someone who led from the front and for the hard work and dedication that he gave to the republican cause. \n\nHe helped with the constituency service at the old caravan in Shantallow and was the man that the people went to for advice and guidance. \n\nAlex on many occasions could be seen at the graves of soldiers of Óglaigh na hÉireann, tending the graves and ensuring they reflected the respect the volunteers deserved. \n\nHe believed that their sacrifice should be a catalyst to spur us on in the pursuit of Irish unity. \n\nWe will never forget the role he played in our struggle.

Only five players attended a pre-season meeting and Down took the field for their National League opener with barely 15 players.\n\nHowever, Rooney\u0026rsquos infectious enthusiasm has transformed Down and three months later the girls find themselves preparing for an All-Ireland showdown.\n\nSport is such a conundrum. All who have been involved in sport at any level can testify to the many frustrating and heartbreaking defeats sporadically interrupted by moments of sheer elation.\n\nIt\u0026rsquos these infrequent moments that keep players and coaches going year in year out in search of just one more. A half, a game even a season can be changed on a block, tackle, score or win and the momentum gathered can be infectious.\u0026nbsp\n\nA group, seemingly going nowhere except deeper into the abyss are suddenly galvanised, working for one another as if their lives depended on it. Success is like a lightning bolt. It can strike when you least expect it and you must keep the energy and drive going. You have to strike when the iron is hot.\n\nYet, as we all know, fairy tale endings only become fairy tale endings when the underdog performs to their very best and leaves the field of play with no regrets.\n\nOn their day the Down girls are a match for anyone as they have proved a number of times this year and they have also shown that when their backs are against the wall they can and have turned games around.\u0026nbsp\n\nDown have talented players all over the park. They will be led by Clonduff sisters Sara Louise and Fionnuala Carr, who were both on the side that won the All-Ireland Junior crown at Croke Park in 2014.\n\nThrow in in Bredagh\u0026rsquos Catherine Rocks, Liatroim\u0026rsquos Aimee McAleenan and Dearbhla Magee and you have the nucleus of an attack-minded side.\u0026nbsp\n\nHowever, Portaferry\u0026rsquos twin terrors Niamh Mallon \u0026mdash skipper of the 2014 side \u0026mdash and Saoirse Sands are the jewels in the Down crown and they have the potential to cut any defence to shreds and no better place to do that than Croke Park on Sunday.\n\nThere were plenty of raised eyebrows when Down got the better of Tipperary thanks to a 58th minute goal from Sara Louise Carr to reach the Liberty Insurance All-Ireland Intermediate final for the first time in 20 years.\n\nIt may have been a surprise, but there were indications that the Mourne girls were making real progress as the summer evolved.\n\nAdmittedly, the league was a disaster, as they lost all five outings, but then they got the better of Derry in the Ulster final. They followed that up with a draw against the much-fancied Oak Leafers in the opening round of the All-Ireland Championship.\n\nThat laid the platform for the rest of the campaign and they defeated Laois to bag the runners-up spot in Group 1 behind Cork, who had overcome all before them.\n\nTipperary topped Group 2 and were six points clear at half-time in the semi-final, but with the experiment of deploying Fionnuala Carr at full forward dispensed with, there was an immediate improvement as the Clonduff colossus began to exert greater influence from centre back. Nicole Kelly put the shackles on the dangerous Nicola Treacy too.\n\nMeanwhile, Niamh Mallon was busily keeping the umpire busy as she racked up nine points, seven from placed balls. That brought Down in touch and Sara Louise Carr, who got married earlier this year, pounced for the definitive goal to go with her earlier two points from play.\n\nCork will be desperate to get over the line having lost the last two deciders, including last year\u0026rsquos to Meath after a replay.\u0026nbsp\n\nMuch like their senior counterparts, they have cruised through to the final, finishing the group phase with a positive scoring differential of 65 points, compared to Down\u0026rsquos -2. Indeed, the Rebels were 12-point victors when the teams met in P\u0026aacuteirc Esler in July.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe Leesiders possess a lot of firepower with Finola Neville, Caroline Sugrue and Katelyn Hickey well able to hit the target. Minor star Cliona Healy came off the bench to have a big impact in the semi-final win over Galway, scoring three points in as many minutes soon after her second-half introduction to edge the Leesiders clear and finishing with four.\n\nHealy wasn\u0026rsquot involved when the Leesiders garnered the Division 2 League title, but she and a handful of other colleagues from the All-Ireland-winning Minor Championship side have made the step up and with that sort of ability to be called upon, they will be hard to beat.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Arts Centre launches new programme  ","story":"\t\t\t\nDOWN Arts Centre has announced its latest arts programme.\n\nThe new-look autumn guide, covering September to December, is brimming with a huge range of exhibitions, music, theatre, comedy, talks, classes and workshops.\n\nA ied season of live performances gets off to a comedic start with Owen O\u0026rsquoNeill\u0026rsquos new one man play, \u0026lsquoTen Songs To Die For\u0026rsquo.\u0026nbsp Also billed for the autumn are local comedians Shane Todd with his hilarious brand new stand-up show \u0026lsquoHero\u0026rsquo and Kevin McAleer \u0026mdash a comedy apparition not to be missed.\n\nMusical highlights include celtic and country classics including the Leading Ladies, charismatic singer songwriter Grainne Duffy and the ever popular Illegals with Niamh Kavanagh.\n\nNew to Down Arts Centre is local musician Tony Wright who will provide a unique night of story and song with a killer sound track.\u0026nbsp\n\nAlso not to be missed is The \u0026lsquoLegend of Luke Kelly\u0026rsquo, a spectacular tribute to the greatest folk artist of the 20th century, a definite must-see for all fans.

community service dedicated to eighth century replica monument  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA REPLICA of St Patrick\u0026rsquos Cross at Down Cathedral has been formally unveiled following a cross-community dedication service.\n\nThe replica eighth century cross \u0026mdash which stands an imposing 12-feet high and weighs five tonnes \u0026mdash is located just yards from where the patron saint is buried on the historic Hill of Down, with the Mournes in the distance providing a stunning back.\n\nBishops from the Church of Ireland and Catholic communities took part in last Friday afternoon\u0026rsquos service and they were joined by local clergy and monks from the Holy Cross Monastery in Rostrevor.\n\nFriday\u0026rsquos ceremony had been pencilled in for earlier in the summer but had to be postponed following the discovery of medieval human remains while contractors were preparing the ground for the installation of the cross, carved from Mourne granite excavated from Thomas\u0026rsquo Mountain high up in the mountain range.\n\nThe intricately designed structure was manufactured by the Kilkeel firm of McConnell Brothers and representatives from the firm were joined by Church of Ireland Bishop Harold Miller, Down and Connor Bishop Noel Treanor, the Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, and members of the Cathedral Chapter.\n\nDean Hull, who led the short service of dedication, said the ceremony marked a very special day and was delighted a number of people heavily involved in the project were present, including Dr Mike King from the Down County Museum.\n\nDean Hull explained that Dr King played a key role initiating the replica cross project, financed by Newry, Mourne and Down Council.\n\n\u0026ldquoMike worked hard along with others to bring about the cross which replicates one that was in place around 800AD. Inside Down Cathedral, there are some old stones and through research, Mike discovered they were in fact part of the original St Patrick\u0026rsquos Cross, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoIn some old drawings of the cathedral you can see broken portions of the cross which marked nearby St Patrick\u0026rsquos grave. Obviously this old Celtic cross had fallen down and was broken with some pieces placed inside the church.\n\nDean Hull said Dr King, with the help of Philip Armstrong, redesigned the replica cross based on drawings and sketches and eventually, through the help of McConnell Brothers, the imposing replica cross was produced.\n\nThose in attendance at the dedication ceremony were told that the source of the granite used to make the replica cross was most probably the same as that from which the original was made, Dean Hull said the cross is at the heart of the Christian faith and that because Jesus died on the cross, people are reconciled to God and find forgiveness.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are reconciled to God but through the cross we can be reconciled to each other, with the cross reminding us of our common faith as Christians. It is lovely today that Christians from different traditions are able to stand around this cross today because the cross is a symbol of Christian unity and it reminds us that we have one faith, he continued.\n\nDean Hull said when people look at the cross and reflect back to Patrick and to the days of an undivided church, they are reminded that despite all has happened, \u0026ldquowe are still one in Christ with the cross a symbol of what people have in common\u0026nbsp \u0026mdash Christian unity.\n\nConcluding before the start of a short religious dedication service, Dean Hull thanked the Lecale and Down Historical Society which helped with the restoration project and the former Down Council and current Newry, Mourne and Down Council for their support.\n\nDean Hull\u0026rsquos words were reflected by Bishop Miller, who said a prayer as part of the dedication service along with Bishop Treanor.\n\nThe clerics then gathered at the base of the sculpture where they placed their palms over the imprint of a hand in the cross\u0026rsquos base and were joined by Bishop Grant Le Marque, former Anglican Bishop of the Horn of Africa, who was visiting the Down and Dromore Diocese.\n\n\u0026ldquoHere we have Christian hands together, said Bishop Miller, encouraging other people from all over the world to visit the cathedral to make the same gesture.\n\nHe added: \u0026ldquoThe cross is never just something at a distance it is the very heart of our faith in Christ, our relationship with Christ and our salvation in Christ.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Delight after new Translink bus service is extended to Clough  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA NEW bus service is operating in Clough.\n\nThe Downpatrick to Ballykinlar service is being extended to Clough from this month.

A super effort. The only other male junior, Oliver Robinson,\u0026nbsp did a double. The U-13 boys 100m in 15.15 and a strong run in the 1500m saw him finish in 5\u0026rsquo40.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\nA promising start to his career as a Year 8 athlete. The sole senior of the night was Davy Foster in 1,500m running a fast 4\u0026rsquo50. Maybe Davy will stick to these faster shorter distances to try and keep up with his daughters.\n\nGirls galore\n\nTwo of the aforementioned Foster girls competed in the U-11 girls\u0026rsquo 1200m. In a competitive race Jodi hit the finish line in 4\u0026rsquo17 then not far behind was the always-smiling Kari in an impressive time of 4\u0026rsquo43. They both also tried the long jump.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn the U-13 girls\u0026rsquo 100m EDAC had three runners. Heat one saw Kara Trainor finish well in second place in 15.01. In heat three we saw Lauren Madine win in\u0026nbsp a new PB time of 14.16 and Anna Gardiner come home in 15.67 with Lauren taking the overall win and gold medal for the distance.\u0026nbsp\n\nKara\u0026rsquos time placed her sixth overall. It was pleasing to see them follow the lead of the younger girls by trying a field event as well, in this case the discus. Commendable enthusiasm!\n\nFab five females\n\nThe U-13 girls\u0026rsquo 1500m saw a large field of 14 athletes, five of which were EDAC runners and which also included the top class City of Lisburn athlete Katie McCleery, who is ranked in the top 10 in the UK for her age category over this distance.\u0026nbsp\n\nMcCleery made her intentions clear from the start as she immediately hit the front. Lauren decided to track her run and see how she went and was closely followed by Anna Gardiner, Lucy Foster, Kara Trainor and Emily Burns.\u0026nbsp\n\nAll five EDAC athletes looked superb over the three and three-quarter laps. On the last bend McCleery tried to hold on, but Lauren moved up another gear waiting and cruised past to take first place with 100m to run and crossed the line in a superb time of 4\u0026rsquo57 which is a PB by 18 seconds and puts Lauren 8th in the UK for her age for 2018. That was an outstanding performance.\n\nAnna Gardiner was the next EDAC athlete to finish in 5\u0026rsquo05 which is also a significant PB.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\n\nThe PBs were coming thick and fast as Lucy Foster came home in 5\u0026rsquo17 which was 12 seconds better than her previous best. The ever-improving duo of Kara Trainor and Emily Burns battled it out to the end and almost needed a photo finish to separate them \u0026mdash their times were\u0026nbsp 5.41.34 and 5.41.90. This race was really exciting to watch with brilliant efforts from all the girls. By filling first, third, fourth, seventh and eighth places, in the field of 14, there is surely cause for celebration at the depth of talent within the EDAC ranks.\n\nIcing on the cake\n\nLast girl to race was U-15 rising star Kirsti Foster in the 1500m. The girls were mixed with a strong U-15 boys\u0026rsquo field and Kirsti did not take the race lightly, despite carrying a slight niggle from hockey.\u0026nbsp\n\nShe dominated the girls\u0026rsquo field and beat some of the boys too in her race to finish a strong 5\u0026rsquo12 to provide a fitting finale to the night and to the track season.\n\nLaganside 10k\n\nPaula Radcliffe was obviously the star of the show, but EDAC had a few sparkling performances themselves.\u0026nbsp\n\nPaul Lloyd led the troops home and despite narrowly missing out on the elusive sub 40, he felt that he had given his all in the fast-paced race. His time of 40.08 is tantalisingly close and his consistency has to be commended.\u0026nbsp\n\nPhillip Vint, another man who rarely misses a weekend race, came next in 41.10 with Liam Keenan not far behind in 41.36. Gavin Hynds in 41.45 had plenty to celebrate as this was a PB and proves that marathon training doesn\u0026rsquot always slow you down and must be great morale booster for him.\u0026nbsp\n\nDeirdre v Paula?\n\nDeirdre Weatherall finished in 42.08 and was slightly disappointed with that. However, she was cheered up by the fact that Paula Radcliffe had decided to run in the pack and was seen in chat with ious folk en route.\u0026nbsp\n\nThis gave Deirdre the chance to have a sprint finish to the line with the women\u0026rsquos marathon world record holder.\n\nPaula also has European and World Championship medals too numerous to mention as well the accolade of four times Olympian. Many would defer to such greatness, but Deirdre is well known for her fresh-faced enthusiasm and took no time to decide that having a result sheet with her name one place ahead of Paula\u0026rsquos was an opportunity unlikely to be repeated.\n\nAfter reading on Wikipedia that Deirdre is described as the foremost tragic heroine in Irish legend and probably its best-known figure in modern times, she could probably argue that Paula should have been in awe of her rather than the other way round.\n\nThis is the spirit that is key to Deirdre\u0026rsquos rise in the ranks and long may it continue.\n\nLiam Smyth \u0026mdash veteran in terms of longevity in these events clocked up a respectable 44.42. Behind him another historic event was unfolding.\n\nGavin McConvey came in to the finish line in 53.51 declaring that the last time he saw a sub 54 minute 10K was in 2004. Not bad going Gavin, keep it up.\u0026nbsp\n\nRoisin Gaffney, another reliable EDAC runner, finished in 54.09 and for once found, despite her love of the sun, that the heat was oppressive and was glad to be done.\n\nDonal at the double\n\nDonal Smith headed to Kildare on Saturday to take part in an a 5k run in aid of the Injured Jockeys\u0026rsquo Fund - but having discovered that there was a 10K race nearby he decided in true horse lovers\u0026rsquo form to hedge his bets and do both. He did say afterwards that it was a lot for one day and he may need a few rest days, but knowing Donal, that won\u0026rsquot last for long.\n\nNo one from the club made their way to Derry on Sunday morning for the Waterside Half Marathon which this year was also the NI and Ulster Half Marathon Championships.\n\nWhat\u0026rsquos ahead?\n\nThis will probably come too late for regular readers of the weekly papers, but Tuesday is the night for the annual trek to Castlewellan for the lung busting, for some, Mill Hill Mile Challenge.\u0026nbsp\n\nThis is a race that is, or should be, on everybody\u0026rsquos bucket list so if you\u0026rsquore going don t\u0026rsquo forget you must register online beforehand.

They were freed on bail later that evening.\n\nAiring last November, the Alex Gibney-directed documentary was a hard-hitting examination of claims of state collusion in the murders, which broke new ground by publicly naming alleged suspects.\n\nThe six men killed in Loughinisland were Adrian Rogan, Barney Green, Dan McCreanor, Eamon Byrne, Malcolm Jenkinson and Patsy O\u0026rsquoHare.\n\nClare Rogan, wife of Adrian Rogan, said the families would not be deterred in their search for truth and justice.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are shocked and appalled at the arrest of two journalists related to the No Stone Unturned documentary, which exposed the extent of state collusion between the state and loyalist paramilitaries in Loughinisland, she said.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe British government have systematically denied and continue to cover up its role in the murder of six people in the Heights Bar.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThese arrests show the lengths of desperation that the British government and state forces are prepared to go to, in order to stifle the truth about what happened in Loughinisland.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe Police Ombudsman\u0026rsquos report into Loughinisland murders was one of the most damning expositions of state collusion in mass murder ever published.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoOur families, and many other families across the island, some of whom have been denied the basic right to an inquest, have campaigned for many years against state collusion and for truth and justice for our loved ones.\n\nSouth Down Sinn F\u0026eacutein MP Chris Hazzard has thanked those who came out to stand with the Loughinisland families on Friday night.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe arrests of two leading investigative journalists who helped lift the lid on collusion following the 1994 Loughinisland murders through \u0026lsquoNo Stone Unturned\u0026rsquo has re-opened many wounds for the families of those murdered, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoThat truth would never have been possible without journalists like Barry and Trevor who acted always with integrity.

He started rowing back to shore, but one of the oars slipped overboard and into the water.\n\nAfter a few unsuccessful attempts to circle the oar, Mr Milligan decided to jump overboard to retrieve it. After getting the oar, Mr Milligan tried to swim back to the boat, but it was drifting away in the strong tide.\n\nA strong swimmer, Mr Milligan struck out for the shore and was about half a mile out when he was picked up by police in a rowing boat.\n\n\u0026ldquoI shouted to the children to keep calm and they did.

He is still the top bid. It is understood that two additional parties are interested in acquiring the 75,000 sq ft red brick building which once provided work for 400 people when it was owned by Hursts, part of the Ulster Weaving Group.\n\nNearly 150 years old, the five-storey mill was used for the wet spinning of flax and most of its flooring is tiled.\u0026nbsp This activity closed ten years ago.

The display was organised by Down District Council as part of their Percy French festival and more than \u0026pound500 worth of fireworks were used.\n\nBilly Caughey was the master of ceremonies for the evening and introduced several bands who played selections prior to the display.\n\nCROSSGAR \u0026mdash Mr James Mejury, founder of the family motor business in Crossgar, died at his home this week. He was 80. A native of Ballyronan, Derry, he moved with his family from Belfast to Shrigley after the outbreak of the last war and began his business in Killyleagh Street, Crossgar.\n\nHis conscientiousness at work meant that 12-hour days were common place. The solution of customers\u0026rsquo problems were his delight.\n\nDRUMAROAD \u0026mdash Gene Fitzpatrick, voted Ulster\u0026rsquos top cabaret artist, is to compere a grand iety concert organised by St Patrick\u0026rsquos Scouts and Cubs in Drumaroad Hall next Tuesday night. A top class line-up includes Fergie, Houl Yer Whist, Dominic Hughes and a local supporting cast.\n\nDuring the past few months the boys and their leaders have been very busy. The cubs spent a very enjoyable five days at Clare, while 30 miles away the scouts were on a ten-day camp at Birr, Co Offaly.\n\nThe scouts won the Diocesan Shield and represented Dromore diocese a few weeks ago at the Melviin Trophy in Dublin where they gained considerable success.\n\nKILLINCHY \u0026mdash A harvest fair in Killinchy Presbyterian Church Hall on Saturday afternoon raised \u0026pound1,300 for church funds. There was a high standard of entries for the ious classes for bread, cakes, fruit and vegetables and sales were also good.\n\nThe crowds seemed to enjoy a iety of sideshows on the football pitch where darts shooting and beanbag games contributed to the fun.\u0026nbsp\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Local minister gets in tune for marathon on the organ  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA PLUMP cushion will be the Rev Mark Spratt\u0026rsquos best friend as he undertakes a 12-hour music marathon.\n\nThe minister of Kilmore Presbyterian Church, near Crossgar, is once again preparing to play an organ and piano non-stop to raise funds for the church.\n\nHe will be playing hundreds of psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, church music, classical pieces along with wedding favourites from 9am-9pm on Saturday, September 15.\u0026nbsp\n\nIt will the second time since 2014 that Mr Spratt will take to the keyboards to raise money for the Drumaghlis Road church where he is Director of Music.\n\nA renowned organist, Mr Spratt told the Recorder: \u0026ldquoI did a 12-hour marathon before in 2014 and that time we raised just over \u0026pound2,000 for the Women\u0026rsquos Association and other church activities.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis time it\u0026rsquos to raise money for repairs to the church\u0026rsquos roof and other property matters and I\u0026rsquoll be happy with whatever the community is able to give.\n\nMr Spratt has successfully completed two other music marathons for Bangor Presbyterian Church where he was part of the ministry team before he moved to Kilmore.

She said people expect the politicians to be at work and backed the clamour for them to engage in meaningful talks on the way forward and get back into government.\n\nThe Dundrum woman said the event, alongside those held in other towns, was designed to send a clear message that people have had enough and want the MLAs back in Stormont working for those who voted for them.\n\nJoan hopes the We Deserve Better campaign is something that will focus a lot of minds, explaining people are aware that some MLAs who want to get back to Stormont as part of a functioning Executive, but this has not been possible as result of the political leadership vacuum due to the DUP and Sinn Fein being unable to agree a way forward.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt feels as if we have been putting up with the impasse but there is momentum for change. Hopefully this movement will be able to grow and put some pressure on the politicians to get back, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoA lot of people have said that maybe we should do this again and last week I encouraged those in attendance to take photographs and send them to their MLAs to show the support there is for them to get back to work.\n\nJoan said the simple message from last week\u0026rsquos meeting to the politicians was: \u0026ldquoWe elected you, get back to work.\n\nShe added: \u0026ldquoThe politicians are in effect our employees, we elected them to do a job for us and at the minute they are not delivering.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, diversity in the church, compassion for the complexities of life and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own life journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by individual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland.

It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres.
