This is an outrage.The change happened with the official start of the sugar tax, presumably as a way to deal with the increase on the price of Pepsi and Coca-Cola – neither of which have changed their recipes, instead choosing to up the price.It’s not just meal deals that are affected. It looks like we’re entirely unable to buy 500ml bottles of Coca-Cola from Tesco, with all of them being replaced with the 375ml bottles, still for £1.30 each.Before you start charging to Tesco’s holding signs with ‘GIVE US BACK OUR FIZZY DRINKS’, it’s worth noting that it’s unlikely Tesco will be the only supermarket offering a smaller drink with your meal deal.Supermarkets selling Coca-Cola and Pepsi as part of their meal deals will face a choice: Either increase the price of their deals to include the tax (which would p*ss customers off), or include smaller bottles of fizzy drink as part of the current offer (which, clearly, would also p*ss customers off).That means we’re all left with our own choice of how we will respond to this horror.We can accept our smaller drinks and enjoy sticking to a £3 budget for lunch.We can swap to a big bottle of water if we’re thirsty.Masterchef rendang row: What is the dish and how to make itOr if we’re really determined to polish off a large bottle of Coke midway through our day, we’ll need to pay extra and head to a different aisle to get a 2 litre bottle, letting go of the joy of a meal deal entirely.This is life now, thanks to the sugar tax. It’s going to take us a while to adjust.MORE: Is the sugar tax just an exercise in babying adults?MORE: The sugar tax is a good thing, but it won’t solve all our diet problems"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/image-52.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"single uk town records 23 cases flesh eating alabama rot","story":"Bolton has recorded 23 cases of the flesh-eating Alabama Rot (Picture: Wessex News Agency)Dog owners are on red alert after a single UK town recorded a staggering 23 cases of flesh-eating Alabama Rot.That’s more cases than anywhere else in the UK, including the whole of Wales (14 cases), Scotland (two) and Northern Ireland (one).Local veterinary nurse Alex O’Hagan warned: ‘The first sign of the disease are ulcerations on the legs, paws and tongue.Confirmed cases of Alabama Rot shows the disease is sweeping the country (Picture: Vets4Pets)‘One of the most worrying aspects of the disease is no known cure has been found, meaning the majority of cases unfortunately result in death.‘There is little research on the disease, what causes it and how it’s prevented.‘There’s no way to diagnose it when the dog is alive, only once a post-mortem is carried out.

She bore him a son Sancho, whose descendant later married the Earl of Cambridge in the 11th century.  But British magazine the Spectator points out Zaida\u0027s origins are \u0027debatable\u0027.

Brown trout waver and dart, and in early summer rise to feast on the countless mayflies that fall into the water at eventide. Watching the mayflies is mesmeric. In places, there are stepping stones for children to hop across. They can come to little harm, as the water is shallow, though they may get their feet wet.All year round there are dippers bibbing and bobbing on streamside rocks, and grey wagtails ghosting by, uttering their metallic, high-pitched call. In spring and summer, redstarts, newly returned from their winter quarters in Africa, nest in holes in old sycamore trees. You can lose yourself here — and be much the better for it.Murlough Dunes, County DownThis is my favourite place out of many in Northern Ireland. Murlough is a rambling sand dune system, just north of where the dreamscape Mountains of Mourne ‘sweep down to the sea’, in the words of the popular song.The sand is acidic, which means mauve heathers abound where the sand is stable, along with the ubiquitous marram grass that bends in the stiff onshore breezes.In June, when the days are long, the dune hollows turn purple with the tiny flowers of heartsease pansy, and yellow with the starburst flowers of birdsfoot trefoil.          This is my favourite place out of many in Northern Ireland. Murlough is a rambling sand dune system, just north of where the dreamscape Mountains of Mourne ‘sweep down to the sea’, in the words of the popular songTwo rare butterflies haunt these hollows: the black and orange marsh fritillary, with its wings the pattern of stained glass windows, and something now called the cryptic wood white. This little butterfly looks exactly like the ordinary wood white found elsewhere in the UK, but has now been separated from its cousin and named as a new species.Great flocks of brent geese overwinter in Murlough Bay, and at this time of year the shoreline is haunted by huge flocks of lapwings, oystercatchers, golden plovers, dunlins and godwits, all swirling and calling away.In spring, skylarks ascend over the dunes, singing their song high above our heads.The Great Orme, North WalesThis is a place of pilgrimage for naturalists: a natural paradise, towering aloof above the holiday resort of Llandudno. Try finding a botanist or a butterfly enthusiast who hasn’t been there, or at least doesn’t desperately want to visit.It is also on the birders’ radar, with rare cliff-nesting species such as choughs, a member of the crow family with glossy blue-black plumage and a long, curved, blood-red bill.          This is a place of pilgrimage for naturalists: a natural paradise, towering aloof above the holiday resort of LlandudnoSeabirds nest here, too, including guillemots, razorbills and kittiwakes, which breed on the narrow ledges, jostling each other for prime position.Bat, beetle, lichen, moss, moth and marine wildlife enthusiasts also revere the Great Orme, as do geologists, geographers and archaeologists.But, above all, this is a botanists’ paradise, full of rare plants with esoteric names such as spiked speedwell, spotted cat’s-ear, Welsh hawkweed and wild cotoneaster.The Great Orme is also the finest example of ‘limestone heath’ in the UK, a rare type of vegetation in which acid-loving heathers grow on limestone rocks and among lime-loving plants.          Purple Emperor butterflies, clustered bellflowers and sacred rivers: these have been the captivating world of naturalist, conservationist and author Matthew Oates, who has worked as the National Trust’s Specialist on Nature for 27 yearsIn midsummer, on bright, sunny days, parts of the Orme swarm with tiny blue butterflies — the local race of the silver-studded blue. You won’t see a butterfly in greater profusion anywhere in the British Isles.The limestone crags, where sure-footed feral goats hang out, also support a unique, dwarf race of the grayling butterfly. The grey rock dominates, and in dry summers the grasslands also turn grey, making the place feel almost Mediterranean. In June, the short grassland is yellow with birdsfoot trefoil and rockrose flowers, while in high summer the aptly named bloody cranesbill appears on many of the slopes.Compton Bay, Isle of WightHeaven and Earth meet here. Behind, is a long whaleback of downland, which turns grey, then brown, in summer drought and is grazed by a herd of Galloway cattle. These downs give way to spectacular white cliffs, where peregrine falcons — the fastest living creature on the planet — patrol, and rare plants such as hoary stock grow.The ridgetop path offers deeply memorable views, while the bay provides wondrous sunsets.

Behind, is a long whaleback of downland, which turns grey, then brown, in summer drought and is grazed by a herd of Galloway cattleBelow, there are sandy cliffs which steadily crumble away into the shoreline, providing fresh sand for the best beach on the Isle of Wight (and the standard is high).Rare plants, beetles, bees and Glanville fritillary butterflies breed on the warm, sparsely vegetated cliff face. At low water, a relic fossil forest and dinosaur footprints can be seen. Farmland birds, such as skylarks, linnets and yellow-hammers, abound.Dunkery Beacon, SomersetThe domed, heathery top of Dunkery Beacon, with its distinctive pepperpot cairn, always feels too bleak for me — a monoculture of windswept heather. It is the highest point on Exmoor, haunted by plaintive meadow pipits. But the steep-sided, sheltered combes below the summit are magical and welcoming, with a warm microclimate. They have wonderful ancient names such as Allercombe, Sweetworthy (pronounced Sweetery), Halse Combe and Hanny Combe.

This place wants time to stand still, and to grant it the eternity it deserves.Brandreth \u0026amp Grey Knotts, Lake DistrictI love the high fell tops above and to the south of Honister Pass. I always take the easy route, parking at the youth hostel and going up the old mining tramway to Fleetwith Pike, where I can wander aimless and free.          I must confess that I come here only in midsummer, when grey Herdwick ewes and their black lambs graze the carpet of mat-grassI usually make a special pilgrimage to Innominate Tarn, below Haystacks. For Alfred Wainwright, who wrote the classic guides to the Lakes, this was his favourite place in the world — and it’s certainly one of mine. I must confess that I come here only in midsummer, when grey Herdwick ewes and their black lambs graze the carpet of mat-grass.Yellow tormentil flowers and patches of wild thyme jewel the turf, ring ouzels and wheatears call distantly, and dark mountain ringlet butterflies blunder about in the breeze. Everywhere are little peaty pools, reminding me that rain is seldom far away.Hod Hill, DorsetThis Iron Age hill fort above the River Stour, near Blandford Forum, has impressive fortifications with deeply incised ramparts. The Romans conquered it, constructing their own distinctive fort in the north-west corner. History and nature come together here rather wondrously.          This Iron Age hill fort above the River Stour, near Blandford Forum, has impressive fortifications with deeply incised rampartsIt is a place of rising skylarks, lowering skyscapes and impressive archaeological features. I once found a corn bunting’s nest in a tussock of grass at the foot of an old fence post — and everything seemed right with the world.The White Cliffs Of Dover, KentThis part of England is where chalk cliffs stare out across the Channel to hazy France. The first port of call for many visitors is the National Trust’s Langdon Cliffs centre, set in what was once a series of massive gun emplacement bays above the port of Dover.Many walk the mile-long clifftop path to Mrs Knott’s tearooms in the old South Foreland Lighthouse. The walk is breathtaking, and in spring and autumn offers glimpses of passing swallows and other migrant birds, while fulmars, kittiwakes and ravens hug the brilliant cliffs below.          This part of England is where chalk cliffs stare out across the Channel to hazy FranceThe rough grasses pulsate with insects and the path edges are lined with flowers.History is everywhere, much of it military and relatively modern: gun emplacements, deep shelters, the Dover Patrol Monument, Shakespeare Cliff and, of course, Dover Castle.On calm summer days, Battle of Britain aircraft can be seen overhead. Best of all, it is often cloudy inland, but cloudless along this unique shoreline.Arnside Knott, CumbriaPeople fall deeply in love with this partly-wooded limestone hill above the small town of Arnside, downstream of Kendal. It has a unique feel about it, and offers some of the best sunsets in Britain, with broad vistas over the Lakeland fells.The Knott is criss-crossed by a labyrinth of grey scree paths, which meander through shady woodland and out into grassy or heathery glades. It takes years to get to know it properly, and even then the place surprises you.          People fall deeply in love with this partly-wooded limestone hill above the small town of Arnside, downstream of KendalIf I could afford a second home, mine would be near here, perhaps in the village of Silverdale.In terms of wildlife, this is where north and south meet, and embrace each other.

They said many elderly people would feel more comfortable with cash rather than online payments.Finance campaigner Baroness Altmann said: ‘I find this shocking. The banks should be chasing criminals who are paying in large amounts of cash, not stopping grandparents doing what they love and giving money to their grandchildren.’However, banks including Lloyds, Halifax and TSB say they do not plan to impose similar rules.A spokesman for banking trade body UK Finance said: ‘Banks have to tread a fine line or risk falling foul of money laundering regulations.’ A Santander spokesman said it is ‘offering guidance and support in setting up alternative payment methods’.In reference to Mr Icke’s case, a Nationwide spokesman said: ‘Existing members are able to pay money into their account and transfer this to another.

We will continue to work with the governors to deploy the necessary resources until our nation\u0027s borders are secure,\u0027 the senior officials added.  Some of the troops were seen being airlifted to the border via helicopter on Friday from a Texas military base, with the state\u0027s National Guard expected to deploy an estimated 250 service members within the next 72 hours. Earlier Friday, Arizona and Texas announced that they were preparing to deploy National Guard members to the U.S.-Mexico border in response to Trump\u0027s call for more border security.  Under that law, the National Guard remains under the command and control of each state\u0027s governor, but receives federal pay and benefits (Gov. Ducey pictured Jan 2018) Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said about 150 Guard members would deploy next week. And the Texas Military Department, the umbrella agency over the Texas National Guard branches, said on its Twitter account that it would hold a Friday night news conference on its preparations, though further details were not immediately available.Trump told reporters Thursday that he wants to send between 2,000 and 4,000 National Guard members to the border to help fight illegal immigration and drug trafficking.New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez\u0027s office said Friday that it had not yet deployed any Guard members. The office of California Gov. Jerry Brown did not respond to questions about whether it would deploy troops.That would be lower than the roughly 6,000 National Guard members that former President George W. Bush sent in 2006 during another border security operation, though more than the 1,200 Guard members President Barack Obama sent in 2010.A spokesman for Ducey said Friday that the deployment would be funded under a federal law called Title 32.Under that law, the National Guard remains under the command and control of each state\u0027s governor, but receives federal pay and benefits. The deployments under Bush and Obama also occurred under Title 32.           Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said about 150 Guard members would deploy next week in response to Trump\u0027s demand  Trump told reporters Thursday that he wants to send between 2,000 and 4,000 National Guard members to the border to help fight illegal immigration and drug trafficking          Texas Military Department, the umbrella agency over the Texas National Guard branches, said on its Twitter account that it would hold a Friday night news conference on its preparationsTrump signed a proclamation Wednesday blaming \u0027the lawlessness that continues at our southern border.\u0027           Rep. Raul M. Grijalva (Pictured), D-Ariz. called Trump\u0027s plan \u0027the latest chapter in his reign of terror\u0027 against migrants living in the USEarlier, he said he wanted to use the military to secure the southern border until his proposed border wall was built. Congress has largely refused to fund Trump\u0027s full request for the wall. After plunging at the start of his presidency, the numbers of migrants apprehended at the southwest border have started to rise in line with historical trends. The Border Patrol said it caught around 50,000 people in March, more than three times the number in March 2017.That\u0027s erased a decline for which Trump repeatedly took credit. Border apprehensions still remain well below the numbers when Bush and Obama deployed the Guard to the border.News reports of a caravan of Central American migrants passing through southern Mexico also sparked angry tweets from the president. The caravan of largely Central American migrants never intended to reach the U.S. border, according to organizer Irineo Mujica. But Trump has repeatedly cited it as an example of what he called America\u0027s weak immigration laws.Department of Homeland Security officials have said Guard members could support Border Patrol agents and other law enforcement agencies.   Central American migrants traveling with the annual caravan wait in line to receive food at the sports club where they have been camping out in Matias Romero, Oaxaca State, Mexico on Thursday  Blanca Zunega, 20, is traveling with her two-year-old daughter Michelle in the caravanDHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said this week that guard members could \u0027help look at the technology, the surveillance,\u0027 and that the department might ask for fleet mechanics. Federal law restricts the military from carrying out law enforcement duties.A number of lawmakers slammed the President following his border announcement earlier this week, saying it was a waste of tax-payer money that could be spent on assisting American citizens.Rep. Raul M. Grijalva, D-Ariz. told USA Today that the plan is \u0027the latest chapter in his reign of terror meant to wreak havoc on immigrants and residents of border communities. After his failure to secure funding for his \u0027big beautiful wall,\u0027 he is clearly grasping for straws.\u0027Faulty warning siren sparks fear of a late-night Russian...Share this articleFrom 2006 to 2008, the Guard fixed vehicles, maintained roads, repaired fences and performed ground surveillance. Its second mission in 2010 and 2011 involved more aerial surveillance and intelligence work.Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, now Trump\u0027s energy secretary, also sent about 1,000 Guard members to the border in 2014 in response to a surge in the number of unaccompanied immigrant children crossing the Rio Grande, the river that separates the U.S. and Mexico in the state.About 100 Guardsmen remain deployed as part of that existing state mission.

Osborne denies these accusations.The Russian has featured prominently in US prosecutor Robert Mueller\u0027s investigation over his ties to former chairman of the Trump campaign, Paul Manafort.He has also been accused of illegal wiretapping, extortion, racketeering, money laundering, and death threats against business rivals.Shares in his energy company EN+ dropped 19 per cent on the London Stock Exchange after the sanctions were announced, wiping £1billion from its market value.

SDN stands for \u0027Specially Designated National.\u0027          George Osborne (pictured) joined Deripaska on his yacht in 2008Deripaska, estimated by Forbes magazine to have a net worth of £4.7billion, is the main owner of the conglomerate EN+, which is the co-owner of some of the world\u0027s biggest metals producers, Rusal and Nornickel.Hong Kong-listed Rusal is one of the world\u0027s biggest aluminium producers. It says exports to the United States account for over 10 per cent of its output.Rusal owns assets in Italy, Ireland, Sweden, Nigeria, Guyana, Guinea.According to a Rusal prospectus, its major customers include Glencore, Toyota, and Rio Tinto Alcan.In his life and career, Deripaska has frequently intersected with the Kremlin and Russian officialdom. He holds regular meetings with President Vladimir Putin, he invested heavily in building infrastructure for Russia\u0027s 2014 Sochi winter Olympics, and has said his own interests are inisible from the state\u0027s interests.The mother of Deripaska\u0027s children, Polina, is the daughter of Valentin Yumashev, who was presidential chief of staff under former Russian president Boris Yeltsin. Yumashev later married Yeltsin\u0027s daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko.           Deripaska did business in the 2000s with Paul Manafort (pictured), who later became campaign manager for Donald Trump          \u0027Nobody has been tougher on Russia than I have,\u0027 Trump said at a news conference on TuesdayYeltsin and his entourage were instrumental in elevating Vladimir Putin to power as the anointed successor to the ailing president.Deripaska did business in the 2000s with Paul Manafort, who later became campaign manager for Donald Trump when he was running for president.Last year the Washington Post reported that Manafort sent an email in July 2016 offering Deripaska private briefings about Donald Trump\u0027s presidential campaign. Manafort was chairman of the campaign at the time.Manafort spokesman Jason Maloni has said the email exchanges were \u0027innocuous\u0027 and aimed at collecting money owed by past clients.   Raising the stakes: Senior Trump officials cast the penalties as part of a concerted and ongoing effort by the U.S. to push back against Russian President Vladimir Putin\u0027s government and his inner circle  Industry bigs: Oleg Deripaska, an aluminum magnate whose Rusal is one of the country\u0027s biggest companies and who has ties to ex-Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort is being hit, as is Gazprom CEO Alexi MillerThis latest wave of sanctions come as senior U.S. administration officials cast the penalties as part of a concerted and ongoing effort to push back at  Putin and his inner circle. But Trump has continued to avoid directly criticizing Putin himself, and recently invited the Russian leader to meet with him, possibly at the White House.Still, in recent weeks Trump\u0027s administration has rolled out a series of actions - including several economic and diplomatic steps - to increase pressure on Putin and those in his circle.\u0027Nobody has been tougher on Russia than I have,\u0027 Trump said at a news conference on Tuesday.Rather than punishing Russia for one specific action, the new sanctions are in response to \u0027the totality of the Russian government\u0027s ongoing and increasingly brazen pattern\u0027 of bad behavior, said the officials, who weren\u0027t authorized to comment by name and briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.The sanctions freeze any assets that those targeted have in U.S. jurisdictions and bars Americans from doing business with them.It was not clear whether any of those hit have significant, or any, holdings that would be covered and most of them were warned of possible penalties in January when they were identified as possible targets on lists published by the Treasury and State departments.   Pout of order: Kiril Shamalov, who is believed to be married to Putin\u0027s daughter Katerina Tikhonova, is one of those facing new sanctions  Friends and allies: Igor Rotenberg\u0027s father is one of Putin\u0027s oldest friends while Andrey Kostin heads Russia\u0027s second-largest bank, VTB, which is controlled by the stateThe administration officials said Americans who may currently have business with them would be given guidance about how to wind down that business and avoid running afoul of the sanctions.The officials ticked through a list of activities they said had prompted the U.S. to act, including Russia\u0027s annexation of Crimea, backing separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine, support for Syrian President Bashar Assad, cyber-hacking and attempts to subvert Western democracy.Many of the targets are iniduals and businesses associated with Russia\u0027s energy sector, including those affiliated with state-owned Gazprom. Officials said the goal was to show that those who have benefited financially from Putin\u0027s position of power are fair game for U.S. punishments, noting that many of those being sanctioned are closely tied to Putin himself.Targets include:Kirill Shamalov, who is reportedly Putin\u0027s son-in-law, married to his daughter Katerina Tikhonova, although neither Putin nor the Kremlin have acknowledged that she is his daughter.Igor Rotenberg, the son of Arkady Rotenberg, a friend of Putin\u0027s since they were teenagers.Andrey Kostin, named among government officials, heads the nation\u0027s second-largest bank, VTB, which is controlled by the state.Alexei Miller, the longtime head of the state-controlled Gazprom natural gas giant. Both Miller and Kostin are longtime key members of Putin\u0027s team.          Victim: Sergei Skripal, a Russian who spied for Britain, was poisoned with a nerve agent prompting tit-for-tat expulsion of diplomats. His daughter Yulia (left) was also left seriously illOther oligarchs on the list include some top names on the Forbes\u0027 list of billionaires, aren\u0027t part of Putin\u0027s inner circle but like any other billionaire tycoons in Russia they vie for the Kremlin\u0027s attention to preserve and extend their business empires.Many of the Russian oligarchs and politicians and affiliated businesses had already been identified by the Treasury and State Department as potential targets on a list that was compiled and published in January.One of those hit by Friday\u0027s sanctions, Konstantin Kosachev, the chairman of the Russian Federation Council\u0027s foreign affairs committee, expressed surprise he had not already been blacklisted by the U.S.\u0027As far as I am concerned the only thing I\u0027m surprised at is that this didn\u0027t happen earlier,\u0027 he told the Interfax news agency. \u0027I never made secret of my criticism of the U.S. foreign policy, and I will not change my stance.\u0027The sanctions freeze any assets that those targeted have in U.S. jurisdictions and bars Americans from doing business with them.           On their way home: Russian diplomats kicked out of the U.S. were picked up by government bus in Moscow on Sunday, while later in the week American embassy staff flew back to the U.S.But the administration said it would give guidance to Americans who may currently have business with them about how to wind down that business and avoid running afoul of the sanctions.The Trump administration used a variety of legal mechanisms to implement the sanctions, including the Countering America\u0027s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act.Known as CAATSA, the law was overwhelmingly passed by Congress in 2017 and signed by President Donald Trump despite some objections. The law aims to punish Russia for interfering in the U.S. election as well as actions intended to subvert democracy in Europe. The law also authorizes the president to impose sanctions on Iran for destabilizing activity in the Middle East and North Korea for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.Last month, the U.S. targeted 19 Russians and five other entities with sanctions in the first use of the law. The administration has also expelled dozens of Russian diplomats and shut down two Russian consulates in response to Russian behavior, including the poisoning of an ex-spy in Britain that has been blamed on Moscow."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/07/11/4AE7C43600000578-5588811-image-m-23_1523097957393.jpg","title":"Prince Charles dons grass skirt traditional ceremony Vanuatu historic one day visit","story":"    The prince received a warm welcome in Vanuatu, where he was made a high chief in a colourful ceremony          Prince Charles donned a grass skirt for the traditional welcoming ceremony, where he was honoured as a distinguished guest   The prince also took a sip from a cup of special kava, known as Royal Kava, before planting two trees and trying out the local skirtware  The prince immersed himself into every aspect of Vanuatu\u0027s culture, and was not reluctant to try on traditional skirts          The prince arrived to a rapturous welcome in Vanuatu where many of the local said they were delighted he had taken the trouble to visit          Prince Charles visited the Chief\u0027s  Nakamal, a traditional meeting place for chiefs where he was given a VIP reception          Prince Charles in Brisbane joked he will never again be able to fit into a pair of \u0027budgie smugglers\u0027 -

We can\u0027t even count all the wounded,\u0027 said Mohammed, a young doctor inside Douma.\u0027There are some wounded who we couldn\u0027t operate on in time, and they died,\u0027 he said.            Smoke rising after Syrian government airstrikes hit in the town of Douma, in eastern Ghouta region east of Damascus, Syria, Saturday, April. 7, 2018          The government of President Bashar al-Assad has made no secret of its desire to capture al of the Eastern Ghouta area   Douma is the last rebel-controlled town in Syria\u0027s Eastern Ghouta, a sprawling suburb of Damascus that was once the opposition\u0027s bastion on the edge of the capital  Relatives of Syrians believed to be held by rebels wait on the Syrian government-held side of the Wafideen checkpoint on April 5, 2018, as evacuations of the last rebel-held pocket of the former opposition bastion stallThe shelling has not all been one way. Six civilians were also killed and dozens more wounded as Douma rebels shelled the capital Damascus on Saturday, Syrian state media said.State television broadcast live footage from a hospital in Damascus, where pools of blood stained the floor and the wounded could be heard wailing in pain.One woman cried over the lifeless body of a young man on a stretcher. Another said she had been riding in a taxi when the shelling started, and the car crashed head-on into a wall.President Assad is keen to recapture Ghouta to eliminate the opposition from the outskirts of Damascus and end years of rocket fire on the capital.The regime\u0027s offensive on Ghouta since February 18 has killed more than 1,600 civilians. It sliced the area into three isolated pockets - each held by different rebel factions.The first two were evacuated under Russian-brokered deals last month that saw more than 46,000 rebels and civilians bussed to opposition-held Idlib province in the northwest.

Created by Simon Fuller, the impresario behind the Spice Girls and Pop Idol, they sold more than 17 million records before disbanding in 2004.Of the seven members, blonde Hannah Spearritt has been, arguably, the most successful since the split, making the transition to television to star in ITV sci-fi series Primeval and winning roles in Casualty and EastEnders. Yet role after role has cast the shy singer as a tomboy, an image she eventually tired of.Then, during S Club 7’s most recent reunion in 2015, fans were introduced to a new-look Hannah. By then 34, Hannah posed in revealing tops that drew attention to an embonpoint that put her co-stars in the shade.What Hannah didn’t admit was that her newfound curves were not entirely natural. In August 2013, like 25,000 other British women each year, she had a breast augmentation, taking her pert small-B cup to a curvy C. The change looked all the more dramatic given her slender size eight, 5ft 3in frame, prompting fans to compliment her new, ‘sophisticated’ look.Yet behind the glamour, Hannah was desperately sick, suffering from crippling fatigue-like symptoms that would destroy her health, career, relationship and nearly her life.That was before an ‘explant’ – or removal of implants – in 2016, and now the 36-year-old is keen to tell the story of ‘the hardest, most traumatic four years of my life’ to help others.Tales from The Supervet Noel Fitzpatrick: The incredible...I\u0027m changing my rooms! How celebrity interior designer Linda...Share this articleAs far as Hannah is concerned there are two, clear culprits to her misery: the textured silicone gel pockets or breast implants she had put in.She recalls: ‘My operation was performed by a top Harley Street cosmetic surgeon. I paid top dollar.’ (Breast augmentation can cost anywhere from £3,000 to £8,000.)She explains when we meet for lunch: ‘I never felt womanly enough on top. I’d compare myself to the other girls in the band during photoshoots and was jealous of their beautiful curves.’          Hannah, pictured top right, shot to fame with S Club 7 at the turn of the centuryAlthough pleased to bid farewell to her hated padded bras, it wasn’t long before Hannah’s health began to suffer. ‘Within six months my hair started to fall out in clumps,’ she says. ‘Then I started sleeping more and more – eventually 22 hours a day. I couldn’t move from bed because my muscles were aching. I lost balance, I was always freezing cold and my brain fog meant I couldn’t remember anything.’After she needed paramedic attention during a charity bike ride in June 2014, Hannah’s then partner of two years, personal trainer Adam Thomas, insisted she seek medical attention. ‘I went to a private GP,’ she recalls. ‘He said I was anxious and depressed, and prescribed a maximum dose of Prozac.’Her symptoms persisted, and within a few weeks she was ‘unable to peel myself off the sofa’.          Hannah said she noticed soon after having the surgery she noticed her hair starting to fall outWith a 13-date reunion tour approaching and desperate to boost her energy levels, Hannah visited a psychiatrist – who prescribed a maximum dose of epilepsy and anti-anxiety drug Pregabalin.‘The symptoms eased. It felt as if I had my life back,’ she remembers.The drugs got her through the tour, but it quickly became evident that strong medication was merely masking symptoms – and by the end of the physically demanding month, she felt ‘sicker than I was before’. Appointments with private endocrinologists, immunologists and gastroenterologists revealed nothing but a ‘borderline underactive thyroid’.She says: ‘Doctors didn’t listen. I felt like I was dying. I could barely walk.’Flippant doctors simply made her condition worse by prescribing a daily cosh of sleeping tablets, antihistamines and anti-depressants which Hannah took just to ‘get her through the day’.

Speaking in her London office – a converted warehouse on the Chelsea embankment overlooking the Thames – Gina is clearly fond of Meghan, and it is easy to see why the two women had such a strong connection.A self-made entrepreneur and businesswoman with an easy charm and piercing green eyes, she worked as a model before moving from her native South Africa to Britain, where she had connections, including her brother-in-law, BBC journalist John Simpson.Gina and her husband Mark established Kruger Cowne Talent Management and today, more than 20 years on, their clients include Sir Richard Branson, Cher and Elle Macpherson. She has spent decades rubbing shoulders with celebrities, yet Meghan has made a lasting impression.It started with the first time they met in October 2014, when Gina and Kruger Cowne were working with the One Young World conference, a youth summit to inspire 18 to 30-year-olds – and Meghan, who was starring in US legal drama Suits, expressed a keen interest in becoming involved.\u0027When I arrived at Meghan\u0027s hotel room, her then boyfriend, Toronto chef Cory Vitiello, opened the door. She was in a towelling bathrobe with her hair tied back.          Gina is one of only a handful of people who know the inside story of the whirlwind courtship between Meghan and Harry (pictured together on a recent trip to Northern Ireland) \u0027We just clicked. We spoke on the phone and through emails a number of times before actually meeting, but it was an instant connection.\u0027We hugged as if we had known each other for ages. She was delightful – warm and personable. And hugely charismatic.\u0027I\u0027ve been in the business a long time and I know that\u0027s not something you can train someone to be. \u0027You\u0027ve either got it or you haven\u0027t and Meghan is a really warm and genuine person. She just has it.\u0027There\u0027s the eye contact and then the connection. She instantly brings you right into her world. \u0027What people don\u0027t realise about Meghan is that she is ferociously intelligent. Even then she was starting to think about her career after Suits.\u0027She was interested in humanitarian and philanthropic causes – and in animal rights issues, too, but her main focus was and I believe still is women\u0027s rights. She wanted to be recognised as a humanitarian.\u0027She wanted to develop her own causes and the youth summits were perfect for her. Soon after the conference, I asked if she\u0027d like to do more events and she said \u0027Yes!\u0027, so we signed a contract to represent her and I became her agent.\u0027When Meghan was back on set, she would fire off emails to Gina, thanking her for her support.          Gina says it was just weeks after their first meeting, when the couple were on holiday in Botswana, that the deal was sealed, and Harry and Meghan (pictured together in Northern Ireland) knew they would be togetherGina recalls: \u0027She whispered it so quietly I had to ask her to repeat it. \u0027I couldn\u0027t believe what I was hearing but I think she could barely believe it either. We were both extremely excited. \u0027I jokingly asked if she knew what she was letting herself in for and she said: \u0027Well, it\u0027s going to be an experience and at least it will be a fun night.\u0027\u0027After the date, she was telling me what a great guy he was, a real gentleman, genuinely nice, and when I asked if she would see him again she said: \u0027Well, it looks like it.\u0027 \u0027In fact, Harry asked her out again the next day and after just a few dates, invited Meghan to join him at a secret hideaway in Botswana. There, he escorted her on her first wildlife safari. For Harry, the location held a special significance: Prince Charles took him and his brother William to Africa shortly after the death of Princess Diana.On their return, Meghan told Gina how they had stayed in a tent with spectacular views and had bonded over a shared love of wildlife and conservation.\u0027I\u0027m sure that the Botswana trip is what clinched the deal,\u0027 says Gina.\u0027I knew that would do it for them – Africa has that effect. When they were back, she showed me the most wonderful photographs of the two of them on her phone. \u0027They were so clearly already in love. She told me it was serious and they had started discussing the future.

That society was apartheid-era South Africa, which he chronicled with meticulous patience and a certain formal detachment, his acutely observational gaze illuminating the lives of ordinary people living under a system that separated and controlled them according to skin colour.From the early 1960s, when he began photographing the landscape and people of South Africa, Goldblatt shot in black and white, later saying: “During those years, colour seemed too sweet a medium to express the anger, disgust and fear that apartheid inspired.” His detached approach reflected his own sense of being an outsider – his Lithuanian Jewish family had originally settled in South Africa to escape religious persecution – but it also allowed him to present the complexities of life under apartheid in a way that contrasted with the often dramatic images made by visiting photojournalists.This photograph, titled Shop assistant, Orlando West, Soweto, 1972, is a case in point. The young girl is poised, stylish, even languorous, yet with a suggestion of defiance in her straight-to-camera gaze. Around her, the rows of canned goods suggest a society marooned in a postwar era. She is a child of the townships, of oppression, uprisings and struggle. And yet, the image insists, she is also an ordinary young woman whose life is not entirely defined by the system that exerts control over so much of her life – where she lives, works and travels, who she befriends, socialises with and marries.Goldblatt once said: “I would look at Edward Weston’s work and envy the freedom to be lyrical... to photograph a landscape apparently without concern for the implications of its possession.” His work, though, has its own moments of beauty and they are made all the more striking by the context out of which they emerged.Structures of Dominion and Democracy by David Goldblatt is published by Steidl Verlag, £45"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/845e0cbfb9e567db8df468a1c9e3085c914b9200/0_0_5486_3618/master/5486.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4f4e3f2ac1b25cbbbe6193b6caa35205 960w","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"Protests in Gaza, the death of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr and the Commonwealth Games in Australia – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79ccf365eb0eb05da5790c3358ef423986e153e6/0_364_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?w=3000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de4fb221a0de1ac471e8d731a4e80923 6000w","title":"the mane attraction hair tossing horses in pictures","story":"Haas grew up around animals, which perhaps explains why her horses look so at ease. “The most difficult part was to keep them straight to the camera,” she says.

Do you love me?” Rose Tremain’s mother kept asking her daughter at the end of her life. “And I’d say: ‘Yes, of course I do.’ But I never have and I never will because you didn’t show me love when I needed it,” the novelist says now, as if her mother, Jane, were in the room with us.After more than 40 years of not drawing on her own life in her fiction, Tremain has written a memoir. This slim, elegant – sometimes shocking – study of maternal failure is also a love letter to her nanny, “the kindest person I’ve ever known”, the author’s “saviour” and “angel”. Her childhood, she writes in Rosie: Scenes from a Vanished Life, was defined by one heartbreaking wish: “I didn’t want Jane to be my mother I wanted Nan to be my mother.” The scenes of the title are moments of “particular emotional intensity”, Tremain explains, usually episodes of “dereliction or cruelty” on the part of her parents – in particular, her mother. “She really didn’t like us, either me or my sister. And I don’t quite know why.”Materially, their postwar, upper-middle-class upbringing “was quite privileged and easy”, she says. “And in an emotional way really hard.” This was a world in which the pre-lunch gin and tonics flowed more freely than affection, and children were expected to be seldom seen, at least not by their parents. In her memory, their house in Chelsea, “a pleasant but ordinary little London borough then”, is ided between the “frozen world” of her parents on the lower floors, and at the top of the house “this very warm, loving heart with Nan,” with whom she shared a bedroom for her first 10 years. Her father, Keith Thomson, unerringly referred to as a “failed playwright” (“He wasn’t very good”, she says) wrote in an office on a little landing: “Shhh, daddy’s working …” they were told every time they went up the stairs.When she was 10, he walked out on the family for a younger woman, rupturing her childhood into a before and after “the great casting away”. Her mother had a breakdown and promptly married one of their circle (“the grown ups were playing musical beds”) Rosie and Jo were sent to boarding school (an exile of chilblains and constant hunger) and worst of all – Nan was sent away.A natural storyteller, Tremain talks in eloquent anecdotes with the precise intonation of a distinguished actor – and flashes of gossipy humour. Rare is the interview that doesn’t mention her Georgian house on the outskirts of Norwich. And yes, early spring sunshine fills the lovely sitting room, where tall windows give a view on to sloping lawns and wide Norfolk skies. “When I first saw this house,” she recalls, “I’d come out of a very unhappy orce, all very frantic. I remember walking into this room and the elderly couple who were here were eating cucumber sandwiches and watching the Test match. I thought – this is something else, I think I have to buy this.”That was in 1985, and for the last couple of decades she has shared it with the biographer Richard Holmes. “Richard is sort of a perfect partner for me. We have such a wonderful ongoing conversation. It’s very rare that you meet a soulmate, isn’t it? But we are,” she says matter-of-factly. As her first two marriages were “turbulent”, it was not until her mid-40s, she says, that her life became “sensible and stable”: one of the reasons why Rosie ends on the brink of adulthood. “I don’t want to write the sort of memoir that slags people off and takes vengeance,” she says firmly. “I don’t admire writers who do that. It’s cheap, angry. I’m not, I hope, cheap or angry.”She had hoped the book might help her both understand and forgive her parents – it didn’t. A sorry incident (borrowed in her 2010 novel, Trespass) when her mother got stuck in a lime-green bathing costume on her 13th birthday has ruined the day ever since, “hard on the people who have to share it with me now”. But by sheer “force of mind” she long ago resolved to stop being persecuted by feelings of loss about her absent father. “It’s over. Finished,” she decided. She couldn’t have written the memoir had her parents, especially her mother, still been alive: “It would have been too hurtful to her.”The book arose out of a conversation with her daughter, Eleanor, a psychotherapist, during one of their weekly lunches. “She said to me: ‘Come on Mum, I want to know about Nan,’ ” Tremain recalls. “It was an absolutely overwhelming experience. And of course, being a therapist, Eleanor could facilitate the conversation very well. I don’t know what they thought in the restaurant, me sort of weeping.”It was Nan’s affection that saved her sanity and stopped her passing on the mistakes of her mother, “who had no schooling in love”, to Eleanor and ultimately to her two young grandchildren. (Although she is the least autobiographical of authors, Tremain’s emotionally inadequate mothers – in, for example, The Gustav Sonata, and Sacred Country – now seem striking.) After the lunch, Tremain came home and started looking through old photograph albums. “I thought, I do have very strong feelings about all this. I’ll probably die quite soon and it will be lost.” So she started writing.One of the most memorable scenes records a “little epiphany” she experienced at school when she was around 13 or 14, the intensity felt as she describes it all these years later: “We had been playing tennis, it was summer, early evening, a very beautiful light. I remember standing in this hay meadow, it had just been cut, so there was that absolutely wonderful scent of new-mown hay, and thinking, this is going to go in about five minutes, how can I can capture this? This feeling of almost transcendence? The beauty of this place?” So she wrote a story about it, “locking it in ... for ever”. She can’t remember whether the story was any good. “I don’t suppose it was,” she says. But it confirmed in her the certainty that “writing was the only thing that I wanted to do”.Nan died in 1964 when Tremain was at university, and it is one of her sadnesses that she never knew of her literary success, especially as she would have taken more pride in it than either of her parents.Her early novels were critically well received, but it wasn’t until her fifth, Restoration – “a ludicrously flamboyant, noisy, wild, sort of orchestral thing”, she says now – that she really made her name. (It is the only one of her books her father, jealous of her success, admitted to enjoying.) Set in the court of Charles II, “a mirror” to the explosion of Thatcherite materialism at the time, it also earned her the label “historical novelist”, which, she says, has followed her around ever since.In fact, several of her novels now seem prescient in their timeliness, tackling issues such as transsexuality in Sacred Country (1992), and immigration in The Road Home, which won the Orange prize in 2008 and which, post-Brexit, she’s updating for TV. Sacred Country was described as “groundbreaking” by Peter Tatchell in a new introduction for its reissue last year, but when it first came out, “People said: ‘What? This is such a marginalised subject. Why’s she writing about this?’” she says.Long part of the literary establishment, Tremain was one of only six women on the inaugural 1983 Granta best young British novelists list that included Amis, Barnes, McEwan, Ishiguro et al. It’s hard to think of a contemporary novelist to rival her imaginative range: her fiction roams the world from 17th‑century Denmark to 21st-century London. But, although Restoration was shortlisted for the Booker in 1989 (losing out to Ishiguro’s The Remains of the Day), the prize has eluded her, perhaps, it has been suggested, due to a sniffiness about historical fiction. Then Hilary Mantel marched into the 16th century and made off with the trophy – twice. “Yes, it’s quite annoying isn’t it,” Tremain laughs.Does the Booker still bother her? “Well, it does slightly,” she says with unwriterly candour. “I think, really? All those books which have had on the whole, such great acclaim, why has that never happened? But it annoys me that it bothers me. And now we’ve got the Americans in it, it’s gone, hasn’t it?” She has been a judge twice, in 1988 and 2000. Did she enjoy it? The first time, yes the second, not so much.Her office is lined with box-files of cuttings: she likes a Kipling image – “riddling the fire of your research” – to describe her writing process. Holmes works upstairs. They meet for lunch. Lots of coffee. And clock off around 6.30pm. “Sometimes a bit scratchy, sometimes a bit silent.” One of the great things about living with another writer, she says, is not having to explain “the mood of slight preoccupation. It’s a great relief. Because if you are doing creative work you are bound to have bad times with it, aren’t you?” Both she and Holmes are determined “to keep working until we fall over or our minds go completely, what he calls ‘the boots-on strategy’.”She hit a crisis last April, after the death of her editor Penny Hoare, with whom she had worked since her first book, Sadler’s Birthday, in 1976. Penny would come to stay and they would go through each manuscript line by line. “She would sit there,” Tremain says pointing at a chair next to her – “very upright. She would only want roast chicken for dinner. We would talk for two days.” Her longest book, Music and Silence, “took us three days. I think we ran out of chicken.” Penny had Rosie by her bed when she died, Tremain says, her voice catching. “She would just unerringly put her hands on all the weak points of the book, quite uncanny to me.”For the first time, Tremain doubted whether she would be able to carry on, but somehow her joy in writing still hasn’t wavered. She cites Amis’s observation that if he were not a writer life would be “thin”. But she’s not very hopeful about the world at large: “I can hardly watch the news,” she admits. “With war and climate change and Brexit and Trump – it’s never been worse in my 70-odd years of life. I think we live in really very terrifying times.”Outside of her study, she finds solace in the cafe in Norwich’s John Lewis. “A cheese scone and a cup of coffee and I’m completely at peace,” she says. “Give me a tearoom anywhere. So many things that we do in our life you have to do. Pretty much must do, must do, must do. But you can just decide to be in your tearoom, or not. They are spaces outside time.”And the novel she is working on now?Well, it begins in a teashop – and ends in the jungle of Borneo.“If I can keep on writing fiction, that’s a tiny contribution to people’s mental health,” she says. “You can pick up one of my books and think: ‘Oh well, for the next half an hour, I’m all right.’” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f418d1af33e22942422b00d707fa39e63a471f15/0_2458_5191_3114/master/5191.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=39bb8abb03b06700c946d5e8cabd0a57 1240w","title":"east end small business artist relocate eailway arch rent rise","story":"Spiralling rents are driving growing numbers of artists and small businesses out of London’s East End, with the problem expected to spread to other cities around the UK.In many cases, traders are being replaced by cafes and workspaces designed for people working on laptops.Of those that remain, many are struggling for survival, as business rates also went up substantially last year for the first time in seven years.Frances Northrop of the New Economics Foundation says: “Imagine London without the small businesses of Portobello Road, Brick Lane, Columbia Road and Chinatown. They are being driven out by the cold logic of ever-increasing rents.”Many small independent businesses are based in railway arches across London, often owned by Network Rail or Transport for London.Network Rail has almost 4,500 arches across the country, with two-thirds of those in London. Transport for London, meanwhile, owns about 2,000 commercial units across London.Derec Hickman of Chu’s Garage in Hackney, who runs the Guardians of the Arches, a group that is open to traders in the rest of the UK, says: “The action is spreading from London to other cities. What’s happening to us will happen to them.”Five of his neighbours are looking to leave, and one trader has already moved out of the arches due to the crippling rent increases.The EETG is proposing a London working rent: an affordable formula for small and micro-businesses akin to the London living rent, and has received backing from the mayors of Hackney and Tower Hamlets.The New Economics Foundation is in the process of working out a formula. Guardian Money spoke to a number of small businesses affected by the rent hikes.The bespoke furniture maker was one of the first tenants at Bayford Street Industrial Units in Hackney, built by the Greater London Council in the 1980s to attract local business and jobs to a then-run down area.This year, unable to meet the now private landlord’s demands to double the rent, Poetstyle, with its 15 furniture makers, moved to Hainault, on the border of London and Essex. Managing director Charlie Fox says it has just moved out of its second workshop in a railway arch in Hackney after facing a similar rent hike there.He says Network Rail originally asked for £31 per sq ft, which was then reduced to £18 until September, but going up to £24 thereafter. He was originally paying £14.“It’s not really viable,” he says. “It is tough, ever since Brexit, but I just can’t hike the price of a sofa because I’m up against cheap imports.”Sarah Haque and her son launched their company in 2004 in Cheshire Street, Shoreditch, to create and sell T-shirts and other products designed by London and UK-based artists.Their business rate has gone up from £1,100 to £16,000 a year, while the annual rent charged by their private landlord is rising to £29,000 plus VAT in a stepped five-year increase, compared with £8,500 in 2006. No improvements have been made to the space, she says.Haque says she had to reduce her staff from 10 to four. “It’s very, very sad because we’ve been here more than 10 years and it’ll be sad to leave. We can’t increase our business, we are late in paying the rent and late in paying salaries. It’s just a mess.”Best known for its laser-cut Perspex jewellery, Tatty Devine is run by Rosie Wolfenden and Harriet Vine, who founded the business together in 1999, and were awarded MBEs for services to the fashion industry in 2013.They opened a shop in London’s Brick Lane in 2000 – but Wolfenden says the shop rent has quadrupled since then.“It’s getting to the point where it’s unaffordable,” she says. “It’s driving out so many creatives from Hackney or Tower Hamlets. A lot have gone to Kent, to Margate.”She notes that there are lot of empty shops in east London.Wolfenden adds: “If we were to inflate our prices to match the rent and rate rises, we would go out of business.”She says the business is surviving because it includes retail, wholesale and e-commerce, and could not have been set up in the same location if she and Vine were starting it today.The MOT garage in a railway arch in London Fields, east London, was founded by Quang Chu 30 years ago.He is battling a rent increase from Network Rail, his landlord, which originally wanted to hike the rent from £18,000 to £38,000 (or £35,000 if the garage gave up its secured tenancy).Network Rail is now asking for a stepped increase to £26,500 in the first year, going up to £34,000 in the third year, says the firm.Ten other traders in the arches were put under the same pressure, says Derec Hickman, who married into the Vietnamese family that founded Chu’s Garage.The garage and one other trader are due to go to arbitration, where the rent will be set by independent assessors.What the owners sayOn the claim that it is hiking rents in order to pocket a bigger profit from the sale of property, it says “this is completely untrue. Any reviews are part of business-as-usual activity. The sale will be based on past performance and receipts of the estate over a number of years”.Transport for LondonGraeme Craig, director of commercial development, says: “We are committed to encouraging erse, small businesses as vital to London’s economy. Our leases are flexible … and we are working with Tower Hamlets and Hackney and the EETG to explore how we might change our policies to allow smaller businesses to continue to flourish on our estate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ea892ad58eb3941f9c3f6fe4bf1775f76a42b0b/0_69_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c525e255b0b9f07f38d6988d607984f7 1240w","title":"global inequality tipping point 2030","story":"World leaders are being warned that the continued accumulation of wealth at the top will fuel growing distrust and anger over the coming decade unless action is taken to restore the balance.Analysts suggest wealth has become concentrated at the top because of recent income inequality, higher rates of saving among the wealthy, and the accumulation of assets. The wealthy also invested a large amount of equity in businesses, stocks and other financial assets, which have handed them disproportionate benefits.The research was commissioned by Liam Byrne, the former Labour cabinet minister, as part of a gathering of MPs, academics, business leaders, trade unions and civil society leaders focused on addressing the problem.The actor Michael Sheen, who has opted to scale back his Hollywood career to campaign against high-interest credit providers, was among those supporting the calls.The hope is to create pressure for global action when leaders of the G20 group of nations gather for a summit in Buenos Aires in November. Byrne, who organised the first OECD global parliamentary conference on inclusive growth, said he believed global inequality was “now at a tipping point”.“If we don’t take steps to rewrite the rules of how our economies work, then we condemn ourselves to a future that remains unequal for good,” he said. “That’s morally bad, and economically disastrous, risking a new explosion in instability, corruption and poverty.”In a sign of the concern about the accumulation of wealth in the hands of so few, the move has gained support from across the political ide.George Freeman, the Tory MP and former head of the prime minister’s policy board, said: “While mankind has never seen such income inequality, it is also true that mankind has never experienced such rapid increases in living standards. Around the world billions of people are being lifted out of poverty at a pace never seen before. But the extraordinary concentration of global wealth today – fuelled by the pace of technological innovation and globalisation – poses serious challenges.“If the system of capitalist liberal democracy which has triumphed in the west is to pass the big test of globalisation – and the assault from radical Islam as well as its own internal pressures from post-crash austerity – we need some new thinking on ways to widen opportunity, share ownership and philanthropy. Fast.”Demands for action from the group include improving productivity to ensure wages rise and reform of capital markets to promote greater equality.Danny Dorling, professor of geography at the University of Oxford, said the scenario in which the super-rich accumulated even more wealth by 2030 was a realistic one.“Even if the income of the wealthiest people in the world stops rising dramatically in the future, their wealth will still grow for some time,” he said. “The last peak of income inequality was in 1913. We are near that again, but even if we reduce inequality now it will continue to grow for one to two more decades.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d959b82caac7655e6820bcf09c4b67ebcb74828a/0_75_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e89059239371b5b4a5e9b7cbff062cbc 1240w","title":"charlie kirk turning point usa universities free speech debate","story":"With universities in an ‘existential crisis’, Turning Point USA sells a safe space for conservatives who have convinced themselves they are the embattled minorityAnyone who regularly reads a US newspaper knows that universities in this country are in an existential crisis. No, not because of decades of underfunding, or the partly related ballooning university administrations, but because of “postmodernism” and “safe spaces”. It is one of the few things conservatives and liberals agree on these days. The dominance of “fake courses” and “political correctness” is a major theme in conservative media, from Fox News to the Wall Street Journal, as well as liberal media like the New York Times and, yes, even the Guardian.Almost all accounts of alleged censorship of “conservative voices” are based on events at private universities, mostly Ivy League schools in the north-east, as well as some “public Ivies”, notably the University of California at Berkeley. But how bad is the situation in the “real America”, ie that vast space between the coasts that is sometimes, derogatively, referred to as “the flyover states”?To find out, I attended an event at my own university, the University of Georgia (UGA), a public university in a deep-red state. Like most of the universities I have taught at in the US, UGA has a fairly apolitical campus, where only a few usual suspects organize small events around issues like LBTQ rights and the occupation of Palestine. Most students come from Republican homes, holding fairly conservative views without necessarily realizing it. For example, Reagan’s statement that “government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem”, revolutionary in 1981, is considered apolitical common sense by many of my students.As I approach the building where the event is held, I see a surprisingly large university police presence. I count at least six UGAPD officers, of which three would also be in the lecture hall during the whole event. This excessive police presence reinforces the impression that “conservatives” are embattled on campus, even though I am not aware of any physical attack on or credible threat to rightwing organizations or students at UGA in the past years. The few protesters, including the inevitable Democratic Socialists of America, seem resigned to being an irrelevant side note to the event.After signing in and picking up some free goodies from the well-stacked TPUSA table – such as “BDS  BS” and “Socialism Sucks!” buttons and stickers – I go into the large lecture hall, which will soon be almost filled. Some 250 students attend the event, which is a large turnout for a midweek political event at UGA. I guesstimate that some 50 students were protesters, 50 were curious attendees and 150 were true sympathizers – although the number of Make America Great Again hats and Stars and Stripes clothing was disappointingly low.After a quick, and nervous, introduction by the local chapter president, Kirk took the stage to enthusiastic applause. At first sight, Kirk is an unlikely hero of rightwing students. He did not attend college and believes fewer people should go to college. On the other hand, that is also part of his appeal among conservatives: the self-made man, untainted by progressive universities, who knows things because the truth doesn’t need a degree.After a quick pandering to the home crowd, saying he supported Georgia against Alabama in the College Football Playoff National Championship, he starts his attack on the universities. The story is simple, really: universities are full of Marxist professors, who force students to take irrelevant courses, which indoctrinate them with postmodernism and socialism – the fact that these two are diametrically opposed is but a detail. While many students raise their hands when asked whether they have to take “irrelevant courses” for their major, it is unclear whether these are of the Marxist and postmodern persuasion Kirk spoke about.To back his claims up, he states that Karl Marx’s The Communist Manifesto is the most assigned book in college. This is a popular claim among rightwing media, based on outdated results from the highly problematic Open Syllabus Project. A more recent count has the writing guide The Elements of Style as the most assigned text, with The Communist Manifesto coming third, behind Plato’s Republic. Interestingly, Marx did not even make the top 10 among the so maligned Ivy League schools, which do have Samuel Huntington’s The Clash of Civilizations, a favorite among conservatives and radical right alike, as the second most assigned book!The attack on Marxists in higher education leads to a question by one of the protesters, a self-acclaimed Marxist (“I think”), who exemplifies the lazy left’s response to rightwing challenges on campus. Inarticulate and opinionated rather than informed, he becomes the perfect “leftwing” punching bag for Kirk, who happily gives him excessive time to field questions, shooting back with specific clarifications, which overwhelm the student, and thereby “prove” Kirk’s intellectual and ideological superiority.After that much of the lecture focuses on guns, in which Kirk presents himself as a staunch defender of the NRA and the AR-15. In addition to an excellent one-liner, “there is no first amendment without the second amendment”, he throws out various statistics about guns in the US and abroad, which make him look rational and well-informed, even though many of the statistics are from dodgy studies or are presented out of context. Moreover, Kirk uses an old debating trick: reduce the general discussion to one small specific issue, then argue that the specific issue doesn’t explain the broader issue, and therefore claim that the broader critique is wrong.After the inarticulate Marxist has regained control of the media, the lecture turns into a student version of a Fox News show, and I decide to call it a night. The next morning, when I wake up, I realize why I was so underwhelmed by my night with Kirk (and the inarticulate Marxist).In essence, Kirk is just Fox News for college students: overly confident rhetoric, backed up by at best fudged data, taking down a far left straw man. Moreover, in much of the “real America”, including at their university campuses, Kirk is part of the political mainstream, selling a safe space for white conservatives who have convinced themselves that they are the embattled minority."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a3a6b367e6daaf61c2b8d437c33f5a761e49152/209_72_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=07e42ada51c49d43d29897188cf40071 1240w","title":"entebbe film annoy left and right thank heavens","story":"A drama about the 1976 Israeli raid to free hostages at Entebbe treats the politics with admirable nuanceWhen Entebbe is released next month, most cinema audiences will enjoy an exceptional drama documentary. With luck, it should also annoy all the right people for all the right reasons. Supporters of the Israeli government will protest at how a great act of daring – the 1976 Entebbe airport rescue by Israeli special forces of Jewish passengers held by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Baader-Meinhof gang – ends with an appeal for Israel to negotiate with its enemies. That the film-makers show a compassionate German terrorist disobeying orders to kill Jewish hostages in the seconds before the Israelis soldiers reach them will not please the right either, I imagine.The pseudo-left will denounce the film because, when all its politics play out, it is still a story of Israeli heroism and still presents Israel as a lifeboat state for the victims of European and Arab antisemitism as well as an oppressor of Palestinians.Fewer will comment on the shift in the world and the shift in our sensibility since the 20th century. I cannot imagine anyone making a morally complex drama today about the battle between Hamas and Israel, the Syrian bloodbath or any modern conflict with the possible exceptions of the struggles of the Kurds and Ukrainians.You can map how far we have moved by looking at the polemics of the past. In 1950, Bertrand Russell mocked the “fallacy of the superior virtue of the oppressed”. Generally, it was an excuse offered by oppressors. Victorian society denied women property rights and the vote, but justified itself by saying the dainty wife had an angelic nature which sexual equality would ruin. Naturally, it never entertained the notion that men would undergo spiritual improvement if they were stripped of their rights, too.The fallacy could also be found in the minds of opponents of the status quo. The old socialists romanticised the working class as nobler and kinder than the greedy bourgeoisie. Yet if they truly believed poverty and slums eradicated selfish inidualism, they would have campaigned for everyone to enjoy the benefits of a poor education, bad food and overwork. “Obvious as this argument is,” said Russell, “many Socialist and Communist intellectuals consider it de rigueur to pretend to find the proletariat more amiable than other people, while professing a desire to abolish the conditions which, according to them, alone produce good human beings.”Until recently, it was commonplace to imagine oppression overseas also ennobled its victims. It was not enough, for instance, to say apartheid was wrong. If you looked at how members of the anti-apartheid movement were honoured, the writers who endorsed its struggle garlanded with Nobel prizes and Nelson Mandela turned from politician to saint, you might have concluded that the more oppression there, was the better humanity would become.Or, to take an example closer to home, leftists have produced whole books denouncing conservative gays as traitors. It never occurred to the authors that once the right stopped supporting the judicial persecution of homosexuality, a conservatively inclined gay man was as likely to support a rightwing party as a conservatively inclined straight man. In the 21st century, Russell’s fallacy has all but vanished. A realistic understanding that freedom means the freedom of women, the working class, subject peoples, ethnic minorities and gay and lesbian people to be as good or bad, left or right, interesting or dull, crooked or honest, radical or conformist as the white, male middle class has not replaced it. Instead, we have a blindness that does not romanticise the oppressed but refuses to look at them.To understand the phenomenon, imagine a screenwriter trying write a drama about Israeli troops shooting dead Hamas demonstrators on the Gaza border at the end of last month. The writer could not paint Benjamin Netanyahu as a compromised but sympathetic politician in the mould of his predecessor as Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin. At the time of the Entebbe raid, Rabin was impressing on his colleagues the need to negotiate with enemies. He paid with his life for that in 1995 when a rightwing fanatic assassinated him for supporting the Oslo peace process. By contrast, Netanyahu, whose brother died saving the Entebbe hostages, not only failed to negotiate, but his policy of colonising the West Bank makes it impossible for a successor to negotiate.If the Leninist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine had taken power in the 1970s, it would have produced another murderous dictatorship. But in theory at least its solution of a one-state Arab nation with Jews as a minority was not inhumane. Outsiders could look at it without shuddering. Radical Islamists, who not only want to drive Jews into the sea, but establish a sexist, homophobic, inquisitorial theocracy, as Hamas has done in Gaza, long ago surpassed the old Marxists. As a result, I doubt one western protester in a thousand against Israel’s crimes could name the leaders of Hamas or describe their world vision. It’s not just that they don’t know, they cannot know. They must blank out the reality of religious dictatorship.In the 20th century, interested outsiders wanted to learn about a Mandela or a Havel. If they fell into Russell’s trap of romanticising them, you could explain the foolishness as natural in people who had reason to believe their values of liberalism and economic justice were on the march. In the 21st century, the ascendant values are illiberal: ethnic nationalism in the west, China and Russia religious sectarianism in the Middle East and India.Refusing to look too hard – or at all – is a reaction to a world where there is too much to fight against and too little to fight for."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58bec11314e3cb7fc3b97a1e24517e9772617429/0_180_1365_1649/master/1365.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2af9d6460b249ee1ddbc7e313848655e 1240w","title":"hadley freeman help im turning into ben affleck","story":"I saw a photo of Ben Affleck at the beach, tattoo of a phoenix on his back, towel positioned to hide his belly in front, and I thought, oh Ben. I feel you, manAs a miserable, disaffected, self-loathing teenager in the 1990s, my celebrity alter ego was Winona Ryder, who made adolescent misery, disaffection and self-loathing look incredibly chic, as opposed to the unwashed and self-destructive mess that it was and is. A\u0026nbspcelebrity alter ego is a famous person who has a hint of qualities you recognise in yourself, but carries them off perhaps a bit more photogenically, and, as adulthood beckoned, I looked around for role models to show me how to do\u0026nbspthe grownup years well. I gravitated towards cool, older women who looked like they could happily spend a weekend on their own and also like they would be the greatest lunch dates ever. There was Nora Ephron, obviously, and Gloria Steinem, still killing it after all these years. There was also a carefully curated selection of actors: Holly Hunter, Allison Janney, Laurie Metcalf, Sally Field. Yes, I’d think, watching them become even more talented, self-confident and beautiful as the years went by. Those are lives I want. This is the path I\u0026nbspam on.And then, one day, I opened a magazine, saw a photograph and realised I had not grown up to be Nora Ephron or Holly Hunter or even modern-day Winona. I had grown up to be Ben Affleck.To describe this as problematic would be like describing a nuclear holocaust as bad weather. I don’t like Ben Affleck. You don’t like Ben Affleck. Just try saying the words, “I’m a huge Ben Affleck fan”: you physically can’t. But, despite not especially liking Ben Affleck, I have somehow seen most of his movies,\u0026nbspincluding Jersey Girl and Gigli, the latter of which was so bad it lasted only\u0026nbspa week in UK cinemas.So I have witnessed the many phases of\u0026nbspAffleck: the Harvey Weinstein years when he churned out three-star movies that his buddy Weinstein bulldozed through the Oscars (Good Will Hunting, Argo) the bewildering Jennifer Lopez years when Affleck gave hope to\u0026nbspevery random schlub that they, too, might one day date a goddess the marital stability years with Jennifer Garner the marital instability years when Affleck may or may not have shagged the nanny the cash-in superhero years. And I never related to any of those phases, although, if I find myself dating J-Lo in a few years’ time, I’ll happily revise that statement. But then I saw a photo of Ben Affleck at the beach, enormous tattoo of a phoenix on his back, towel carefully positioned to\u0026nbsphide his belly in front, and I thought, oh Ben. I feel you, man.I, too, am falling apart. I have a tweaked nerve in my neck – almost certainly from picking up my twins, who apparently felt they hadn’t destroyed my body enough already – which means I am in pretty much constant pain. I’m a little younger than Affleck, but I am old enough that when I go to parties and hear someone quietly mutter, “So I have this great guy…”, this no longer means that they are about to recommend a drug dealer. It means they are going to tell you about their amazing osteopath, their incredible acupuncturist, their fantastic therapist. Like Affleck, I no longer walk around in a swimsuit without sporting a\u0026nbsptowel and, also like Affleck, I have quietly considered getting a tattoo, my way of raging against the dying light of approaching midlife.A midlife crisis, contrary to popular perception, is not the affair, or\u0026nbspthe newly buff body, although that is a symptom. It’s the visible difficulty with which someone accepts their age, and Affleck’s ongoing\u0026nbspmidlife crisis is now my number one obsession. The New Yorker ran an only semi-satirical article about the larger social meaning of Affleck’s “sadness”, prompting Affleck to tweet in response that he’s “doing fine”, and then somewhat undermined that\u0026nbspclaim by retweeting strangers who expressed their love for him. One magazine recently ran a photo story showing how Affleck always wears stained T-shirts, and another ran a story about his bad taste in T-shirts, both signs of a man who is struggling to dress like the 45‑year‑old he is, and, oh boy, do I feel that. What to wear when caught between Topshop and Country Casuals? And at what age does looking a bit of a mess stop being charming and just make you look gross? (Answer: younger than I am now.) Then there was the tattoo, which he\u0026nbspinsisted was for a movie, until it was obvious that it\u0026nbspwasn’t. When asked about the tattoo, his ex-wife, Jennifer Garner, clucked condescendingly, “Bless his heart”, while his ex-girlfriend, Jennifer Lopez, described it more directly as “Awful. His tattoos always have too many colours, they shouldn’t be so colourful. They should be, like, cooler.” The midlife pain, it never ends.Thank you, Ben Affleck. Thank you for being my celebrity alter ego, because you have shown me not how I want to be, but how I\u0026nbspdon’t. You are the canary in the mine for all of us who were born in the 1970s, and you have shown that the way does not lie in dressing how your dad did\u0026nbspin the 1980s, nor in dressing how you did in your 20s.\u0026nbspMost of all, it\u0026nbspdoes not lie in tattoos. To be honest, I’m not sure what it lies in, but we’ll find it together, Ben, you and me, one towel-clad step at a time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce5db986580c3c26867fc433eee033261e20495e/0_104_3537_2122/master/3537.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d33d37badc7a0f2c56c501aaf839d700 1240w","title":"peter kay hailed as comedy genius over car share finale","story":"Comedian holds special screenings after more than 100,000 fans demand a conclusion to seriesFans of Peter Kay have hailed him as a “comedy genius” after a special public screening of the final episodes of his sitcom Car Share.Kay recently announced there would be three charity screenings of his popular BBC comedy show at the Blackpool Opera House, each one airing a special finale to the series, as well as an entirely improvised episode. The second series of the Bafta-winning show ended on an emotional cliffhanger last year as Kay’s character, John, failed to reciprocate the advances of his car share colleague, Kayleigh, played by Sian Gibson. Car Share viewers were left in dismay when Kay said he wanted to “quit while you’re ahead”. More than 100,000 fans signed an online petition demanding a conclusion to the series.But the comedian later announced a special finale to reveal what happens next for the pair, along with an improvised episode, Car Share: Unscripted.He had said at the time: “We were completely overwhelmed by the response and even though we’ve no plans to write a third series we knew we couldn’t end the story there.”Kay later broke his silence for the first time since he had cancelled his UK tour in December due to “unforeseen family circumstances”, to announce the special screenings, which sold out in minutes. A matinee show in Blackpool was later added due to “exceptional demand”.Kay was praised on social media following the first screening on Friday night, which raised money for The Lily Foundation, a charity working to improve the lives of children with mitochondrial disease. One fan described the finale as a “perfect final episode” and hailed Kay as a “comedy genius” on Twitter. “Watching Car Share at Blackpool Opera House tonight – never in my life laughed so much and so honoured to watch the perfect final ending to Car Share,” another said.

By Alex NeedhamWhen it comes to memorable outfits, few can match the impact of the Nazi uniform Prince Harry wore to a fancy-dress party in 2005. Not to mention the full-frontal nudity revealed to the world seven years later, after a game of strip billiards in Las Vegas ended up on a gossip site – “A classic case of me being too much army and not enough prince,” he said of the incident.Usually, however, Harry wears classic royal garb. There’s the blue-and-burgundy tie of his regiment, the Blues and Royals his medals and his single-breasted suit, chinos and blazer, all of which tend to be blue, like his blood. Then there’s the polo kit (like many royals, Harry looks most at home on a horse) and some undeniably impressive uniforms, such as the Blues and Royals’ tropical dress: in eye-popping Persil white, it confirms that Harry may be the best wearer of medals, a gold sash and thickly-braided epaulettes since Michael Jackson circa Dangerous.Off duty, however, Harry’s flair for style is far less certain. Despite their appearance in various fawning best-dressed lists, neither Harry nor William have that crucial sixth sartorial sense. When they’ve got a day off, they favour baggy shirts and khakis, sometimes accessorised with that modern curse, the gap-year bracelet (he is wearing an unforgivable seven in one shot). Yet that was the BM era – before Meghan.There’s no doubt that Harry has started looking sharper since La Markle came on the scene. His shirts have got crisper, his suits better-fitting, his car coats more luxurious. Even those endless blue garments have started exhibiting a bit of variation: a cobalt Everlane cashmere jumper in Wales, a cornflower coat at Christmas in King’s Lynn, a midnight-blue knitted tie with a paler blue Gieves \u0026amp Hawkes suit when announcing his engagement.None of this is going to frighten those polo horses – and that’s exactly the way Harry intends it. The royals stand for continuity, tradition and security, not waiting for the latest Vetements drop at Dover Street Market.Gert Jonkers, editor-in-chief of men’s fashion magazine Fantastic Man, is a fan of Harry’s muted style. “Prince Harry is, of course, pretty ridiculously handsome,” he says, “so I’d say everything suits him well, including the perfectly understated clothes he’s always been drawn to. He dresses a bit like a royal press release: considered and nothing to be offended by. Navy blue suits him very well, as do combinations of blue, grey and white, but I guess that’s what you do when you’re in the company of your future spouse and with the assurance that there’ll be a billion photographers awaiting you. One thing I noticed is that on a recent joint appearance, the prince wore a muted-army-green jacket, which isn’t a very lifting colour for redheads. That’s all!”Yet what if Harry had more leave to experiment in his new married life? As we demonstrate here, he could still be an ambassador for Britain in Burberry – in fact, by wearing the rainbow flag-infused check of Christopher Bailey’s final collection, he can wink to his newfound wokeness. He can still wear the classics, but why not a remixed version by Stella McCartney, whose new menswear line has all the green credentials of her womenswear? Rather than shrieking at clingfilm like his dad, he can prove his modernity by embracing the sports tech trend in a Burberry cagoule, a definite upgrade from the rain jacket he wore last October at Brockholes nature reserve in Preston. And while his grandfather sleeps in the nip (according to The Crown), Harry can indulge in some statement sleepwear by Desmond \u0026amp Dempsey.Finally, away from the paparazzi, Harry can ditch the button-downs and billowing linen shirts, and embrace his inner party animal with a Paul Smith Hawaiian shirt. He doesn’t even need to lose the bracelet – but please, Harry, confine it to just the one. And don’t even think about an armband.• Commenting on this piece?

Or, at least, they thought they had. Blue smoke bombs were being let off. The first euphoric chants of “championees”, could be heard and the Etihad was overdosing on schadenfreude given the history of these teams and the prospect of a title-winning victory that would have meant so much in this ided city.What followed was extraordinary. Manchester United scored, quickly added another and then one more to complete an improbable feat of escapology against the Premier League’s champions-in-waiting. From 2-0 down to 3-2 up in the space of 16 second-half minutes – the game had been turned upside down and, at the final whistle, the television cameras even picked out a few home supporters in tears.Reminder: City are 13 points clear at the top of the table. Mourinho congratulated them afterwards for winning the title.It was a wild, eccentric derby and one of the stirring United comebacks from a team, in Sir Alex Ferguson’s day at least, that used to make a habit of these kind of thrilling recoveries. United, to put it bluntly, were abysmal in the first half. Vincent Kompany and Ilkay Gundogan had both scored for City and it could easily have become a rout if Raheem Sterling had not been having one of those days when he seemed to confuse the measurements of David de Gea’s goal with a particularly troublesome barn door. Sterling’s misses did not feel so consequential at the time, with City winning 2-0, but they did by the end.United certainly rode their luck bearing in mind the two incidents when penalties should have been awarded against Ashley Young – the second one, at 3-2, a studs-up lunge on the substitute Sergio Agüero that should also have resulted in a red card – but it was a triumph, ultimately, for the strength of personality within Mourinho’s team and if City defend this way against Liverpool on Tuesday their chances of reaching the Champions League semi-finals are somewhere between minimal and non-existent. This is the first time in Guardiola’s coaching career that one of his teams have conceded three goals in successive matches and Nicolás Otamendi, in particular, was badly exposed during the period of the game when Paul Pogba scored twice and Chris Smalling turned in the winner.Until that stage, Pogba was part of a midfield that was being over-run and Alexis Sánchez had found it difficult to make any kind of favourable impression.Yet the game swung on the moment, five minutes into the second half, when Gundogan’s shot flicked off the angle of crossbar and post. After that, United’s A-listers seemed to remember they were supposed to be elite performers. Pogba demonstrated his more attractive qualities and Sánchez – involved in all of his team’s goals – chose a good day to remind everyone why United made him the best-paid footballer in the land.For Guardiola, it must have been startling to see the way City unravelled once Sánchez had drawn Otamendi out to the right wing and then swivelled away from him to help create Pogba’s first goal. Ander Herrera chested Sánchez’s cross into Pogba’s path and once the Frenchman had aimed his shot beyond Ederson it was remarkable how quickly the game swung United’s way.Two minutes later, Sánchez crossed from the left and Pogba eluded Otamendi to equalise with a precise header. Smalling’s goal was another cross into the penalty area, this time from Sánchez’s free-kick, and the centre-half was completely alone as he side-footed his shot into an exposed net.For all the praise they have attracted this season, City have not actually kept clean sheets in successive home matches since September. Their vulnerabilities at the back can often be overlooked when they attack so beautifully. Yet the last two games have shown how susceptible they can be against top-level opposition and this was one occasion when Mourinho could never be accused of ultra-defensive tactics. As Jürgen Klopp said last week, sitting back is not the way to hurt City. From Mourinho, there was no parking of the bus.Guardiola chose not to blame the referee, Martin Atkinson, in his post-match analysis. Indeed, he had to ask his press officer for the referee’s name, which made a refreshing change compared to the response it might have incurred had it been Mourinho in that position. Yet there was nothing of note from City’s manager to explain why and where it went wrong and, by the final whistle, this was one of the few occasions since he Guardiola joined the club that a few supporters behind the dugout could be seen taking exception with his decisions. Only a few – but still noticeable.Guardiola had taken the calculated gamble of starting with Kevin de Bruyne on the bench. Gabriel Jesus and Kyle Walker were also rested with Tuesday’s game against Liverpool in mind and Guardiola resisted any temptation to fast-track the fit-again Agüero into the starting lineup. Yet it scarcely seemed to matter when Kompany powered in Sané’s corner and five minutes later Gundogan swivelled past Nemanja Matic to stab in City’s second goal.At 2-0, the mood was euphoric. City were on course to win the league with six games to spare. No side would have done it any earlier, date-wise, since United beat Blackpool 2-1 on the same day to seal the 1955-56 championship and Mourinho said afterwards it would have felt “like death” for his team’s supporters. Instead, it was the players in red celebrating a highly memorable victory and City will have to wait until next weekend, at the earliest, to wrap up their third title in seven years.More likely, it will need a little longer, given the chances of United losing at home to West Bromwich Albion.An exhilarating high had turned into an excruciating low, and vice versa. “Wow”’ Guardiola said. “How could we lose that game?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5ef7b310a6643c1bf64ce3d4c21ef68b5ebdf1c/29_0_1137_682/master/1137.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3bd2d9495b6a36546acf21363be23ea0 1240w","title":"wayne rooney sam allardyce substituted reaction everton liverpool derby","story":"Sam Allardyce has told Wayne Rooney to vent his frustrations within the confines of the Everton manager’s office after the forward reacted furiously to his early substitution against Liverpool.Rooney was withdrawn in the 57th minute at Goodison Park for the second game in succession as Allardyce sought “more legs” in midfield and an improvement to a passing game he described as “a bit woeful”. The former England captain did not disguise his ange at the decisionand responded angrily to the decision, appearing to snub his manager’s offer of a handshake as he was replaced by Idrissa Gana Gueye and being caught on camera shouting “bullshit”. The 32-year-old had also been replaced in the 57th minute of last weekend’s comprehensive home defeat by Manchester City.“He can say whatever he wants to me in the office but it has to be done between the four walls of the office between me and him,” the Everton manager said. “He’s an Evertonian through and through and he’s been brought off in a derby game. I’d expect a reaction because that’s how much he cares. That’s fine by me. I wouldn’t expect him to smile and say, ‘All right gaffer, well done’.“The three substitutions, no matter how disappointed anyone is when they are substituted, made a big impact and almost helped us win the game. I understand the ones who get brought off are disappointed but I made those decisions for the benefit of the team and they benefited the team today. Nobody is too big to be hooked.”Everton were on the back foot for the majority of the derby but finished the 0-0 draw strongly and should have recorded their first win over Liverpool in eight years when both Cenk Tosun and Dominic Calvert-Lewin missed excellent chances in the final minutes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c33f8d0582dc3de12407102b2cba79159df437cc/0_37_2556_1533/master/2556.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2b96fe3ff10524c3de97a7fd16f5ff8e 1240w","title":"jurgen klopp defence manchester city liverpool return second leg","story":"After two seasons the Liverpool manager has found a system that works, led by the £75m signing Virgil van Dijk“If we have to score five goals to win, then so be it,” Vincent Kompany said when it was put to him that a single Liverpool goal at the Etihad on Tuesday would surely leave Manchester City with too much to do to progress in the Champions League. “We won’t stop\u0026nbspbelieving. We will still take a positive attitude into the game and try to get through.”One can only admire the City captain’s confidence, though his assessment overlooks the fact that his side did not manage a single attempt on target in the first leg of the quarter-final at Anfield and the consideration that, even had the match gone on until midnight, the visitors might still not have managed to give Loris Karius anything to do.Based on the first leg, and Liverpool’s appetite for Europe, not to mention Jürgen Klopp’s managerial record against Pep Guardiola, the chances are that Liverpool will score against a City side now obliged to chase a three-goal deficit. The odds on City scoring four or five against a defence that shut them out so effectively in the first leg must be considerably longer. Liverpool will not have the backing of an impassioned Anfield this time, it is true, though they will have the knowledge that after a couple of seasons of trying Klopp has come up with a defensive system that finally seems to work.The key to that is probably the £75m acquisition of the unflappable Virgil van Dijk, even if the full‑backs Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson were the stars of the show in the first game against City. Karius in goal has given some reassurance too. He might have been underemployed in the first leg but his decision-making and communication with the players in front of him is an improvement on Simon Mignolet, whose sometimes erratic goalkeeping tended to undermine confidence. Compared with Nicolás Otamendi, Kyle Walker and others in the City rearguard each member of the Liverpool back line was a tower of strength, though the whole point about Klopp’s defensive system is that it is a system, it is not just about the back line. It starts from the front, as Van Dijk is in a good position to explain.“The work our front three do defensively, not just attacking‑wise, is amazing,” the centre-half says. “They get through so much work. Look at Bobby Firmino. It is a nightmare to play against him, I can say that myself because I have done it. He chases everything down, all the front three do, and if the midfield do it as well then you are not going to be in trouble. If you can get it right at the front, then obviously you feel the benefit at the back. As a defender you may even have an easy night.”Van Dijk stopped short of describing last Wednesday as an easy night – “Everybody knows how much quality City have got and in the second half they were pressing us” – and he does not imagine the next leg will be a formality, even with such a lead. “I don’t think anyone believes it is all over,” he says. “We just have to play our game and try to score goals. I don’t think it will be a good idea to sit back.“We need to be aware and ready for anything, though we can take a lot of encouragement from keeping a clean sheet in the first leg. The key in quarter-finals is not to concede, particularly when you are at home. We knew we had to be tight, and the way we reacted under pressure from City in the second half made me proud. We were struggling at times but we worked hard and stayed\u0026nbsptogether.”Kompany can talk about belief, though in the decisive 20 minutes of the first half that tilted the tie in Liverpool’s favour and left their opponents looking rattled and disorganised for the second time at Anfield this season, this time without an answer, City did not look like the side with the stronger conviction. Liverpool positively radiated self-belief, as so often happens on European nights at Anfield, with Klopp somehow able to channel the energy of the crowd into asking for and receiving new highs of confidence from his players. There seems no other explanation for the fact that so many players in red had their best games to date, while too many of the players in blue struggled to respond.Most managers would have considered Alexander-Arnold a risk at right-back, yet the 19-year‑old shone in keeping Leroy Sané quiet. Most critics wondered what Klopp was doing when he spent £35m on Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain at the start of the season – after a devastating first half capped by a fine goal, they now know. Robertson, Dejan Lovren and James Milner were also right at the top of their game and the only worry for Liverpool going into the second leg is that it might be difficult, perhaps even unrealistic, to expect so many players to reach the same level again. Liverpool’s high-pressing style is famously tiring and hard to keep up over the course of a season, though one has the feeling that at the business end of the Champions League they will not be found short of enthusiasm or energy.Suddenly it is City being asked to dig deep. Guardiola would have liked to be free to concentrate on Europe with the league put to bed but by a matter of days it has not worked out like that. A season of admirable, elegant simplicity has reached a complicated, urgent conclusion, so much so that even the City fans are now expected to do their bit on Tuesday, to do their best to turn the frosty Etihad into the sort of frenzied cauldron Anfield resembled for the first leg. Good luck with that, though at least the City support will not need reminding that their initial attempt to wind up their opponents on Merseyside rather backfired.It turns out Liverpool do not live in the past after all. Nor are they like Manchester United in the way they approach the Champions League knockout stage. Liverpool come alive in Europe, standing taller than ever. Now City are facing a taller order than they must have anticipated, it is their turn to show they can do the same."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/649f810da3c6b823a0a81f6c2139e9002f77137a/0_186_5222_3133/master/5222.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=557532bbbb2101f02ab076783dcfb8a9 1240w","title":"manchester united jose mourinho party pooper city","story":"The ice melts sadly around the unopened champagne.

But he has offered further evidence of this City side’s curious vulnerability, inflicted a trauma that might yet resurface to significant effect in the future and, more even than that, shown that, however much Pep Guardiola wants to make football a game of three-dimensional chess, he can drag him into a bar fight, play the game on his terms.In January 2014 Mourinho’s Real Madrid went to the Camp Nou to face Barcelona in the second leg of a Copa del Rey tie. They trailed 2-1 from the first leg and fell 4-1 behind. With nothing left to lose, they attacked, came back and drew 2-2 on the night. It made no immediate difference and Barça went on to win the Cup but it blew away the sense of invulnerability Guardiola’s side had previously projected. Their aura gone, Barça dwindled to the end of the season, losing to Chelsea in the Champions League and surrendering their league title to Madrid.It is far too early to suggest this game will similarly send the pendulum swinging back the other way. The teams are at different stages of their cycles and Guardiola does not seem as frazzled now as he did then. United, in truth, were extremely fortunate to win given the chances City missed and the penalty they were denied. But it is something and, in a season in which they have struggled to emerge from City’s shadow, they will take that.Football has known few party poopers like Mourinho. He may not literally have broken up a party at one of his young player’s homes, wearing evening dress and calling them by their numbers rather than their names, as Sir Alex Ferguson famously did at a gathering at Lee Sharpe’s house, but he loves nothing more than stopping other people having fun.He has the vague awareness of work in the morning, the barman who insists you have three minutes to drink the pint you bought two minutes ago even though you are pretty sure you are legally entitled to 20 minutes’ drinking-up time, the sour and neurotic former girlfriend who turns up and sits in passive aggressive disapproval until all hilarity has been sapped from the room.Mourinho always seems at his most buoyant after puncturing somebody else’s balloon. He has rarely seemed more chipper than he did when dousing the boisterousness of a pre-Christmas crowd with a Chelsea performance of heroic lack of ambition in a 0-0 draw at Arsenal in 2013-14, unless it was later on that season when his side, with nothing to play for, went to Anfield, spoiled and wasted time and inflicted a 2-0 defeat that in effect cost Liverpool the title.This was a different type of spoiling, although surely not by design. United were genuinely awful in the first half. Be more like Jürgen Klopp, they had said. Take a lesson from how Liverpool beat City on Wednesday. But the only aspect of Liverpool’s campaign United replicated, in both games against City, was the inability Klopp’s side showed earlier in the season to defend set plays. This City, as Liverpool demonstrated, are vulnerable. Their defence can be got at.Attack them with pace and verve and they will struggle. United did not attack them before half-time and the result was that City, comfortable in possession, cut through them again and again.Pogba, who at least got in the mood by dying his hair blue and white for the occasion, was, as so often, the barometer, terrible before half-time, inspirational after it. In the first half, his touch was poor, his use of the ball worse. Two goals in the first 10 minutes of the second half and suddenly he was winning every tackle, so dominant that Guardiola made a point of congratulating him at the final whistle.At half-time it had seemed as though City could humiliate United, that this could be a beating for the ages, the sort of scoreline that could haunt a club. By the end, as the tackles flew in and tempers frayed, the sense was less of a United side coming together than of the fissure in City’s make-up being prised wider and wider. United, clearly, are still deep in the process of transition. They will not often get away with conceding the chances they conceded here. But they did point a huge finger at City’s soft underbelly and they may not be the only side to benefit from that in the future.Mourinho, once again, could lap up the salt-tears of frustrated opponents as though they were the sweetest nectar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2ea533a7759c9d3de05d8cfc4aecf81d1375d54/48_0_3685_2212/master/3685.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6f060bb0dcea00ffa14ac0ec4c0f7c02 1240w","title":"david tennant organised religion gave me a good moral compass","story":"The actor, 46, on Scottish football tribalism, optimism and mountaineering up banistersA good friend once told me: “You’re not as nice as you think you are.” I was stunned because it seemed quite harsh at the time, but she was actually right. She was being cruel to be kind. However, sometimes allowing yourself to be honest about how you’re feeling can be more useful than pretending you’re such a nice person that you can’t ever have a negative thought. Niceness isn’t always a virtue, it can be quite limiting.I’m a good bluffer. I am a worrier, but I’m quite good at shielding it from the outside world. I think I surprise people, apart from those closest to me, when they find out I’m quite an anxious person.Organised religion gave me a good moral compass. I grew up in a religious family in Paisley. Dad was a Church of Scotland minister and Mum was every inch the minister’s wife. They were both good people who had respect for others. They were liberal, progressive Christians. They didn’t allow the fact they had a belief system to limit them. They’re gone now, but I still feel them sitting on my shoulder, reminding me to be better.I’m an optimist because otherwise there’s no way forward. We’re in some very dark days and one can only hope that the pendulum’s about to swing back. I do believe that there’s more good people than not.

But I’ve never been a football fan and have only been to two matches in my life.

Basil will germinate in a matter of days on any warm windowsill. Fennel shoots, sorrel, rocket, lemon balm and young borage leaves can all be brought on with a cloche or fleece if necessary, and sweet violets should be springing up around the garden.If you don’t have any of these in your garden, then now is the time to get them established. Don’t buy lemon balm  someone somewhere will have more than enough to give you a ision. Don’t let it self-seed too much, as it has a habit of coming up everywhere. Herb fennel is a lovely tall addition to any garden, and there’s a bronze form, too. Once established it’s there for life: the seed can be collected later in the year and used in cooking toasted, it’s a lovely, nutty addition.French sorrel has a tendency to start flowering after a few years, and thus you get fewer leaves. Either resow every three years or try to get hold of ‘Profusion’, a non-flowering form. Salad burnet tastes of cucumber but it needs to be picked very young and tender, or else it’s a little hairy. It grows well in partial shade and likes damp soil.Borage and rocket can be sown undercover now, or direct in April or May. Both will happily self-seed where they please. The easiest way to get sweet violets (Viola odorata) in the garden is to buy a pot now (try plantsforshade.co.uk), and, again, let it spread to create a ground cover.

I spent most of August standing at my bedroom window watching four men paint a school, ducking out of sight whenever one of them turned around. For two days in November, I sat in the kitchen looking on while my garden office was constructed. Two months later, I sat in my new office watching a man called Tomasz lay a brick patio.“It is a good day to work!” he said to me each morning as I crossed the garden.“Yes, it is,” I said.My office is a glass-fronted observation booth. I can watch my wife mop the kitchen floor from my desk. But it means that when I’m observing, I am also observable.On Thursday, a load of plants arrive. Our friend Anna, who is a garden designer and knows about these things, has come to show us where to stick them. The middle one, just home from university, is being paid to help out. I see them as I cross the garden in the morning, coffee in hand, on my way to my computer.“Are we going to be disturbing you, digging and planting while you’re trying to work?” Anna asks.“Nope,” I say.“Disturbing him?” my wife says.“I’ll be fine,” I say. “I’m used to it.”“If you think you’re going to sit in that box all day watching us do everything,” my\u0026nbspwife says.“Actually, I have business in town,” I say.“What business?” she says.“Business business,” I say.“He’s got a lot going on, your husband,” Anna says.“He doesn’t,” my wife says. “He’s lying.”My business – technically more of an errand – takes about an hour. When I get back, all the plants are still in their pots, although they have been set in their positions along the empty beds. “Looks good,” I say. “I’ll get out of your way.”“What are you talking about?” my wife says. “You’re helping.”I am assigned the northern end of the left bed. My first strike with the spade hits something hard, causing my fillings to vibrate like tuning forks. I fish up the broken corner of a concrete paving slab, followed by the rest of the paving slab, followed by the paving slab next to it. My shoulder blades burn. Sweat runs off the end of my nose. It’s tough work, I think, but honest.“Why are you making those noises?” my\u0026nbspwife says.“What noises?” I say.“The grunting and wincing,” she says.“I hit a slab,” I say.“No one else is making noises,” she says. “Anna’s not sighing and groaning.”“It’s all construction rubble at this end,” I say.“Your son isn’t muttering and swearing under his breath,” she says.“He’s planting peonies,” I say. “I’m excavating a Roman villa.”“You are making a lot of noise,” the middle one says.“Stop listening to me work,” I say.“We can’t,” my wife says.A week later, I’m in my office when I\u0026nbspcatch sight of my wife crossing the grass with Kitch the electrician, here to\u0026nbspinstall the outdoor light.

It’s the fattiness of some cuts versus the relative leanness of others, allied to pork’s rather neutral flavour – it’s not beef, and definitely not lamb – that opens it up to ingredients as erse as whisky, fish sauce, orange, caraway and ginger. I love this ersity – especially the ability to mix and match flavours on a global scale.This works very well just as it is, but serve with mashed potato if you want an even heartier meal.400g pork mince70g fresh breadcrumbs (from 2 slices white crustless bread)2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed2 tbsp fresh thyme leaves15g parsley, roughly chopped2 tsp lemon zest (ie, from 2 lemons)½ tsp ground cinnamon1 tsp caraway seeds½ tsp chilli flakesSalt and black pepper1 tbsp vegetable oil40g unsalted butter1 cabbage, cut in half and then into 5mm-thick strips2 tsp dark brown soft sugar300ml vegetable stock250g soured cream, to serveIn a large bowl, combine the mince, breadcrumbs, garlic, a tablespoon of thyme, a third of the parsley, a teaspoon of lemon zest, all the spices, a half-teaspoon of salt and a grind or two of pepper. Form the mix into roughly 20 walnut-sized balls, each weighing about 25g.Heat the oil in a large saute pan on a high flame, then fry the meatballs (in batches, if need be) for about three minutes, turning them so they go golden brown all over, then transfer to a plate.Return the pan to a high heat – don’t worry about wiping it clean –and add the butter. Once it sizzles, add the cabbage and fry for 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until caramelised and dark golden brown.Stir in the sugar, the remaining tablespoon of thyme and a teaspoon of salt, then pour in the stock. Return the meatballs to the pan, turn down the heat to medium-low, cover and leave to simmer for eight minutes. Remove the lid, return the heat to high, and cook for four to five minutes more, until the liquid reduces to about 150ml.Divide the cabbage and meatballs between four bowls. Mix the remaining 10g parsley with a teaspoon of lemon zest, and sprinkle on top. Serve with a generous dollop of soured cream.If you can, marinate the pork overnight to really get the flavours into the meat if you’re pushed for time, though, two hours will do. This same treatment would also work very well on chicken thighs. If you can’t get hold of barberries, use chopped dried cranberries instead. Serve with herby rice and vegetables on the side.1 tbsp Chinese five-spice2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed1½ tsp paprika5cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated1½ tbsp maple syrup60ml olive oilSalt and black pepper1 pork fillet (about 500-600g)For the salsa 35g dried barberries, soaked for a few minutes in boiling water, then drained (or chopped dried cranberries)45g parsley, picked and finely chopped1½ tsp red-wine vinegarFinely grated zest of 1 large lemon, to get 1½ tsp1½ tbsp olive oil1 pinch caster sugarFlaked sea salt and black pepperPut the first five ingredients in a large bowl with three tablespoons of oil, a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Add the pork, rub the marinade into the meat, then cover and refrigerate for at least two hours and ideally overnight.Heat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4. Heat a tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan on a high heat. Lift the pork from its marinade, then sear for about four minutes, turning often, so it turns golden brown on all sides. Transfer the meat to a roasting tray, spoon over the marinade and roast for about 10-15 minutes, depending on how well done you like your pork. Remove from the oven, cover with foil and leave to rest for five minutes. Put all the salsa ingredients in a bowl with a third of a teaspoon of salt and some pepper, then stir to make a coarse salsa.When you’re ready to eat, carve the pork into 1.5-2cm-thick slices and ide between the plates. Spoon the cooking juices over the top, sprinkle lightly with salt and serve with the salsa spooned alongside or over the meat.Pork neck fillet (which is also known as collar) is a very forgiving cut that has plenty of fat running through it (if you can’t get hold of neck, use shoulder instead). The meat will really benefit if you can leave it in its marinade for two days, but four hours is the bare minimum.

Add the lemongrass and ginger, turn off the heat and leave to cool completely.Cut the pork against the grain into four 12cm-long and 6cm-wide pieces, then cut away and discard any silverskin. Transfer the meat to a non-reactive container that is just big enough to hold all the pieces in one layer, then pour over the cooled marinade and make sure the pork is well coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least four hours.Heat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4. Lift the pork from its container and dry well with kitchen towel (don’t discard the marinade it can be frozen and used again for marinating alternatively, cook it down and, once reduced, use to glaze, say, chicken drumsticks). Brush each piece with a little oil and set aside. Ventilate the kitchen and put a griddle pan on a medium-high heat. Once the pan is smoking hot, lay in the pork pieces (in batches if need be) and cook for four to five minutes on each side, until golden brown and nicely marked with char lines (turn down the heat a little if it looks like the meat is starting to burn).Put the browned meat on an oven tray lined with greaseproof paper, and roast for 10-12 minutes, until cooked through, then remove from the oven, cover with foil and leave to rest for 10 minutes.While the meat is cooking and resting, make the nam jim. Put the orange juice in a small saucepan on a medium-high heat and simmer for about four minutes, until it’s reduced to about 60ml, then leave to cool a little.At the same time, toast the rice in a small saucepan on a medium-high heat for four to five minutes, until it starts to colour and smell nutty. Transfer the toasted rice to a spice grinder or mortar, add the chilli and blitz or pound to a coarse powder. Combine this with all the remaining ingredients for the nam jim and set aside.Gently toss all the ingredients for the salad. Cut each piece of meat widthways into five, and serve warm with the herb salad, the nam jim poured over both of them and a lime wedge alongside.

There’s no queuing and you get driven right from the plane door to immigration. I must save at least six hours of my time per round trip. That’s important to me, because I tend to work incredibly hard when I’m not on holiday, typically putting in a 10- to 15-hour day.I must have taken 45 or 50 flights in the past year to 30 different places. I like to go skiing or visit Paris, Milan and new places – I love immersing myself in new cultures.

When I take her on a walk to my local pub, I’ll buy her a cooked steak – no sauce.I’ve got a six-figure sum invested in cryptocurrencies, and it’s not uncommon for me to make around £1,000 overnight. I’ve made around £60,000 to £70,000 in total although I lost £7,000 recently when bitcoin fell back.I have two buy-to-let properties I own which pay my mortgage, and I’m about to take on a third one. And I do guaranteed rentals I rent, say, a three-bed home and pay £1,500 a month to the landlord guaranteed for five years, then I make it an HMO (house of multiple occupation) doing things like changing the lounge into a bedroom and earning more than the £1,500 rent.Recently, I bought a £12,000 jet ski. I also bought a £70,000 Porsche. I traded in another car I owned to get the Porsche, so it actually only cost me about £10,000 upfront.

And finding a decent adviser is a lottery in itself.You will also need to learn an ugly new word – “decumulation” – and take some big guesses about your health and longevity. The single biggest problem with managing your money in retirement is that you don’t know when you’ll die, or whether or not you will need expensive long-term care.The potential for rip-offs is enormous. That’s why the pension minister, Guy Opperman, must take on board recommendations this week from the work and pensions select committee and create a low-cost deal at retirement which is as automatic as the current enrolment system.The weirdness of our market-based pension system is that Nest, the government-owned body that delivers auto-enrolment for many small employers, is forbidden from offering drawdown or other decumulation plans. Why? Because they will probably do it cheaper than the profit-seeking private companies.This nonsense has to end. Nest must provide a low-cost benchmark service for managing your money through retirement – and in effect force the private companies to fall in line.But none of this is going to lessen the challenge of saving enough first. The grim reality is that while £106,000 sounds like a lot of money, it is peanuts when it comes to pensions. It will give you an income of less than £5,000 a year in retirement – and leaves you wide open to the vagaries of inflation and any stock market collapses. If you want an income of £25,000 a year in retirement – consisting of £8,300-a-year state pension as well as a £16,700-a-year private pension – that many say is the benchmark for a decent life, you will have to save north of £300,000.But don’t get too depressed – if you are a couple, both 40, with no savings so far, but can stretch to putting aside £40 per week each into a pension scheme, then it’s (just) possible to hit the £25,000 a year target income that many experts say is what you need in retirement. Good luck."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47bb34509fa1068e936a4603c9f8cb440e554550/0_1316_6208_5299/master/6208.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=25d32c58bf3d227962ad70ef31e67e9d 1240w","title":"olly alexander success is overwhelming people talk to you differently","story":"The Years \u0026amp Years frontman on fame, therapy and how Disneyland inspired himOlly Alexander, the frontman of the British band Years \u0026amp Years, has blood-red dyed hair. He wears a brass safety pin through one ear and sometimes grins so widely, so wildly, that the edges of his mouth seem to disappear around his narrow, fine-boned face. What soon draws the eye is a scar on his forehead. “I ran into a brick wall as a kid,” the 27-year-old says over lunch at a cafe in London. He touches the scar. “I was playing at being a Power Ranger. Ouch.”These days, Alexander plays at being a pop star – and on the surface, at least, it seems like a game that’s going well for him. With the launch of their first album in 2015, Years \u0026amp Years enjoyed a really remarkable few months. They were named BBC Sound of 2015 in January, promptly going to No 1 in the UK singles chart in March, and likewise topping the album chart in July. The band’s propulsive, 90s-nostalgic dance pop (like Disclosure or Clean Bandit, only up the randiness and add a little disco) caught on. And Alexander made a quick Meghan Markle-like ascent to something like pop royalty. “One of the most influential gay pop stars of this generation,” the Gay Times wrote. “All hail the King!”Years \u0026amp Years are a three-piece – also made up of keyboard and synth player Emre Türkmen and bassist Mikey Goldsworthy – but it has always been clear that Alexander is the band’s guiding force, their chief lyricist, a Gaga-like taker of risks when he performs and a political voice, off stage, who has an appealing, glitter-speckled sense of activism. A pithy and witty speaker on LGBTQ+ rights, Alexander has also opened up engagingly about his struggles with mental health. “A lifeline to troubled young people,” the Observer wrote of him, in 2016, around the same time that Years \u0026amp Years played at Glastonbury. There, Alexander wore an oversized choirboy smock strung front and back with rainbow-coloured ribbons – it was Pride weekend – and made a widely admired speech about battling prejudice. “Shove a rainbow in fear’s face,” was how he put it.Musicians must pray for debuts like this – to come over credible, commercial, with real-world clout. No brick walls clattered into, no obvious “Ouch” moments. Or were there?Years \u0026amp Years are almost done on their second album, due this summer, and from the demos I’ve heard the new music admits a brittleness and vulnerability in Alexander that wasn’t so obvious on the 2015 debut. He is still a fabulous and steely man when in pop-star mode (at the photoshoot, he prowls around in heels and a collared lace bodysuit that make him resemble a steampunk, space-bound Queen Elizabeth I), but he cuts a shyer and less certain figure at lunch.He arrived with a cigarette pushed behind his ear, and smoked it outside with quick, jittery puffs. Now he hunches over a salad, an elbows-in kind of eater and a nervous giggler. Of his pop-mode confidence, he says, “I wish I carried that around with me in my day-to-day life. But I don’t.” He’s wearing a pair of dungarees that he likes, he says, because they feel “like clothes that give you back a hug”.As Alexander eats, he talks about what happened in the aftermath of that famous Glastonbury performance, once he was out of public sight. The band had been cheered off, a career high. And once backstage, the musician recalls, he sat down and wept. Inconsolable, feeling lower than he’d been in months. “It happens,” he shrugs. “A falling off a cliff. The pendulum swings.”“When I was younger,” Alexander says, “I thought that if you were famous and successful, it would mean that you just felt happy all the time. That you would become, like, this mystical creature that people just adored. And so you would adore yourself.”Alexander doesn’t always make eye contact, and he addresses this next bit at the napkin dispenser between us.“Obviously I realise how ridiculous that sounds. But it wasn’t until our album got to No 1 that I realised I still believed in it. We’d basically won the lottery. I felt like I’d won the lottery. And at the same time I still felt like the same person I’d always been. And all the things that I associated with my depression, and my anxiety, those periods of feeling really low, they were still there. And I was so annoyed at myself. ”Alexander talks about first discovering the transformative, strengthening power of a good costume. It was on a trip to Disneyland, when he was nine. “The greatest experience of my life up to then,” Alexander says. “The pomp! The whole make-believe nature of that place. It was very powerful for me.People were all wearing costumes, playing characters. It was this other reality where fun things happened, more than they seemed to in real life. And I just remember wanting to be a part of something like that.”Theme parks were a big feature of his young life. Alexander grew up living next door to them, not one but three, first Alton Towers, then Blackpool Pleasure Beach, then Drayton Manor. His father helped launch and market new rides in these places, and the family moved wherever the work was.He was born in 1990, the younger of two sons. His mother ran community craft groups. His father, while employed in the theme parks, tended side dreams of being a professional musician. Of his father he says, cautiously: “Quite a difficult man... Definitely not happy within himself.”Alexander is more explicit about his own early troubles. “I used to have hallucinations and hear voices and stuff as a kid. Which sounds alarming, but it’s just the way it was.” Also: “I had what would now be called sleep paralysis, from six years old until maybe I was 16. Terrifying dreams.”His parents separated when Alexander was 13, a daunting and confusing period for him. “My dad had been very absent, even when he was there. Then he left the family and moved away. Our relationship, it feels to me, ended when I was 13.” With his mother and brother, Alexander relocated to a sleepy village in Gloucestershire called Coleford.Part of Alexander’s conversational charm is that he’ll veer between the frank and sober discussion of the self-doubt and difficulty he experienced as a young man, into brilliantly catty and droll little anecdotes about his upbringing. Here he is, describing his first paid employment – a Saturday job in a Coleford shop called Moonstones. “We sold incense, candles, spellbooks. Um, bongs. Chocolates shaped like penises. Everything you’d need really – a one-stop shop.”He wasn’t a popular teenager, and was bullied at his secondary school in Coleford just as he had been at his old primary schools. He marvels, thinking back, at his response to this. “I started wearing eyeliner to school. Nail varnish. Choker necklaces.” He put on a costume: a counter-intuitive form of self-defence. “I’d been bullied for years and all I wanted was for that to stop. But at the same time I had this sense that I was different, I was weird, and wearing makeup and crazy clothes was my way of trying to find an identity, in the face of people who were going to rip me apart anyway.”Half by accident, he embarked on a different artistic career first. At 16, Alexander auditioned for the Channel 4 drama Skins, and was in talks about a role. The job didn’t materialise until he was well into his 20s, when he was cast as a creepy student photographer, but meanwhile his agent put him up for other stuff. By the time he’d finished his A-levels and moved to London, he was getting varied work – in Gaspar Noé’s Enter The Void and Laura Wade’s The Riot Club and a corporate video for Google, playing a confused consumer who didn’t know how much he needed the advice of a really good search engine. Probably his peak as an actor came in 2012 when he was cast in a Michael Grandage production, Peter And Alice, alongside Judi Dench and Ben Whishaw.This West End run coincided, in Alexander’s breezy telling, with the busiest period in his romantic career. “Lot of sex.” He had known that he fancied boys from the age of about 10, though the concept of being gay was something only introduced to him via playground insult he can remember drawing stick figures in a geography textbook, bewildered, trying to figure out how two men could ever even manage it. These days, Alexander says, “my sexuality is part of my music, part of my identity”, but this was a clunky journey in its early phases and it wasn’t until he arrived in London and got into a first relationship, with the brother of a friend, that he felt he could properly come out to those closest to him.After that – whoosh. “I figured out that I could pull, basically. It wasn’t as hard as I thought it was going to be. I realised that, actually, everyone’s pretty horny, pretty desperate at times, and all you needed to do was maintain eye contact and be confident and that was kind of it.” Since then, he’s sampled romance in many of its forms, being single and shagging a lot, being single and not shagging so much, being in an open relationship, being in a celebrity relationship (with Clean Bandit’s Neil Amin-Smith), being in a quieter relationship with somebody unknown – that was the most recent, and it came to an end about 18 months ago. What has he learned? “That the longer you’re single, the more you notice how everyone else is in a relationship. But that’s a whole other thing.”He says he finds it harder to pull in clubs without the freedom of anonymity he used to enjoy. “I’m having much less sex than I did in my early 20s, for sure.” He’s tried the hook-up app Grindr, but the men he messaged with wouldn’t believe he was who he said he was. “So that didn’t go very well.” After years of living with flatmates, he recently moved to live on his own, in a flat in east London. “The last few months I’ve been wondering, ‘Will I just be alone, for ever? And would I be OK with that?’ I want to be OK with that.”Thinking of how ill-informed he felt as a kid, and of the anxiety he might have been spared had he only known more and known better, Alexander has resolved to be a public figure who is as vocal and open about his sexuality as he can be. As soon as he was asked, in an early-career interview for a blog, he said he was gay. (This was actually how his beloved grandmother found out: Alexander hadn’t yet got around to telling her.) Last year, he made a BBC Three documentary, Growing Up Gay, that is still on iPlayer and gets broadcast around the world. “I get messages about it at weird times of night.”Soon after our lunch, he’s due to give the keynote address at an annual Stonewall event. He hasn’t written his speech yet, and is still toying with points of view he might want to get across: that LGBT-inclusive sex education should be compulsory in schools that LGBT support groups need more government funding than ever “that yes, we can get married now, but that’s not the end of the story, that’s not gay rights done.” When the event does take place, Alexander will speak about how, as a young actor who went through media training, he was told it might be best not to speak about his sexuality at all. (“I ignored advice.”)Alexander made an interesting choice, in 2013, when major labels started showing an interest in Years \u0026amp Years. He entered therapy, specifically in anticipation of what a frontline music career might do to his fragile emotional state. Polydor were still six months from formally signing them.He knew fame was coming, though – that early?No, he says. But if there was a chance of the band making it, however slight, he reasoned he’d better be prepared. “And I’m grateful I made that decision. I’ve been seeing the same therapist through the whole process.” Through the band’s kick-starting anointment as the BBC Sound of 2015, then their smash No 1 single King that spring, then their No 1 album Communion that summer. “To go from zero to 100. To have an idea of what success is, your entire life, and then it happens to you. It’s overwhelming. There’s a lot of noise. And people start talking to you differently.”Alexander laughs, frowns – speaks at the napkins again. He starts talking about his dad, with whom Alexander went through an awkward episode after Years \u0026amp Years topped the charts. By then, father and son had no relationship to speak of, Alexander says. They hadn’t said a word to each other in seven years. “And, um, my dad started tweeting at me.”A pause. “It’s hard for me to talk about. It’s a hard issue, because it’s tied up with my family, and also his new family. I want to be respectful.”He doesn’t sound sure whether his father even knew whether what he was doing was public but anyway, he messaged him over Twitter, in full view of social media. “And it got really, really messy. There were some Years \u0026amp Years fans who started tweeting him back, trolling my dad. He was talking back to them. It was a real head-fuck.”However clumsy the timing and the method, was a part of Alexander gratified that he got in touch?“The best way I can describe it is that when me and my dad last knew each other, when I was 13 or 14, that’s frozen in time for me,” he says. And back then, he continues, he couldn’t have imagined any better future for himself than becoming a pop star and having his father want to be a part of his life again. “But then he did get in contact with me. And it was then I realised that what that 13-year-old wanted, that wasn’t actually possible. Not any more.”What did the 13-year-old want?“I realised that a part of me wanted to be successful in music because my dad wanted to be a musician. That a part of me thought, if I became a musician and I did well, he’d be proud of me. Or he’d, y’know, be so sorry for not being the dad I wanted him to be.”But that’s not how it felt?No, he says. When they did come together, Alexander noticed that, “I’d become something that my dad was sort of intimidated by. I’d been wanting to be successful, in part, because I wanted to prove something to him. And when that happened, I realised it didn’t feel good, it just felt like… like I’d tricked somebody.”Yeah, he says, his father was foremost in his thoughts when he wrote that one. But he’d been thinking, too, about past relationships, those various boyfriends he’d dumped or been dumped by. Alexander sees a clear thread running through it all, from parental to romantic difficulties. “I guess at its heart it’s just not really being able to trust someone who says they love you. If that’s something that’s ingrained in you, then I think it’s hard to get past that.”We’re finished with lunch. Having travelled deeper into his psyche than he expected to – “normally I would have these mental conversations alone with myself, in my flat” – Alexander starts to wonder about another cigarette, and pats the pockets of his dungarees. I tell him that, yeah, I can see why he might choose to wear clothes that feel like they hug. He smiles.Before we stand up and gather our things, he asks to add a couple of “bookends” to what’s been discussed. That he experienced a lot of love and support, growing up, from his mother and grandmother. (“I feel I have to say that: My mother loved me! She tried her best!”) And also that he’s profoundly grateful to music, to his band and their followers, to the rainbow smocks and lace bodysuits and the whole pop palaver, for the release-valve it has offered a troubled mind.“There’s a lot of quite raw emotion inside me,” Alexander tells me. “Obviously. And most of the time it can only come out in these tiny little cracks. One of those cracks – that’s the music.”Commenting on this piece?

Get set with everything from advice on finding your feline friend and turning your pad into a puss-worthy palace to grooming and getting them ready for the outside world. They grow up so fast …Getting you and your pad kitten-ready need not be a drama, as long as you get to grips with just what they need to feel safe and secure. Understanding how young cats work is the key to making their transition from kittenhood to a much-loved family member as smooth as possible.“Do you need eyes in the back of your head? Maybe,” laughs registered feline behaviourist, Lucy Hoile. “But knowing how a kitten matures helps us understand their behaviour, which means fewer surprises (hopefully) and you can build a solid foundation for a lifetime of wonderful feline companionship.”Finding your new kittenIf you are responding to an advert for a kitten, there are a few pointers to be aware of to ensure you are buying from a reputable breeder.“Unlike dog breeding, there isn’t the same legislation in place for cats, so it’s best to ensure you can see the mother and her litter,” explains Hoile. “Expect to be asked a lot of information about your home setup – a caring breeder will want to know where their kitten is going.”Equally, most animal shelters have lots of unwanted kittens that need rehoming, so it is often a great place to start your search. Try the RSPCA, Cats Protection League, Battersea Dogs and Cats Home or Blue Cross for more information.Prepping your padInside, tape up any gaps that could intrigue your new kitten, such as that tiny space in between your washing machine and tumble dryer. “It’s incredible the tiny gaps your kitten can squeeze through, so better safe than sorry,” says Hoile. “Kittens are programmed to explore – they’re hunters by nature, so every new thing is an adventure. In these early weeks they have less fear than when they are a little older – they really are fearless.”You may also have noticed by now that cats can climb, so don’t presume your fencing will retain them. Kittens won’t be as strong, but they can still scale a decent height. Ensure you can keep your kitten in until they have had their first set of vaccinations (about eight weeks), before letting them explore the area around their new manor.Tip: Discuss neutering with your vet as soon as you bring your cat home – a female cat can get pregnant at around six months and an unneutered Tom is not an ideal family pet.Getting the right kitWhen it comes to shopping, less is generally more, but some specific kit is essential for settling in a kitten. “You do need to buy kitten-sized kit,” advises Hoile. “It may sound obvious but a high-sided litter tray will prevent a kitten from using it, the wrong-sized litter will be sore on a kitten’s paws and a food bowl that’s too deep will deter it from feeding adequately,” advises Hoile.As a starter kit you will need:“Buying a climbingscratchinghiding kit might seem excessive, but it’s not,” says Hoile. “Kittens climb, explore and want to hone their physical ability, if they don’t have something to climb they will shoot up your curtains, along your carpet, round your sofa … they’re programmed to train their bodies, so they need an outlet to do it.”Feeding“Kittens need to be fed little and often,” says Hoile. “Ask your breeder what foods your kitten has been used to and follow suit, making sure it is age and weight appropriate. If in doubt, ask your vet.”Myth buster: kittens and cats should not be given cow’s milk. “They can’t tolerate it and it’s a myth they crave it,” says Hoile. “Kittens and cats need fresh water in the wild they would drink from fresh running water, so they prefer to drink water fresh from the tap. Wet food is good for cats as it contains water – cats need water in their diet as they often have kidney and urine issues in later life without adequate quantities.”Worming and vaccinationsA responsible breeder or animal shelter will already have wormed your cat or will raise the issue of vaccinations with you.“Once you have your kitten, book a visit to your vet as soon as possible. Many vets hold kitten days now, they will check your kitten’s health and weight and advise on the worming, flea and vaccination programme. It is also a great way for your kitten to get accustomed to a vet’s visit. The more they are exposed to as kittens, the easier they will be to handle as adults.”GroomingGrooming isn’t just for a sleek coat, it also helps us get to know our cat’s physical shape and allows us to spot any health issues as soon as possible. Short-haired cats need grooming once a week to ensure the coat is kept free of dead hair and it helps you to bond with your cat. Longer-haired cats, such as persians, need to be groomed daily.“Otherwise, the damage to their coat and their skin can be devastating,” says Hoile. “Long-haired varieties very quickly get matted and this causes problems that go beyond just a matted coat – it can lead to skin infections and more.”House-trainingIf you get your kitten at between eight and 12 weeks, they will probably have been litter trained already.“Provide a kitten-friendly tray, with kitten-sized litter and ensure it is kept clean and accessible at all times,” says Hoile. “If your kitten isn’t using it, chances are it’s not big enough, not clean enough, or the litter is either a) too highly scented or b) too big for the kitten to rake easily.”Cats are very clean animals by nature. Once your kitten is old enough to go outside, move the litter tray outside during the day and, at night, leave a clean litter tray by the door.Going outsideYour kitten should be vaccinated before it ventures outside under supervision. International Cat Care recommends your kitten is four months old and also neutered before going into the great outdoors on its own. Most vets will microchip your kitten when they are neutered, before then a kitten safety collar with a name tag is a good idea just in case they escape – and it’s not the worst idea to keep a safety collar with a home address disc on, especially in these early days. When they are ready to go outside, monitor short trips into and around the gardensurrounding spaces.Tips for a (relatively) stress-free first-timer:Of course, not all cats love the outdoors, some are happier as house cats – if you’re unsure what’s best for your cat, speak with your vet.Whether they’re in, out or – most likely – all about, an energetic new cat needs food tailored to them. Royal Canin provides nutritionally complete, age- and breed-specific diets for optimum feline health "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8d43975afe3b6461e1a29cd9ba59a3831260112/2_266_3445_2067/master/3445.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9c747103d05d3000d4eadff648e9f2a7 1240w","title":"ever evolving story humanity david reich interview neanderthals denisovans genome","story":"For David Reich, research can be a harrowing experience. The 44-year-old Harvard University geneticist says he now goes to bed terrified he will wake up to find his team’s recent, stunning discoveries about human ancestry have been proved wrong. “We are now making so many startling insights I sometimes fear it must all be incorrect,” he says.To be fair to Reich, no one has yet found any hint his results are invalid. “That still doesn’t stop me worrying,” he insists.Reich’s work as a leader of prehistoric population studies includes the discovery that all people of non-African descent carry small amounts of Neanderthal DNA, showing that Homo sapiens – at one stage – must have interbred with this long-dead species of ancient humans. Reich was also involved in uncovering the existence of Denisovans, a previously unknown species of ancient humans, using DNA found in fossil scraps in a Siberian cave.In addition, he has discovered that 5,000 years ago northern Europe was overrun by invaders from central Asia, a migration of profound importance – for those newcomers became the first people of the British Isles.These remarkable recreations of our past are outlined in Reich’s book Who We Are and How We Got Here, in which he chronicles the spectacular rise of ancient DNA studies in the last few years. Thanks to this remarkable new science, we now know that about 70,000 years ago, our planet was remarkably rich in terms of its human variety.It was populated by modern humans, Neanderthals – and the Denisovans who, Reich has recently discovered, must have existed as at least two separate varieties: Siberian Denisovans and the more recently discovered Australo-Denisovans from south-east Asia. In addition, we also know that the Hobbit folk – Homo floresiensis, a race of tiny humans whose remains were discovered in 2003 – were then thriving in Indonesia. In those not too distant days, there were many ways to be a human, it transpires.The ingrained notion – that there has only ever been one species of human being, Homo sapiens – is a latterday fiction born of our own self-important view of ourselves. Think instead of the bar scene from Star Wars with all those various people playing and drinking, says the Israeli palaeontologist Yoel Rak. That gives a far better flavour of our evolutionary past.In making constant new discoveries about humanity, Reich and his Harvard team are now plunging into uncharted academic waters. “We are going out on a limb on so many different studies,” he says. “It is very lonely and somewhat terrifying. We don’t have the comfort of standing on the shoulders of others. We are the first. That’s why I worry.”Reich’s influence in this field has been immense and the output of his department monumental. This year alone he has been involved in producing an analysis that reveals the existence of a previously unknown group of ancient Native Americans from fossil remains uncovered in Alaska a study that shows the ancient British people who built Stonehenge and other great neolithic monuments were almost completely replaced by invaders from central Asia 5,000 years ago and a paper that indicates there were at least two waves of settlers, from Taiwan and then Papua New Guinea, which were responsible – 3,000 years ago – for the settling of one of the last pockets of the planet to be reached by humans, Vanuatu.Ancient DNA studies are overturning our oversimplified vision of our past and are the outcome of a late 20th-century revolution in molecular biology that gave scientists the power to study DNA, the material from which our genes are made, with startling precision. For the first time, the exact structure and makeup of a gene could be determined and the detailed origins of many inherited illnesses and cancers outlined, setting in motion the slow, ongoing task of developing new treatments.By contrast, the study of ancient DNA, which uses the same basic technology, began late but has since flowered far more dramatically. “It is in the area of shedding light on human migrations – rather than in explaining human biology – that the genome revolution has been a runaway success,” says Reich.The field’s hesitant start is understandable. In samples from living animals, DNA exists in long, healthy, easily analysed strands. However, DNA starts to decay the moment an organism dies and those strands quickly fragment. And the longer the passage of time, the shorter the fragments become.This disintegration poses problems. If, for example, you want to study Neanderthals, who dominated Europe for around 400,000 years and who were close in evolutionary terms to Homo sapiens, DNA from their fossils is going to be in minuscule pieces. The last member of this doomed species died more than 40,000 years ago, after all. Genetic material taken from Neanderthal fossils is also likely to be contaminated with large amounts of DNA from bacteria and vegetation – and sometimes from researchers.Trying to create a genome from these sullied scraps has been likened, by writer Elizabeth Kolbert, to reassembling “a Manhattan telephone book from pages that have been put through a shredder, mixed with yesterday’s trash and left to rot in a landfill”.Nevertheless, scientists have persevered and in 2007, geneticist Svante Pääbo, of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, decided to assemble a team of experts to sequence a Neanderthal genome that would be billions of DNA units in length. Reich, an innovator in the field of studying population mixtures, was asked to join and has since played a key role in the fledgling field’s remarkable development.Clean rooms were built, advanced gene sequencers purchased and DNA extracted from Neanderthal bones that had been found in Vindija cave in Croatia. A Neanderthal genome was slowly spliced together from pieces of DNA only a few dozen units in length. It was a brilliant achievement though Reich makes clear progress was halting. “The Neanderthal sequences we were working with had a mistake approximately every 200 DNA letters,” he reveals in his book.So yes, Homo sapiens and Neanderthals had a common ancestor, about 500,000 years ago, before the former evolved as a separate species – in Africa – and the latter as a different species in Europe. Then around 70,000 years ago, when modern humans emerged from Africa, we encountered the Neanderthals, most probably in the Middle East. We briefly mixed and interbred with them before we continued our slow diaspora across the planet.In doing so, those early planetary settlers carried Neanderthal DNA with them as they spread out over the world’s four quarters. Hence its presence in all those of non-African origin. By contrast, Neanderthal DNA is absent in people of African origins because they remained in our species’s homeland.Reich has since established that such interbreeding may have occurred on more than one occasion. More importantly, his studies show that “Neanderthals must have been more like us than we had imagined, perhaps capable of many behaviours that we typically associate with modern humans”. They would, most likely, have had language, culture and sophisticated behaviours. Hence the mutual attraction.That itself is intriguing. However, there is another key implication of Reich’s work. Previously, it had been commonplace to view human populations arising from ancestral groupings like the trunk of a great tree. “Present populations budded from past ones, which branched from a common root in Africa,” he states. “And it implies that if a population separates then it does not remix, as fusions of branches cannot occur.”But the initial separation of the two lines of ancient humans who gave rise to Neanderthals and to Homo sapiens – and then their subsequent intermingling – shows that remixing does occur. Indeed, Reich believes it was commonplace and that the standard tree model of populations is basically wrong. Throughout our prehistory, populations have split, reformed, moved on, remixed and interbred and then moved on again. Alliances have shifted and empires have fallen in a perpetual, sliding global Game of Thrones.An illustration is provided by the puzzling fact that Europeans and Native Americans share surprising genetic similarities. The explanation was provided by Reich who has discovered that a now nonexistent group of people, the Ancient North Eurasians, thrived around 15,000 years ago and then split into two groups. One migrated across Siberia and gave rise to the people who crossed the Bering land bridge between Asia and America and later gave rise to Native Americans. The other group headed west and contributed to Europeans. Hence the link between Europeans and Native Americans.No physical specimen of the Ancient North Eurasian people had ever been discovered when Reich announced their existence. Instead, he based his analysis on the ghostly impact of their DNA on present-day people. However, the fossil remains of a boy, recently found near the Siberian village of Mal’ta, have since been found to have DNA that matches the genomes of Ancient North Eurasians, giving firmer physical proof of their existence.“Prior to the genome revolution, I – like most others – had assumed that the big genetic clusters of populations we see today reflect deep splits of the past. But in fact the big clusters today are themselves the result of mixtures of very different populations that existed earlier. There was never a single trunk population in the human past. It has been mixtures all the way down.”Instead of a tree, a better metaphor would be a trellis, branching and remixing far back into the past, says Reich, whose work indicates that the idea of race is a very fluid, ephemeral concept. However, he is adamant that it is a very real one and takes issue with those geneticists who argue that there are no substantial differences in traits between populations.“This is a strategy that we scientists can no longer afford and that in fact is positively harmful,” he argues. Plenty of traits show differences between populations: skin colour, susceptibility to disease, the ability to breath at high altitudes and the ability to digest starch. More to the point, uncovering these differences is only just beginning. Many more will be discovered over the decades, Reich believes. Crucially, we need to be able to debate the implications of their presence at varying levels in different populations. That is not happening at present and that has dangerous implications.“If as scientists we wilfully abstain from laying out a rational framework for discussing human differences, we will leave a vacuum that will be filled by pseudoscience, an outcome that is far worse than anything we could achieve by talking openly,” says Reich.The genome revolution provides us with a shared history, he adds. “If we pay proper attention, it should give us an alternative to the evils of racism and nationalism and make us realise that we are all entitled equally to our human heritage.”• Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past by David Reich is published by Oxford University Press (£20).

Guests will be charged $9.5m each, or about $791,666 a night. Refundable deposits of $80,000 can now be made online. The founder Frank Bunger – described by his own company as “a serial entrepreneur and technology start-up executive” – told Bloomberg: “We want to get people into space because it’s the final frontier for our civilization.”In a press release, Orion Span said it would take “what was historically a 24-month training regimen to prepare travellers to visit a space station and streamline it to three months, at a fraction of the cost”.Customers would subsequently understand basic spaceflight, orbital mechanics and life in pressurized environments in space, the company said.The company said travellers would then “enjoy the exhilaration of zero gravity … gaze at the northern and southern aurora through the many windows, soar over their hometowns, take part in research experiments such as growing food while in orbit (which they can take home with them as the ultimate souvenir), revel in a virtual reality experience on the holodeck, and stay in touch or live stream with their loved ones back home via high-speed wireless internet access.”They would also, it said, “be treated to a hero’s welcome home”.Bunger said the project had been made possible in part because “almost every week, there’s another rocket-launch company that’s starting up with a new way to get to orbit cheaper, faster, better”.A spokeswoman told Bloomberg the company was assessing potential funding sources but would not disclose how much it wanted to raise.Orion Span would not be the first operation to offer rides into space. A number of wealthy travelers have flown to the International Space Station (ISS) with the Russian space programme – which said recently it too plans to open a “space hotel” in 2022.Dennis Tito, an American businessman, took the first “space tourism” flight in 2001, visiting the ISS for a reported $20m. He was followed by, among others, the software entrepreneur Mark Shuttleworth and the first female space tourist, Prodea Systems co-founder Anousheh Ansari. Charles Simonyi, a former Microsoft executive, has visited the space station twice.Last year, the SpaceX founder Elon Musk said his company planned to send two private citizens on a trip around the moon. The pair had paid a “significant deposit”, he said.Jeff Bezos of Amazon and the Virgin entrepreneur Richard Branson aim to give tourists short rides to the edge of space, about 60 miles up. Branson has reportedly signed up celebrities including Tom Hanks, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Katy Perry to take the $250,000 ride. Bunger, who announced his project at the Space 2.0 summit in San Jose, California, said Orion Span’s clients would be passionate about space and astronomical study.“We’re not selling a ‘Hey let’s go to the beach’ equivalent in space,” he said. “We’re selling the experience of being an astronaut. You reckon that there are people who are willing to pay to have that experience.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43d4e8d1b30076b1686c72ad32b518642b09f186/0_0_5825_3496/master/5825.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3cd7f033451a6a8900c7513361c8d51e 1240w","title":"oulton leeds prefab airey houses demolition eviction","story":"The first that the residents of Wordsworth Drive and Sugar Hill Close knew of the possibility they could be turfed out of their homes was when flyers dropped through letter boxes last autumn.At first, some of those living on this estate on the outskirts of Oulton, a village that has morphed into a suburb of Leeds, were excited about what they thought would be a much-needed project to renovate their homes, which are among the last examples of Airey houses left in Britain. Named after Sir Edwin Airey, a construction magnate, around 200 of the houses were built on the estate in the late 50s as homes for miners, and few thought they would see in the millennium.Made from prefabricated concrete and scrap metal salvaged from military vehicles, they were designed to meet the housing needs of the growing numbers of workers living outside cities. Today, some 70 still survive on the estate, their pebble-dashed exteriors and brown wooden window frames offering a stark contrast to the smarter, modern brick houses with double glazing and uPVC doors that later appeared.Barry and Mavis Abbey, both in their early 70s, have lived on the estate since 1970, when the homes were owned by the National Coal Board. They admit it has had its share of problems as the miners moved out and new tenants moved in. But they talk fondly of a community where people still look out for each other. “I wouldn’t want to move somewhere else,” Mavis said. “We have a support system here.”At one stage the Abbeys had been led to believe they would be able to buy their home under the Thatcher government’s right-to-buy scheme. But this option was denied them for reasons that remain opaque. Ex-miners like Barry believe it was in revenge for them going on strike in the mid-1980s.The estate was sold off by the NCB in 1986, after which the homes passed through a series of owners until they ended up in the hands of the Pemberstone Group, a private investment firm that boasts a erse portfolio of interests including an Italian tour operator, an indoor ski slope and the Ilford camera-film brand.Pemberstone’s “scheme” involves replacing the existing 70 Airey houses with 71 new properties, only 11 of which will be reserved for “affordable accommodation”, a number that it says is in line with Leeds city council’s Strategic Homes plan.Locals have heard that the new homes will be priced at around £300,000 – 10 times what a three-bedroom Airey house on another estate fetched recently. Surrounded by attractive green spaces, close to motorways and 20 minutes from the city centre, they should sell easily.The ex-miners, like Barry, and their widows have legal rights to be rehoused. But the prospect of moving at their age remains daunting. “When we got to know what was happening we couldn’t sleep,” Barry said.The Abbeys are the lucky ones. The occupants of more than 50 of the homes – who do not have assured tenancies – have no such protection and can, if Pemberstone gains planning permission, be ordered to leave with just two months’ notice.Pemberstone said it was talking to social housing organisations to see if they might take on the site, but it is unlikely that any could afford the expected price-tag. If no takers are found, Pemberstone intends to carry out the development in phases, building around six homes at a time over the next three to 15 years. “Given the natural turnover of properties and the long-term nature of the redevelopment, it is highly unlikely that any tenants would be asked to move from their home without being offered an equivalent alternative on the same estate,” the company said.But whether the tenants could afford the new rents is questionable.Cindy Readman, a teaching assistant who has lived on the estate for 13 years with her husband and three children, pays £500 a month for a three-bedroom house. “We couldn’t get anything like this size for the same amount of money,” she said. “There’s such a shortage of affordable housing around here. We’ve been told that once we were given notice, we would get the highest priority on the council waiting list. But even if you’re at the top, the waiting list is 70 weeks.”But the company appears to have misjudged the mood of those on the estate, some of whom have firsthand experience of confronting authority. During the strike, when money to heat their homes was scarce, Barry recalled how he and his fellow miners went into their back gardens and dug the coal seam a metre below, a quirk that Pemberstone might need to consider if it starts building work.When the Observer visited last Thursday, almost all the homes were sporting posters protesting against the scheme, and opposition is gathering momentum. A social media campaign has attracted the attention of both regional and national media.When the residents presented their reasons for opposing the scheme to the city council, they received a standing ovation. “This is the biggest injustice I’ve seen in all my time in politics,” said Karen Bruce, a Labour councillor.The fight has been joined by the Twentieth Century Society, which is backing a petition to save the homes due to their historical importance. And now, decades on from when their collieries closed, Yorkshire’s ex-miners are preparing to march again – a show of solidarity for the last vestiges of another era.“It’s not just about houses, it’s about the community spirit that will be lost,” said Chris Kitchen, general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers. “These people still talk to each other and help each other out. A lot of communities now, you don’t get that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4e5356ef5ff41fa635998c517fc7a484bcaf46f/0_219_2578_1547/master/2578.jpg?w=2500\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a325ce6856494bcd9da95e0fbb6c3030 5000w","title":"commonwealth games day three in pictures","story":"All the latest pictures from the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast as gymnasts, swimmers, cyclists and weightlifters battle for medals"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afbd47b13bcbca30bb9906d87b607fc0b0c96e3c/490_165_2367_1421/master/2367.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a105a702237aebef505399c4084326bd 1240w","title":"the masters 2018 third round live","story":"Patrick Reed takes a three-shot lead into Sunday after a day of sensational scoring at Augusta NationalOfficial Masters leaderboardWhat a third round! Some amazing performances: 65s for Rory McIlroy, Rickie Fowler and Jon Rahm, a 66 for Tommy Fleetwood. But it’s all about Patrick Reed’s 67, and those two eagles, because he’s the one with the three-shot lead going into Masters Sunday. He’s the form horse, having made 18 birdies and two eagles in 54 holes of golf so far this week. But nothing’s certain. Rory had a four-shot lead going into Sunday in 2011, you’ll remember. Greg had six on the field in 1996. So anything can happen. It promises to be a classic ... or a procession. Either way, you’ll not want to miss a shot. See you tomorrow, when the 2018 Masters begins in earnest around Amen Corner!Reed’s putt slips to the right of the cup. But no matter. That’s par, a 67 to go with his 69 and 66, and he’s three in the lead going into Sunday. Par for Leishman.Reed is calmness personified. This has been one hell of a performance ... and he serves up more brilliance by caressing his second into the green, using the banking on the right to send his ball curling in towards the flag. He’ll have a ten-foot look at birdie, a second 66 in a row, and a four-shot lead going into Masters Sunday! Wow!Reed’s playing partner Leishman has hoicked his drive deep into the trees down the left. He’s a long way back too. He appears to be contemplating a miracle smash through the smallest of gaps between two trunks. Yep, he’s going for it. And he hits a pearler, running his ball up to the front edge of the green ... well, nearly. But that was something else from where he was. I suppose in his position, eight off Reed’s lead, there’s no point being meek and mild. Fortune certainly favoured the brave there.Reed, his spirit buoyed by that magnificent par save on 17, crashes a huge drive down the last. He looks solid as a rock right now. He’s had opportunities to wobble, but every time he’s come back stronger. Whether that’ll survive a night tossing and turning, thinking about winning his first major championship, is another matter of course. But there’s plenty of time for those considerations for now let us consider only Saturday matters. If he can eke out a birdie here, he really will have one arm in the green jacket!Reed will have heard the roar, and worked out exactly what was going on. You could forgive him for shaking at the prospect of missing his par putt and his lead shrinking to two ... but he’s nerveless, and strokes it into the middle of the cup! What a wonderful up and down from a very tight spot at the back. Meanwhile a 70 for Henrik Stenson, and he ends the third round at -7.From the bank at the back of 17, Reed lifts a gentle chip to ten feet. Delicate brilliance, especially under the circumstances. Then up on 18, Rory trundles in his putt! Full advantage taken, after that big break from his wild drive! He signs for a 65, and will be in the final pairing tomorrow with Reed. He’s -11.Yes, Patrick Reed is fine. He’s on pine straw, but he’s not quite made it to the line of trees, and therefore has a clear route to the green. He overcooks his iron in, and the ball tumbles down the back. That’ll be a testing up and down, but we’ve said that before, and he’s holed out! Meanwhile on 18, Rory also has a full view of the green. He hits a big fade and lands it pin high, 20 feet to the right of the cup. What he’d give for a birdie finish.A huge break for McIlroy on 18. He slices his drive into the trees down the right, but gets a big kick back out onto the fairway. Whether he’s got a route into the green or not remains to be seen, but he can thank the golfing gods either way. Back on 17, Reed’s a bit wayward off the tee too, sending his drive into the pines down the right. He might not be in too deep, but again, we’ll have to see. Meanwhile up on 18, Jordan Spieth signs for a 71, having come back impressively with those birdies at 13 and 15. But at -5, the chances of a second green jacket look pretty slim, given how Patrick Reed is carrying on.Reed’s putt across 16 isn’t the best he’s hit today. He leaves himself four feet short ... and pushes his par effort to the right. His second bogey at a par-three on this back nine. His lead is now only four. Only four! But McIlroy’s up and down on 17 now looks even more valuable.Reed’s shot into 16 spins off to the bottom left of the green the pin’s top left. A 45-footer for birdie. The way things have been going for this amazing young American today, he’ll probably make it. On 17, McIlroy can only take his medicine and chip out from the pine straw. But he wedges his third to 18 inches, and that’s a great par from the position he found himself off the tee. Up on 18, birdie for Justin Thomas, who signs for a 70. He’s -5.McIlroy pushes his drive at 17 into the trees down the right. And he may be snookered behind a trunk. The footage was on delay, and as he contemplated the trouble he’s likely to face, the cheer generated by Reed’s chip-in for eagle crackled across the course. You could see the realisation of what had most likely occurred flash across McIlroy’s face.Reed is finding it easy all right: he’s just eagled another par five! He’s lobbed his wedge into the cup at 15 from the front right of the green! A high lob, a couple of bounces, and an unerring trundle into the cup! In his first 14 rounds at Augusta National, he’d made one eagle. He’s just made two today in three holes! And he’s now five clear of McIlroy in second place. This is quite sensational! The 2018 Masters is beginning to look like his to lose ... though there’s many a slip between cup and green jacket at Augusta, as well we know.Rory knocks his chip four feet past the hole. Enough to furrow the brow. But he makes the putt coming back, and that’s another salvaged par. He’s battling to stay on the leader’s shoulder Reed by comparison is finding the game so much easier today. A par for Stenson as well.The rain is coming down again. Nothing too dramatic yet, not like earlier, but it’s wet enough. Reed takes on the water at 15, and his 3-wood only just gets over the creek. His ball ends to the right of the green ... but it’s dry. His playing partner Leishman lets his grip go in the rain, and his ball sails miles right. He stays out of the creek too, but he’s got a testing chip to the green from way out there. Meanwhile on 16, Rory pushes his 9-iron just off the right of the green. He’s close to the flag, but it’ll be a testing chip nonetheless.Rickie Fowler’s second into 18 is nothing more than average. He’s left with a 30-foot uphill birdie putt with a gentle left-to-right break. And he would have made it, too, with a couple more joules of energy. That’s a sensational seven-under-par 65, matching Jon Rahm’s best-of-week effort from earlier. It’s his first bogey-free round here in 29 attempts. He ends the third round at -9. Could the immensely likeable Californian break his major duck this week?A huge birdie for Rory McIlroy at 15! Having taken his medicine from the trees, he wedges to the back of the green, then holes in a 15-foot left-to-right curler. He moves into second spot on his own at -10, three off Reed’s lead. Birdie for Henrik Stenson too: he’s been steady today, if not spectacular, and isn’t out of this by any stretch of the imagination. He’s -7.Bubba Watson pars the last, and signs for a 68. At -6 going into Sunday, the two-time champion will be a hovering presence felt by the leader, whoever he may be. Almost certainly Patrick Reed, let’s face it: he negotiates two ridges across the 14th green from 100 feet to five. What a wonderfully weighted putt, and he’s making no mistake in tidying up for par.Here, Jordan Spieth isn’t quite out of this yet. He’s birdied the two par-fives on the back nine, 13 and 15, and suddenly he’s -5 again. He’ll probably require Reed to have some sort of meltdown, but these things happen round Augusta, as Spieth himself knows all too well. See also: McIlroy, who lifts a wedge over the trees down the left of 15 and onto the fairway. Medicine taken.Rickie Fowler had birdied 15, and he follows that with another at 17. This one was the result of a gorgeous short iron which very nearly slam-dunked into the cup. The popular Californian, who had two top-five finishes in the majors last year, in the US Open and PGA, jumps into a share of second place!McIlroy’s tee shot at 15 bounds into the trees down the left. He’ll not be able to make the green in two from there, surely. He’s not managed to build on the momentum of that eagle on 8 at all. Patrick Reed on the other hand, has grown and grown since birdie on the same hole. He’s got a route to the green from the pine needles down the side of 14, and bashes his second onto the right-hand edge of the putting surface. The flag’s over the other side, but that’s not half bad from where he was. He’s playing calmly and with confidence. He’ll take some beating, unless the pressure of closing out his first major begins to do its awful thing.The field needs a little help from Reed, and he might have given them it by hooking his drive at 14 into trees. We’ll see. Up on the green, Stenson and McIlroy have both sent their second shots 12 feet past the flag, setting up birdie chances. Neither can convert. We’re not at the stage yet where these chances simply can’t be missed ... there’s too much narrative to unfold yet ... but spurning them doesn’t help, and McIlroy’s chest heaves a sigh accordingly.Jon Rahm finds the front of the 18th with his second. He’s faced with a putt that’s the best part of 100 feet uphill. He rolls it up the ridge to three feet, a simply wonderful effort from there. Par, and he signs his name to a best-of-week 65! He’s the new clubhouse leader at -8. Meanwhile the actual leader Reed, in the no-nonsense fashion, curls his left-to-right breaker into the cup at 13 for eagle! He moves four clear at the top, and in this mood will take some catching.And McIlroy can’t afford a mistake, because coming behind him, Patrick Reed is playing like a dream. He’s split the 13th fairway too, but he’s not making a mistake with his approach like Rory. A long iron arrowed straight at the flag, one of the shots of the week, and he’ll have a 12-foot look at eagle!Rory chips wonderfully to four feet. And rolls in the par saver! On the one hand, that’s not ideal, having blasted a lovely drive down the middle of the hole. On the other, serious disaster loomed when, for a terrible moment, he feared his ball was lost. That’s a stunning scramble in the circumstances, having got himself into terrible trouble. He blows his cheeks out hard, knowing he’s got away with one there.McIlroy’s found his ball! He’s standing waist-deep in the flowers, with a grim look on his grid. Can he get a swing to this? It looks as though he’s going to give it a whack. This could be costly. But he manages to punch it out onto the fringe! That at least gives him a chance to get up and down to scramble his par. What drama! That brief tempest nearly knocked McIlroy seriously off course. Even a bogey might be a reasonable result after that off-kilter, slippery second shot.The rain brings instant pain for Rory, whose grip slips as he hits his second into 13. That sends his ball high into the bank of azaleas to the left of the green. He might have lost that. He’s looking for it with great concern on his face. Ah, the rain has eased off, which is the only bit of good news.Reed’s tee shot to 12 is a little strong, over the back left. The pin’s in the immediate environs, just on the green, but Reed is overly aggressive with his chip and sends his ball sailing 12 feet past. He can’t knock in the return, and slips back to -11. Ever the good metaphor, the rain suddenly comes down very heavily. Wow. Seems like the forecasters knew what they were taking about after all.Cameron Smith is making a move! The 24-year-old Aussie birdied 2, 13 and 15, and now he’s nearly holed in one at 16. He’ll kick in to move to -5. Back-to-back birdies for Bubba, at 14 and 15, and he’s right up there at -6. Justin Rose creams an iron into 15 to set up a ten-footer for eagle, but he doesn’t hit his putt and has to settle for birdie. He’s -3. Rahm eases his second at 17 to ten feet, then registers his second birdie on the bounce: he’s -8.Patrick Reed has made three birdies in a row on three separate occasions this week. Can he register his first run of four? Not quite. But it’s a beautifully weighted putt on 11, and he’s tapping in for his par. Still -12. And it’s yet another close shave for Leishman, who is inches from birdie. He stays at -6, and looks super-frustrated. He’s not playing badly, but his putter is stone cold. Over on the 12th green, Rory splashes out of sand and somehow gets an abnormal amount of check spin, which means he’s got a longer par putt than he’d have liked. A testing seven footer. And in it goes! He fist-pumps the air. He knows how important that could be come tomorrow afternoon. He stays three behind Reed at -9.McIlroy’s tee shot at 12 hits the lip of the bunker at the front and topples back into the sand. Back up the hill, Reed is firing into 11. He aims straight at the flag, but he’s a little bit shy. His ball creeps onto the green. Should be an easy two-putt it’s an outside chance for birdie. Or a good chance for birdie, the way Reed’s been putting today. Meantime up on 16, Rahm whips a gorgeous tee shot to ten feet, and rolls in the birdie effort. He’s -7.McIlroy sets his putt at 11 away on the right line ... but doesn’t give it quite enough. His ball dies at the last turn, and he’s forced to tap in for a par. He mouths the EFF word in frustration. So close to closing the gap at the top. Meanwhile up on 18, Tommy Fleetwood can’t make his par from distance, but a round of 66 is pretty fine work nonetheless. He goes into the final round at -6, well placed for a run at the title ... providing Patrick Reed doesn’t keep making birdies, that is.Rickie Fowler salvages his par on 13. He wedges from the drop zone to five feet, and knocks what’s left into the centre of the cup. He stays at -7, and after getting wet, that’ll be a small boost. (Speaking of getting wet, the forecast rain’s stayed away. Woo hoo!) On 11, McIlroy sends his second straight at the flag and leaves himself a 15-footer for birdie. And on 14, birdie for Bubba, the reward for screeching a wedge to a couple of feet. He’s -5.Rahm’s second into 15 goes over the back of the green. He knocks a fine wedge to six feet, but doesn’t hit the birdie putt, and remains at -5. Up on 18, Fleetwood’s second finds the heart of the green, but it’s teetering on the ridge that runs across the middle, and loses the battle of gravity. The ball comes rolling back, which means he’ll have a long two putts for his par and a round of 65.Disaster for Rickie Fowler on 13, as he loses his second shot, a fairway wood, to the right. And that means his ball doesn’t make it over the creek. Ker-plunk. Back on 10, Marc Leishman watches another birdie putt narrowly fail to drop. But Patrick Reed’s flat stick is hot now, and he curls in his short birdie chance to tear three clear at the top! Three birdies in a row!

Now, at the age of 90, Harold “Hal” Prince is embarking on two more musicals.One is inspired by an award-winning documentary, How to Dance in Ohio, about a group of autistic children who find a way to realise their potential. The other, set in the 19th century, explores the roles and responsibilities of men and women – “an old-fashioned musical done in a new-fashioned way”, he says. “A very contemporary subject, and we’re trying to have a lot of fun with it.”Winner of more Tony Awards than anyone else, Harold Prince has collaborated with the theatre greats, including Kander and Ebb, who wrote Cabaret, Bock and Harnick, writers of Fiddler on the Roof and Stephen Sondheim, who wrote lyrics for West Side Story.\u0026nbspIn 1971, Prince staged Follies, which at a cost of $800,000 was then the most expensive musical ever produced.He is responsible for numerous stage hits, including Cabaret (which he produced and directed in 1966), Evita (director, 1979) and ­­The Phantom of the Opera (director, 1986).Prince received a special Tony award for lifetime achievement in theatre in 2006.The roll-call of celebrated names with whom Prince has collaborated is extraordinary: “I did the first musical with Kander and Ebb, who wrote Cabaret, the first musical with Bock and Harnick, who wrote Fiddler on the Roof, and Steve Sondheim wrote the lyrics for West Side Story, so I’ve had great good fortune working with people who were very fresh.”In Prince’s recent memoir, Sense of Occasion, he recalls picking up West Side Story after Sondheim told him that they had lost their producer and there was “absolutely no interest from anyone on Broadway in doing a show about gang warfare in Hell’s Kitchen”. Prince jumped at the chance: “Sondheim and Bernstein played the score, and soon I was singing along with them.”On Jerome Robbins’s direction of West Side Story, Prince says: “During the rehearsal period of West Side, he related the cast thoroughly to their gangs. Half were Jets and half were Sharks. They travelled in packs away from the theatre. They were young and inexperienced, and identification improved their acting.”Though he continues to work in the business, Prince has reservations about the world of the modern musical, where the stars sell the show, rather than the show creating the stars. An exception, he points out, was Hamilton, which wowed audiences and produced hits without relying on the household names beloved of investors.The groundbreaking productions of the 70s and 80s, he says, were made possible by dozens of investors but could not be staged today because investors are no longer prepared to take risks. They now prefer to follow the template of previous hits, which can lead to pale imitations rather than “extending the danger and vision of theatre”.The problem is that costs have spiralled. In 1971, Prince staged Follies, a smash hit, for nearly $800,000, then the most expensive musical ever produced, he says. Today it would cost up to $20m, as $800,000 covers little more than “a one-set play with two characters”.The financial risks of backing such productions are stifling artistic risks. “There’s a temptation to copycat, but I don’t think it’s good for the future of the artform.” Classic productions such as Follies were “audacious” and “never designed to be primarily a commercial success”, he says. “Producers today are influenced by what they think audiences want, which is frequently ‘the same old thing’. That’s really what’s happened.“Audiences are better than that. They’re quite willing to go where they’ve never been before. But producers are not willing to take them there. That’s because of the cost. It becomes too much of a business and too little of an artform. We are deluged with limited-engagement productions, usually revivals, featuring huge stars. They guarantee paying back their investments but with limited profit potential. And revivals, though important historically, are not new work. They do not represent the now or the future of the theatre.”Back in the day, Prince’s investors took the original gamble of putting unlikely shows on Broadway that ended up making history. “We had a record of three successes before West Side Story, and our investors were willing to go with us. The same applied to Fiddler. Four or five successes later, we had such a good run of luck that my investors never asked any questions, never read a script, never wanted a read-through.”Ultimately, says Prince, live performance is about sparking imaginations: “That’s what’s exciting.”Winner of more Tony awards than anyone else, Hal Prince (pictured winning for Show Boat in 1995) has worked with the theatre greats, including Kander and Ebb, who wrote Cabaret, Bock and Harnick, writers of Fiddler on the Roof, and Stephen Sondheim, who wrote lyrics for West Side Story.In 1971 Prince staged Follies.

Additionally, it did work for John Bolton, the newly appointed national security adviser to Donald Trump, and the US senators Thom Tillis and Ted Cruz.The Observer first revealed links between Cambridge Analytica and AIQ last May. Two weeks ago, Christopher Wylie, the ex-Cambridge Analytica whistleblower, told how he had helped set up the company when he asked friends in his home town of Victoria, British Columbia, to come and work with Cambridge Analytica. AIQ has denied Wylie had any involvement in setting up the company.At that time, AIQ removed a quote from Dominic Cummings, Vote Leave’s chief strategist, from the home page of its website. Previously, it had said: “Without a doubt, the Vote Leave campaign owes a great deal of its success to the work of AggregateIQ. We couldn’t have done it without them.”Ten days ago, Wylie gave evidence about AIQ to British MPs on the culture, media and sport select committee and also handed over legal documents that showed the connections between it and SCL Elections, including two contracts and an IP licence as well as an email between Jeff Silvester, the cofounder of AIQ, and Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica.The email, about the campaign for Bolton, referenced Aleksandr Kogan and the Facebook data he had harvested on behalf of Cambridge Analytica.Last week, AIQ told the Observer it was not a direct part andor the Canadian branch of Cambridge Analytica, and that it had not been involved the exploitation of Facebook data.The company is already intertwined in an investigation by the Electoral Commission, which in November reopened an investigation into a donation of £625,000 that Vote Leave had given its youth campaign, BeLeave, saying there were “reasonable grounds to suspect an offence may have been committed”.It is perfectly legal for one campaign to donate to another if they are separate, but the donation went straight from Vote Leave to AIQ, and a second whistleblower, Shahmir Sanni, a 22-year-old volunteer with BeLeave, told the Observer they had no control over how the money was spent. Vote Leave has repeatedly denied the coordination between the campaigns and said the donation was legitimate pursuant to electoral law. When the commission first looked at this in March 2017 it agreed with Vote Leave. The information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, who is leading another investigation into the use of data in the referendum, said: “AggregateIQ has not been especially cooperative with our investigation. We are taking further steps in that matter.” AIQ says it has answered all the questions put to it by the commission.Both Cummings and Darren Grimes, of BeLeave, told the paper they found the firm – which has just 20 staff operating out of a cramped office above an opticians in Victoria, 4,760 miles away – “on the internet”.However cached searches show AggregateIQ did not show up in Google searches at that time and a new source within Vote Leave has come forward to say Cummings had full knowledge of the connections between the two firms. AIQ says it has had a website since it was founded in 2013.Silvester said Cambridge Analytica was not in contact with AIQ during the referendum campaign. “AIQ never worked or even communicated in any way with Cambridge Analytica or any other parties related to Cambridge Analytica with respect to the Brexit campaign. Any claim that we shared Vote Leave data with Cambridge Analytica or anyone else in any way is entirely false.”AIQ has yet to release a statement in relation to the suspension."},{"url":null,"title":"reunited after 24 years rare happy ending for chinas broken families","story":"The story of Kang Ying, and the parents who searched 24 years for her, moved the countryGrowing up, Kang Ying didn’t think much about the fact that she was adopted. Her family, farmers in a rural county of China’s south-western Sichuan province, never treated her differently. When Kang asked about her birth parents, she was told she had been found on the street, a little girl no more than four years old, probably abandoned.In March, Kang, now 28, learned that was not the whole story. Married and with children of her own, she began to wonder about her own mother. She searched online for “child lost more than 20 years ago” and came across a sketch that made her stop. The drawing had been posted by a couple in Chengdu, about 100 miles from where she grew up, who had been searching for their daughter for the last 24 years. The father, a taxi driver, had been handing out cards about his missing daughter to all of his passengers. The online ad was their latest effort.She called the contact listed and, less than a month later, flew to Chengdu to meet her birth parents. The family met for the first time on Tuesday in an emotional reunion that captured the public imagination, a rare happy ending for one of the thousands of Chinese families who have lost a child.On Friday, Kang was visiting her parents again to celebrate their reunion in her father’s village, two hours from Chengdu where they normally live. Her mother washed dishes and prepared food in a dark kitchen at the back of the family home. Kang took her children to play outside. “I thought it would be awkward meeting them after so much time, but it felt natural. I guess it’s because we are family,” Kang said.In China, anywhere between 50,000 and 200,000 children go missing every year, according to estimates. In most cases the children have been abandoned, the result of multiple factors: rural poverty, China’s formerly stringent one-child policy, a preference for sons and larger families, and local traditions.But many have also been kidnapped, to be sold within the country as couples struggle with rising infertility rates and imbalances caused by population controls. Boys fetch higher prices, but according to Anqi Shen, a professor at Northumbria Law School in Newcastle who researched trafficking, girls are also in demand because of the belief they will take care of ageing parents.“What we can say is that child trafficking and abduction was a historical social problem in China, and it remains a serious problem,” she said.Kang’s parents, Wang Mingqing and Liu Dengying, were selling bananas at a market in Chengdu in 1994 when Kang, whom they had named Qifeng and called Fengwazi, or “Feng baby”, went missing. Liu sent her husband to get change for a customer. When he returned, Kang had disappeared. They ran through the market shouting her name but she was gone. She was three years old. Liu sank into a depression, refusing to work, sleep or eat. Her husband cycled the streets of Chengdu calling his daughter’s name. Eventually they went back to work. They had two other children.But they never quite let it go. Wang subscribed to a newspaper hoping for news of Kang. In 2015, he began driving for the taxi-hailing app Didi and had hundreds of cards printed with information about their missing daughter. They did not have a photograph of Kang so they used a picture of her sister. Every time the phone rang, Liu would jump, thinking it might be Kang. Eventually, news of Wang’s efforts went viral and a police sketch artist volunteered to do the drawing that caught Kang’s attention. When Kang called them in March, the three of them spoke over video on WeChat. Wang and Liu had spoken to 30 other women they thought might be Kang but this time felt different.“When we saw her I had this feeling of being a mother that I never felt with any of the others. I knew for sure she was my daughter,” Liu said.They started to talk over the phone every day, and decided Kang should do a DNA test. When she became anxious about how long it would take, Wang told his daughter: “We’ve been waiting for this for years. It’s OK if we wait a few days more.”China has criminalised the buying of children, punishable with three years in prison, and established a national DNA database for searching families. Still, the problem persists. On the website, Baobeihuijia, or Baby Come Home, more than 41,000 sets of parents are looking for lost children. On 1 April, Kang got a call from the police telling her she should book a flight to Chengdu. Her DNA matched. Two days later, Kang made the journey with her husband and two children. They were swarmed by a horde of reporters and television crews.“I’d never seen so many people. My mind went empty,” she said. In the crowd she saw her mother holding a sign: “Child, welcome home.” Kang went back to her parent’s home in Chengdu, where they stayed up until the early hours of the morning. “I don’t remember what we talked about. We just didn’t stop talking,” she said.The next day, Kang’s father wanted to take her to his village, two hours from Chengdu, where his family has lived for generations. Relatives and friends came, filling 20 dining tables set out in the yard. Kang’s father parked at the village gate and insisted on carrying her on his back the rest of the way. He told her how much his parents, now dead, had prayed that she would be found. “Now I can finally tell my mom I’ve brought our Fengwazi back,” he said.Kang, who lives in China’s northern Jilin province, more than 1,500 miles from Chengdu, still talks with her birth parents most days. They understand that she has a separate life and her own family. On Thursday on Tomb Sweeping Day, a holiday for families to honour their ancestors, Wang drove them three hours to where Kang’s adoptive father and grandparents are buried. Kang watched as her parents knelt and kowtowed at their graves. They thanked them for raising their daughter and said they were sorry they had not.“At that moment, I really felt like crying. I don’t want my parents to feel regretful. It’s not their fault,” Kang said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68a8e5e257bf425d8fc566f4871f0b477b805b04/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=bfa451b79b2562ba502dd26e0195c15c 1240w","title":"the spirit of 1968 rises again can french students and workers triumph","story":"President Macron faces his biggest challenge as strikes and protests recall the epic struggle that rocked France to its core. We can win, insist this generation…At Nanterre university, on the outskirts of Paris, militant students have a dilemma: how can they pass their end-of-year exams while simultaneously fighting to derail the French government’s education reforms?“It’s a worry, but we’ll find a way,” says Annaël Lombe, a student union leader who is taking his political science finals in a few weeks. “Exams or not, we won’t stop the protest. We will carry on the action.”Fifty years ago, Nanterre students issued much the same warning. It turned out to be far from an idle threat. Subsequent protests at Nanterre sparked the May 1968 civil unrest that drew 10 million students and striking workers on to the streets and brought France to a halt. It was a dramatic – some thought revolutionary –moment in French history that nearly toppled a government.In the end, the protests fizzled out, but even now the events remain a model of how people power can rattle French political leaders and in doing so change society.Today, as France again faces revolts from students and workers, the left sees a rare opportunity to reignite the spark that set the country alight in 1968: railway workers opposed to legislation to change their status have taken to the streets en masse and halted much of the train network Air France pilots are striking over pay the elderly are furious about pension reforms students are protesting over proposed changes to access to higher education.President Emmanuel Macron plans to change the baccalaureate requiring students to specialise earlier and to introduce more selective entry requirements for universities as opposed to the current lottery system. Opponents say the measures go against France’s tradition of free education for all and will penalise poorer students.For Macron, this is the biggest challenge to his leadership since his election a year ago. For others, such as the hard-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, this chaos has the makings of a long-awaited convergence des luttes: a coming together of various worker and popular struggles into one general movement. May 1968 revisited, in other words.“The president of the rich has decided to confront us,” Mélenchon said last week. “We will fight back. We will see who will have the final word. If we have the wisdom to unite across the country … the final word will be ours. To those who suggest with a wry smile that I dream of May ’68, I say, yes it’s a fine dream. I prefer my lovely dream to the nightmares that are in the process of happening.”Protest – often violent and disruptive – is part of France’s political culture. As the historian, writer and commentator Jacques Julliard pointed out: “To go from Louis XVI to Louis XVIII, that is to say from moderate absolutism to parliamentary monarchy, those maladroit foreigners would have gone by way of a Louis XVII. Instead, we went via Robespierre and Napoleon.”May 1968 still ides France, half a century on: a triumph of idealism and emancipation for the left a tragedy marking the beginning of the end of the Gaullist era and the disintegration of French society for those on the right.Les évènements were unexpected but did not come out of the blue. Charles de Gaulle, 77, had been in power for almost a decade, and while France was economically prosperous, it was run by a rigidly conservative administration. Women were not allowed to open bank accounts without their husband’s permission homosexuality and abortion were crimes there was a record number of university students, who were strictly segregated into separate dormitories.The Nanterre students took their protests to the heart of Paris: the Left Bank and the Sorbonne, ripping up paving stones to lob at CRS riot police, whom they taunted with CRS SS placards. Paris’s most celebrated quarter became both a battleground and a debating club. The students joined forces with eight million angry workers – who worried De Gaulle’s government more – but union leaders were as traditional and paternalistic as the president, and spooked by his suggestion that the youthful revolution was heading towards a Communist takeover.The government wobbled, saving itself by making major concessions to the striking workers. Despite the rallying call of Jean-Paul Sartre, committed to the strikers’ cause, workers went back to work and the students returned to their studies. “The Communists are afraid of the revolution,” Sartre wrote afterwards.Thomas Guénolé, of Mélenchon’s La France Insoumise party, says May 1968 was not just about 60s sexual emancipation or a “spiritual revolution” but was also part of a “global revolt against capitalism” which carries on today. “From beginning to end, May ’68 was a social movement, with the aim of overthrowing the system. It didn’t succeed, but it would confirm the fundamental lesson of the massive strikes of 1919-1920 and 1936, and that is: when a large strike paralyses the economy of a country, the government and employers give in after a few weeks at the most. Fifty years on, this lesson is still valid,” Guenolé said recently.Others see little chance of today’s protesters, with their erse demands, forming a strong enough alliance to force the reformist Macron and his government, elected only a year ago, to capitulate.Laurent Bouvet, a political scientist, believes today’s protests are the French left’s attempt to rerun last year’s presidential and legislative elections, in which they were defeated (and in the case of the Socialist party trounced).“This is Mélenchon, the unions, the far left and even the Parti Socialiste trying to get their revenge for Macron’s election. It’s a return match,” Bouvet told the Observer. “But having voted Macron in only a year ago, I cannot see the French in massive numbers turning against him – even those who didn’t vote for him and don’t agree with his reforms.”He added: “People have forgotten the reality of May ’68. They forget the general strike that paralysed transport and remember it as a student revolt. What happened, and this is particularly French, is the people who organised this revolt quickly became people who had responsible jobs in the media, and when the left finally arrived in power in 1980 they began celebrating ’68 because it was such an important date in their youth.“And so a mythology emerged about the events on both sides, left and right, that was completely false.” It was really the last big movement in which the left played a big part, and everyone on the left wants to keep that illusion.”As the current wave of rolling strikes by rail workers, and sit-ins and blockades by students continues, opinion polls show France is ided over support for Macron’s economic reforms, a pillar of his presidential manifesto. La France Insoumise has been leafleting students across the country, and Mélenchon has called for two anti-Macron demonstrations in Marseille, his parliamentary constituency.Outside the Sorbonne in the Latin Quarter of Paris, there is no blockade, and many students seemed indifferent to the protests. “I’m not happy with the reforms, and I think Macron is being authoritarian,” said Anya, a humanities student reading in the sunshine. “We have to protest for what we believe that’s what young people do. But this isn’t May ’68. The social context is completely different.”Nor was there any sign of students revolting at Nanterre on Friday. But Lombe, 24, the treasurer of France’s main student union UNEF, which has 30,000 members, including 800 at Nanterre, says the protest movement is growing, directed at a society in which “precariousness has replaced prosperity”.“1968 was our grandparents’ battle. In every era the young have decided to mobilise because they have had something to say and they don’t agree with society. It’s what we do: we challenge, fight, make demands. Although our demands are different, the young today, like those in 1968, want to be autonomous, emancipated, recognised as equals to the rest of society. We want people to listen to us,” Lombe said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ba01dc9382ba2540098ba321563d569700dcb06/0_301_4600_2760/master/4600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=19c064abf7386dc5b9f1de3f3bc0ed82 1240w","title":"are you getting the most from your savings","story":"Save cash and get more money – for free. It sounds like a win-win situation, but is a Lifetime Isa right for you?If someone offered you thousands of pounds towards the purchase of your first home, you might think the prospect was too good to be true. But that’s what’s on offer if you save using a Lifetime Isa. The latest addition to the range of inidual savings accounts, Lifetime Isas give savers the chance to earn extra funds to put towards their first property or later life.“Having the government bonus is a great way to boost your savings – for every £4 you save you are getting another £1,” says Nici Audhlam-Gardiner, managing director at financial services provider OneFamily. “Even if you have got a relatively small amount to save, it does add up.”There are, of course, a couple of catches – the money can only be used to buy a property if it is genuinely your first, and the accounts can only be opened by people aged 18 to 39. However, the bonus keeps being paid, every month you pay in, until you turn 50. That means if you start as soon as you turn 18 and put in the maximum every year, you can get up to £32,000 from the government.“It isn’t for short-term savings – when people open one, either they are going to use it for a house deposit or it is going to be tucked away for their retirement,” says Audhlam-Gardiner.If you’re a steady Eddie and don’t fancy taking too much risk, a cash Lifetime Isa, similar to a normal savings account, may be most appealing. Anyone prepared to take a bit more risk can opt for a stocks and shares Lifetime Isa. If the stock market goes up, this could provide better returns than a simple cash Lifetime Isa, but you can lose money too. Stocks and shares Lifetime Isas are better suited to longer-term investments, of at least 5 years, so that any dips in the market are balanced out.Whichever you choose, you will have to plan a little in advance – you’ll need to have an account for a year before you can use it to buy a home.Got all that?

During discussions in October 2016, Mr Pitt was advised that the radio station might have a value of up to €14 million, approximately €20 million less than was being sought. The sale never went ahead.The purchase of Newstalk was promoted by the then chairman of INM, Leslie Buckley, according to an affidavit before the High Court from the Director of Corporate Enforcement, Ian Drennan. Mr Buckley is a close business associate of Mr O’Brien.According to Mr Drennan’s affidavit, there was an exchange of text messages on November 11th, 2016, between Mr Buckley and Mr O’Brien about Mr Pitt’s protected disclosure.The INM board was not aware of the matter until 10 days later, on November 21st, when it established a committee to investigate. The committee met on November 22nd and November 23rd. It heard from Mr Buckley but did not invite Mr Pitt to appear before it.The affidavit goes on to say the committee came to a unanimous decision on November 23rd that there was no evidence of any matter that constituted a serious concern for INM, and decided to advise the board to take no further action.Mr Drennan, in his affidavit, described this as “wholly unsatisfactory and inadequate” and said there was a failure to appreciate the gravity of the situation. The affidavit quotes a text from INM director Len O’Hagan to Mr Buckley on November 26th where he said: “I know it’s galling for us but I believe we now need to write the cheque and be done with him.” Mr Buckley replied that he had the INM lawyers working on it.Mr O’Brien later sent a message to Mr Buckley that said: “This storm will pass. I know it is awful for you, but we need to play the long game. This will put pressure on the two malcontents... Ultimately we may have to get them out and pay them. Best regards, Denis.”After the committee’s decision, Mr Pitt threatened legal action, and an independent review was established. It did not come to a definitive finding on the disclosures because of the gulf between what was said by Mr Buckley and by senior management. Mr Pitt then made a protected disclosure to Mr Drennan. Mr O’Brien did not respond to a request for a comment. Mr Buckley has said he will “robustly defend” himself against any allegation made by Mr Drennan. A spokesman for INM had no comment.Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3453320.1523042669!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"department-collects-280-planning-documents-for-worst-case-brexit-1.3453322","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, who is managing the Government’s Brexit team. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Department of Foreign Affairs has collected emergency plans from all Government departments amounting to 280 documents in preparation for the possibility of no deal being reached on Brexit. Plans were sought by the department, which is leading the Government’s preparations for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU in March 2019, as part of contingency planning for a worst-case scenario. The reports sought from the departments are aimed at preparing a Government-wide response to manage a disorderly Brexit, including any emergency legislation required and measures to deal with high tariffs imposed on goods entering and leaving the UK and delays at Irish and British ports. In some cases, the department has sought more detailed plans, resulting in dozens more documents being submitted by the Departments of Finance and Business. The Department of Finance has looked at whether new legislation would be required for financial services in the event of a hard Brexit given that contracts in this area are governed by English law.The potential number of new customs and excise staff and additional resources required by the Revenue Commissioners to manage post-Brexit inspections and Border checks has also been explored by the department.“A massive amount of work has been going on across all Government departments to ensure Ireland is prepared for every eventuality with Brexit,” said a spokesman for Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Simon Coveney, who is managing the Government’s Brexit team.“We have to be prepared for a disorderly Brexit and that work is under way, it is contingency planning we hope never to have to use,” he added.The department has declined to release details of the planning contained within the documents as it was “still being processed and is extremely sensitive” with Brexit negotiations ongoing, said the spokesman.“It is not in the national interest for us to air our contingency planning for all to see during international negotiations which are of such fundamental importance for the future of the island,” he said.EU and UK negotiators have been meeting over the quiet Easter period in Brussels discussing for the first time potential ways to avoid a hard Border on the island of Ireland.In a separate development, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has accepted an invitation to visit Ireland again at the end of this month. Mr Barnier is expected to visit the Border and possibly Belfast when he visits for the Government’s next all-island civic dialogue on Brexit, comprising 1,500 civic society and industry representatives, in Dundalk, Co Louth. Ahead of that visit, Mr Coveney will continue his round of shuttle Brexit diplomacy, briefing foreign ministers of smaller EU countries over the coming week on Ireland’s concerns around the UK’s departure.Portuguese foreign minister Augusto Santos Silva will visit Mr Coveney at Iveagh House in Dublin on Monday. The Tánaiste will meet the new Dutch foreign minister, Stef Blok, in The Hague on Wednesday.He will then host German foreign minister Heiko Maas in Dublin on Thursday. Ahead of a meeting of foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Monday week Mr Coveney will host the foreign ministers of the EU’s Nordic and Baltic member states along with Mr Blok at a dinner the previous evening.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orceThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3454411.1523124430!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fact-almost-10-000-people-homeless-a-blight-on-society-1.3454412","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople taking part in a  protest organised by the National Homeless and Housing Coalition in Dublin on Saturday. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw.Figures showing that almost 10,000 people were homeless across the State at the end of February are a “shame and a blight on our society”, a housing rally in Dublin has heard.The protest, organised by the National Homeless and Housing Coalition, saw participants march from the Garden of Remembrance to Custom House Quay.It was told that trade unions would mobilise to press for the building of 10,000 public homes every year for the next five years.The latest homelessness figures, for the month of February, show almost 10,000 iniduals are homeless with 3,755 children among the total.Kevin Callanan, the vice-president of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (Ictu), described the figures as a “shame and a blight on our society”.He told the crowd that Congress had set up a committee to campaign for an end to homelessness. It will have three aims: The first is for the Government to declare a homelessness emergency. The second is for the building of 10,000 homes by the State every year for five years, and the third is for a referendum giving everybody a right to a home.“Where stands the Republic if they can’t vindicate this basic right. What is liberty without social solidarity and equality?” he asked.“We need a national policy once and for all to make the country’s national resources work for the people.”The rally was also addressed by homelessness campaigner Fr Peter McVerry, who said the Government had failed to address the housing crisis in an adequate way.“Government must go back to the drawing board, look at the policies that they are currently operating to address the homeless and housing problem,” he said.Fr McVerry maintained the Government was doing very little while house prices and rents were increasing all the time.He suggested it should adopt radical measures including making it illegal for landlords, bankers and vulture funds to making anybody homeless “except in very exceptional circumstances”.He also recommended that the Government must draw up an inventory of empty properties and sites and bring them back into use.Social housing needs to be built “on a much more massive scale” than at present, he said.“There is no sense of urgency. There does not seem to be any sense of a commitment to tackling this which the Minister for Finance (Paschal Donohoe) said was the most serious social problem this country has faced in a generation.”The rally heard from Tracey Hanby, a nurse, who said she has been at risk of homelessness for the last seven years.She said she was part of a “new demographic” of those facing bankruptcy and homelessness and has arrears of €70,000 to the bank. She described herself as “almost homeless”.A crowd of approximately 1,000 people gathered in Customs House for the rally, although organisers claimed 15,000 participated in the march from the Garden of Remembrance .Siptu national campaigns and equality organiser Karan O’Loughlin, who compered the event, said it was now up to the parties of the left to bring a Bill forward to deal with homelessness.They want the Bill to be brought before the Dáil in September. She said it needed to include an end to evictions and a freeze on all rents.“This (the rally) is only the tip of the iceberg for what is coming. Once the politicians of the left line up, we will be targeting other politicians to join us.”Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"the-agreement","story":"A central figure in Good Friday negotiations, PUP leader is on political margins, 20 years onFormer deputy leader of SDLP says deal has been damaged in some eyes, but it still has promiseTwo decades after it was signed, the agreement that underpins the peace looks vulnerableFormer US President will receive the award at a ceremony on April 10th in Ulster HallTwenty years ago, a team concluded negotiations that sealed Belfast AgreementThe 1998 accord did not end the Troubles, but it did result in extraordinary progressFormer SDLP leader says deal has been damaged but has not outlived its usefulnessDo our current leaders have the same skills as those who helped secure the Belfast Agreement?Officials in both governments acknowledge lack of chemistry between Varadkar and MayHave we seen the new beginning to policing which was promised asks Joanne Murphy?Some families have campaigned for over 40 years for truth and justiceBritish-Irish relationship is both bedrock of agreement and its driving force, writes Katy HaywardThe Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister have staked their political reputations on the comprehensive peace package agreed\u0026hellipPerhaps, in time, the date will resonate in the collective memory of our children and our grandchildren, just as 1916 or 1912\u0026hellipWe send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayInvalid email or password."}]
