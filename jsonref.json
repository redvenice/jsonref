Photograph: iStockAs the country exits the emergency phase of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Government has agreed to lift the vast majority of the remaining public health restrictions.What are the new changes?From Monday, there is no longer a legal requirement for mask wearing, including in retail, personal services and schools.Specific protective measures in place in schools and early-learning and school-aged childcare facilities are also being lifted, such as the requirement for pods, social distancing and staggered breaks.What will still remain in place?\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhile the mandatory requirement to wear face coverings has been lifted, it will continue to be advised on public transport and in healthcare settings, the Government said.In early-learning settings, school-aged childcare, primary and secondary schools, infection prevention and control measures will remain, such as ventilation, hand hygiene measures and advice to stay at home if symptomatic.The antigen testing programme will also continue in these facilities.But what if I still want to wear a mask?\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe changes remove the legal mandate to wear them, but it does not mean you cannot do so if you wish.Public health experts have advised the public to use their own judgment on the use of masks in retail settings, personal services, schools and busy crowds, particularly if they’re not well-ventilated facilities.Will schools operate in a manner similar to pre-pandemic times?\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPretty much, with the exception of the aforementioned infection prevention measures around ventilation, hand hygiene and remaining at home if symptomatic.Guidance issued to schools from the Department of Education states “in general schools should now resume normal school routines and normal teaching and learning activities”.Staff and students are no longer required to wear a face covering but they can if they wish to do so on a personal basis.Schools should continue to make masks available on request as they are currently doing, the guidance added.Is school transport affected by these changes?\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe wearing of face coverings or masks on school transport will no longer be mandatory but will continue to be advised.All other measures relating to hygiene, including the provision of hand sanitiser and additional cleaning of services, and pre-assigned seating will remain in place subject to further review.What about the office?\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSince January 24th, employees have been permitted to undergo a phased return to the office.It is no longer required that people be spaced apart or in pods, and face masks are optional.However, employers should continue to support those workers who want to continue using face coverings, the Government’s protocol on returning to the workplace states.Is everyone happy with these changes?\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe teachers’ unions have expressed concern and caution over the end of the mask-wearing requirement in classrooms.The Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) said the move could be “premature”, while the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland (Asti) said it would “continue to urge caution”.Denis Hynes, sector organiser for hospitality at Siptu trade union, said there is an “air of caution” among hospitality workers. Many have concerns that it is too soon as cases remain high, and many workers intend to continue wearing face coverings for their own safety, he added.Do I still need to self-isolate if I’m positive?\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspYes. If you’re aged 13 years and older and test positive for Covid-19, you must self-isolate for seven days and wear a medical grade of FFP2 mask for 10 days, under the new rules.For children aged zero to 12 who test positive for the virus, self-isolation for seven days is also required, but a well-fitted mask for 10 days is only required for those aged nine to 12 years old.From Monday, the requirement to get tested for Covid-19 lifts for most people.Only those aged 55 and older who are unboosted those with a high-risk medical condition those who are immunocompromised pregnant people and those who live in the same household or provide care or support for an immunocompromised person should undergo PCR testing.For all others, no test is required, but they should self-isolate until 48 hours after symptoms resolve.What if I’m a close contact?\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIf you’re a healthcare worker who has been identified as a household contact, repeat antigen testing is required, unless they have recovered from Covid-19 in the past three months.All other asymptomatic close contacts are not required to test, self-isolate or restrict their movements, unless symptoms begin to appear.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"dublin s role in the finances of the kremlin","story":" The logo of Russian oil producer Rosneft on its headquarters in Moscow.

Photograph: Olivier HosletEPAAwakenings don’t come any ruder than the one Russian president Vladimir Putin, by invading Ukraine, delivered this week to Berlin.Until Thursday morning German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock insisted that Berlin’s dual path – of diplomacy backed by sanction threats – was the correct one with Russia. By Thursday evening her\u0026nbsppalpable outrage – at growing civilian casualties and a flagrant breach of the international order – culminated in an expression of how, until the end, Moscow had duped her.“We have to say we were lied to,” she said in a television interview, her voice trembling. “They stone-cold lied to us.”Official German shock, surprise and, now, regret over its political approach with Moscow have all sparked anger in neighbouring Poland and its Baltic neighbours.In Warsaw a bit of gallows humour doing the rounds on Friday about Berlin’s take on Russia drew on the wisdom of cartoon character Homer Simpson: “It takes two to lie: one to lie and one to listen.”“Berlin listened to Russian lies and believed ... either due to a lack of imagination or because of pure self-interest on a massive scale,” said Eugeniusz Smolar of Warsaw’s Centre for International Relations.\u0026nbspSmolar was jailed in 1968 for protesting against the Soviet invasion of neighbouring Czechoslovakia and later was involved in the Solidarity opposition movement.\u0026nbspOn Friday, after three decades of pro-EU engagement in Poland, as a journalist and analyst, his shattered illusions are not towards Moscow – but Berlin. “Germany has lost a lot of goodwill in this region, first for its Russia approach but even more now after refusing to back a Russian ban from Swift.”At late-night talks in Brussels on Thursday, Berlin insisted on holding in reserve a Russian ban from the international payments network. On Friday Ms Baerbock explained that a ban could have unintended consequences, “hitting a granddaughter who wants to transfer money to her grandmother, while those responsible for the bloodshed have their own way to move their finances around”. Business interestsThat has not impressed all of Germany’s neighbours, many of whom see another move by Berlin to protect its business interests in Russia.\u0026nbspAs well as importing 55 per cent of its natural gas from Russia, Germany is one of Russia’s most significant trade partners. Direct investment amounted to about €25 billion last year, from over 3,600 companies including Mercedes-Benz, BASF and Volkswagen employing almost 280,000 people.As tensions grew some companies scaled back: building materials giant Knauf, which has annual revenues of about €12.5 billion, has closed its Donbas factory in eastern Ukraine. But others have scaled up. Engineering giant Siemens, which earns about 1 per cent of its revenue in Russia, is developing high-speed trains there, while a part-owned energy subsidiary is building power plants and equipment for 57 wind farms in Russia. The company shrugged off as “very regrettable” revelations that Siemens-made gas turbines found their way to Russian-occupied Crimea.From Tallinn to Warsaw, politicians who spent years warning that Georgia in 2008 and Crimea in 2014 were part of a bigger Putin plan, are now saying “We told you so”.Central to this western blindness, they argue, was Berlin’s block on Ukraine’s Nato and EU membership. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s long-time foreign policy adviser Christoph Heusgen defended the double refusal last year, saying Berlin “did not want to promote conflict” with Moscow.He told Der Spiegel magazine last September: “She always kept in mind what was tolerable for Russia.” Western illusionsOn Friday among Warsaw officials the frustration was palpable over Berlin’s refusal to back the toughest sanctions, including the Swift ban. Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki argued that the Ukraine conflict had shattered Western illusions about the post-1989 “end of history”.“Today, however, history is returning with all the force it can muster,” he said.While EU leaders argue over the timing and scale of sanctions, senior Polish officials said on Friday that “everyone escaping the war will be received in Poland”.Michal Dworczyk, a top aide to Mr Morawiecki said: “Everyone seeking help in Poland will be able to receive it ... this includes people without passports.”Despite border queues of up to six kilometres, Poland’s interior ministry said that only a small percentage of those crossing the border were\u0026nbsparriving in reception\u0026nbspcentres set up by the government along the 540km Polish-Ukrainian border.At midnight on Saturday Poland was set to close its air space to Russian aircraft and block all Russian television stations from its airwaves.\u0026nbspPolish president Andrzej Duda delivered a stern warning to his European neighbours.“I agree entirely with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy: if you don’t help us today, then tomorrow war will knock on your door.

Video: Russian PoolWhat has surprised me most about the history I have lived through is how often we get dragged on demented, destructive rides by leaders who put their personal psychodramas over the public’s wellbeing. And it always feels as though we are powerless to stop the madness of these iniduals, that we are trapped in their ego or libido or id or delusion.Now comes the insanity of Vladimir Putin, the former KGB officer who has been feeling humiliated and furious ever since the red banner of the Soviet Union came down from the Kremlin 30 years ago. This demonic little man with the puffy, Botoxy face has been watching too many episodes of The Americans during his Covid isolation.He decided to indulge his nostalgia for the days when American children had to practise ing under their school desks when James Bond sparred with Soviet assassin Rosa Klebb, sprouting a knife from her shoe. He longs for the shadowy era when Moscow was a menacing superpower, not a withering autocracy.To feed cold war dreams, Putin spun a nuclear nightmare. He invaded a peaceful democracy, Ukraine, vowing consequences “you have never seen in your entire history” to those who interfered.“Even by his logic, I don’t see how this ends well,” the New York Times’s Steven Lee Myers, a former Moscow correspondent who wrote The New Tsar: The Rise and Reign of Vladimir Putin, told me.“He conquers Ukraine and people declare him the tsar of all Russian lands? That’s not going to happen. There’s not even cheering in Russia like there was after the annexation of Crimea, which was done with almost no bloodshed. And I doubt a majority of Russians believe the propaganda about the imminent Nazi threat.” (Especially since the country is run by a Jewish comedian turned courageous president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. )As Julia Ioffe wrote in Puck, Putin stewed in his begrudging juices for decades and then rang down a new iron curtain: “Even as his forces were shelling the entirety of Ukraine – north to south, east to west – Putin made clear that his invasion wasn’t really about Ukraine. It was about the United States, about history and settling old scores, and rewriting the terms of surrender, 30 years later, that ended the cold war.”War criminalOn Thursday, Putin tried to justify behaving like a war criminal, saying that Russia – that is, Putin – was being treated in an “insolent”, “contemptuous” and “disdainful” way by the West.In the midst of his “extraordinary, if predictable, doublespeak”, as Roger Cohen of the New York Times called it, Putin draped the albatross of the unwarranted invasion of Iraq around America’s neck: to prove that there were WMDs in Iraq, Putin said, “the US secretary of state held up a vial with white powder, publicly, for the whole world to see, assuring the international community that it was a chemical warfare agent created in Iraq. It later turned out that all of that was a fake and a sham, and that Iraq did not have any chemical weapons”.Hard to argue with that. George W Bush and Dick Cheney let their own egos, gremlins and grandiose dreams occlude reality. W wanted to outshine his father, who had decided against going into Baghdad when he fought Saddam Hussein. And Cheney wanted to kick around an Arab country after 911 to prove that America was a hyperpower.So they used trumped-up evidence, and Cheney taunted Colin Powell into making that fateful, bogus speech at the United Nations, chock-a-block with Cheney chicanery.Though Donald Trump was Putin’s lap dog, upending traditional Republican antipathy toward Russia, Putin no doubt has contempt for the weak and malleable Trump. Putin could have been alluding to Trump in his speech on Thursday when he accused the United States of “con-artist behaviour”, adding that the US had become “an empire of lies”. Certainly, Trump was the emperor of lies.Republicans used to be so allergic to communists that George HW Bush told this story in his memoir: in his 1964 Texas Senate bid, the John Birch Society slimed him by implying that Barbara Bush’s father, the president of McCall publishing, put out a communist manifesto, Redbook, the women’s magazine.Nauseating praiseAs President Joe Biden marshalled world opinion against Putin, Trump offered nauseating praise of this murderer. Like the thug he so admires, Trump let his fragile ego and world-class delusions distort reality. Trump politicised the Covid response in a dangerous way. And, unable to accept the designation of Loser, he helped spread the lies and misinformation that led to the January 6th attack on the US Capitol.In a breathtaking betrayal, the president of the United States tried to scuttle the democracy he was running Trump abandoned the constitution he was sworn to protect.But if Biden got no back-up on helping Ukraine from the quisling Trump, he did get a boost on Friday from his inspiring supreme court nominee, Ketanji Brown Jackson, who reminded us, “The United States of America is the greatest beacon of hope and democracy the world has ever known.”As for Putin’s Napoleonic megalomania, perhaps Russia expert Nina Khrushcheva summed him up best in a Vanity Fair podcast: “He’s a small man of 5-6 saying he’s 5-7.” – This article originally appeared in The New York TimesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"beginning end vladimir putin","story":"What is being fought in the cities of Ukraine is not just a war for that country’s freedom and future, it is a conflict that will determine Russia’s, too. Win, lose or draw, Putin has guaranteed that the Cold War – a war that arguably he never stopped fighting – is back. His regime will likely decay into isolation, economic stagnation and political repression as a result.While our intelligence services and the military analyst community were warning of an imminent, full-scale war in Ukraine, Western Putin-watchers and Russians alike had their doubts. It just seemed too dangerous, disproportionate and self-destructive. On Sunday, just before the fateful meeting of Russia’s Security Council that showed the world how isolated Putin was, and how out of touch, a Moscow-based financial analyst messaged me that he was “feeling more comfortable now – Putin’s about to pull off the biggest bluff in history”.It was not a bluff, though, and the ambition of Putin’s gamble is becoming clear. His stated objectives – Ukraine’s “demilitarisation and de-Nazification” – suggest his goal is to install a puppet government that will ensure the country remains within Russia’s sphere of influence. The obscene suggestion that modern Ukraine needs “de-Nazification” is not only a desperate rhetorical flourish to convince the Russian people that this is in some ways a parallel to the “Great Patriotic War” – the Second World War – but also a prelude to the mass arrests and, Western intelligence agencies claim, even executions of those who would resist.Putin’s plan seems to rest on a naïve assumption that it is simply a matter of taking Kyiv and announcing a new government. In fact, that is the relatively easy part – any quisling administration will then need to be maintained by force against a Ukrainian population that shows no sign of being willing to accept it. Some will fight, something that is already clear as Ukraine’s government opens up its arsenals to distribute guns among volunteers. Even those not willing or able to fight, though, will resist in other ways, from sabotage to simple, mulish non-cooperation. As a British Ministry of Defence analyst put it to me: “This isn’t going to be Occupied France – it’ll be more like the partisan war Ukrainians fought against the Germans in the Second World War.”Hubris and paranoiaThat would be a galling parallel for the Kremlin, which has made a virtual secular state religion of the war. An equally instructive one would be the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Again, an ageing leadership in the Kremlin airily assumed that all it needed to do was take the capital and impose a new leader, make a brief show of force and withdraw, with the Afghans now cowed and obedient. Ten years and 15,000 Soviet deaths later, Moscow withdrew from a war it could not win. The generals had been well aware that the invasion would be a terrible and dangerous blunder, but the defence minister simply refused to convey his concerns to Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. We do not know what Sergei Shoigu, the current Russian defence minister, has been telling Putin, but judging by that Security Council meeting, this is not a president who welcomes or listens to naysaying.More significantly, while the Afghan War did not bring down the Soviet system itself, it magnified a series of debilitating trends that did. The economy was already grinding towards collapse, but Western sanctions worsened it by denying access to credits and technology. The people were already disgruntled and cynical, but as boys started coming home with broken minds or bodies, or not coming home at all, their resentment towards the Kremlin only grew. It is hard to believe that Putin is seriously thinking of this parallel, but we should, because, either way, his Russia is heading in the same direction as Brezhnev’s, driven by the same combination of hubris and paranoia.If, unlikely as it seems, Putin is able to take and hold Ukraine, even if only for a while, it will prove a Pyrrhic victory. The prospect might be that a triumphalist Russia will have pushed closer to Nato, have resisted Western pressure and be ready to unleash covert chaos on Europe if it continues to challenge the Kremlin’s claim to a sphere of influence. In the process, though, Putin will simply have re-booted the Cold War only to find himself losing it. Ukraine will be a turbulent, truculent conquest, and he cannot expect this to re-legitimise his regime like Crimea. There will be continued casualties, and it will further galvanise the West. Putin has been able to make political gains in the past by his willingness to go beyond the bounds of what we could call the etiquette of the global system. However, on every index of power – military, economic, soft, technological – Russia lags behind the West. Nato has twice as many troops as Russia (even if it is still in the process of reorienting from distant counterinsurgency operations back to mechanised European war). As we are seeing in the unfolding sanctions, the West has a massive economic preponderance. We also have other capacities that we really have not yet tapped, from cyber to cultural conflict. In the Cold War, we were willing to conduct political warfare against the Soviets and often got very good at it – these are skills we can quickly re-learn, if we are forced and willing to do so. The West is a giant that, having gorged itself on the presumed “peace idend” of the end of the Cold War, had settled down for a nap. It is beginning to awaken, thanks to Putin. Backed into a cornerIn this new Cold War, Putin’s Russia would have to cope with the three challenges of isolation, impoverishment and information. It would be treated as a pariah state, with all but a handful of partners of convenience. Of these, China would be the main one, but its relationship with Beijing would increasingly be that of client, not ally. Meanwhile, sanctions and a brain drain of the best and brightest would prevent Russia from dragging itself from its current economic stagnation. The current best-case scenario for its economy is that, by 2030, incomes are not any worse in real terms. Finally, given that even the Soviet state could not control the flow of information in the country, we should not expect today’s cynical and online Russians – they have the same level of internet use as in the UK, and many get their news from internet sources – to be any easier to dupe. Instead, Putin’s Russia would increasingly resemble the Soviet Union of the late Seventies and early Eighties, as an ageing elite presides over a country falling behind the rest of the world and a dissatisfied population is kept in line by police state methods. That led to the slow-motion car crash that Mikhail Gorbachev’s reforms actually accelerated.Of course, it seems much more likely that Putin’s gamble will wholly or partly fail. Perhaps he will end up holding on to the Donbas region, because it is hard to see how he could walk away from the war altogether without something to show for it. In any case, he can hardly walk this back. This is his war. As Emily Ferris at the defence think tank RUSI notes: “He can\u0027t step back…  he can\u0027t leave the country in the state he has created, so all those discussions about succession plans for 2024 now seem defunct.”It seems hard to think of Putin re-inventing himself at the age of 69, after 20 years in power. That means no new ideas, no serious chances to improve relations with the West. Nor does it seem likely that Putin would now voluntarily leave the Kremlin, especially as constitutionally he can hang on until 2036. How can he leave office, when that would mean handing over his life, fate and fortune to someone else? Putin is not a man who trusts easily. How can he leave power, if not on a high? He is clearly consumed by thoughts of his legacy, and there must be the temptation to wait in the hope that an unexpected triumph is just around the corner. In other words, he has backed himself into a corner.And that’s a dangerous place to be. Some years back, a staffer from the Russian Presidential Administration recalled a story that Putin himself told about his childhood in the ruins of post-war Leningrad. He and his friends would hunt the rats plaguing their apartment building. Once, caught up in the chase of a particularly large one, he found he had backed it into a corner. It turned and leapt, and young Putin fled. The staffer’s conclusion was that Putin had learnt never to let people get into that situation: “You don’t chase, you take them out quickly.” It may well also be a cautionary tale for both his own people and the West. There is likely already disquiet among his senior officials, and especially among those now facing sanctions. It would take something catastrophic to make them act, though, given Putin’s control over the security apparatus and increasing intolerance of opposition. Likewise, there are limits as to how far into that corner we will want to push a man with nuclear weapons and a penchant for escalation. The tide is turning on Putin’s generationRealistically, just as in the last Cold War, our goal must be to contain, to undermine and to wait. Just as Russian troops and influence must be pushed out of Ukraine, Putin’s capacity to harm the West must be limited, which will require everything from more robust counterintelligence activity to reducing our dependence not just on Russian oil and gas but also other key resources such as titanium. Meanwhile, our old political warfare arsenal ought to be dusted off and updated for the information age. While some are talking of blanket visa bans and the like, instead let us make it easier for ordinary Russians to see what economically dynamic and politically free democracies are like. Let us make sure that truthful news continues to be available to undermine increasingly toxic state propaganda. Let us find new ways of throwing grit into the wheels of the defence-industrial complex, from cyberattacks to starving it of the best research. All of this will have its risks and costs, to be sure, but we have too long hoped to be able to guarantee security and stability in Europe on the cheap.And, finally, patience. Ultimately, it will be for the Russians to make their choices. Putin and his generation may stay in power for years to come, but the tide is against them. Younger Russians are increasingly open in their disdain for the gerontocracy in the Kremlin and what is being perpetrated in their name. More from NewsIt’s time to stop letting despots weaponise our Western freedomsRussia-Ukraine latest: Three-mile column of Russian troops and tanks \u0026#39moving towards Kyiv\u0026#39Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s nuclear threats aren\u0026#39t aimed at Ukraine, they\u0026#39re aimed at the WestPummelled by Ukraine’s army, and stymied even by unarmed civilians, the Russian blitzkrieg is falteringLatest pictures from Ukraine: Russian forces march on KharkivYour energy bill has gone up to pay for green technology that’s not being usedMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"olaf scholz gave vladimir putin green light invade","story":"During the Second World War, Ukraine was a scene of armageddon: huge battles involving millions of casualties and appalling atrocities. Field Marshal Erich von Manstein, who commanded the German armies there during the decisive phase of the war, was both a military genius and a war criminal. His British admirers, including Winston Churchill, saw to it that he served only four years of an 18-year sentence for his crimes. Ukrainians are less forgiving, and the German military owes them a debt of honour.The polar opposite of the Nazi Wehrmacht, the West German Bundeswehr was once the front line of Nato’s defence against the Red Army. In the late Eighties, when I spent a few days with them while serving as The ’s Bonn correspondent, they impressed me by their professionalism. One officer taught me to shoot. That generation of German soldiers left me in no doubt that, if Soviet tanks came thundering through the Fulda Gap, the Bundeswehr would have stood and fought. They had the tanks, they had the men and they had the money, too.Now, evidently, they don’t. Germany is still the richest country in Europe, but its defence spending is just 1.36 per cent of GDP, far below the Nato target of 2 per cent. A post-Cold War pacifist culture of complacency has undermined military morale. Before moving to Brussels to preside over a series of fiascos as head of the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen was a notably undistinguished German defence minister. Her legacy was symbolised by the discovery that troops were so badly equipped that on Nato exercises, they were forced to use broomsticks as rifles.Even worse than this neglect of the bare necessities of a credible defence has been the all-pervasive pro-Russian attitude of the German elites, even within the military. This was epitomised when the Inspector of the German Navy, Vice-Admiral Kay-Achim Schönbach, was forced to resign after telling a think tank audience last month that the idea of a Russian invasion of Ukraine was “nonsense”. Putin, he said, merely wanted to be treated as an equal: “It is easy to give him the respect he really demands – and probably also deserves.” Crimea, he added, “is gone”, while Ukraine (and Georgia) should be kept out of Nato to placate Russia.After such a public endorsement of Putin, at a time of delicate negotiations with Moscow, caused dismay among allies and protests from Kyiv, Schönbach jumped before he was pushed. But his views are widely shared within a German political, diplomatic and business establishment that has become inured to Putin’s aggression and dependent on his gas.In particular, the Russian state energy company Gazprom has acquired a grip over German gas supplies that renders the country vulnerable to blackmail. The Green energy minister, Robert Habeck, admitted last week that Berlin had watched helplessly while Gazprom “systematically” held back supplies at the start of the winter, ensuring that by the time of the invasion, German reserves would be at an all-time low. Habeck is supposed to be in charge of energy security, yet he seems astonished that not only Germany’s gas supplies but also its reserves are, in effect, controlled by the Kremlin.Looking back over the Ukrainian debacle, who emerges as the guilty men and women? Leaving the Kremlin aside, high on the list of Western culprits come the last three German chancellors: Gerhard Schröder, Angela Merkel and Olaf Scholz.Especially when compared with their postwar predecessors – European statesmen such as Adenauer, Brandt, Schmidt and Kohl – this trio of mediocrities deserve to hang their heads in ignominy. By toadying to Putin, neglecting Nato and feeding the German addiction to Russian energy, each one has betrayed Ukraine and jeopardised Europe.The most obviously Russophile German leader was Gerhard Schröder, the Social Democrat chancellor from 1998 to 2005. The son of a Nazi soldier who was killed on the Eastern front, he internalised the guilt of his generation and has ended up as a Kremlin stooge Schröder went to work for Gazprom within weeks of leaving office. He has vigorously promoted the Nord Stream Baltic pipeline project, designed to increase Europe’s dependency on Russian energy. In recent months, Schröder has lobbied for Nord Stream 2, which would avoid the need to pump gas across Ukraine. In the face of Russian atrocities, Schröder has been conspicuous by his silence.His successor, Angela Merkel, dominated German and indeed European politics for 16 years, only stepping down last December. As an East German and a fluent Russian speaker, she showed a combination of deference and wariness towards Moscow. It was characteristic that Putin exploited her fear of dogs by bringing his huge black Labrador to their meeting in 2007.Disastrously, Mrs Merkel fed the German addiction to Russian gas by closing down the country’s nuclear industry. She worked hard to keep Germany as Russia’s biggest trading partner. While vocal on human rights, she was reluctant to do anything that might antagonise Putin, averse to sanctions after such outrages as the 2014 annexation of Crimea or 2018’s Salisbury poisonings.While enjoying the limelight as “the world’s most powerful woman”, Mrs Merkel utterly failed to complete the task of German reunification by inculcating Western values among her fellow East Germans, allowing both far-Left and far-Right parties to flourish. Lacking any discernible beliefs of her own, she presided over the transformation of Germany from the instinctively pro-Western country I remember from 40 or 50 years ago into the fence-sitting, soft-centred, moralistic yet mercenary society it now is.As finance minister in the Merkel coalition from 2018 until he succeeded her as Chancellor last year, Olaf Scholz was an enthusiastic supporter of this surreptitious appeasement of Putin. So it is no surprise that until this weekend he was one of the chief opponents of kicking Russia out of the Swift international payments system – a sanction that would really damage Putin’s prestige. Scholz has cut a pitiful figure on the diplomatic stage, refusing even to mention Nord Stream 2 while sitting next to Joe Biden and leaving it to the President to declare that the pipeline project was as good as dead, but he left it until the eve of the invasion to endorse the US position. The German company that has built Nord Stream will now be sanctioned – but only by the Americans. The assumption must be that Scholz’s foot-dragging is due to the persistent influence in his party of its former leader, Schröder.More from NewsIt’s time to stop letting despots weaponise our Western freedomsRussia-Ukraine latest: Three-mile column of Russian troops and tanks \u0026#39moving towards Kyiv\u0026#39Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s nuclear threats aren\u0026#39t aimed at Ukraine, they\u0026#39re aimed at the WestPummelled by Ukraine’s army, and stymied even by unarmed civilians, the Russian blitzkrieg is falteringLatest pictures from Ukraine: Russian forces march on KharkivYour energy bill has gone up to pay for green technology that’s not being usedMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britain needs nuclear renaissance end decadent dependence russian","story":"There are few things we Brits enjoy so much as feeling morally superior to the Germans and it should be acknowledged at once that they have made that rather easy down the ages.One doesn’t need to reopen any historical cans of worms to luxuriate in such a sensation right now because, via its foot-dragging on taking effective sanctions against Russia and the paltry nature of its initial support for Ukraine, Germany is rendering itself a very easy target for morality-based wrath.But in truth we are kidding ourselves if we believe the pusillanimous reaction of Germany to Vladimir Putin’s disgusting conduct compared to the more robust responses of our own country says anything much about ethics.The reality is that, were we dependent upon Russia for nearly half our natural gas compared to just three per cent of it, we would be just as hamstrung as Germany has been in the face of Putin’s evil.Would British public opinion be as gung-ho towards the Russian regime if the consequences included shivering in their own homes, massive increases in the price of food and other essential commodities, huge waves of job losses in key industrial sectors and a potential economic depression? That must be highly doubtful.And it is arguably just as much through luck as judgment that we are not in such an unhappy situation. For we have neglected our own energy security and abandoned the strategic goal of self-sufficiency almost as acutely as Germany.Successive German chancellors are culpable for winding down their nuclear energy sector and ramping up dependency upon Russian gas supplies, with the long-serving and recently departed Angela Merkel deservedly getting the lion’s share of the flak.But in recent decades British governments of all political shades have also taken massively complacent decisions about energy provision. The 21st century is thus far a dismal tale of UK expertise in nuclear energy being allowed to wither away, Whitehall deciding to get China – of all countries – deeply embedded in the provision of what little new capacity it did facilitate, fracking getting abandoned at the first whiff of environmentalist aggro, most of our gas-storage capability being scrapped and coal mining more or less completely shutting down.While it is true that there has been a boom in renewable energy, everybody knows that back-up sources of power are needed when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind either doesn’t blow or blows too hard.The past few years of the Covid pandemic and grotesque behaviour by China and Russia should by now have shattered various conceits and delusions that have been prevalent in our liberal establishment. The arc of history does not necessarily bend towards progress, globalising supply chains is not a cost-free exercise, some countries are never going to behave well or transition to liberal democracy, and the folly of neglecting the capacity of the domestic nation state is thrown into sharpest relief when tough times arrive.Fortunately, our own nation state was able to draw on sufficient resources of expertise and finance to deliver the world’s best vaccination programme against Covid. Kate Bingham’s marvellous Vaccine Taskforce, commissioned by Boris Johnson, was authorised to slice through usual time-consuming Whitehall procedures and processes. And what a difference it made, saving tens of thousands of lives.Britain needs to do something similar in the field of power generation and time is of the essence. An Energy Security Taskforce, based on the high-speed Bingham model, should be established at once. Clearly, new power plants cannot be conjured up overnight. But does anyone believe that if or when China starts majoring on nuclear energy it will take them 10 years per plant – the schedule our own Hinkley Point is working to and already slipping behind – rather than 10 months?It is absurd that the environmental movement in Britain has forged so strong an alliance with the ever-present NIMBY tendency that creating any extra energy-generation capacity other than via renewables has become the work of decades.Back in the 1980s, the green movement made opposing nuclear energy one of its central aims because of over-hyped concerns about safety and storing spent fuel rods. But once reducing carbon emissions had been elevated to the top planet-saving goal, the British state should have made a hard-headed decision to forge ahead with major new nuclear capacity.To abandon coal, envisage winding down gas long-term and decommission ageing nuclear plants without replacing them in a timely manner amounted to a decadent strategy predicated on the world becoming a happy and peaceful family of civilised nations reliably helping each other out, such as it has never been.The Russian boot may not be bearing down on the British throat quite as savagely as it is upon the German one right now, but do not imagine we are altogether insulated. The market for energy is predominantly global and when the massive financial firepower of Germany is deployed to find alternative supplies for its citizens the effect will be to bid up prices for everyone.A luxury mindset has dominated British public life for too many years, resulting in the elevation of trivial and isive identity politics to a central position as well an eco-tyranny that brooks no compromise. As we enter what will be at best the era of a new Cold War we are going to need a much harder-headed approach if we are not to find it very chilly indeed.More from NewsIt’s time to stop letting despots weaponise our Western freedomsRussia-Ukraine latest: Three-mile column of Russian troops and tanks \u0026#39moving towards Kyiv\u0026#39Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s nuclear threats aren\u0026#39t aimed at Ukraine, they\u0026#39re aimed at the WestPummelled by Ukraine’s army, and stymied even by unarmed civilians, the Russian blitzkrieg is falteringLatest pictures from Ukraine: Russian forces march on KharkivYour energy bill has gone up to pay for green technology that’s not being usedMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"top tories call burdensome travel checks ditched","story":"Senior Conservative backbenchers have called for the end of “cumbersome, intrusive and redundant” passenger locator forms (PLFs) for air travel in wake of all other Covid restrictions being lifted.They are demanding that the forms - introduced before all the restrictions on travel were ditched - should be phased out before families go on their Easter holidays.Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, is understood to be pressing for their removal by Easter but it is unclear whether a decision will be taken in time. A simplification is already planned, reducing the time it takes on average from 12 to eight minutes.Huw Merriman, Conservative chair of the Commons Transport Committee, said that with the ending of self-isolation last week and removal of all Covid restrictions, the PLF had become “totally redundant and needs to go.”“It’s a drain on international travel the sector arguably most impacted by the pandemic. To leave this cumbersome and intrusive document in place has absolutely no logic and only adds insult to injury,” he saidSir Graham Brady, chair of the Tory 1922 backbench committee, said: “Most other countries have massively simplified their passenger locator form or dispensed with them. “We should now do the same in order to remove a further burden for travellers in a world where all domestic restrictions have already been swept aside.”Henry Smith, Tory chair of the all party Future of Aviation group, said: “The PLF is time consuming and confusing for many, additionally it can lead to delays at the UK border. As Future of Aviation All Party Parliamentary Group chair I\u0027m lobbying for the form to be withdrawn in time for Easter.”The PLF was designed to help Government agencies track passengers who needed to quarantine or be tested on arrival in the UK.However, all testing and quarantine has been scrapped for the fully vaccinated, while unjabbed travellers are no longer required to self isolate although they still have to complete pre departure and day two tests on arrival.The travel industry led by airlines are demanding that not only should the PLF be scrapped but, with the removal of domestic restrictions and end of self-isolation, so too should the tests for the unvaccinated.Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, said: “You don’t need a form to order a table in a restaurant or buy a drink, whether you’ve been vaccinated or not, so why should they be required for travel. What’s the difference, in the age of Omicron? “The Government has rightly removed the remaining domestic restrictions and is not basing policy on vaccination status. It now needs to be consistent and fair to aviation and the travel sector by getting rid of testing for the unvaccinated and retiring the PLF.”Airport Operators Association Chief Executive Karen Dee said: “The Government is removing domestic restrictions as we learn to live with Covid and the same should apply to international travel. We cannot recover from the pandemic as long as we continue to require some sort of health passport like the Passenger Locator Form as well as a normal passport. “The PLF no longer serves a purpose and should be abolished, particularly if the Government ceases to routinely test and monitor Covid-19 domestically. The PLF remains one of the more complex such forms to fill out, compared to other countries’ approaches, regularly leading to problems and delays at boarding abroad or at the border in UK airports.“Abolishing it will remove another burden on travellers and help facilitate a return to normal in aviation.”More from NewsIt’s time to stop letting despots weaponise our Western freedomsRussia-Ukraine latest: Three-mile column of Russian troops and tanks \u0026#39moving towards Kyiv\u0026#39Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s nuclear threats aren\u0026#39t aimed at Ukraine, they\u0026#39re aimed at the WestPummelled by Ukraine’s army, and stymied even by unarmed civilians, the Russian blitzkrieg is falteringLatest pictures from Ukraine: Russian forces march on KharkivYour energy bill has gone up to pay for green technology that’s not being usedMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"complicated covid travel forms fairly","story":"COVID Green Pass Vaccination Certicate On A Mobile Phone, Eindhoven, Netherlands -  Jan \" content\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES n _JS.jpg\" width\"\" \"\" Health Secretary Sajid Javid is in support of ditching complicated Covid travel forms Image: Nicolas Economou NurPhoto REX ShutterstockByPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political Editor:,  Feb |commentsTourists going abroad may no longer have to fill in complicated travel forms when theyto the UK after their Easter holidays. Covid documents that travellers must complete before entering Britain seem set to be ditched after the Health Secretary Sajid Javid backed the move. Government sources told the Mirror it is now “fairly likely” the change will be in place before families jet off for the Easter holidays. A formal process would still have to take place, with ministers signing off the scrapping of the passenger locator form at a Covid meeting in the coming weeks. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is understood to have been pushing for the move to help the travel industry get back on its feet.Boris Johnson last week unveiled his Living With Covid plan.  It scrapped self-isolation requirements but did not include changes to international travel rules. It means those arriving in the UK still have to complete a form. But the Prime Minister hinted it could be ditched in time for the Easter break. He was asked by Labour MP Ben Bradshaw why the “bureaucratic and irritating” documents were still needed when they aren’t by other European countries. The PM responded by saying the form would be reviewed by Easter. Tory MP Huw Merriman, who chairs the Commons transport committee, urged ministers to give the travel industry a “much-needed shot in the arm” by getting rid of the form.

US Banker and anti-corruption activist Bill Browder says the crackdown should hit the Kremlin chief’s own wealth, which is kept safe and sound in London by a handful of his oligarch stooges.Mr Browder said: “ Vladimir Putin ’s a very selfish man. He doesn’t care about other people, so sanctioning people around him doesn’t affect him.“The only way is to hit his personal assets – and they are held by people known to us. We needed to make a list of top oligarchs two months ago and start hitting them five at a time, so he could see we are coming after his money. These men are well-known to us, they’re on the Forbes rich list and some of them even own football teams.” The UK has promised “imminent” sanctions on Putin and Mr Browder’s cautious remarks boost calls from Labour to sanction prominent iniduals – such as Cha’s Russian owner Roman Abramovich, who last night gave up the running of the west London club and transferred its “care and stewardship” to the trustees of Cha’s charitable foundation. Mr Browder made his fortune in Russia around the turn of the millennium. He was moved to fight for the first sanctions after his friend Sergei Magnitsky suffered an agonising death in a Russian jail in , aged , after questioning the powers that be.Mr Magnitsky, a lawyer, had accused Putin’s government of falsying documents as a pretext for throwing Mr Browder out of Russia. He died in prison after  months of being refused medication for his pancreatitis.  Mr Browder said: “My friend Sergei would be absolutely appalled right now. He was the face of all that Russia should have been. He was young, professional, ambitious and patriotic. He wanted the best for his country. He wanted an honest country.” His legacy – the Magnitsky Act – was passed by President Obama in  with the aim of targeting human rights abusers and corrupt officials in Russia.Mr Browder, like many across the world, has been shocked by the scale and violence of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. He said: “Putin’s always cleverly played both sides, being a presentable member of G on one hand while organising assassinations in the heart of Salisbury at the same time.“He’s now destroyed that fine balance – he’s completely crossed the Rubicon.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Rubicon Ltd.Barack ObamaRoman AbramovichSergei MagnitskyVladimir PutinHuman rightsSunday People\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Russia predictably used its veto to block a resolution ordering it to withdraw all troops from Ukraine. And that has prompted calls to reform the  year old institution by removing the glue which keeps Russia fixed to the table. In a sign of Vladimir Putin ’s global isolation even his traditional ally China abstained. And that could signal change is about to come.Constitutionalist David Rogers said: “The UN’s founding fathers would be appalled at what just happened. “There should be nothing in the UN charter which stops the  member states voting to remove Russia as a permanent member.” When the UN was created from the ashes of World War II the five victors - Britain, America, France, the Soviet Union and China - were given all-time powers to veto anything they did not like. That system cannot work when one of them is the aggressor.Now Putin is in a bind. And intelligence chiefs fear he will use indiscriminate violence to speed up the advance delayed by Ukrainian fighters. One Western official said: “Now Putin has committed himself this is no longer a war of choice but necessity. He must win. And he will use any means necessary.” Defence minister James Heappey added: “You are going to see more utterly brutal fighting.” That could include thermobaric rockets, a chemical mix creating a supersonic blast which vaporises buildings and bodies.

Tobias Ellwood, chair of the Commons Defence Select Committee urged the Government to start rolling out sanctions every day on Russia to block Putinaposs political ambitions in Ukraine. Making a statement hours before he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine, Putin said boasted of the cutting-edge weapons Russia had to hand. He said in a TV address: As for military affairs, even after the dissolution of the USSR and losing a considerable part of its capabilities, today’s Russia remains one of the most powerful nuclear states. “Moreover, it has a certain advantage in several cutting-edge weapons. In this context, there should be no doubt for anyone that any potential aggressor will face defeat and ominous consequences should it directly attack our country.  Mr Ellwood told BBC: If I have a concern I would not put it beyond Putin to stoop to radical tactics to secure victory. He canapost fail and the stakes are very very high indeed. We need to continue to support Ukraine not just with hard power but with humanitarian aid as well. We also put pressure on Russia. I donapost think a day should go by when a new initiative isn’t announced. Today weaposve rolled out limits on Swt. Tomorrow all of Europe should send home Russia ambassadors back to Moscow. Letaposs invite Sweden and Finland to join Nato. For months we’ve been playing catch up. We must now start to control the agenda.  When pressed on what type of weapons he was referring to, Mr Ellwood added: Weaposve seen what heaposs done in Syria for example, he can certainly use other weapons systems which havenapost been tested or that weaposre used to. Mr Ellwood listed chemical weapons and said the worst case scenario would be low yield nuclear weapons as well.Huge explosions lit up the sky early on Sunday near the capital, Kyiv, where people hunkered down in homes as Russian forces struggled to gain movement in Ukraine. Western officials believe Putin is determined to overthrow Ukraine’s government and replace it with a regime of his own, redrawing the map of Europe and reviving Moscow’s Cold War-era influence. The UK, US and European Union have agreed to block selected Russian banks from the Swt global financial messaging system, which moves money around more than , banks and other financial institutions worldwide. As part of a new round of sanctions aiming to impose a severe cost on Moscow they also agreed to impose ”restrictive measures” on Russia’s central bank.Mr Ellwood admitted it wouldaposve been nice to see nations rally together in this fashion.Putin sent troops into Ukraine after denying for weeks that he intended to do so. In the past few months he has built up a force of almost , troops along the countries’ borders. He claims the West has failed to take seriously Russia’s security concerns about Nato, the Western military alliance that Ukraine aspires to join.Putin has also expressed scorn about Ukraine’s right to exist as an independent state.

If you sell goods to the EU, or buy goods from the EU and bring them into the UK, you need to be able to prove that they meet the new rules of origin requirements to access preferential tarfs. It’s vital you understand the new rules to keep your business moving. To benefit from the preferential tarfs, you must have proof that any goods you import from the EU originate there, or any goods you export to the EU originate in the UK. Proof of origin can either be a statement of origin completed by the exporter, or evidence of the importer’s knowledge of where products originate. If you cannot prove the origin, you or your EU customer may be liable to pay the full rate of customs duty and could face penalties. Andrew Macleod, founder of London-based restaurant brand Emilia’s Crafted Pasta, explains that imports from the EU are vital to his brand: “We import ingredients directly from Italy, including special cured meats, cheeses, drinks and alcohol. Each of our suppliers is hand-picked.”  Has he had to make any changes to his business now that there are new import rules in place  “Yes – of course we already knew the origin of all the goods we import as we source everything carefully. But we’ve trained two of our managers on the rules around importing, so we know that we have staff in house who are well versed in the process.”  And having successfully navigated the changes, what advice would Andrew offer other businesses that import  “We found using a customs agent really helps the process run smoothly, but it’s equally important that you understand the rules yourself,” he says. “It’s not too late, and the gov.uk site has lots of valuable information.”  You must be able to prove the origin of any product you import You can choose to work with a freight forwarder or courier To benefit from preferential tarfs, you must be able to prove that any goods you import originated in the EU Note:you’re moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, rules of origin work dferently.

And job benefits include flexible working, annual and parental leave, and pensions.Soa career with the chance to make a dference to people’s lives beckons, find your next job at civil-service-careers.gov.ukaposI’ve had a lot of support from othersapos I was born and brought up in Tanzania and I came to Wales to finish my education in . I joined HMRC as an adminis­trative assistant in  – never in a million years would I have thought I’d still be here  years later. But I worked with people I really admired and made good friends. When I started out it was all about admin tasks like filing and sending the brown envelopes people hate. But I was quickly promoted and I learned so much. In March  I was promoted to my current role as customs fraud lead in the Fraud Investigation Service [FIS]. I only manage four people and we’re never going to be glamorous – there are no dawn raids or exciting seizures. The aim is for our team to use our knowledge to lead the FIS to serious customs fraud. I was lucky enough before the pandemic to be part of a team that travelled to Namibia, Madagascar and Tanzania to share how HMRC approaches customs risk. We were presenting to each country and listening to the experiences of their tax authorities. For me it was an amazing opportunity to see how our counterparts work. I’m also customs race lead in Wales. In the past couple of years I’ve really centred my attention on ensuring equality of opportunity for colleagues. In Cardf we’ve set up mentoring, coaching and sponsorship with help from senior leaders. It’s about  per cent of my job and it’s completely changed my le. I’ve had a lot of support from others and I thought maybe I can support others.aposMy job is just so rewardingapos I was originally planning to study politics at Newcastle, but one day I decided to have a quick browse on the Civil Service apprenticeship website. I’d always wanted to work in government and it seemed such an incredible opportunity. I applied on a bit of a whim and went through the interview rounds, and then did a presentation on why more young people need to get involved in politics – but I never thought I’d get in. At first it was a bit of an overwhelming experience, going into these great buildings. You can’t believe you’re in this position, seeing all these really senior people in this massive government office. It took time to get my head around that, getting off the Tube every day with Big Ben behind me. I’m just a normal person! Now I’ve been working here for three months and it’s been great – although it feels like a lot longer because I’ve learned so much. Being in the centre of the Cabinet Office I get involved in lots of dferent areas, so I’m in the community and engagement team for the central GCS team, working on internal newsletters as well as helping run the social media channels. I get paid a full-time salary and still spend  per cent of my time studying. Before taking the apprenticeship I was worried about not making friends like you do in university. But I am part of a large cohort of apprentices and so have had lots of opportunities to socialise with them. I think about  per cent of apprentices go on to get a job. After this I’d like to do something in climate communications, maybe for another COP [Conference of the Parties]. The apprenticeship is  months and so there’s always the option to go back to universityyou decide that it’s not for you.But I think the vast majority of people decide that it is for them. I think it’s really magical. It’s just so rewarding, knowing that every day you’re working to hopefully benefit people, working to help make changes and save lives. aposNo two days are the sameapos When I tell people I’m a civil servant – in particular for HMRC – I get lots of jokes about being lazy, having nothing to do and can I do anything about their VAT s. I never go into specics about my actual role because I am fairly sure it would leave people baffled, but hopefully my career to date shows the Civil Service can be an incredibly rewarding place to work. I joined the Civil Service in  as a frontline manager for contact-centre advisers dealing with the introduction of tax credits, and also worked in HR for four years. After nearly  years, I gained my G promotion to a senior project manager working on delivering IT projects across the entirety of HMRC. This was followed by a brief secondment to the Northern Ireland Office as a senior policy adviser on EU Exit. I then came back to HMRC and moved across into my current role in January. There’s the opportunity to move into dferent professions, and the plethora of jobs available mean that you can continue to grow and learn from each role. No two days are the same and the people I work with are fantastic.aposIt’s very family friendlyapos One thing that I’ve been pleasantly surprised by is how supportive and inclusive the Civil Service is. Being a working mum to Henry, six, and four-year-old Harriet, I think it’s really important to have some flexibility and bring your whole self to work. It’s very family friendly. I work  hours over a four-day week. My managers were very supportive of my request to work Monday to Thursday. My little girl has some signicant health issues, so having that flexibility is so important to me. Tech is usually male dominated in the private sector, but it’s been a refreshing surprise to find that the balance is much better in the Civil Service. Two female staff above me also do a four-day week, so there’s the opportunity to look at that career trajectory. Here in the government financethere’s a good gender balance, lots of ersity and dferent skill sets that people bring to the team. I think it definitely reflects the people in the country we serve, which is exactly what it should do. The civil service is very good at looking at people’s transferable skills rather than overlooking youyou haven’t worked in the same job before. For me, I like doing a role that adds value in society and I’ll hopefully have a career where I can succeed and get promoted. As a working mother, that’s absolutely possible here. Training opportunities are a real strong point, too – from courses to mentoring. I work hard, but I like having the balance and flexibility. That’s worth more to me than pound notes would be. The Civil Service is a unique organisation and you get to be involved in things that make a dference to people around the country. It’s really quite special.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON HMRCThe TreasuryNorthern Ireland OfficeEducationPensionsSchoolsTaxCivil servantsPublic servicesBenefitsTax CreditsMost ReadRecommended"},{"url":null,"title":"council leader refuses resign amid","story":"Council leader refuses to resign amid furious racism row over photo of golliwogsIsle of Wight Council leader Lora Peacey-Wilcox shared a picture on Facebook which appears to show a large collection of the highly offensive \"golliwog\" dolls in a display case in her living roomIsle of Wight Council Leader Lora Peacey-Wilcox is accused of owning a large collection of golliwog dolls Image: Solent News  Photo AgencyByRyan FaheyNews Reporter:,  Feb  A council leader has sparked fury after refusing to resign over an image she posted online showing a large collection of golliwogs in her living room The dolls, which were popular in the s but are now considered racist and highly offensive, were visible in the background of a Facebook picture shared by Isle of Wight Councilaposs Lora Peacey-Wilcox.The photo was first made public last November, but three months later the -year-old is yet to explain herself - leading to tempers raging at the Wednesday night meeting. Infuriated councillors say Peacey-Wilcox has offered aposno explanationapos or aposapologyapos for the dolls. In a statement released after the council spat, Peacey-Wilcox denied owning the dolls and said she has reported harassment and blackmail over the image to police Council members are calling for her resignation in the hopes of putting to bed a debate that has plagued them for months.  Cllr Peacey-Wilcox has now been given a week to respond to questions - with the local authority chairman fuming he will not allow the aposdistractionapos to continue and bring the island into aposdisreputeapos. And in the latest twist to the saga, the council leader has gone to the police claiming to be the victim of a hate crime herself. The scandal escalated this week when an evening meeting of the council morphed into a shouting match after the mention of the controversial dolls.  Calls of aposracismapos as well as members of the public shouting aposbullyingapos and aposharassmentapos were heard. Amidst the bickering, Council Chairman Geoff Brodie was forced to restore order by halting the meeting and clearing the public gallery before continuing. Cllr Peacey-Wilcox, who is of the Alliance Group and has served on the council for over  years, has denied owning the dolls and said she has complained to police that she is being harassed and blackmailed over the image which she has since deleted.  Councillor Joe Robertson, Chair of the Conservative group on the island, asked the council leadershe thought the number of ethnic minority people living on the island apostoo small in number to bother aboutapos. Cllr Peacey-Wilcox, who lives in Cowes on the Isle of Wight, refused to respond to questions on the dolls during the fiery meeting and instead told councillors she would respond in writing. The Facebook post, made on Bonfire Nightlast year, showed her two dogs seemingly in discomfort with the caption: aposFireworks [blasting] over Northwood!apos. However, in the background of the photo, more than ten figures which look to be golliwog dolls can be seen in a glass display case with a light illuminating the display. Councillors are now demanding a aposfull accountapos of why the dolls were seen in the photo in order to protect the islandaposs reputation. In a meeting of the full council held at County Hall in Newport earlier in the week, Cllr Robertson quizzed Cllr Peacey-Wilcox on the dolls, telling her silence was aposnot acceptableapos.  The -year-old, who also works as an advisor for a national charity, said of the image: We have all seen the image... in the foreground are your dogs asleep - and in the background is a display of racially offensive dolls.As leader of the council, please can you explain whether those dolls were displayed in your home in November You shared the offensive image in public - silence is not an acceptable answer.Father-of-two Cllr Robertsonaposs speech was initially drowned out by shouts from the public gallery. One man was heard shouting, aposDonapost answer it, Lornaapos and a womanaposs voice said: I am witnessing harassment and bullying... this is disgraceful behaviour. After an adjournment the meeting continued with an empty public gallery, and Cllr Robertson added: [This was] a racially offensive post by a council leader with no explanation and no apology. If you were leader of a London Borough Council you would have had to resign some time ago. Do you think the ethnic minority population on the Isle of Wight are too small in number to bother about  Other councillors are demanding the leader delivers a full account of why the racist dolls were in the picture. Cllr Peacey-Wilcox has since confirmed making complaints of harassment and apospotential blackmailapos to police, saying: I am aware of the allegations. [regarding the golliwog dolls]. I can confirm I have no such items in my house. I should mention that this relates to an allegation of harassment and potential blackmail of me the matter is now being looked into by the police. In a statement, Hampshire Constabulary confirmed they were investigating a aposhate incidentapos in connection with the photo. Illustrations of golliwog dolls first began appearing in childrenaposs books in the late th century. They are characterised by jet black skin, white-rimmed eyes, inflated red lips and frizzy afro hair - similar to other racist depictions of black Africans such as minstrels, pickaninnies and aposmammyapos figures. Today, the term golliwog is regarded as a racial slur towards black people.

He is one of nine which have physical scars and even missing limbs, after a le of suffering for this cruel and painful, but legal, extraction for use in traditional Asian medicine. However, earlier this month they were saved from their prison hell by the charity Four Paws – their biggest rescue to date – to live out their lives in a sanctuary which is home to nearly  saved bears. In the past, bear bile was obtained by hunting bears in the wild and killing them to remove their gall bladders. It would have been a particularly rare and prized ingredient and used sparingly for specic medical conditions. But in the s, the practice of keeping a bear for the duration of its le to constantly extract bile began, and bear bile farms sprang up across Asia.  The bile is used to treat liver and bladder conditions in traditional Chinese medicine, but it’s also marketed as a cure for everything from cancer to colds. There is no scientic evidence to suggest that it has any effect and according to recent official numbers, at least , bears are currently kept on bile farms in Asia. Experts say the extraction of bear bile from live bears causes unimaginable physical and psychological suffering and long-term health problems. The Asiatic black bears called Vui, Nui, An, Teo, Tai, Tin, Khoi, Danh, and Thi were rescued from three separate bear bile farms in Binh Duong province in southern Vietnam.

Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  This species is native to that country but on the brink of local extinction because of poaching and the illegal wildle trade where demand for their parts remains high. After travelling nearly , miles in a journey that took -hours, the bears are now being cared for at a sanctuary in the Binh Duong province. Sonul Badiani-Hamment, Four Paws’ UK Country Director, said he was “proud” of the rescue but said that there are many bears still in farms which are suffering a “le of misery”. He added: “The remaining bears in Vietnam still have a chance at a better le, but onlyall province authorities are fully committed to finally ending bear bile farming.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BearsAnimal cruelty\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Andrea Sunshine religiously works out for a minimum of three hours a day – and has earned an incredible toned physique in the process. The single grandmother-of-two warms up with an hour of cardio before she starts hitting the weights, which she says is like visiting her very own Disneyland. Divorced Andrea, , from London says she doesnapost entertain men while working out as it upsets her strict routine, which involves at least three hours-a-day in the gym and has been known to go on for a whole eight hours. And her commitment hasnapost gone to waste, as she has competed against women half her age in physique competitions, achieving a hat-trick of finishing in the top five.  People call me a beast,” Andrea said. Young men have a crush on good looking mature ladies so I get hit on all the time. There’s all kind of ages, thereaposs even some below  but most are between -.  I donapost like the attention. When I am on my session I hate to be disturbed. It doesnapost bother me to be called a fitness grandma – I am in my best shape and infinitely healthy. There is a stigma that with advancing age of women, they should only dedicate themselves to taking care of the home and family. Itaposs possible to do both.Andrea, who has dual Dutch-Brazilian nationality, swears by a healthy diet which sees her munching on broccoli daily alongside a tonne of vegetables with protein, sometimes reaching , calories. But she steers away from sweet vegetables as well as salt and oil to keep herself trim. The professional trainer and athletics coach not only teaches physical exercises to keep herself trim but is a great advocate for spiritual therapy too. She added: The mind has a very great power to transform our body, we cannot leave the mind aside.  I go to the gym every single day, exceptI am injured or am very sore from the previous session. To help other women, she posts her balanced exercise and healthy eating routine to her , followers on social media @andrea__sunshinee Andrea said: I always start with cardio – I can’t have a good performance without it – spinning is my favourite though.It depends of my daily routine and resistance, I try to spare enough time for, but on average I go for three hours. Sometimes it is five hours non-stop. My record has been eight hours but with breaks for some nutrition. And she says the key to keeping fit is a healthy diet, which she splits between six to eight meals throughout the day. Andrea said: I eat broccoli the most. But other key vegetables are green beans, little corn, eggs whites, caullower, yam, cabbage and spinach.I try to avoid sweet vegetables, like carrots and pumpkin. The only one I eat is sweet potatoes. Also drinking water is crucial. I drink at least - litres.

Undoubtedly the superior element of the Full English, they are also found in animal-themed dinners like pigs in blankets, toads in holes and hotdogs. But making sure you choose the right banger could be the dference between making and breaking your meal. For many, Richmond is unquestionably the best, having become a firm favourite on Brit dinner plates for decades.  Kent Live reporter Sam Honey decided to put some supermarket -own brand offerings up against the supreme banger to seethere were any on the market that could compete.Supermarket own brands are often a great, and sometimes better, substitute to some of those weekly favourites, and are often cheaper. Sam visited Aldi, Tesco and Sainsbury’s to see which brand of pork sausage deserves a permanent spot in all future fry-ups. Richmond  To start the comparison, Sam went with the one that seemingly the most popular in order to get a basis to compare against. He prepped all of the sausages in the exact same way with a quick blast in the oven for half an hour with a turn halfway through the cooking time. He said he was not all too surprised when it came to taste, being a brand heaposd eaten on countless occasions. The distinct porky flavour with a texture that, while a little on the chewier side, is still very satisfying When it came to price this was, unsurprisingly, the most expensive of these selection, costing £. for the pack I bought. Now time to see how the supermarket alternatives compare. Aldi First out of the oven and onto my plate was Aldi, the place to shop when looking to grab those weekly necessities on a budget.Costing just £., this was the cheapest of the day but an initial taste test helped me to see why. Immediately, the drop in quality was noticeable, the meat tasted much cheaper and the overall flavour was weaker and seemed to vanish in an instant. The texture wasnapost horric, but a littlespongy, perhaps this brand would work better fried but for now I was definitely disappointed. So, in the interest of saving some cash this might be the best way to go, your taste buds just might not thank you for it. Tesco  Tesco often delivers great value alongside equally great quality, sadly this wasnapost the case when it came to their sausages. This was definitely the worst of the bunch when it came to both flavour and texture. The flavour was bland and borderline non-existent, while the texture was incredibly rubbery and hard to bite into. n terms of price, this packet cost £., so almost smack bang in the middle between the other two choices so far, and either would definitely be preferably. If youaposre looking for a better alternative to Richmond, this isnapost it. Sainsburyaposs  The final competitor of the day, only one shot remains to over throw the leading name brand. To my surprise, Sainsburyaposs absolutely delivered and then some, providing a delicious,not better alternative. The texture was perfect, and the flavours much fuller and tastier, leaving a long lasting impression. I would go so far as to say this was better than Richmond, and by a country mile, while also at a lower price. This pack cost me £. also, delivering better quality than not just Tesco, but in my opinion Richmond as well. Verdict Of these choices there was an absolute clear winner, Sainsburyaposs absolutely knocked it out of the park, beating not just their supermarket competitors, but the leading name brand also. Aldi wasnapost the best when it came to quality, but the price does definitely add appeal. Tesco unfortunately was rather disappointing and at the exact same price, Sainsburyaposs is the clear winner. So, when youaposre putting together that morning fry up to get you right and ready for the day, consider a trip to the local Sainsburyaposs for your sausage supply, Iaposm sure theyaposll go great in a sandwich too.

It will not be possible simply to sanction the oligarchs, and hope they will go away.A demonstrator holds a sign depicting the Russian president as Adolf Hitler and reading Stop Putin during a protest against Russias military operation in Ukraine, in Barcelona Image: AFP via Getty ImagesopinionByOliver Bullough:,  Feb |comments I once asked a Russian friend why oligarchs love keeping their money in London and his reply, delivered with a laugh, was enlightening. He told me: “You know those movies when the Chicago mobsters want a break from fighting each other and go to Florida to relax  London is their Miami.”Sure, the weather in London may not be as cheery as in the sunshine state. But the services we have offered oligarchs are equivalent to those once used by the likes of Al Capone. Banks move their money around. Lawyers defend their assets and their reputations. Politicians hear their complaints. And we have lots of property and luxury goods, all available to the highest bidder. This has been convenient for members of the Kremlin’s elite. For while they are very good at stealing companies, invading sovereign nations, poisoning dissidents and shutting down the free media, they are not so hot at navigating the complexities of the international financial system. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter  This is where London professionals have come in. They have done all the back office work – minimising taxes, creating shell companies, laundering money. All of which allows oligarchs to concentrate on their core activity of looting Russia. And in the same way that Miami police officers were encouraged to look the other way when the mobsters came to town, our own law enforcement agencies have been under-funded and demoralised. Even the head of the National Crime Agency, when asked why she didn’t pursue more oligarchs, told a committee of MPs: “We are, bluntly, concerned about the impact on our budget, because these are wealthy people.” This has been highly profitable for the City of London. And for two decades or so, politicians have been very happy to protect those profits from any challenge. When, for example, a group of MPs attempted to close a loophole in Companies House through which tens of billions of pounds had secretly flowed out of Russia, the Treasury defended it, saying it needed to protect the competitiveness of the City of London. Now, however, is a watershed moment in so many ways.  With ruthless and merciless Vladimir Putin on the march, Britain needs to confront its role in enabling his regime’s development. It will not be possible simply to sanction the oligarchs, and hope they will go away. Their wealth has been too well laundered, too deeply embedded into our economy. The ownership of almost , properties in England and Wales is hidden behind anonymous offshore companies – and that is just the start of the problem. You cannot sanction someoneyou can’t see what they own, and you can’t sanction propertyyou can’t see who owns it.This crisis must be a wake-up call that, firstly, it is wrong to serve a regime that invades its neighbours, and crushes democracysecondly, that it is criminally irresponsible to let mobsters buy up large chunks of our capital city behind anonymous shell companies and thirdly, we need to attack corruptly owned wealth as fiercely as its owners defend it. And that means resourcing the police, so they can tackle the oligarchs who have enjoyed themselves here for too long. Here’s an example of “red carpet Britain” gone mad. In the run-up to the  revolution in Kyiv, Ukrainian oligarch Dmitry Firtash made a fortune selling Russian gas to Ukraine and Europe.  The Americans were suspicious of his business ties, investigated him, and he’s now battling extradition to the US after being arrested in Vienna on corruption charges. Our country, however, approached things rather dferently. We sold him a mansion , showed him around Parliament, got him to open trading on the Stock Exchange, asked him for advice on how to deal with Putin, and treated him like an honoured visitor. Oligarchs don’t stop being oligarchs just because they’ve got off a plane at Heathrow. They dislike democracy and free speech here, just as much as they do at home. For the good of ourselves, and for the good of Ukraine, we need to find a better way of making a living than being a mob banker.

Gregory, a reporter at HullLive then set himself the challenge of only living on yellow sticker deals for a week. Gregory says: My first trip to the reduced section was on a Monday evening, this seems to be a good time for the yellow sticker hunters among us as the shelves were packed. I was conscious of the short dates so I went in with the intention to only buy items I could use immediately and things that I could safely store. At Tesco we hit upon a beef massaman ready meal, a cheese, leek and potato pie, a creamy chicken and chorizo pizza, a bolognese sauce, some chicken and bacon sandwich filling, turkey slices and cheese slices. There was no reduced bread which was a shame and the vegetable selection was sparse. Pizza for tea then, not too shabby but still more expensive than anything I would normally buy. Iaposd got carried away, day one and I was already up to £ spent. The rest of the week was marred with similar misadventures, in the hunt for the yellow sticker youaposre very much at the mercy of a small selection of items.  You know what you donapost see on the dry foods reduced section  Pasta. Weaposve got a sauce and nothing to eat it with and weaposre already a few days into this experiment. I had a shameful tea where I used the bolognese as a soup and ate it with a reduced bread roll Iaposd picked up on my way home. Lunch was the dubious turkey on day four, smelt fine but my mind said I shouldnapost be eating it. Dinner was the pie with veg which had been stored in the freezer and was the best thing I ate all week.The turkey went in the bin on day five, moved on to the cheese slices which were fine but the salad I picked up on was not. I managed to pick up some reduced mixed veg, a reduced sliced bread and some bagged salad from Morrisons the day after my Tesco trip. But that was too late for my sandwich filling and breakfast for which Iaposd had to pilfer a couple of slices from my housemate. That nightaposs tea was the massaman which was vaguely disappointing. The rest of the sandwich filling was used the next day but I was already getting worried about the turkey which had shot past itaposs sell buy date.I also gorged myself on the majority of a pack of spicy cocktail sausages Iaposd spotted on the reduced aisle that day, caught by the impulse of a bargain hunter and regretting my choices later on. For dinner that evening I asked a colleague to go to the reduced aisle at Marks and Spencer which is apparently where you can get some of the best deals. They came back with a childaposs portion of pasta, a chocolate mousse, a whole madeira cake and a prawn sandwich. Not exactly what I had in mind. It was at this point that I lost my patience with the challenge, having thrown away half a bag of salad which had wilted to a mush. So in the fivedays Iaposd comfortably spent over £ which is far above my usual spend, Iaposd thrown food away and I was worried about how healthy a lot of it was in the first place. This experiment was extreme, no one lives on yellow sticker food alone and there is a place for the odd bargain in your weekly shop. Realistically though, a lot of the food in those sections is pricey to begin with and store brand value products might still be cheaper. Youaposre also at the mercy of selection and dates, there is no guarantee that there will be enough to put together the meals you need and eventhere is it might spoil before you get to it. Signing off with the image of a nearly -year-old man eating a third of a madeira cake for breakfast and considering his le choices on day six. Regret.

The Highway Code recently changed rules that motorists should know.At the end of January, most Highway Code rules were updates including the hierarchy of the road.It saw pedestrians and cyclists get more protections when out and about.Many motorists enjoy going to KFC, McDonalds and Costa to get a drive-thru but they could be breaking the law and could get a big fine.At the moment, drivers could fine a £ fine or six points for using their phones while behind the wheel including when at a drive-thru.  According to MyLondon, that lean into the window at McDonalds, with phone in hand, could mean you are breaking this rule.On top of this, tougher mobile phone laws are set to be brought in next month. On March , tougher laws are set to be brought in to cover things like unlocking your device and accessing any application on your phone. This could mean drivers in drive-thrus could be subject to tougher rules in the future. The current law bans drivers from making a call and texting while driving but the changes on March  will cover most scenarios including accessing the internet or taking photos On the tougher rules being brought in next month, Edmund King, AA president, said: “The AA has long campaigned to toughen up these rules, and we welcome this announcement. This is a much needed upgrade of the law to help make our roads safer. Mobile phones offer many distractions and this sends a clear message that picking them up to use them will not be tolerated. The law will also become tougher as the use of smartwatches, tablets and laptops behind the wheel will apply.Drivers will be extremely limited on when they can pick up their phone, mainly to call the emergency services when there was no opportunity to safely pull over and to make contactless payments at drive-thrus. Being sat in a traffic jam or waiting at the lights is not an excuse, we want people to keep their hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road.

Carol took the book along to her local branch and was stunned to learn the £. she ha din the account has accrued  per cent interest and was now worth £.Now Carol is urging others to claim any old bank account they have lying around, reports Edinburgh Live.The BBC report that when an account has not been used for  years, the UK’s banks and building societies send the money to the Reclaim Fund. It has received more than £.bn from dormant accounts, and only £, has been reclaimed. Carol, who is now , lived in Manilla in the Philippines when she was young. Every three years, she would travel home to Edinburgh with her mother, Anna Paton, and brother, Gerard. They would spend a year at their granny’s house in Northumberland Street, Stockbridge. Her father, James Paton, would join them for part of the year. During one of these trips, when she was aged six, her grandmother, Helen Ivory, would take them to deposit pocket money in the Trustee Savings Bank - which later became TSB. Carol paid in a shilling - now worth five pence - every week. “I remember the big shiny wooden counter at the bank and granny introducing us to the teller,” she said. “He would fill in the book by hand and then we would take our books back to granny’s again. “It was a very grown up thing to do and on the way home she would stop in the bakers to buy us frosted cakes for our afternoon tea. We would never eat them in the street, we wouldn’t even think of that, we would wait for the afternoon tea.” Carol was given the bank book when her grandmother died, aged , in .

Wiltshire Council say the road has been closed since February  - but some drivers are still trying to use it according to police. The earthquake-like damage has been caused by unexplained underground movements which will now be investigated. Local residents claim the subsidence has been getting worse over the last year and a landslip was inevitable. Wiltshire Council said it is now waiting for a report from geotechnical specialists before taking further action. Dr Mark McClelland, Wiltshire Council cabinet member for transport, told BBC Radio Wiltshire: It could costs hundreds of thousands or up into the millions [to fix].There is signicant damage to the road. It could be up to  months in total. Itaposs not something that can be resolved in a matter of days or weeks. Dr McClelland added in some places the road had aposbuckledapos up to four feet, and descriptions of it looking like an earthquake were accurate.He added: The underlying ground has slipped and we need to understand why that has happened. The police have been very clear that itaposs very dangerous for motorists to ignore signage.

And she feared he was monitoring her after he kept showing up at the same places as herNicola Robinson feared her ex was monitoring her Image: SWNSByKatie PearsonAmy SharpeNews Reporter:,  Feb A mum has told of her horror when she found her violent ex was spying on her using a camera hidden in her wardrobe. Jamie Robinson had attacked Nicola twice after they split last July, leaving her terried. And she feared he was monitoring her after he kept showing up at the same places as her. Police found the Google Nest – designed to record audio and visual for home security – after searching her house in October. Nicola, , said: “I was so shocked. I don’t know when he managed to fit the devices but he filmed numerous day-to-day conversations I had with friends and family.  “I fell out with friends because things they had told me in confidence were being spread around. I didn’t feel like I could trust anyone. It was incredibly isolating.” Robinson, , was jailed for four years at Northampton magistrates court last month after he admitted attacking and stalking her. She said: “It’s upsetting to know I spent nine years with someone who would do this to me. “He tried to make me fall out with my friends by blaming them for telling him things but it was actually him listening in the whole time.” Nicola, a support worker, met tattooist Robinson through friends during a night out in August . The pair wed in November , and had a son. But things soured as he began staying out late and being cagey about his whereabouts. In July Nicola ordered him to go and he punched her in the back of the head. Nine days later, he ed at am, asked her where she had been and throttled her.  Police arrested him but soon afterwards he started turning up unexpectedly – one time following her to a hotel where she was staying with a friend and checking into the room next door. He knocked on their door, leaving her stunned. “I couldn’t believe he was there, and I immediately ran down to reception,” Nicola said. “We were moved to a dferent room, but I was really worried he’d come back.” In October, Nicola told a police officer at her home of her fears Robinson was tracking her. They searched for a camera but found nothing. “I said I needed to dash off to school and Jamie turned up at the school gates,” she said. “He asked me why I let the officer go upstairs and I knew he’d heard my conversation.” Police eventually located the camera in her bedroom wardrobe. Investigating officer PC Thomas Rosignoli described Robinson as “an extremely calculating and manipulative inidual”. Nicola said she was relieved by his jail sentence and hopes to help other women in similar circumstances. She added: “I haven’t dated anyone yet, my headspace is just not there yet. “My main priority is getting myself better and to a stable place.” The Sunday People has campaigned for a stalkers’ register to track serial perpetrators.

Andrew was stripped of his other titles amid the furore over sex allegationsPrince Andrew is said to be broken Image: AFP via Getty ImagesByPatrick HillNews Reporter:,  Feb Prince Andrew is “broken” ­following his legal settlement with his sex accuser, sources claim. The Duke of York is said to be in such low spirits he has been allowed to keep the title of Vice Admiral to cheer him up. Andrew was stripped of his other titles amid the furore over allegations that he had sex with a trafficked teenager in London – which he strenuously denies. The rank of Vice Admiral, equivalent to an Army Lieutenant General, is now his only armed forces honorary title. A source who served with him during the Falklands War said: “He is down, he is broken. If he wants to dress up once in a while in a naval unorm, then let him.”  Our source added of Andrew: “He was actually not a bad person when I knew him. He had a few entitlement issues but that is to be expected. “His reputation is in tatters, his public le is over. He is a walking embarrassment. “Frankly, my view is let him keep the rank of Vice Admiral. He served in the Royal Navy in the Falklands War and this was bestowed upon him by the Queen. It’s effectively the same as an honorary degree. “He hasn’t been convicted of anything. I have no idea whether he is guilty or innocent, so I think he has paid quite a heavy price.” Andrew, , was in the Navy for  years and saw active service in the Falklands War as a helicopter pilot. It is understood the Queen allowed him to remain a Vice Admiral. The Duke was stripped of his other titles earlier this year following claims he sexually assaulted Virginia Giuffre when she was  – a claim he strongly denies. They were allegedly introduced by paedophile US financier Jeffrey Epstein and his now jailed ex, Ghislaine Maxwell. The Prince faced a civil case in New York but earlier this month reached an out of court settlement with Ms Giuffre, , said to be worth over £million.

William, who has been patron of the Welsh Rugby Unionsince , and Kate are known for their rivalry during sporting engagements and the pair sported their own team scarves on Saturday. George sat in between his mother and father at the game, and Kate was seen leaning down to talk to her smiley eight-year-old son, while both parents pointed things out to him.

Kate said: Ha, yes, what does that mean  Weaposre terribly competitive. The fact weaposre now supporting two dferent teams is going to make things interesting. The duchess also told of her childrenaposs enthusiasm for rugby, saying George plays the sport at school and three-year-old Louis likes to be in the middle of everything.

But how would you reactwhile you were there, you bumped into the Queen herself Well, Prince Harry previously shared what itaposs like to run into Her Majesty when youaposre a guest in her house - and his reaction is very surprising.In a clip from a  documentary about the Queenaposs role as head of the commonwealth, Harry joked about feeling a sense of panic whenever he bumped into his grandmother in the hallways of Buckingham Palace. In the HBO documentary, Queen of the World, Harry is shown addressing a group of hospitality professionals from the Caribbean who are staying at the palace. The prince offers the group some advice and went on to reveal that even he still panics when he sees the Queen, despite being related to her. He said: You guys have spent way more time in Buckingham Palace than I ever have - and you’ve only been here two weeks. Have you bumped into the Queen yet  If you suddenly bump into her in the corridor, don’t panic.

We all do! The pressure likely came from his thinking of the Queen as his boss, which he has also previously discussed. During the BBCaposs Elizabeth At  tribute documentary, which aired in , he explained how itaposs dficult to just think of the monarch as his gran.  He added: I still view her more as the Queen than my grandmother.Harry has only seen his grandmother several times since he quit the UK to move to America with his we Meghan Markle and their children.It is hoped he will come to the UK to visit this year - especially for the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee celebrations in June. A legal representative of the prince has said he wants to bring Lilibet and two-year-old son Archie to visit from the US but they are “unable toto his home” because it is too dangerous. Harry is suing over a decision not to allow him to pay for police protection for himself and his family while in the UK. He argues that his private protection team in the US does not have adequate jurisdiction abroad or access to UK intelligence information which is needed to keep his family safe.

Putin raised the awful spectre of nuclear confrontation because he’s losing, or at least not winning as easily as he expected. His calamitous miscalculation in invading Ukraine is backfiring badly now, and the world is uniting against him. He faces a battle at home too, as anti-war protests swell in Moscow and other cities. The pressure on Putin must be intensied, never relaxed, until he has withdrawn the last of his forces from the country he attacked.  And then he must face judgement. He must be held to account for an unforgivable assault that will cost many lives on both sides, including civilians. Many more are being forced to flee their homes in terror. Britain has sent military equipment and is picking up speed on sanctions but much more can be done to help Ukraine. Oligarchs close to Putin must be pursued relentlessly. And we should take in our share of Ukrainian refugees.

However, the Met Office says the nation can expect more settled conditions towards the end of next week.Met Office Chief Meteorologist, Frank Saunders, said: “A cold front, followed by cold arctic Canadian air, has now pushed south across the country and has brought a spell of windy, showery and cold weather.  “Gusty winds mean blizzards are possible on higher routes and National Severe Weather warnings are in place. “The winds pick up again..in the weekend with weather fronts bringing rain to the north and west and milder air spreads back in here.” The Met Office’s forecast for Sunday says an area of low pressure passing to the northwest of the UK, moving towards Iceland, is expected to bring further strong winds and rain to the northwest of the country. It added: “After a spell of rain for all on Monday, it looks like a high-pressure system will settle across the UK and dominate our weather from Tuesday.  “This means it will be less windy and less changeable, although clear skies at night could potentially give us some frosty starts.” Wednesday is expected to bring cloud and rain, continuing into Thursday. The band of rain will move east on Friday, weakening as it progresses, being replaced by fine weather and the risk of overnight frost into next weekend. The Met Office added there are no storms with the potential of becoming named on the horizon.  Despite that, some parts of the country are still feeling the effects of storms Dudley, Eunice and Franklin. Five severe flood warnings are in place along the River Severn, including at Apperley and The Leigh and Tewkesbury as a result of heavy rainfall. Residents have been advised to move valuables to a safe location to avoid water which is likely to seep into homes. The Environment Agency’s warning says: “River levels remain high at the Haw Bridge river gauge as a result of heavy rainfall. “Consequently, flooding of property is expected. We expect flooding to affect Abbots Court, Deerhurst. Haw Bridge peaked at .m on Friday morning,   .  “We expect river levels to remain high into next week. We are closely monitoring the situation. “Our incident response staff are liaising with emergency services. “Please move possessions and valuables off the ground or to safety and avoid contact with flood water.” Less severe warnings are in place for the River Avon in Worcestershire, River Lugg south of Leominster and Severn estuary from Gloucester to Sharpness. Five-day UK weather forecast Today: Northwest UK, some light rain especially early on patchy drizzle eventually reaching the far southwest of England and Wales. Further east, mostly sunny and feeling pleasant enough by afternoon. Winds easing for many but picking up in the northwest later. Tonight: Rain in the north and west, possibly heavy in western Scotland where gales are likely the far northwest turning more showery later. Southeastern areas dry but tending to cloud up. Monday: Southeastern parts of England dry until later, a few bright, mild spells. Northwest UK seeing bright spells and showers, a few heavy and wintry. Elsewhere, areas of rain, sometimes heavy. Outlook for Tuesday to Thursday: Mostly dry with sunny spells on Tuesday, but cloudier with some rain in the south, this extending north during Wednesday, with rain at times through Thursday.

Abbie Plummer, from Maidstone, Kent, breaks out with painful and irritating hives whenever her skin comes into contact with water.The rare condition leaves the -year-old forced to avoid the liquid at all costs – including being ultra-diligent on rainy days, and limiting showers to no more than  minutes. She can only go out in the rain with a rain coat or umbrella, as she risks experiencing painful symptoms when the rainwater hits her skin. In the event of a storm, she avoids going out altogether.Abbie is even allergic to her own tears, which can cause her eyes to itch and puff up.  Doctors initially thought she was allergic to her shampoo or conditioner but after switching to skin sensitive cosmetics, she was later referred to a dermatologist in . Nine months later, Abbie was sent for tests at her local hospital where a doctor diagnosed the student with Aquagenic Urticaria — a rare disease which sees a person break out in hives after contact with water, regardless of its temperature. Iaposm perfectly fine drinking water as it does nothing to me internally, she told Jam Press.Itaposs just on my skin. If it is heavily raining I do see my skin start to flare up. When I bath and shower, I just have to try and be quick when doing so. I can usually tell when thereaposs going to be a breakout of hives as my skin gets itchy and red. The longer my skin is in contact with water, the more it develops hives. It is a bit annoying having the condition but thereaposs not much I can do. I have learned to live with it now.  Abbie is even allergic to her own sweat but says it is not as severe as other interactions with water. Although breakouts usually only last  minutes, the pain is stressful for the young woman, who then has to hold back the tears to not cause herself more discomfort. Thankfully however, she is still able to process water normally inside her body. Abbie also takes prescribed medication to make her le a little easier when it comes to dealing with water. Tanning and working out regularly can also help her manage symptoms. She added: With sweat itaposs a bit more manageable as I donapost break out in hives. I usually get a tan and the UV rays from the sun help my skin to not come up in hives. Itaposs not so bad when I go to the gym but I do notice my skin starts to itch. Without taking medication it means my reactions can be a lot severe and painful.

Watermarks are caused by hard water - water that has higher than average traces of dissolved magnesium and calcium in it - and they can be a hassle to remove. The lime and other minerals in the water leave behind white water spots after the moisture dries, which make your sink look dull and dirty. Luckily, thereaposs a simple way to restore your sink back to its shiny self, and it could be tucked away in the back of your cupboard. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. According to users on a Reddit forum, baby oil is the perfect final step to shine up your sink after cleaning, and it can be purchased for just £ in most supermarkets and drug stores. In response to a post seeking help for a marked stainless steel kitchen sink, one user said: This going to sound crazy, but baby oil helps with these kinds of stains. I have spent a fortune on cleaning products for my stainless steel and I saw this hack on Pinterest.I bought a small travel size bottle and was amazed. A second person agreed and said the results of using baby oil promised an amazing transformation. But while the oil is effective at making your dull-looking sink appear shiny, itaposs advised that you give it a good old clean first. According to an expert from RealHomes: Baby oil used on a soft, dry cloth will effectively remove streaks from shiny surfaces like stainless steel or enamel - but it wonapost actually sanitise the surface.Once youaposve wiped down the sink with a clean, damp rag, use baby oil on a soft cloth, like a microfibre one and buff the surface in the way the grain of the steel goes. To check this, look closely at the sink, and you should be able to see lots of little lines going in one way - move the cloth in this direction and apply minimal pressure. Your sink should be looking sparkly once youaposve done this. However,after the first attempt it doesnapost look how you want, repeat the process a second time.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

I have a lot of trust issuesIsraeli conman Simon Leviev aka The Tinder Swindler used dating app Tinder to seduce and defraud young women. He is wanted in several countries – but his victims are still fighting for justicePernilla Sjoholm and Cecilie Fjellhøy attend a special UK screening of The Tinder Swindler Image: Dave Benett Getty Images for NetflixByLucy Clarke-BillingsDeputy News Editor:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |comments Netflix documentary The Tinder Swindler tells of Israeli conman Simon Leviev, who used the dating app to contact women who he then persuaded to “lend” him money to fuel his lavish lestyle.But his crimes had devastating consequences. Norwegian Cecilie Fjellhøy, , lost more than £, to Leviev, while Swede Pernilla Sjöholm, , lost more than £,. And because of interest rates, their debt is rising. In , Leviev served five months of a -month jail sentence for unrelated fraud charges and he is now free. In an exclusive chat, the two women reflect on le since the documentary – which clocked . million hours viewed in its first week – and their fight to see the crook back in prison.  aposHe sent me death threats - Iaposm scared Iaposll never find peaceaposCecilie Fjellhøy says…Recently, I’ve been reflecting a lot on how I feel about relationships. I’m dating, but I haven’t had a long-term or deep relationship since it happened. Everything Simon did has harmed the way I’m dating and perhaps I’m scared of opening up. I have baggage now. I have healed, but I still think there’s a long way to go. There’s shame attached to stories like mine and I don’t want anyone who’s been a victim to feel ashamed. Since our story broke, I’ve been contacted by people who were almost defrauded by Simon. I’ve had messages saying, “I met him in Amsterdam… but we only went on a couple of dates – he never asked me for money.“ I think, “Oh, great for you!” The truth is, he met so many people and picked the ones he knew would help him out when he was pretending to be in need. People often ask me, “How has he got away with it  What are the police doing ” And I have to say, “Your guess is as good as mine!” I haven’t heard back from the police officer who was supposed to be chasing my case. I’ve no idea what’s going on.  I’m desperate to see Simon behind bars. I want him in jail so he can’t do this to anyone . He deserves to serve time for what he’s done to so many people across Europe. One thing that’s bothered me in recent weeks has been seeing celebrities like French Montana and Cardi B tweeting that they met him. That’s their reaction to watching the documentary and seeing women in pain! They have all that power and a big following and instead of sending a message about the pain he’s caused, they just want to show that they met him, like he’s an actor in a popular show. Some people think the same when they meet me. They smile and want a picture like this is a performance – not a traumatic experience. When I hear some of the voice notes Simon sent me on the documentary or on a podcast, they still make me cry. It’s like the trauma is right there in my face again. The outpouring of love from all over the world has been tremendous, but I still feel scared that I won’t get peace and be able to put it behind me.  Simon inflicted shame and made death threats. He told me to “watch out” and that “every action causes a reaction”. He said I had “no idea” what he was capable of and that I’d regret not supporting him.Someone has been private messaging me on Twitter saying I deserve everything that’s happened to me. They said they’ve sent Simon messages asking to be his apprentice because they’re happy he swindled a gold-digger. It’s disgusting, but I don’t let it break me. These people just want attention.I also see people online twisting what happened. One girl commented, “Who just gives out a loan of , ” But I never did that – none of us did. They don’t know the full story. But others are supportive, saying, “Keep fighting!” In Norway, I’m talking to politicians about fraud because the system, when it comes to money, is so rigged towards protecting the banks. I’ve started an organisation, but haven’t got it off the ground yet because I’m trying to fix my own le first. aposSimon is a stupid man with an empty soulaposPernilla Sjöholm says…I never started this because I wanted people to feel sorry for me. I want to highlight what’s happened to so many and ask, “Why hasn’t this criminal been charged ” I’ve seen people posting memes about us girls and Simon, like, “All my enemies are after me – send me money!”, and I get mixed emotions. I can laugh about some parts of the story because you have to. I won’t let him steal our humour after stealing so much, but it can also feel trashy. We faced a big backlash in  when we first told our story, so we knew what could happen with the documentary. We were like, hit us with a busyou want, we’re not going to stop fighting because we might be able to help someone.  But of course it’s scary to share. I still can’t watch some parts of the documentary – I haven’t seen it in full. I hide behind my hands because some parts are just too much. As for relationships, I can meet people… but I have a lot of trust issues. If someone does something nice, I become suspicious and think there’s an evil agenda. I’m glad we’ve started a movement and I hope in the future the police and banks will be more understanding of how this can emotionally impact a victim, not just financially. So many suicides are connected to instances of fraud. I’d love to start doing lectures about these types of matters. I really want to fight to make a positive change in the world. And I want to see Simon in jail. He’s not a real person, so I’d have nothing to say to him. EvenI did, it wouldn’t affect him because he has no empathy whatsoever. He’s not capable of that emotion. He doesn’t have any friends or family. He’s just an empty soul. It’s interesting that after swindling all this money from women, he spent it on bulls**t. Within two to three weeks of this hitting the news he was homeless. I thought, “How stupid can you be  Why didn’t you put % in the bank for a rainy day ” He might be a sophisticated criminal, but he’s a very stupid man.

Thousands of Russians are reportedly trying to get to the US to claim political asylum to avoid being forced to fight in the war with Ukraine.It comes as Putin is being abandoned by some of his own team as several Russian MPs withdraw their support for the Kremlin following Russiaaposs invasion of Ukraine. Russian troops have driven tanks into the country after weeks of military escalation, sparking international outrage at Putinaposs blatant aggression. US immigration lawyers have said they are overwhelmed with requests from Russian men and their families askingthey can get political protection after Putinaposs invasion. Follow the latest updates on Russiaaposs invasion of Ukraine in our live blog Russia blew up a natural gas pipeline close to the northeastern city overnight, prompting warnings of an environmental catastrophe by Ukrainian authorities before their forces breached its perimeters. An eerie quiet fell over curfewed Kyiv this morning after small arms fire and rockets were heard throughout the night, although Russian troops have so far failed in their efforts to seize the city. In recent months, a record number of Russian citizens have been crossing into the US from Mexico to claim political asylum in a reported response to Putinaposs increased crackdown on the opposition. Immigration lawyers say they expect numbers will skyrocket after Putinaposs invasion of Ukraine - particularly from military-age men who fear they will be drafted to fight. The Russian government has already called up conscripts and reservists aged between  and .  Many Russians are opposed to the war as thousands have bravely demonstrated across Russia risking arrest.Ekaterina Mouratova, a Russian-American immigration lawyer based in Miami, Florida, told The Daily: We have never been so busy. “But the number is going to skyrocket. I have got tons of emails in the last few days - hundreds. “They are mostly men between  and  who are askingthey can get protection from the USRussia does a mandatory military draft. These people do not want to go to war. “Conditions in Russia are becoming harsher and harsher and there is a lot of political instability around the region. More and more people are looking for a way out.”  The number of Russian nationals that were apprehended on the USapos southern border with Mexico soared from  in  to , in . The increase has been linked to Putinaposs crackdown on dissent, which have become ruthless since protests erupted in support of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny. More than , people were arrested in Russia on Thursday night alone for protesting their opposition to the war in Ukraine.  Ms Mouratova said her company, the Immigration Centre of Ekaterina Mouratova, is already dealing with “dozens of people” a week who have flown to Mexico from Russia, Ukraine and neighbouring Belarus. She said many then took a route from Cancun to Tijuana where they presented themselves to US border agents and claimed political asylum. Legal routes to the US for Russians have dwindled in recent years and the pandemic took a toll on consular services, making it dficult for Russians to get a visa. Mikhail Matveyev, a member of lower house of Russian parliament State Duma, today called on the Kremlin to stop the invasion. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putinaposs troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nationaposs army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous.So far, it has been confirmed by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky that  civilians and military personnel were killed in the country on the first day of the Russian invasion. In an address to his people, Mr Zelensky revealed a further  had been wounded in the fighting. The death toll is set to rise as, on the night of February , Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar claimed nearly , Russian servicemen had died during the first two days of the deep invasion She wrote in a Facebook post that the troops of the invading country have suffered the following lossesas of pm Friday, before going on to list up to  tanks  armoured combat vehicles of ious types  aircraft seven helicopters and , special staff she claims were among the losses suffered by Russia. Meanwhile, the official Twitter page of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine claimed in a tweet that today the number of losses from the occupying forces of the Russian Federation is more than  thousand. These claims have not yet been independently veried. Other pundits who have in the past been friendly to the Kremlin have also expressed dissatisfaction with the president’s power play in Ukraine. Mr Matveyev said: “By voting to recognise the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk Peopleaposs Republics I voted for peace, not a war. “For Russia to become a shield for the Donbass, not for bombing Kyiv. MP for Russia’s second-largest party the Communist Party of the Russian Federation Oleg Smolin added yesterday that he was “shocked” by the invasion. It comes as Putin is said to be furious at the state of the invasion as Russian troops and tanks enter Kharkiv triggering a fight on the streets for Ukraineaposs second city.

Putin told state TV that NATO powers have made aggressive statements along with the West imposing hard-hitting financial sanctions against Russia.The -year-old ordered the Russian defence minister and the chief of the militaryaposs General Staff to put the nuclear deterrent forces in a special regime of combat duty. A White House Official has branded the move as part of Putinaposs pattern to manufacture threats to justy its escalating aggression.Follow the latest updates on Russiaaposs invasion of Ukraine in our live blog  Press Secretary Jen Psaki told ABC today: Weaposve seen him do this time and time again. At no point has Russia been under threat from NATO, has Russia been under threat from Ukraine. This is all a pattern from President Putin and weaposre going to stand up to it. We have the ability to defend ourselves, but we also need to call out what weaposre seeing here from President Putin. We try to explain what this means for the ongoing invasion.  What were Putinaposs comments and what do they mean  Speaking on state TV, Putin said: As you can see, not only do Western countries take unfriendly measures against our country in the economic dimension - I mean the illegal sanctions that everyone knows about very well - but also the top officials of leading NATO countries allow themselves to make aggressive statements with regards to our country. In his statement, Putin alleges to be the victim of aggressive tactics from western leaders after they slapped down fresh sanctions to try and cripple Russia in its efforts to fund his invasion.His comments come after Britain, the US, Canada and the European Union announced selected Russian banks would be excluded from the Swt global payments system. In a joint statement, leaders of those nations vowed to crack down on so-called golden passports that let wealthy Russians connected to Putin’s government “become citizens of our countries and gain access to our financial systems”. They have also decided to impose restrictions that will prevent the Russian Central Bank from deploying its international reserves to support the rouble and finance the war effort.Wealthy Russians have been warned that their assets will be frozenthey violate the sanctions, which aim to further isolate Russia from the international financial system. What does it mean to alert the Russian nuclear deterrent forces  Dr Matthew Kroenig, Director of the Scowcroft Strategy Initiative at the Atlantic Council, told The Mirror that Putinaposs escalation tactics mean heaposs sending his nuclear weapons to where they could launch. Dr Kroenig, whose research focuses on nuclear deterrence, said: For example, Russia has intercontinental ballistic missiles on trucks and in normal peacetime, they are kept in garrison. When they are alerted they are then taken to Russian highways and driven around. The idea is that you donapost want them all in place as sitting duck for the US the strike, and now it seems they are on the move. He added that this would also include Russiaaposs nuclear submarines being flushed to sea as well as bomber aircraft. What is the signicance of this escalation  Dr Kroenig explained the reason for this is two-fold - to be less vulnerable to a nuclear attack with the weapons being in one place and to move them into strategic places where they can be launched from. He said: This is part of Russian strategy. I donapost think we are getting ready for a nuclear war. Itaposs like in the animal kingdom when animals make themselves look really big before a fight. What Putin is trying to do is intimidate us to say aposstay out of Ukraineapos. Dr Kroenig said that Putin used a similar strategy in  during the annexation of Crimea. He added: This development does make things more dangerous with nukes moving around, but Russia did this in  and they use nuclear deterrence as an offensive strategy. Dr Patricia Lewis , Director International Security Programme, Chatham House told The Mirror: “This not ‘deterrence’ on Putin’s part - this is a threat. Russian officials have long thought that NATO countries are so frightened by Russian nuclear forces that they would never do anything to counter Russia. Now he’s testing that out.We should not be referring to Russia’s nuclear weapons as a ‘deterrent’ - these weapons are being used to threaten not to deter. What we need now is clear, credible, non-nuclear counters to nuclear threats. Putin’s ministers and generals at least know that a nuclear attack would mean a catastrophic end to Russia.” What do we know of Putinaposs nuclear arsenal Russia possesses approximately , nuclear weapons. These can be launched from missiles, submarines, and aircraft. In , Russia spent an estimated US billion to build and maintain its nuclear forces. The former Soviet Union tested  nuclear weapons between  and  Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons in  under the Budapest Security agreement. Kyiv had previously had the third-largest stockpile in the world, but they were under Moscow’s control.

As a result, Solovyov will not be allowed to enjoy the Italian sunshine. He raged on his show, The Evening With Vladimir Solovyov: “I was told that Europe is a citadel of rights, that everything is permitted, that’s what they said…I know from personal experience about the so-called ‘sacred property rights. “With every transaction I was bringing paperwork demonstrating my official salary, income, I did it all.

The team of astronomers has been analysing a series of bright flashes, known as fast radio bursts, which were first spotted in January . These flashes are unpredictable and extremely short, lasting thousandths of a second, but each one sends out as much energy as the sun gives out in a day.In a new report, the team revealed these fast radio bursts were traced to the galaxy M, which is around  million light years away, and that is the closest source ever detected.The astronomers also discovered that these bursts are incredibly similar to ones seen in the Crab Nebular, which is a remnant of a supernova explosion that was seen from Earth in  AD and recorded by cultures around the world.  They have concluded that fast radio bursts can be created by Magnetars - extremely dense remnants of stars that have exploded. Jason Hessels, from the University of Amsterdam, said magnetars are the universe’s most powerful known magnets which are “definitely not surrounded by old stars”. He added: “If what we’re looking at here really is a magnetar, then it can’t have been formed from a young star exploding. There has to be another way”. The astronomers believe the magnetar which caused the flashes in M may have been caused by a white dwarfwhich became massive enough to collapse under its own weight.Franz Kirsten, who led the team of astronomers, said: “Strange things happen in the multi-billion-year le of a tight cluster of stars. Here we think we’re seeing a star with an unusual story.” He added: “We wanted to look for clues to the bursts’ origins. “Using many radio telescopes together, we knew we could pinpoint the source’s location in the sky with extreme precision. That gives the opportunity to see what the local neighbourhood of a fast radio burst looks like. “These fast radio bursts seem to be giving us new and unexpected insight into how stars live and die. If that’s true, they could, like supernovae, have things to tell us about stars and their lives across the whole universe.”Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Space\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Unmanned spacecraft would feed the rocks into the machine to be crushed to dust that would be pressed into tablets. Heating these tablets would trigger the release of oxygen, which could be stored in tanks for future use. The European Space Agency has made an £, deal with Thales Alenia Space, an alliance of French and Italian firms, to make a blueprint for the device – made possible by UK scientists. Roger Ward of Thales Alenia Space, which could launch the project in the next two years, said: “We wish to have lunar research stations which are permanent and people can go backwards and forwards from, rather than just go up there every  years.  “That’s when you start thinking about lunar villages and the need for resources such as oxygen to support that.” British firm Metalysis, in Rotherham, South Yorks, developed the chemical process that makes extraction possible. Scientists hope the Moon could eventually be used as a refuelling station for deeper space travel.

Later, the foreign ministry reiterated the threat online.Follow the latest updates on the Ukraine and Russia situation in our live blog  We regard the Finnish governmentaposs commitment to a military non-alignment policy as an important factor in ensuring security and stability in northern Europe, the department wrote on twitter.Finlandaposs accession to NATO would have serious military and political repercussions.Putin is understood to have attacked Ukraine after western nations examined the idea of the country joining NATO. CNN this morning report that US intelligence officials fear capital Kyiv could fall as early as Saturday afternoon.Russian troops were seen entering the city in the early hours. They have already captured the city of Melitopol in the southeastern Zaporizhzhya region, a combination of trained troops and civilians baring arms have managed to stave off attacks in most other areas. The harrowing night of fighting has taken a great toll on both sides, with estimates suggesting between , and , Russian soldiers have been killed.  A total of  Ukrainians, including three children, have been killed amid the Russian invasion according to the countryaposs Health Minister Viktor Lyashko.A further , people have been wounded, among them  children he wrote on Facebook.It comes as Putin stands accused of bombing a nursery as more heartbreaking footage emerged last night. The horrying drone slips appeared to show a kindergarten, named the Sunshine nursery, surrounded by bodies in the eastern Ukrainian city of Okhtyrka. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putinaposs troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nationaposs army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous.So far, it has been confirmed by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky that  civilians and military personnel were killed in the country on the first day of the Russian invasion. In an address to his people, Mr Zelensky revealed a further  had been wounded in the fighting. The death toll is set to rise as, on the night of February , Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar claimed nearly , Russian servicemen had died during the first two days of the deep invasion She wrote in a Facebook post that the troops of the invading country have suffered the following lossesas of pm Friday, before going on to list up to  tanks  armoured combat vehicles of ious types  aircraft seven helicopters and , special staff she claims were among the losses suffered by Russia.

Yet just three years ago, when he beat incumbent Petro Poroshenko in  elections, his only experience of politics had been his role as a fictional Ukrainian President in a sitcom called Servant of the People.That came  years after he won the Ukrainian version of Strictly Come Dancing – clips from which are now going viral. As one fan said: “He can dance, he can act, he can lead a country, he can stand in defiance against Russian forces. Not only is he incredibly talented, but he’s also one of the most courageous leaders on the planet.” Zelensky was born on January , , to Jewish parents in the Russian-speaking city of Kryvyi Rih when Ukraine was a Soviet Socialist Republic. His father Oleksandr is head of the Department of Cybernetics and Computing Hardware at the Kryvyi Rih Institute of Economics, while his mother is a former engineer.Zelensky’s grandfather Semyon Ivanovych survived the Holocaust but his three brothers were all killed by the Nazis. So claims by Russian President Vladimir Putin that he is trying to rid Ukraine of “Nazis” does not sit well with him.He says: “How can I be a Nazi  Explain it to my grandfather, who went through the entire war in the infantry of the Soviet army, and died a colonel in an independent Ukraine.” Aged  he passed English language exams and got a grant to study in Israel. But his father would not let him go so he studied law at the Kryvyi Rih Institute of Economics instead. Meanwhile he performed in local comedy troupes before, aged , he was invited to join national Ukrainian comedy team Zaporizhia-Kryvyi Rih-Transit. They won a comedy competition in  and that year Zelensky broke away to create his own outfit, Ktal .For five years they performed across Ukraine and in other former Soviet countries before producing and starring in TV shows. The charismatic Zelensky became a breakout star, and in  he appeared on Ukraine’s first season of Dancing With The Stars, which he went on to win with professional dance partner Olena Shoptenko. He also starred in rom-coms Love In The Big City, Office Romance and  First Dates. Through his comedy group he met his screenwriter we Olena, . They wed in  and have daughter Oleksandra, , and son Kyrylo, nine.  In  he landed the starring role in Servant of the People, playing Vasyl Petrovych Holoborodko, a history teacher who is unexpectedly elected President after a video of him ranting against the government goes viral. Le imitated art in March , when employees of Ktal  created a real-le political party of the same name, initially as a joke. But the party soon became a serious frontrunner.One of his manesto pledges was to put a stop to the Donbas war in the east of Ukraine, seeking peace with Russia, saying: “We don’t want our people to perish any more.”He won .% of the vote, despite having no expert advisors until just days before the election.  Ousted Poroshenko suggested his rival was too inexperienced to stand up to Russia and said the Kremlin would be celebrating his win. He added: “They believe that with a new inexperienced president, Ukraine could be quickly ed to Russia’s orbit of influence.” But when Russian troops rolled into Kyiv last Friday, Zelensky stood up to them. He turned down offers of sanctuary in the US and Turkey, saying: “I need ammunition, not a ride. Posting a video of him and his cabinet outside the presidential palace, he said: “We are all here. We are defending our independence, our country.”A keen user of Instagram, he even shared last Saturday’s Daily Mirror front page with his  million followers.As he once said: “You don’t need experience to be president.

Minutes later, missiles begin to rain down on Ukrainian cities - including Kyiv. I wake up to find the war I’ve been expecting for weeks has begun. I’ve been staying in an apartment in the heart of the capital since February  because I didnapost believe any of the claims that Russia was seeking dialogue. I thought the danger for Ukrainian people was very real and I wanted to document what was happening to them. At first, the mood is defiant. I leave my apartment and I see a man waving a Ukrainian flag. People are still on the streets. Some even manage to laugh. But as the day wears on, the reality of what we are facing dawns. Queues for cash machines snake down the streets. I join one, but I’m only allowed to withdraw £. Gradually, the mood becomes more sombre. The roads out of the city are gridlocked as thousands of people head west, in the hope of seeking refuge in Poland. Others pack their bags and head to metro stations, hoping they’ll be safe there.  Friday The atmosphere has darkened overnight. Early in the morning, air raid sirens ring out across the city.I hear the government is handing out rles to citizens in a desperate bid to stave off the Russian advance. On the streets, I run into some civilians who have taken them up. What strikes me is that these are people from completely dferent walks of le, from all age groups and class backgrounds. They are defiant. They want to defend their families, and their homeland.  Outside every apartment block, I see people loading their cars with everything they own and weeping - unsure when they’ll be able tohome. Then, I head to a metro station. Incredibly, some of the trains are still running on a limited service but every station is rammed full of people. I feel asI have stepped into a scene from the Second World War. Itaposs like nothing I’ve ever seen before. Some people have brought their pets. I see dogs, cats and even a hamster. Across the city, shops and pharmacies are closing. I have to walk two miles to buy a pizza for dinner. Saturday The night is disturbed by the constant sound of air raid sirens and the rumbles of gunfire. I hear an apartment block in the city has been damaged by a missile of some sort - it’s not clear which side it has come from - so I find a driver and head there.  ATMs are starting to run out of cash now, and you can only withdraw moneyyou have a foreign bank account. When I get to the apartment block, I’m relieved - but stunned - to find no one has been killed. One side of the building has been destroyed, and there is rubble everywhere. As I head home, I can’t help but think how far reaching the implications of this conflict will be - and Europe has yet to feel its impact.

That means we must throw open our doors to Ukrainian refugeesVladimir Putin has chosen the path of war Image: Getty ImagesopinionByVoice of the Mirror:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |comments Today we salute the bravery of the Ukrainian people as they struggle to repel the biggest invasion of their country since .Their sacrices in the name of freedom are heartbreaking, humbling, but inspiring. And it is the duty of every civilised nation to do all we can to help them.The air raid sirens wailing over Kyiv  years ago warned against Nazi attacks, not Russian ones. ButVladimir Putin objects to being compared with brutal dictator Adolf Hitler, he has only himself to blame. Like Hitler, Putin’s word cannot be trusted. Like Hitler, he promised peace while all the while being intent on war.Like Hitler, Putin cares nothing forindependence and liberty as he attempts to recreate an empire.And like Hitler, he plans to subjugate a sovereign nation with all the force and brutality at his disposal. Just as we faced down Hitler, we must face up to another dictator determined to destroy the freedoms we hold so dear. And we must do it without sleepwalking into a Third World War.  Boris Johnson compared this invasion with that of Czechoslovakia in . This time there must be no appeasement. That occupation set off a chain of events that took six years of horrying war and  million deaths to resolve. Ukraine must regain its rightful independence sooner than that but, nevertheless, we must be prepared to be in this for the long haul. Now that Putin has chosen the path of war, he has to win it, and we dread to imagine the horrors that might unleash.  That means we must throw open our doors to Ukrainian refugees who appeal to us for a safe haven and might even want to stay here. We are told such a resettlement programme is being prepared. But, as always in Whitehall, the wheels are moving despairingly slowly. Ireland has waived the need for visas for Ukrainians. The Irish will get them to safety first and worry about the paperwork later. We should follow that example. Now it is incumbent on the rest of the world to isolate Russia as the pariah state it is. Even Putin’s traditional ally, China, has shown a certain ambivalence to the tyrant’s actions.  It abstained on the UN resolution to condemn Putin for the invasion – a promising result rather than a great one. President Xi of China is the one man who might persuade Putin to withdraw and he should make every effort do so. Meanwhile, the rest of the world must put a stranghold of sanctions around the Russian state. And NATO must stand firm and resolute.  The borders of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland are the NATO red line. Putin must be left under no illusion about the lethal consequences of crossing it. Andthe Russian people are as truly opposed to this war as they appear to be, there is only one course of action open to them: to topple the man who caused it.

But by the time I was on the case, the disease was spreading closer to home # in forests near Loch Carron, Ross and Cromarty.Phytophthora, ominously meaning #plant destroyer#, is a genus of fungus-like organisms containing around  known species with a worldwide distribution.The genus, which includes the pathogens that cause potato blight and sudden oak death, has been responsible for massive crop failures, economic loss and environmental damage.Phytophthora are called #fungus-like# since they behave like fungi but dfer from them, and from all animals and plants, in several key features of their reproduction and chemical makeup.This places them in an ill-defined group of misfits called protists, which also includes amoebae, kelp and slime moulds.Phytophthora pluvialis was discovered in Oregon USA in , where it resides in soil and watercourses, and mainly infects Douglas fir.Its recognition in Cornwall during  was the first identication of this particular Phytophthora species in Europe.Thought to have arrived here on imported live plants, its spores germinate in water and can be spread, for instance, on shoes, tyres and animal paws.The pathogen infects a iety of trees, including western hemlock, Douglas fir and several pine species, causing needle shedding, shoot dieback and lesions on the branches, trunks and roots of infected trees.Forestry and Land Scotland and its policy section Scottish Forestry took rapid action # surveillance to detect infected forests, restrictions on the movement of timber and trees, and asking the public to report suspicious tree lesions.But since the European climate is ideal for P pluvialis to thrive, and its favoured trees are commonly grown here, like so many other plant pathogens, it seems likely that this one is here to stay for the long term.Forestry and Land Scotland asks foresters and the public to be vigilant for signs of Phytophthora pluvialis.Anyone who thinks they might have spotted signs of the disease should report it using the online TreeAlert system on the on www.forestresearch.gov.uk website."},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry loop sportive announced","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThe popular Kilberry Loop Sportive will take place on Saturday August  this year.Organised by Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle Club and local man John Hardie, the -mile open road event starts and finishes in Tarbert.Registered as an event with British Cycling, the fun, friendly Kilberry Loop Sportive is targeted at every level of cyclist.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden.Top three jobs in March:PICS:Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. no_aGardening_March"},{"url":null,"title":"council backs argyll events in covid recovery","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowCowal Highland Gathering is to receive a £, grant from Argyll and Bute Council as it prepares to take place in person for the first time in three years.The event, at Dunoon Stadium in August, had to take place virtually in  and  due to the Covid- pandemic.But preparations are being made for the  event to take place from August -, and it is the only event recommended to receive more than £, from round four of the council’s strategic events and festivalsfund.The Mull Rally has been recommended to receive £,, Mull of Kintyre Music and Arts Festival is earmarked for £, and the Tiree Wave Classic is in line for £,.Seven other events across Argyll and Bute are recommended to receive smaller grants.Councillors approved the recommended grant awards at the virtual meeting of the authority’s policy and resources committee on February .Eleven events across culture, sport and the arts will receive support totalling £, from round four of the council#s fund.The total budget available for   is more than £,.Councillors agreed to make remaining SEF funds, estimated to be £,, available to apply for.Receiving £, grant awards are Jura Music Festival, the Gathering of Cowal Clans and Helensburgh Winter Festival.The Highlands and Islands Music and Dance Festival will get £,, West Highland Yachting Week £, and Inveraray Highland Games £,.Tarbert Seafood Festival has also been recommended for £, despite being £ over the  per cent criteria.The report says it is felt this #does not prejudice the other applications# and the funding is available.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for economic growth said: #Events and festivals have played an important part in the economic health of Argyll and Bute in past years.

councillor.Routes in Victoria Park and Tweed Green were discussed by the sub-committee of the Peebles Common Good Fund on Wednesday night .Members heard that it could cost up to £, to install lighting in the park and up to £, on the green.Chairing the meeting, Tweeddale East councillor Robin Tatler said: “Lighting in Victoria Park is a particular issue, it has been for many years.“There’s one lit route through the park but the rest of the park is in a great deal of darkness.“The lighting in the park is really appalling.”Tricia Hill, Scottish Borders Council estates surveyor, told the meeting that officers in the parks and lighting teams would not recommend installing lights in either location due to there being alternative lit routes.Ms Hill added that it has been estimated that placing bollards in Victoria Park would cost £,, with further costs of £, and £, for energy maintenance and light source replacement.For lanterns it would set the council back £,, £, and £, under those same categories, according to Ms Hill.At Tweed Green, bollards would cost around £, to install, with £, estimated for both energy maintenance and light source replacement fees.Lanterns would again be cheaper on all three fronts at £,, £, and £,, Ms Hill told members of the sub-committee.Councillors agreed that there needs to be a balance between making sure routes are safe at night and avoiding unnecessary light pollution.A request was made to delay any decision until more information was available.Meanwhile, a request from Peebles Community Council to keep the public toilets at Haylodge Park open all year was also discussed.Mr Tatler said that the facilities are currently available between April and October.Ms Hill said that last year’s quote for cleaning costs was £ per week..removeTweeddale West councillor Eric Small, of the Conservatives, said: “If it’s going to bring people to the town I think it’s a good thing but it’s a lot of money.”Fellow Conservative councillor Shona Haslam, who represents the Tweeddale East ward, said: “Any money spent on keeping the toilets open is money taken away from projects in the town and we have to hold that at the forefront of our minds in terms of priorities in the town.“Is keeping toilets open in the winter a higher priority for this Common Good [Fund] than giving the money to good causes ”Members suggested discussing the issues at the next meeting in order to consider the cost of opening the Haylodge Park facilities on Saturday and Sunday throughout the winter."},{"url":null,"title":"peebles-christmas-lights-decision-cash-plea-deferred","story":"A DECISION on whether the council will approve a cash application from the organisers of the Peebles

And there is also a stag that appears in the town from time to time.“People love the animals, and all the kids wave at them whilst some adults even like to talk to them and I know form speaking to folk that Betsy was badly missed. My granddaughter loves giraffes, so I decide to have two made for the town“We decided to put Gerry at Tesco and his brother Garry between St Andrews Cemetery and Peebles Golf Club where lots of people will see them.

He restored the club to the Premier League, but his impact on the wider community ran deeper than that.His legacy transcends Elland Road and cannot be measured by a long-awaited promotion or, when at its best, the breathtaking beauty of his football alone. Bielsa helped one of the UK’s largest cities rediscover its sporting identity.A city centre street renamed after him and murals depicting Bielsa the saviour in suburbs such as Holbeck, Guiseley, Hyde Park and Wortley attest to that.As does the outpouring of sadness, indignation and even outrage from fans on social media at the manner of his departure. Did he have to go now, like that pic HlwvNSUExb— Leeds UnitedFebruary , There will be demands for a statue because after  years of hopeless failure on and off the pitch, Bielsa made the fans fall back in love with their club.He made the city stand up and sing for Leeds United.And new fans, from South America and all over the world, came to share in the dream and stand alongside them.In six short weeks in the summer of  after being unveiled as Leeds’ new head coach, he transformed a mid-table Championship side into promotion contenders.It was true what they said about ‘El Loco’. If he was trusted and allowed to do things his way, they said, he would perform miracles. And he did.Thank you Marcelo for everything you have done for me.You saw in me what I didn’t even see in myself. You helped me grow as a player but most importantly as a person.Wishing you all the best in your next chapter.Gracias Marcelo Vamos Leeds Carajo!!❤️ pic efuWFvT— Kalvin PhillipsFebruary , He turned the dream into spectacular reality for a negligible financial outlay. Even Gary Neville and Roy Keane became big fans of Bielsa-ball.But all dreams must come to an end and as the next page is turned when Leeds are on Monday expected to announce Jesse Marsch as their new manager, fans may begin to realise this was the way it was meant to be..removeLeeds are after all English football’s boom and bust club and not even Bielsa can keep pulling rabbits out of his hat forever. Not in the Premier League.He came unstuck because he ran out of players. The ones he had moulded in a notoriously small squad, which he insisted was the only way he could operate.At one stage this season Bielsa was without  injured first-team players and the loss of Kalvin Phillips, Patrick Bamford and captain Liam Cooper to long-term problems was a conundrum too far.Bielsa’s critics said it had only been a matter of time, that the physical demands required to play his turbo-charged pressing brand of football would take their toll.You United a club, a city  a team going nowhere. I will be forever grateful for everything you and your staff did for me and my family. A club legend of our era. Gracias Marcelo 🤍 pic wiacGcoxmh— Liam CooperFebruary , In his fourth year at the club, Leeds have struggled to replicate the form which had swept them to a ninth-placed finish in their first season back in the Premier League.Bielsa’s great entertainers have still made for compulsive viewing, but the  goals conceded in February, a new top-flight record for a calendar month, and  in total during this campaign has left them facing relegation.Some boos were heard after Saturday’s - home defeat to Tottenham and chairman Andrea Radrizzani felt compelled to act.The Italian has been savagely criticised by a large section of fans for not giving Bielsa until the end of the season to try and turn it round.Bielsa the romanticist versus Radrizzani the realist.But it must not be forgotten, Radrizzani backed director of football Victor Orta’s romantic notion that Bielsa could be the one to stir the sleeping the giant in the first place.Radrizzani will argue he had no choice but to apply the brakes to a thrilling roller-coaster ride in order to protect the club’s wider interests, albeit as well as his own.vw,vw,px, px\"Marcelo Bielsa oversaw Leeds’to the Premier League The investment arm of NFL franchise the San Francisco ers, ers Enterprises, increased its stake in Leeds from  to  per cent in November last year and a possible full takeover could hinge on top-flight status.Radrizzani has always maintained that Leeds need deeper pocketsthey are to break into the Premier League’s ‘top six’.That is the reason why Radrizzani and his board decided Leeds’ love affair with Bielsa had to end.Bielsa does not deal in pragmatism. He admitted himself he could never change his style of play and Leeds’ joint-owners refused to risk more heavy defeats.Bielsa the maverick, the reluctant hero, delivered more than just promotion and the city will be forever grateful that he came.But whether we like it or not, it appears romanticism alone will never be enough to challenge in the Premier League..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Marcelo Bielsa us Leeds legacy runs much deeper than long-awaited promotion"},{"url":null,"title":"samsung-reveals-new-laptops-mobile-first-generation","story":"Samsung has revealed two new laptops it says are aimed at the new “mobile-first” world of hybrid home and office working, with one of the devices supporting G to offer remote connectivity.The technology giant’s new flagship Galaxy Book Pro, which features the G support, is being positioned as a Windows-supporting rival to Apple’s MacBook range.Meanwhile the Galaxy Book  comes with a rotating hinge which allows the device to be folded and used like a tablet and also comes with an S-Pen stylus in the box to aid using the device like a note or sketch pad.Samsung’s vice president of sales for the UK and Ireland, James Kitto, said users in the now “hybrid living era” expected the “next level” in PC experience to help them live and work.Introducing #GalaxyBookProand #GalaxyBookPro.

We are determined to fight back fiercely as long as it is needed to defend our land and our people.— Dmytro KulebaFebruary , The Ukrainian leader had earlier rejected an offer of talks in Belarus, saying the Russian ally had been a launchpad for the invasion of his country.Meanwhile the European Union announced a fresh round of sanctions banning Russian aircraft from the EU airspace and barring the Kremlin-backed media, RT and Sputnik.In a round of Sunday morning broadcast interviews, Ms Truss said Mr Putin may be prepared to resort to “the most unsavoury means” to suppress Ukraine.Her warning came after the Commons Defence Committee chairman Tobias Ellwood said that in the “worst-case scenario” Mr Putin could deploy low yield tactical nuclear weaponshis forces failed to make a breakthrough.With the Russian advance on the capital, Kyiv, apparently bogged down in the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance, Ms Truss said the survival of Mr Putin’s regime could now be at stakehis invasion plan failed.Latest Defence Intelligence update on Ukraine pic xEssfecrQ— Ministry of Defence 🇬🇧February , “This could well be the beginning of the end for Putin.“I fear that he is prepared to use the most unsavoury means in this war,” she told Sky News’s Trevor Phillips On Sunday programme.Asked about Russia’s arsenal of chemical and tactical nuclear weapons, she said: “I urge the Russians not to escalate this conflict but we do need to be prepared for Russia to seek to use even worse weapons. I think it would be hugely devastating.“We need to avoid this at all costs.”Speaking later on the BBC’s Sunday morning programme, she said that senior Russian officials could be tried for war crimes “ they do go into that arena”.“This would be extremely serious escalation of the situation,” she said.vw,vw,px, px\"“The International Criminal Court has already said they are looking at what is happening in Ukraine andI was a senior Russian official, or indeed the president, I would be very wary of taking further steps.”Western officials have previously raised the prospect that the Russians could use thermobaric “vacuum bombs” which suck in oxygen to create a devastating, high temperature blast.Following the co-ordinated announcement by the UK, US, EU and Canada late on Saturday that some Russian banks would be excluded from the Swt global payments system, Ms Truss said it was vital to maintain pressure on Moscow with more economic sanctions.She said the Government would bring forward its planned Economic Crime Bill this week and was drawing up a “hit list” of Russian oligarchs who would be targeted with travel bans and asset freezes in the coming weeks.We have taken decisive action tonight with our international partners to shut Russia out of the global financial system, including the important first step of ejecting Russian banks from SWIFT.We will keep working together to ensure Putin pays the price for his aggression.— Boris JohnsonFebruary , “Every few weeks we will sanction new oligarchs,” the Foreign Secretary told Sky News.“We will be targeting oligarchs’ private jets, we will be targeting their properties, we will be targeting other possessions that they have and there will be nowhere to hide.”Ms Truss acknowledged there would be an “economic cost” to pay but said it was essential that Mr Putin was stopped to avert future wars in Europe.“If we don’t stop Putin in Ukraine we are going to see others under threat, the Baltics, Poland, Moldova, and it could end up in a conflict with Nato,” she said.“Yes, there will be an economic cost here in Britain, there will be a cost in terms of access to oil and gas markets.“I firmly

Sturgeon expressed frustration over Boris Johnsons approach to Covid testing that he outlined on Monday.The Scottish Government is \"determined to retain\" free Covid testing, in contrast to England.Nicola Sturgeon criticised the decision by Boris Johnson to end universally free testing and said that the Scottish Government was looking for clarity on funding for the testing programme for devolved countries.Ms Sturgeon said: “Current funding arrangements mean that though taxpayers in all four UK nations contribute to the costs, it is decisions taken for England that determine the resources available to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for testing and other Covid measures.“As of now, we have no clarity on how much of the Covid testing infrastructure the UK government intends to retain no clarity on how much investment will support it in future and no clarity on whether the Treasury will provide additional resources to pay for it or demand instead that funding is taken from where in the healthbudget.“I hope we get this clarity soon so that we can out in more detail our longer-term approach to testing.“However, and I will say more later, I want to give an assurance that the Scottish Government is determined to retain a robust testing system capable of providing Scotland with strong resilience against future Covid threats, and firmly aligned with public health advice and the principles underpinning our National Health Service.”.remove: Nicola Sturgeon update LIVE as Covid roadmap published: Covid Scotland: Vaccine passports scrapped and changes to face mask rulesNew Covid Strategic FrameworkThis weeks announcement coincides with the publication of the Scottish Governments Covid strategic framework.Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government’s strategy was now to “manage Covid effectively, primarily through adaptations and health measures that strengthen our resilience and recovery”.In her statement to MSPs, the First Minister said: “Widespread vaccination coverage and better treatments have reduced the direct harms of the virus.“As a result, using restrictions to suppress infection is no longer as necessary as it once was.“And, given the wider harms caused by protective measures, it is no longer as justiable either.“The strategic framework therefore makes clear that in future we will rely less on legally imposed measures to control the virus – and more on vaccines, treatments, and sensible adaptations and good public health behaviours.”The framework sets out three broad levels on how the Government may respond to potential iants that could see restrictions reimposed, Nicola Sturgeon had said.Setting out the contingency strategy for low, medium and high risks, the First Minister told MSPs: “If a new iant emerged that was more transmissible and more severe, perhaps with the ability to evade vaccine or natural immunity, this would likely be classied as high risk.\"In those circumstances, we might advise people to limit social contacts for a period and to work from home where possible and we may introduce some temporary protections for high-risk settings.“If a new iant was either more transmissible or more severe, but not both, as is the case with Omicron, the initial threat assessment would likely be medium.\"In these circumstances, there may be a legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings and we might issue guidance for businesses and service providers on reasonable measures to reduce the spread of Covid on their premises.“Lastly, in the absence of a new iant, ora new iant was neither more transmissible nor more severe, andvaccines continue to be effective, the threat classication would likely remain low. Obviously, this is the level we hope to reach and stay at on a sustainable basis.“In these circumstances, there would be no legally imposed protective measures. Instead, we would continue to advise iniduals and organisations to adopt sensible public health behaviours.”Covid isolation to continuePeople who test positive for Covid- should continue to isolate in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed.The legal requirement for infected people to self-isolate in England will be lted from Thursday, Boris Johnson announced on Monday.Although there has never been a legal requirement in Scotland, Ms Sturgeon said the guidance to isolate would remain.In her update to the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: “This new approach will see us resort much less, hopefully not at all, to legally imposed protective measures.“Instead, we will rely predominantly on vaccines, treatments and sensible public health behaviours and adaptations.“However much as we might wish it was not the case, Covid is still a public health risk here and globally and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future so we must also remain vigilant and prepared.”Vaccination updateVaccination appointments for the vulnerable - age group will begin in mid-March.--year-olds with an underlying health condition or who lives with those who with underlying conditions should come forward for their vaccine.Eligible children are being invited for their vaccination by NHS Scotland via letter or phone call.These appointments will be concentrated for evenings and weekends so that parents and s can attend.Visit the NHS Inform websitefor more information.Vaccine Passport SchemeThe First Minister has been under pressure from hospitality bosses to scrap Scotlands vaccine passport scheme for late-night bars and clubs.Leaders in the hospitality industry have been demanding an end to the legal requirement for customers and staff to wear face masks in licensed premises.In her update today, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that the vaccine passport scheme will end on February .Face covering restrictions to end on March The face-covering legal requirement in shops and on public transportwill end on March , Nicola Sturgeon has announced.Ms Sturgeon said: “As of March , assuming no signicant adverse developments in the course of the virus, we expect that the legal requirement to wear face coverings in certain indoor settings and on public transport will be converted to guidance.“However, we will continue to strongly recommend the wearing of face coverings in shops and other indoor public places, and on public transport.”She added: “Even though certain measures, for example face coverings, may not be legal requirements in future, we will still recommend voluntary compliance as part of the range of behaviours that will help keep us safe as we manage Covid in a more sustainable and less restrictive way.”Latest Covid casesToday, , more people have tested positive for #coronavirus, people were in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before.Sadly  more people who tested positive have died Latest update ➡️ https:t.co YnREdCegvpic WCZTIZVjw— Scottish GovernmentFebruary , The First Minister also updated MSPs on the latest Covid figures., more people have tested positive for Coronavirus today, Nicola Sturgeon said.There were , people in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before and  people were in intensive care yesterday with recently confirmed COVID-.more people who tested positive have sadly died which brings the total to , in total.Looking towards vaccination, ,, people have received their first dose of a COVID- vaccination, ,, have received their second dose, and ,, have received a third dose or booster.For more information, visit the Scottish Government website."},{"url":null,"title":"calvin-harris-announces-mystery-scottish-gig---get-tickets","story":"Gigs in Scotland has today released the newsthat Calvin Harris will be coming to Scotland.The musician will be coming to Scotland in summer , but as of yet the location has been kept secret.Those interested in attending can sign up for an exclusive pre-sale on the Ticketmaster website.Harris has not given any hint to the performance on his own social media.The show is part of a number of gigs he will be performing this year, including  exclusive shows in Ibiza.,  px px  rgbamargin: pxmax-width: pxmin-width: pxpadding: width: .%width: -webkit-calcwidth: calc\"\" fill\"#\"View this post on InstagramtranslateY\"translateX translateYwidth: .pxflex-grow: margin-right: pxmargin-left: px\"translateY\"translateY rotate\"\"\"translateX\"A post shared by Gigs in Scotland The DJ and producer will also be ing to Creamfields this summer.

reported in last week#s front page article #Have a say on planned Dalintober demolition#, these are iconic buildings in terms of the aesthetic value they bring to the town#s outstanding seafront location.I fully understand the need to reduce housing stock, in line with a declining population, but previously demolished buildings in adjacent areas – Saddell Street and Queen Street – are now unsightly gap-sites.Local opinion is important, given what has happened in the wake of recent housing demolition. There is concern, often heard in local conversation and frequently discussed on Facebook, of what might happen in the latest round of town planning.To be fair, plans are afoot to replace the same with modern housing – probably less stock to suit the demands that exist in the town at the moment – however, it is really important any proposed build be sensitive in design to suit this prime parkland location, an area fronting onto Kinloch Park and town#s seafront Esplanade.I share this concern, given the results of previous demolition, but also hope any future plans will include thoughts to increase housing stock, this in line with greater employment opportunities and rising population levels.I am appealing to people throughout the region to support my Right to Food Bill proposal before the consultation closes on Wednesday February .In the wake of Ofgem#s eyewatering

needed.If the SNP and the Greens hadn#t played party politics and kicked my Bill back, we could have already been working on ensuring the Right to Food is enshrined in Scots law.Instead, we are having to re-consult at a time when the country is already grappling with a cost of living crisis.On Thursday, Ofgem announced that from April the energy price cap would rise  per cent to £, – that is an extra £ households will have to find just to keep their homes warm and the lights on.Forthcoming increases to the interest rate and rises in National Insurance payments will exacerbate the situation.It is heart-breaking. I have had food bank helpers in tears saying we can#t wait another year for the Right to Food to kick in. People need help now.Food bank volunteers need assurance that the invaluable support they provide in their communities will end one day, when wages and benefits are adequate enough for proud families to be able to stop using the food banks.New statistics show rising homelessness across Scotland. Food bank use is soaring. Illnesses of the past like rickets and malnutrition have reappeared.In a rich nation like Scotland, in the st century, this is appalling.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season. The quantity required will y with soil type, but  to  litres per square metre – four to six watering cans – each week in dry weather will do the trick.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow lettuce seeds – both under cover and outside.If you start now, it will give you a continuous supply that can be harvested throughout the year.Sow in modules or fibre pots under cover to have lettuces ready to plant outside in four to six weeks. You can also sow outdoors, but use cloches or small poly tunnels until next month when the soil has warmed up.

only to the local people whose lives are enriched by music, but also for the tourism on which so much of the local economy depends.#Campbeltown and the surrounding district is famed throughout the

The mine was finally rediscovered by HMS Bicester early last week.Bad weather made it impossible for the crew of the Bicester to attach a surface riser to it and the mine was left to a Navy ing team to bring it up.Led by Lt Adrian Dann, the four-man Northern Diving Team from Faslane finally pinpointed the mine on Tuesday morning and brought it up later that day.The two-tonne mine is currently lying on the New Quay waiting to be picked up by the mine laying team from Cromby, Fe.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown churchgoers, in common with other congregations throughout the country, are being asked to sign petition forms calling for an end to public filth in television and literature.Already many people, including non-churchgoers, have appended their names to the forms which are also in several businesses in the town.The forms are headed: ‘Petition for public decency.’It states: ‘Being concerned about the effect on society – particularly on the young – and of the increasing exploitation of sex, the public portrayal of intimate or unnatural sexual behaviour and violence and brutality, we the undersigned call upon Her Majesty’s government: to note the concern of the public about this matter. to ensure that the law as regards of sanity stops this public affront and is so designed as to be an effective instrument for the maintenance of public decency.Some church congregations in the town have already begun signing the petition and others planned to follow suit in the near future.All of Campbeltown’s ministers are in agreement that the obscenities on television and in literature are going too far, and hope that the petition has the desired effect.The Reverend James W Hood, of Lorne Street Church, commented yesterday: ‘I think it is perfectly right that the church should be given the opportunity of speaking its mind.’SEVENTY YEARS AGOThe majesty and pomp of King George VI#s funeral procession through London, and later its journey to Windsor Castle, was seen and heard by people in Campbeltown and Tarbert on Friday, in the history-making experimental television broadcast.In both places, reception was remarkably clear and those who were privileged to see it saw this royal journey of dignied and poignant pageantry in a much greater detail than the vast crowds in London and Windsor.At both places, the sets, with -inch screens, were shown by radio dealers to parties of friends.Mr Anthony P MacGrory, Campbeltown town councillor and housing convener, had his set installed in the radio showroom of his firm’s shop in Main Street.At Tarbert, the set there was arranged by Mr Douglas C Smith, Electrical and Radio Engineer, Harbour Street.Earlier last month, Mr Smith informed us that he was getting surprisingly good results from the test from the Scottish television station at Kirk o’ Shotts – the Scottish station which is using only low power transmission.Scottish TV reception of this historical occasion was the previous day viewed with serious misgivings and doubts by BBC experts, who pointed out that the Kirk o’ Shotts station was not due to open until March  and that this is the first-ever television radio link up, connecting Scotland to London, through Manchester, was merely an experiment and the Scottish transmitters were still undergoing adjustment.So, until the TV programme went onto the air on Saturday, the BBC could give no guarantee that the venture would be successful.It was a great success and thousands of Scots over a wide area, from Dumfries to Aberdeen, saw clear pictures of the funeral processions.At Campbeltown and Tarbert, the pictures were almost as clear as everyone was looking at them on the cinema screen, the detail in some of the pictures being unbelievably perfect.One local businessman, who saw it, described it as ‘uncanny’.But, throughout the years, this has been the descriptive of all great inventions when they first made their impact on the public mind.It was a pity, of course, that this great moment in Scottish television progress should have been heralded in with such a sad event as the funeral of our King.Considering that Kintyre was not regarded as a good reception area and that this  miles relay was the longest ever attempted by the BBC, the result was truly amazing and will no doubt mean the booking of many orders from this part of the country.Already, Mr McGrory has been receiving enquiries from ious parts of Argyll.We were privileged to see the screening in Mr MacGrory’s premises that afternoon. The scenes from Paddington to Windsor were impressive, especially the arrival at Windsor and the unforgettable journey to St George’s Chapel.To those people in Kintyre, so far from the television network, it must have been an unforgettable experience to have this outstanding London ceremonial brought hundreds of miles to before their eyes and to be taken in imagination straight to Windsor to watch the Royal coffin being carried out and upon it the Imperial State Crown, the orb and the sceptre and the white wreath of orchids, camellias and lilies of the valley from Her Majesty, the Queen Mother, also movingly clear."},{"url":null,"title":"leader february 25 2022","story":"This week#s publication of the report on the follow-up visit to Campbeltown Grammar School makes welcome

2022","story":"I was so pleased to read the piece in last week#s Courier headlined #Show your garden some love this month#, and the suggestion of planting our own trees.So many trees are being cut down these days.I suggested to my husband, John, that we should buy each other a tree for Christmas and plant them in the garden of our new home.In fact, I ordered six – three each – dwarf fruit trees, due to high winds in Drumlemble, and we planted them in January.The apples are two x Golden Spur, two x Redspur and, pears are two x Lilliput Dwarf.With fruit trees, there is also the benefit of fresh fruit in years to come, either for us or future residents in our home.In response to Alex McKinven’s letter in the February  edition of the Courier titled ‘Any Dalintober developments must be sensitive’, hopefully I can give an assurance on behalf of Argyll Community Housing Association .Despite the merits or otherwise of a debate on aesthetic value with respect to the Dalintober buildings, they do not meet the needs of ACHA’s current or future tenants for a iety of reasons around layout and energy efficiency.ACHA is committed,demolition is permitted, to build  high-quality family homes, built sensitively in this outstanding seafront location.In reference to the gap sites at Saddell Street and Queen Street, ACHA does plan to bring these sites back in to community use and will consult on that in the very near future.That will be consistent with what we did when we demolished properties in central Campbeltown and replaced them with  family homes at New Parliament Place, Park Square, Longrow and McCallum Street.ACHA is committed as a partner of Argyll and Bute Council to do all we can to complete the direction of travel of regeneration in central Campbeltown over the last  years and we believe that our proposal for Dalintober and our consultation for Saddell Street and Queen Street will take that forward.My we and I have recently received from the pension service a note of our increase in the state pension from April  .The increase is . per cent whilst, by that time, inflation is expected to be in excess of . per cent.Therefore, this published increase is actually a decrease in real terms of . per cent.This is, of course, due to the triple lock guarantee being abolished by Rishi Sunak.I was pleased, however, to be informed that upon reaching my th birthday in December this year,I am still here, I can look forward to a further increase in my state pension of  pence per week.Any suggestions as to what I should spend this welcome amount on Never mind, when the SNP and Greens obtain independence, they will be able to increase my pension from their abundant resources.Then again, all the SNP’s money trees have been blown down in the recent gales.Perhaps I should rely upon the Scottish Government being in a position to capture one of the flying pigs overhead to fund my state pension when independence is achieved.Yeah, that’s right!"},{"url":null,"title":"the singing kettle returns with arties revival","story":"Artie’s Singing Kettle live is on tour and is coming to the Arran High School theatre onAnd Artie’s is back with the original singing kettles packed with favourite songs including: Music Man, Buy me a Banana, Bunny Fou Fou, Eelly Alley O, as well as stories and even some magic tricks.Speaking to the Banner Artie Trezise said it would be the first time he had performed on Arran since staging a school show on the island more than  years ago.He also has fond memories as a child coming to Arran from Cupar in Fe and it was here that he learned to ride a bike.He said: #The show is nostalgia for adults and fun for kids. Bring granny too. We promise not to #Shove Granny off the Bus#.#The Singing Kettle was formed in the early s by Artie and his we Cilla Fisher. Very soon they were joined by Gary Coupland and the three stalwarts were the backbone of the company for more than  years.From the very start Singing Kettle shows have been based on clues for songs inside brightly coloured kettles with the famous chant: #Spout, handle, lid of metal. What#s inside the singing kettle # # which Artie still uses today.While this principle was always central to the action, plot lines and stage sets were built around imaginative story lines, transforming the original concept into a spectacular musical for the whole family.The Singing Kettle turned children’s theatre into an art form and the troupe#s unique performances became the bench mark for fellow professionals everywhere.They performed in hundreds of venues, from the Palladium in London to the Town Hall in Campbeltown, from the Palace Theatre in Kilmarnock to the Royal Palace in Jordan.BAFTA-award winning and decorated with MBEs for services to children’s entertainment, audiences worldwide were hooked on their madcap musical adventures flavoured with cheeky Scottish humour.Adults and children alike found themselves singing the songs together long after the performances were over.The company closed in , with the final line-up forming Fun Box and with Cilla retiring.Artie continued performing solo shows as Artie#s Tartan Tales but since the beginning of  his show is now Artie#s Singing Kettle.There is a £ one price ticket for the show, plus booking fee.

has been  years this week since I began this column and, apart from a couple of months after the birth of our son seven years ago, I have written something every week.The content has changed over the years indeed, it has changed from week to week.I write about stories in its broadest sense sometimes a historical theme, sometimes folklore, often about the wonders of nature and our beautul landscape. But over these last years, I have also written stories inspired by my observations and experience of le and people. It’s been a mixed bag in terms of theme and topic.Recently, at a talk to a local group, one of the members came up to me and said: “I’ve read your column for years now, with my tea and biscuits on Thursday mornings. I’m never sure what to expect, but that’s what’s kept me intrigued, it’s a bit like a lucky dip.”The most interesting stories for me are those of people I meet, and this column has given me the privilege of getting to know folk I would probably never have met otherwise. Some have become good friends, but I’d like to take this opportunity to say thank you to all those who have been in contact, shared their stories and time, shown me places or given me comments. I’ve said it before and will say it again: the ability to write every week and connect with people is a huge privilege I am very thankful for.Telling a story on Traprain Law I feel very lucky as I’m now able to give talks and have the joys of storytelling in schools and where. We have all yearned for ato ‘normality’ but of course so much has changed and what’s normal for one person isn’t for another. I know that many people can’t, or feel unable to, enjoy the relaxation of measures. I’m acutely aware of the dference in people’s experiences and circumstances our stories are dferent and the impact of the last two years will be felt for many years to come.It’s light now, the sky outside is grey and the bare branches of the nearby trees are dancing in the wind. The birds are searching for the seeds I left out for them in our small garden, and it’s almost time to wake the children to get them ready for school. In moments like this, I try to pause and soak in the magic of le. It’s not always easy to do so like most folk, I have my bag of worries, anxieties and problems, and sometimes the day ahead, with all its responsibilities, can shadow my mood.But watching the morning arrive, even on a cold, blustery February day, is a gt. Our days are our lives, and we need to pause and think about how we spend each one of them. I have learnt the importance of this as I’ve got older of letting my soul catch up with me, putting things into perspective by opening that bag of worries and seeing them for what they often are: less important than they have made me believe.Storytelling at Cuthill a few years ago So with your patience, and I hope your company, at least every now and then, I plan to continue to write this column, perhaps not for another  years, but at least for a while yet as circumstances allow. I still have new places to explore in East Lothian, a list of people to meet who have kindly agreed to share their stories, and our county is blessed with a rich heritage of history to discover.And as I always say when I do a storytelling session, I am not the only storyteller in the room, for we are all storytellers. This is The Year of Stories, a time to celebrate the stories which have made us who we are, as an inidual, as a community, as a nation.But I think it must also be a time to celebrate and indulge in the art of traditional storytelling itself, that powerful personal connection made with a telling of a tale between teller and listener heart to heart, eye to eye, mind to mind. In this age of TikTok, which is redefining attention as a -second soundbite, then the need to scroll on, I think the ancient craft of the traditional storyteller, is needed more than ever.I hear folks say: “He’s a storyteller, so he would say that!” But of course, “I’m not the only storyteller in the room” you are a storyteller too. We all have stories and tales worth sharing. And the more we share, the more we may understand each other.So I look forward to hearing and perhaps sharing more tales in the weeks, and possibly years, ahead. Perhaps your story, your tales too "},{"url":null,"title":"sports-direct-reveals-uks-loved-sports-teams-including-arsenal-chelsea","story":"The sports retailer analysed teams associated with leagues across eight sports from up and down the country and crafted a list based on a number of critical factors.The researchers looked at everything from the teams brand sentiment on social media to its number of online searches.The ranking was also constructed by looking at online mentions, social following and fan engagement.Sports Direct store.

address Boris Johnsons Living with Covid policy and the scrapping of all Coronavirus restrictions in England as of Thursday.This week, Nicola Sturgeon announced her Covid strategic framework also known as a roadmap out of Coronavirus restrictions.Heres what Ms Sturgeon said during her Covid briefing today.Today First Minister @NicolaSturgeon will give an update to @ScotParl on #coronavirus.Watch live ➡️ https:t.co zWDxpMyAe from :pm. pic LKTccbDImNicola Sturgeon expressed frustration over Boris Johnsons approach to Covid testing that he outlined on Monday.The Scottish Government is \"determined to retain\" free Covid testing, in contrast to England.Nicola Sturgeon criticised the decision by Boris Johnson to end universally free testing and said that the Scottish Government was looking for clarity on funding for the testing programme for devolved countries.Ms Sturgeon said: “Current funding arrangements mean that though taxpayers in all four UK nations contribute to the costs, it is decisions taken for England that determine the resources available to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for testing and other Covid measures.“As of now, we have no clarity on how much of the Covid testing infrastructure the UK government intends to retain no clarity on how much investment will support it in future and no clarity on whether the Treasury will provide additional resources to pay for it or demand instead that funding is taken from where in the health budget.“I hope we get this clarity soon so that we can out in more detail our longer-term approach to testing.“However, and I will say more later, I want to give an assurance that the Scottish Government is determined to retain a robust testing system capable of providing Scotland with strong resilience against future Covid threats, and firmly aligned with public health advice and the principles underpinning our National Health Service.”                                                                                                              : Nicola Sturgeon update LIVE as Covid roadmap published: Covid Scotland: Vaccine passports scrapped and changes to face mask rules                                                                                                              This weeks announcement coincides with the publication of the Scottish Governments Covid strategic framework.Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government’s strategy was now to “manage Covid effectively, primarily through adaptations and health measures that strengthen our resilience and recovery”.In her statement to MSPs, the First Minister said: “Widespread vaccination coverage and better treatments have reduced the direct harms of the virus.“As a result, using restrictions to suppress infection is no longer as necessary as it once was.“And, given the wider harms caused by protective measures, it is no longer as justiable either.“The strategic framework therefore makes clear that in future we will rely less on legally imposed measures to control the virus – and more on vaccines, treatments, and sensible adaptations and good public health behaviours.”The framework sets out three broad levels on how the Government may respond to potential iants that could see restrictions reimposed, Nicola Sturgeon had said.Setting out the contingency strategy for low, medium and high risks, the First Minister told MSPs: “If a new iant emerged that was more transmissible and more severe, perhaps with the ability to evade vaccine or natural immunity, this would likely be classied as high risk.\"In those circumstances, we might advise people to limit social contacts for a period and to work from home where possible and we may introduce some temporary protections for high-risk settings.“If a new iant was either more transmissible or more severe, but not both, as is the case with Omicron, the initial threat assessment would likely be medium.\"In these circumstances, there may be a legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings and we might issue guidance for businesses and service providers on reasonable measures to reduce the spread of Covid on their premises.“Lastly, in the absence of a new iant, ora new iant was neither more transmissible nor more severe, andvaccines continue to be effective, the threat classication would likely remain low. Obviously, this is the level we hope to reach and stay at on a sustainable basis.“In these circumstances, there would be no legally imposed protective measures. Instead, we would continue to advise iniduals and organisations to adopt sensible public health behaviours.”People who test positive for Covid- should continue to isolate in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed.The legal requirement for infected people to self-isolate in England will be lted from Thursday, Boris Johnson announced on Monday.Although there has never been a legal requirement in Scotland, Ms Sturgeon said the guidance to isolate would remain.In her update to the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: “This new approach will see us resort much less, hopefully not at all, to legally imposed protective measures.“Instead, we will rely predominantly on vaccines, treatments and sensible public health behaviours and adaptations.“However much as we might wish it was not the case, Covid is still a public health risk here and globally and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future so we must also remain vigilant and prepared.”Vaccination appointments for the vulnerable - age group will begin in mid-March.--year-olds with an underlying health condition or who lives with those who with underlying conditions should come forward for their vaccine.Eligible children are being invited for their vaccination by NHS Scotland via letter or phone call.These appointments will be concentrated for evenings and weekends so that parents and s can attend.Visit the NHS Inform website for more information.The First Minister has been under pressure from hospitality bosses to scrap Scotlands vaccine passport scheme for late-night bars and clubs.Leaders in the hospitality industry have been demanding an end to the legal requirement for customers and staff to wear face masks in licensed premises.In her update today, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that the vaccine passport scheme will end on February .The face-covering legal requirement in shops and on public transport will end on March , Nicola Sturgeon has announced.Ms Sturgeon said: “As of March , assuming no signicant adverse developments in the course of the virus, we expect that the legal requirement to wear face coverings in certain indoor settings and on public transport will be converted to guidance.“However, we will continue to strongly recommend the wearing of face coverings in shops and other indoor public places, and on public transport.”She added: “Even though certain measures, for example face coverings, may not be legal requirements in future, we will still recommend voluntary compliance as part of the range of behaviours that will help keep us safe as we manage Covid in a more sustainable and less restrictive way.”Today, , more people have tested positive for #coronavirus, people were in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before.Sadly  more people who tested positive have died Latest update ➡️ https:t.co YnREdCegv pic WCZTIZVjwThe First Minister also updated MSPs on the latest Covid figures., more people have tested positive for Coronavirus today, Nicola Sturgeon said.There were , people in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before and  people were in intensive care yesterday with recently confirmed COVID-. more people who tested positive have sadly died which brings the total to , in total.Looking towards vaccination, ,, people have received their first dose of a COVID- vaccination, ,, have received their second dose, and ,, have received a third dose or booster.For more information, visit the Scottish Government website."},{"url":null,"title":"calvin-harris-announces-mystery-scottish-gig---get-tickets","story":"The musician will be coming to Scotland in summer , but as of yet the location has been kept secret.Those interested in attending can sign up for an exclusive pre-sale on the Ticketmaster website.Harris has not given any hint to the performance on his own social media.The show is part of a number of gigs he will be performing this year, including  exclusive shows in Ibiza.class\"instagram-media\"data-instgrm-captioneddata-instgrm-permalink\"https:www.instagram p CaT_TVTsE_  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"data-instgrm-version\"\"style\"background: #fffborder: border-radius: pxbox-shadow:   px  rgba,  px px  rgbamargin: pxmax-width: pxmin-width: pxpadding: width: .%width: -webkit-calcwidth: calc\"href\"https:www.instagram p CaT_TVTsE_  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"style\"background: #ffffffline-height: padding:  text-align: centertext-decoration: nonewidth: %\"target\"_blank\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: %flex-grow: height: pxmargin-right: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: flexflex-direction: columnflex-grow: justy-content: center\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxmargin-bottom: pxwidth: px\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: block height: px margin:  auto px width: px\"width\"px\"\"px\"viewBox\"   \"version\".\"xmlns\"https:www.w.org  svg\"xmlns:xlink\"https:www.w.org  xlink\"\" fill\"#\"d\"M.,.

On the shore, a gently sloping sandy shelf means the clear water is shallow enough for children to paddle.Close to the village of Baile Mò and the ferry pier, the beach’s calm beauty, however, has a dark, disturbing past: its name translates as Martyr’s Bay, after the killing of  monks in ad by marauding Vikings.These days it is tourists who seek it out one of hundreds of Scottish beaches that,not for the bitter wind and constant threat of rain, could have fallen from the pages of a Caribbean holiday brochure.At the start of her mission to track down Scotland’s most beautul beaches for a new travel guide, outdoors writer Stacey McGowan Holloway noted Martyr’s Bay on her list of those which merited inclusion.But, on Iona alone, an island only . miles wide and  miles long, she found a further three: along with Martyr’s Bay was Camas Cuil an t-Saimhwith its crashing waves and beautully coloured pebbles, Port Ban, secluded and sheltered with steep clfs embracing white shell sand, and North End Beach with dramatic, rocky shores, pristine sand and occasional seals.By the time she had finished her list of Scottish beaches worthy of being included, it had stretched to well over .Some were remote and rarely visited. Others, like Portobello near Edinburgh, were a stone’s throw from large towns and cities. Many boasted stunning rocks and sweeping bays, the promise of spectacular sunsets and mesmerising views of neighbouring islands.Others had gripping historic stories to tell, or offered a unique chance to be close to wildle.Eventually, her list was whittled down to just over  ‘best’ beaches, stretching from the Northern Isles to Dumfries and Galloway, down the east coast and right across the Hebrides.Some were well known ‘Instagram’ beaches – it would be hard not to include Traigh Shiar on Vattersay, with its wide stretch of machair and wooden gate that opens on to dazzling white sand and blue water.Others are even further off the beaten track. Visiting them would involve her spending weekends travelling hundreds of miles by bicycle and car, noting down their features and detailing just what makes them so special.The  plus beaches have now been included in The Beaches of Scotland, which details how to find the nation’s most beautul beaches, their potential for a dip, paddleboarding, kitesurfing, kayaking and other sports, and how easy – or tricky – they are to get to.However, some of Scotland’s most precious beaches have been left out, deemed too good to include for fear of opening them up to too many visitors.“The hardest thing has been choosing which beaches to include and which to leave out,” says Stacey, who splits her time between working as a cancer research scientist and, outdoor writing. She is also a member of Oban Mountain Rescue Team and founder of the Tyndrum  ultra-running race.“There are so many wonderful beaches, and some were too good to put include.“What can make a place special is that it’s hard to find and too hard to get to.“I do drop hints that there might be a beach nearby that could be worth visiting, but I prefer to leave it to the readers to work out where.”Instead, the book focuses on beaches which are reasonably easy to reach – evensome, such as Kearvaig Bay in Sutherland, require a strenuous km hike - that can sustain tourists and which offer something more than a stretch of sand and some chilly water.Such as Blackwaterfoot, on the island of Arran, where the long beach of sand and rocks gives way to a coastal walk passing impressive Drumadoon Point, a breeding area for fulmar, jackaw and kestrel, and where ers and black guillemot can be seen.The walk leads to King’s Cave, where Robert the Bruce is said to have hidden in the winter of  and took inspiration from a spider, while ancient carvings and Pictish symbols on the walls suggest he was not the cave’s first inhabitant.On the Ardnamurchan peninsular in Lochaber, Camas nan Geall – bay of strangers – has mesmerising views over Loch Sunart, the remains of a Neolithic chambered cairn at its head and the ghosts of crofters cleared from the land following the Jacobite uprising in .While remote Scoor Beachon the southern coast of Mull has large, white sandy beaches with crashing waves, awe-inspiring views and caves to explore.Scoor Cave is hard to find, explains Stacey in her book. But the reward comes in dramatic views and cave walls covered in rock carvings said to date back to – BC. A few kilometres away are the ruins of the town of Shiaba, emptied during the Highland Clearances.Some of the beaches featured may be very familiar: Dornoch beach with its sweeping sands and nearby caravan parks bustling with holiday makers, Aberdeen beach near the city centre with its Category B-listed, art-deco Beach Ballroom and Brodick and Lamlash on the Isle of Arran, wide, east-facing and when the sun shines in summer, packed with visitors.According to Stacey, however, the best Scottish beaches don’t need a blistering sun, which is probably just as well.“One of my personal favourites was Blanakeil Bay, right on the north coast, in Sutherland,” she says. “I arrived in April, it was freezing and the sun was very low.“I was by myself, it was sunset and I’d be travelling three days in the car and camping at night.“There was no-one around, and it was like standing at the end of the earth.”While the beaches she visited offered beauty and closeness to nature, waste and pollution was also often not far away – even at beaches like Oldshoremorenear Kinlochbervie in Sutherland.Miles from anywhere, its white sand of eroded stones and crushed seashells is offset by aquamarine water and, unfortunately a share of marine waste.“Sandwood Bay is another,” she adds. “I would try to pick up and take away as much litter as I could.“But it’s a km hike to get to it. A lot of fishing rubbish gets washed up andyou’re picking it up, you then have to carry it back with you, which isn’t always easy.“I found the amount of fishing litter really quite shocking.”That aside, she points out is dficult to dampen the magic of a day at the beach.“Scottish beaches have so much history, there are croft ruins or iron age ruins. It’s not just this expanse of water, because in the ground under your feet or behind you is all this history.“When you’re on the beach, you get this perspective that reminds you how small you are,” she adds.“There’s something about being by the water that is really ‘freeing’, all the background noise seems to disappear.”"},{"url":null,"title":"delivered-margarine-tub-scots-beans-revolutionise-dinners","story":"Henry Taylor was retired and in the early stages of dementia. But that had not dulled his determination to cultivate a new iety of bean, one that would be ideal to grow in a Scottish climate, with a host of environmental benefits and the bonus of being protein-packed and tasty.Having experimented and cultivated his crop for  years, he took his margarine tub of beans to the doors of Scotland’s crop research institute to see what they thought.The result, it has transpired, has become something of a bean revolution.For far from humble beans, Henry’s iety have been revealed as a Scottish ‘super’ bean, harbouring a range of special qualities which could revolutionise crop growing and bring a range of environmental benefits – from curbing the use of fertilisers on farmers’ fields, to cutting carbon emissions.Not just that, they are small and with just the right qualities when cooked to make them perfectly palatable, potentially helping to meet soaring demand for climate-friendly vegan food and an ideal Scottish homegrown alternative to one of the nation’s staples, baked beans.Plans are now underway for the first cans of Henry’s Scottish Beans to be cooked, canned and sold as the nation’s first homegrown baked beans.Although UK consumers get through more than two million cans of baked beans every day, a lack of suitable bean ieties adapted to the UK climate, means not a single bean they eat is grown here.Instead, the baked beans that land on the nation’s plates are imported, mostly from Canada.Cultivating the right bean would not only open the floodgates to a host of bean-related food products, but it would also help cut food miles, curb emissions and help farmers introduce a nitrogen-fixing legume in their crop rotations, benefitting the soil and curbing fertiliser use.Such a bean feast was not quite what Dr Pete Iannetta, a plant biologist and ecologist based at The James Hutton Institute in Dundee expected when he received a call asking him to meet a gentleman in reception who was carrying a margarine tub filled with beans.“He said he wanted to talk to the ‘bean man’,” he recalls. “Henry said he had developed this bean that ripened in the same timeframe as a pea, which was unusual for a faba bean.“I thought that was a nice thought, however some people have been trying to do that for quite a while.“So I told him, ‘leave them with me’.”Aware that Henry had once worked as a Field Trials Officer for a forerunner of the institute, Pete took the tub and planted the beans. Nature took its course and soon – far sooner than might be expected from a typical crop of faba or broad beans - Henry’s beanstalk sprouted.And Pete soon realised that the beans, gted to the James Hutton Institute by Henry in  and which he dubbed simply ‘Scottish Beans’, are,not exactly magic beans, certainly far from the average.“Henry wanted the bean to be an early ripening beans, because normally it’s very dficult to get a faba bean out of the ground in time in Scotland,” he explains. “They are relatively big plants that grow quite tall, but they generally don’t ripen until early September.“That means some farmers can’t harvest them. They aren’t wasted, they still provide a good manure, but they are a challenge,” he adds.Henry’s dwarf faba beans are smaller and have been cultivated to be early ripening, meaning one crop can be harvested allowing growers to use the nitrogen-rich residue in the soil left behind to quickly sow a second crop.While large-scale commercial corps of common haricot beans used for canned baked beans need around kg of nitrogen per hectare, Henry’s Scottish Bean doesn’t need any.Pete also found it grew well alongside barley, enabling the cereal to thrive without the need for synthetic nitrogen fertiliser.And because the beans perform well when they are ‘direct drilled’, the soil does not need to be ploughed, which helps to avoid the emissions of greenhouse gases that creates.The beans’ potential as a food crop could solve a range of other problems at a time when demand is growing from vegetarians and vegans for alternatives to heavily processed, low-nutrient fake meat style products.Currently most faba beans grown in Scotland for human consumption end up being exported to North Africa, with some imported back in the form of falafel and other foods. Other crops are used for animal feed.However, Henry’s Scottish Beans are particularly easy to cook with a thin and palatable skin – raising hopes they can reignite the use of homegrown beans which were once a staple ingredient in the nation’s kitchens.Highly nutritious with high levels of protein, slow energy release starches, high fibre and essential minerals, the beans can be ground to make flour for bread, added to soups, casseroles and stews, and even turned into a hot drink.“Whatever you do with wheat, you can do with beans,” explains Pete.“You can even roast the flour until it’s toasted, mix it with hot milk and sugar and it tastes like liquied digestive biscuits. It is % protein and with high essential minerals - have it for breakfast and it will keep you going all day.“I have come across some great books from the s with recipes which use peas and beans. They were often used for brewing and distilling because the crops were grown together with barley – it was known then that they worked naturally together and complimented each other.”The Scottish Bean is already gaining interest from bean growers globally as well as in the UK, while a quantity of the two and half tonnes of Henry’s beans that have been harvested will go to an organic grower who will work with Glasgow-based social enterprise Locavore to grow the beans for the retail market.The first cans of baked Scottish beans are expected to hit shelves next year. Although likely to be more expensive than typical beans, the potential is said to be huge: every hectare of farmland has potential to produce , tonnes of beans, while just one tonne of beans can produce , cans.The Scottish Bean has also led researchers at The James Hutton Institute to dig into its archives, where it has uncovered three long lost ieties of beans, Glen Lyon, Glen Carse and Glamis. Work is now being carried out to see how they may be cultivated into new Scottish crops.Henry, who retired in the s, was in his nineties when he died last year but had been kept up to date with a range of scientic tests on his beans.Pete adds: “They were dferent times in the Eighties, and when Henry left the Institute he wanted to continue what he started.“He took some beans home with him and was growing them in his back garden, just enjoying what he did.“His we told me the beans were so precious that the family was rarely allowed to eat them.“Henry’s stock of beans is a godsend,” he continues.“His bean is being called ‘the Scottish Bean’ but I wonderit really should be called ‘Legacy’ in recognition of everything Henry did.”"},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

This stems from the  Harbours Act which states that any harbour may be open to all for the shipping of goods.“But in my view is this is so very dferent. Can you imagine Churchill complying with Victorian legislation and allowing a vessel owned by a hostile nation into the Flow “We have a proud maritime history in Orkney, and we should play our part and issue an immediate ban on all Russian vessels entering our harbours. This would be a peaceful but very effective act.”Councillor Sankey intends to liaise with OIC officers, his councillor colleagues and politicians early next week to see how this visit can be stopped. He says he can’t condone OIC services of any type assisting the vessel.“Whilst we may by law have to allow access, there’s no law that says our pilot boats and tugs should be used, and I’m deeply unhappy about our harbour assets helping a Russian ship under current circumstances,” adds Councillor Sankey.In a statement provided to The Orcadian on Saturday, Orkney Islands Council said the authority is an “extremely dficult position.”A spokeswoman said: ”We recognise the strength of feeling around this — feelings that we share —  but we are bound by our legal obligations to accept the vessel, until such a time as the UK Government tells us otherwise.“We have sought urgent advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, who have told us that the current sanctions do not cover this operation.”We continue dialogue both with elected representatives and Government departments on this situation as we seek to clary what possible further action can be taken.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He restored the club to the Premier League, but his impact on the wider community ran deeper than that.His legacy transcends Elland Road and cannot be measured by a long-awaited promotion or, when at its best, the breathtaking beauty of his football alone. Bielsa helped one of the UK’s largest cities rediscover its sporting identity.A city centre street renamed after him and murals depicting Bielsa the saviour in suburbs such as Holbeck, Guiseley, Hyde Park and Wortley attest to that.As does the outpouring of sadness, indignation and even outrage from fans on social media at the manner of his departure. Did he have to go now, like that pic HlwvNSUExb— Leeds UnitedFebruary , There will be demands for a statue because after  years of hopeless failure on and off the pitch, Bielsa made the fans fall back in love with their club.He made the city stand up and sing for Leeds United.And new fans, from South America and all over the world, came to share in the dream and stand alongside them.In six short weeks in the summer of  after being unveiled as Leeds’ new head coach, he transformed a mid-table Championship side into promotion contenders.It was true what they said about ‘El Loco’. If he was trusted and allowed to do things his way, they said, he would perform miracles. And he did.Thank you Marcelo for everything you have done for me.You saw in me what I didn’t even see in myself. You helped me grow as a player but most importantly as a person.Wishing you all the best in your next chapter.Gracias Marcelo Vamos Leeds Carajo!!❤️ pic efuWFvT— Kalvin PhillipsFebruary , He turned the dream into spectacular reality for a negligible financial outlay. Even Gary Neville and Roy Keane became big fans of Bielsa-ball.But all dreams must come to an end and as the next page is turned when Leeds are on Monday expected to announce Jesse Marsch as their new manager, fans may begin to realise this was the way it was meant to be.Leeds are after all English football’s boom and bust club and not even Bielsa can keep pulling rabbits out of his hat forever. Not in the Premier League.He came unstuck because he ran out of players. The ones he had moulded in a notoriously small squad, which he insisted was the only way he could operate.At one stage this season Bielsa was without  injured first-team players and the loss of Kalvin Phillips, Patrick Bamford and captain Liam Cooper to long-term problems was a conundrum too far.Bielsa’s critics said it had only been a matter of time, that the physical demands required to play his turbo-charged pressing brand of football would take their toll.You United a club, a city  a team going nowhere. I will be forever grateful for everything you and your staff did for me and my family. A club legend of our era. Gracias Marcelo 🤍 pic wiacGcoxmh— Liam CooperFebruary , In his fourth year at the club, Leeds have struggled to replicate the form which had swept them to a ninth-placed finish in their first season back in the Premier League.Bielsa’s great entertainers have still made for compulsive viewing, but the  goals conceded in February, a new top-flight record for a calendar month, and  in total during this campaign has left them facing relegation.Some boos were heard after Saturday’s - home defeat to Tottenham and chairman Andrea Radrizzani felt compelled to act.The Italian has been savagely criticised by a large section of fans for not giving Bielsa until the end of the season to try and turn it round.Bielsa the romanticist versus Radrizzani the realist.But it must not be forgotten, Radrizzani backed director of football Victor Orta’s romantic notion that Bielsa could be the one to stir the sleeping the giant in the first place.Radrizzani will argue he had no choice but to apply the brakes to a thrilling roller-coaster ride in order to protect the club’s wider interests, albeit as well as his own. vw,vw,px, px\"Marcelo Bielsa oversaw Leeds’to the Premier League The investment arm of NFL franchise the San Francisco ers, ers Enterprises, increased its stake in Leeds from  to  per cent in November last year and a possible full takeover could hinge on top-flight status.Radrizzani has always maintained that Leeds need deeper pocketsthey are to break into the Premier League’s ‘top six’.That is the reason why Radrizzani and his board decided Leeds’ love affair with Bielsa had to end.Bielsa does not deal in pragmatism. He admitted himself he could never change his style of play and Leeds’ joint-owners refused to risk more heavy defeats.Bielsa the maverick, the reluctant hero, delivered more than just promotion and the city will be forever grateful that he came.But whether we like it or not, it appears romanticism alone will never be enough to challenge in the Premier League.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Today it took  penalties to find the winner. Andyou want to blame anyone blame me, there’s no problem.”Cha had subbed Kepa on for Edouard Mendy for the penalty shoot-out in the European Super Cup final against Villarreal in August.And the switch paid off in Belfast as the Blues prevailed - at Windsor Park.But the plan did not bear fruit at Wembley, as Jurgen Klopp secured his first domestic cup as Liverpool manager. vw,vw,px, px\"Kepa Arrizabalaga missed the decisive penalty Cha boss Tuchel was at pains to stress that Kepa must not receive any criticism, amid a shoot-out where every other penalty proved close to flawless.He said: “It is so bad for him of course, but no blame of course.“We took the decision like we did last time in a penalty shoot-out, because Kepa is training with the players on a daily basis.“They know how good he is and he simply has more time to do this than Edouon the training ground.“This plays a huge part in how good we shot today. Unfortunately he could not save any, the pens were brilliantly taken.“It was a bit harsh on him today to be the guy to miss the one and only penalty today but there’s no blame. vw,vw,px, px\"Thomas Tuchel, right, saw his side lose on penalties “I take the decisions when I take the decisions and I only take them when I want to take them. I cannot re-judge my decisions after the outcome.“We cannot know what would have happenedwe had left Edou on the pitch.“So of coursethere’s any blame, it’s blame on me. I’m the guy to take the decisions, sometimes it works out and sometimes it does not.“This is le as a football coach, and as a football coach who makes substitutions. So there are no regrets, I take the blame and responsibility for that of course.”Cha were left to rue three goals ruled out for offside amid a goalless  minutes.Liverpool saw Joel Matip’s header chalked off for offside, but Kai Havertz had the ball in the back of the net twice and Romelu Lukaku also had an effort ruled out.Lukaku has the ball in the net, well-found by Chalobah, offside.🔵 - 🔴 [] #CarabaoCupFinal— Cha FCFebruary , “If you look at the line that’s drawn in the goal for Romelu, it’s a bit of a weird line to make the decision that it’s offside,” said Tuchel.“But that’s it, we cannot have any regret, I’m very proud of the performance of the team.“There’s a lot of good things and I told the guys we should not lose sleep about this.“I think we have to accept the quality also of the opponent. They are maybe the most dangerous attacking side at the moment in Europe, they are full of inidual quality and with such a high rhythm.“And so defending with the quality we did and playing like this made me so proud today.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This was a warning sign of things to come as just moments later McCoubrey managed to put the ball into the net courtesy of the outside of his right boot after a scramble in the box.Again, Carryduff showed their resilience and still relied on their counterattacks, the latest coming from captain Conway, although his misjudged pass denied team-mate David Quigley a chance at goal.The pressure would continue to mount on the Carryduff back line and soon it was - as McCoubrey registered his second of the match mdash albeit through an unorthodox but neat finish.Celtic defender Blaine Connolly saw his effort fantastically thwarted by Carryduff lsquokeeper Leggett, who pounced to the bottom right corner of his net with a strong outstretched arm to deny further punishment.The weather began to give its input into the game as temperatures ped bitterly and the wind began to blow harshly at intervals.Although this cannot be cited as the determining factor in this contest by any stretch of the imagination, it certainly played its part when Carryduffrsquos Emmet Curran saw his through ball carried beyond its intended target.Carryduff did manufacture a rare breakaway and it looked asstriker Jonathan Wilkinson would open the away sidersquos account when a pass from midfield left him with just lsquokeeper Curran to beat.However, an impressive last-ditch tackle from defender Gary Carberry allowed the Celtic number five to hook the ball to safety, thus further frustrating the opposition.Celticrsquos Shaun Megahey saw his left-footed effort saved before Carryduffrsquos Joseph McBrien swept up the loose ball and in the last notable action of the half, Conway witnessed his lowly struck effort palmed away from danger by the Hoopsrsquo number one.As the second half kicked off, the home side showed no signs of relenting as they pushed for more goals.Conaill Kerr saw his point-blank effort superbly saved from six yards by lsquokeeper Leggett, who, despite the score line, made numerous contributions to prevent his side conceding into double figures.This over-eagerness from the hosts would cost them as they were caught short at the back, leaving Raymond Grant unmarked  yards from goal.The striker quickly picked his spot and unleashed a lovely curled effort into the top right hand corner to get his side off the mark.Unfortunately for Carryduff, this was as good as it got as Celtic replied almost immediately with McMahon grabbing his second of the matchafter rounding the lsquokeeper for an easy tap in.Things went from bad to worse for the away team when Stephen Galbraith slipped a pass into the path of team-mate Conaill Kerr, who made no mistake with his finish in the one-on-one scenario.At this point Carryduff were aiming for damage limitation but Celtic smelt blood. McMahon completed his hat-trick with an eye-catching acrobatic effort before McCoubrey, tapped in his third of the day.Hoops defender Carberry picked up a yellow card after some unsavoury words with the official and captain Michael Rice was left red-faced after midfielder Curran knocked the ball between his legs, but the home outfit didnrsquot let that deter them from their onslaught.Carberry atoned for his booking in the form of a late header from a Galbraith corner delivery to round off the scoring at -.After the match, hat-trick hero Sean McMahon gave his thoughts on his sidersquos resounding victory.ldquoIt was a good performance, he said. ldquoWe knew they only had  players so we had a good chance of winning but you have to play the  minutes and make sure you get the victory at the end of the day.ldquoWersquove put pressure on the league leaders, itrsquos good to score three goals but the main thing is to get the three points.He added: ldquoI donrsquot usually score headers so thatrsquos my pick of the goals for me.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, B Connolly, R Fitzpatrick, G Carberry, M Rice , B Treacy, C McCartan, S McMahon, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.

The Gill brothers, Gareth and Kyle, were among the replacements.Ballynahinch used the conditions superbly to burst into a lead they would not surrender.Playing with the wind, they pinned the students back with excellent tactical kicking and after missing an early long range penalty they went for the corner following a UCC offence at the breakdown and Kyle McCall burst from the edge of the maul to score.A great kick and chase moments later led to another penalty and another maul try for McCall. Greg Hutleyrsquos superb conversion took Ballynahinch  points clear after  minutes.The second quarter yielded only a single UCC penalty. Ballynahinch were not quite as accurate as they had been earlier in the game and small errors and indiscipline allowed UCC plenty of possession. However, excellent defence and long clearing kicks meant that the Ballynahinch line was never threatened.The second half was a scrappy affair and Ballynahinch began to fall foul of the referee at the breakdown.UCC kicked a long range penalty to close the gap to six points and missed another moments later as Ballynahinch struggled to put phases together into the wind. However, they sprung to le on  minutes and battled upfield where McCall was denied another maul try for a double movement.Following this disappointment UCC won a big scrum penalty and had the chance to kick to the corner to really turn the screw but misjudged the wind and kicked the ball dead. From the resulting scrum it was the away side who were celebrating as they won a penalty to relieve the pressure and settle the nerves.As the game entered the final quarter it was an error-strewn, stop-start affair, with injury stoppages and errors denying either side the chance to stamp any authority on proceedings.A mistimed Ryan Wilson tackle earned him a yellow card on  minutes and when UCC kicked the resulting penalty to close the gap to three points UCC were probably favourites.However, Ballynahinch produced an excellent spell of forward play with their maul continuing to be a very powerful weapon.They won a penalty from a maul on halfway and went for the corner, using up vital time on the sinbin and subjecting UCC to huge pressure deep in their .A solid scrum allowed Rory Butler the chance to go for the line where UCC gave away a penalty at the breakdown. Ballynahinch piled on the pressure, carrying hard at the line and desperate UCC defence led to another penalty and a yellow card for their replacement prop.The game was now there for the taking and following another big scrum on the UCC line Ballynahinch tried to put Conor Rankin over on the blind side.Multiple phases later UCC looked to have weathered the storm when they stole the ball and kicked clear. A superb chase saw Ballynahinch caught in possession but Cairns made an excellent arcing run to scythe through the cover and head for the line.He was tackled just short but the supporting Hutley was on hand to barge over, taking a knock in the process.He recovered to slot the conversion, sending Ballynahinch  points clear going intothe last five minutes and they saw out the game in relative comfort.Celebrations lasted long into the night and Ballynahinch have now put daylight between themselves and UCC.Third from bottom UCD arrive at Ballymacarn Park on Saturday to take on a rejuvenated local outfit who now have a snf of avoiding the relegation play-off.

One sat down while the other went up to the counter and asked for a bag of coins to be changed.As the men waited in the bank a Securicor delivery van arrived and a guard began leaving money bags into the bank.As the guard left a second bag into the bank one of the robbers produced a handgun and pushed him to the floor while the other vaulted the bank counter and grabbed the bags.Both men then left the bank and raced down the alleyway beside Irwinrsquos Superfoods to the red Sierra which was waiting, with a driver, at the entrance to the supermarket car park.The car sped off and was found on Sunday abandoned in a cul-de-sac off Hillfoot Crescent.CASTLEWELLAN ndash Mill bosses this week denied they plan to close the doors on a Castlewellan factory ndash less than three years after the plant was reopened.Speculation has intensied that Castlewellan Yarns, which is based in the former Moss Lane factory on the townrsquos Dublin road, is to be shut.The company is a ision of Linfield Group of textile-companies but a spokesman when asked about possible closure said this week: ldquoThat is not the situation at the moment. The Castlewellan plant was set up to do a specic job. It is having to compete head-on in a dficult world market at this time of depression.ldquoThere has been short-time working and we have operated at  per cent of capacity. Castlewellan is totally dependent on an upturn in the general linen market.The Linfield Group announced in  that it intended to commence production in Castlewellan. It said then it hoped to create up to  jobs in a poundm investment. However, employment levels have failed to reach this mark and the Ulster linen trade generally is currently experiencing one of it biggest slumps for a number of years.ARDGLASS ndash An assurance has been given that the long-awaited improvement package for Ardglass harbour will go ahead, despite a sizeable increase in cost projections.The chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fishery Authority, Mr Ronan Fitzsimons, has said he is confident the work on the scheme will proceed, even though it is expected to cost substantially more than the Governmentrsquos pound.m budget.Work on the project, which involves extending the main pier by  metres and providing rock armouring at the back of the harbour wall, was expected to begin next month.But trawlermen, who have been campaigning more than  years for the scheme, were startled when it emerged late last week that tenders received were vastly above original estimations.It has been claimed that some of the tenders are up to pound, over the initial budget.Mr Fitzsimons said yesterday there would be a delay in the start date but denied rumours that the scheme is being put on ice indefinitely.ldquoThe start will have to be put back but there is no question of the project being ped, he remarked.STRANGFORD ndash The proposal to build a tidal barrage across Strangford Lough has been killed off ldquoonce and for all.Stormont Minister Richard Needham axed the plan because of the damage such a barrage would have caused to the sensitive environment of Strangford Lough.The announcement has been welcomed by environmentalists who described the Ministerrsquos attitude to the Lough as ldquovery positive and encouraging.Mr Needham made his announcement at the annual conference of the Royal Society for the Protection of birds and the Irish Wildbird Conservancy in Newcastle on Saturday.Opening the conference in the Slieve Donard Hotel, Mr Needham said the barrage proposal would no longer be merely shelved but would be dropped completely.ldquoIn the early rsquos there was a proposal to construct a barrage across the Narrows to allow the generation of electricity using tidal power, explained Mr Needham. ldquoAt that time, the proposal was examined from many viewpoints. On economic grounds it just did not measure up, and so it was shelved.ldquoThere is no doubt that the creation of a barrage would severely and irretrievably damaged the superb wildle of the Lough, altering the tidal regime, ruining feeding grounds, and in the process reducing muchthe scenic quality, said the Minister.KILLYLEAGH ndash A government minister is to be asked by Down councillors tomorrow to lt the embargo on marina development at Killyleagh.A deputation of councillors is hoping to persuade Economy Minister, Mr Richard Needham, to allow a marina development on the shores of Strangford Lough.The Minister will be told of the fears that Killyleagh is being turned into a ghost town because of substantial job losses in its industrial base ndash and the belief that a marina could hold out hope of a revival.The townrsquos Ulster Unionist councillor. Mr Sam Osbourne, said ldquowhile we are meeting the Minister about the decision last August to refuse three separate applications for a marina, it goes much wider than that. There is a need for an overall plan for this town.ldquoThe whole place is badly run down and has probably never been at a lower ebb. Killyleagh is a ghost town now.

Improved disabled access is also part of the investment plan which will result in a number of paths being widened.Council officials say the planned improvements are essential for local people who are increasingly using the trails as part of their daily routine and commute.Since the start of the Covid pandemic, there has been a major increase in the number of people walking along the banks of the Quoile with this set to increase over the spring and summer.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason and Downpatrick councillors Oonagh Hanlon and Gareth Sharvin are delighted with the master plan and the benefit that it will provide for the town, its residents and visitors.Cllr Mason said due to Covid- restrictions, many areas across the district have experienced an increased use of outdoor spaces.ldquoThis has been so important for the health and wellbeing of residents and visitors to our area, she continued.ldquoThe Quoile in particular has been extremely busy with families and friends using the location for running, walking, cycling or simply meeting up with each other.

The design was rejected by the council.The campaign started last May when contractors turned up with equipment and portacabins and marked the trees for felling.Local resident Lily Devlin noticed the development and started the campaign, first rallying support via her Facebook page, and then starting an online petition.Speaking on behalf of the Save the Trees Campaign group, Cathie McKimm said: ldquoThe council got this wrong from the beginning.ldquoWe now have a situation where the council are applying for planning permission for a project they have already appointed contractors for and the project has increased by almost % in cost.ldquoIn bringing in experts to late at a huge cost to the ratepayer to fix the many mistakes theyrsquove made, including failing to include a drainage system in a flood risk area, the council are now having to contribute more than pound, to this scheme and growing, whereas before they were only contributing approximately pound, for the same scheme. ldquoGiven all the conflicts of interest that the council now have we do not believe they can assess this planning application objectively, and believe that the Department of Infrastructure needs to call it in and conduct a full investigation about how this has been handled.A council spokesman confirmed that a planning application for the project would follow regulations which apply to all councils throughout Northern Ireland in making its decision.He said: ldquoThe council will let matters follow due process, mindful of the procedures put in place by the Department for such planning applications.He also confirmed that the project, which was planned as a local tourism boost, had increased in costs.ldquoThe council has applied for and obtained funding of pound, towards the project.

Daffodils are peaking out of the ground, the weather is softening, and the feast of St Brigidrsquos Day , February , has passed.This can mean only one thing ndash lambs! In fact, lambs have been born in our practice since before Christmas. But the majority will be coming to a field near you over the next few weeks.Now, modern flocks have a lot of sheep in them. Indeed, there are about five million sheep in Ireland overall. Thatrsquos one for every man, woman and child.Our domestic sheepis descended from a primitive European ancestor, today found mainly in Corsica. In the past it was common for sheep to havejust one lamb. But today, thanks to better feeding, shelter and shepherding, it is possible for sheep to have twins, triplets and even quads!This abundance can come with problems though. Whata sheep doesnrsquot have enough milk to feed this many lambs  Well, farmers have come up with a number of solutions.The first is lsquopet lambsrsquo. These lambs are hand reared. They are fed with a bottle using condensed milk from commercial suppliers. Or the milk can be taken from another ewe who is producing a lot.As anyone with a baby will tell you, this solution is labour intensive and will keep the shepherd working around the clock. But they are dedicated, and they do it! It is not always sustainable in the long run. Another solution is fostering.Lamb fostering is where a ewe adopts the lamb from another ewe. The reasons for fostering can be manold. A lack of milk is one of the major reasons. The ewe may not want to take on another lamb, not recognising it as her own, but shepherds have adapted one of naturersquos many wonders to encourage it to happen.They use a technique called olfactory imprinting. Have you ever wondered how a ewe can recognise her own lamb in a flock of hundreds  One reason is that, just after birth, the ewe learns the smell of her newborn. This is what olfactory imprinting means.Shepherds can take advantage of this amazing process by rubbing some of the birthing fluid of the newborn lamb into the wool of the lamb to be fostered. The ewe will then accept the lamb as one of her own, and feed and care for it. The lives of many lambs are saved in this way.So when you next look at the fields of Lecale, check out the sheep and seeyou can tell them apart. Evenyou canrsquot, their mums can!.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ulster Aviation Society left ‘dismayed’ over council at Festival of Flight decision  ","story":"THE decision by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to cancel this summerrsquos international Festival of Flight in Newcastle was taken without consulting one of its key partners, it has emerged.Last weekrsquos decision to pull the plug on the event mdash which was last held in  mdash was taken in secret during a meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Tourist and Regeneration Committee.It is understood that no contact was made with the Ulster Aviation Society which has played a major role since the inaugural festival and described its disappointment at the cancellation decision.Regularly attracting in the region of , people to the resort in the summer, the flagship tourist event has been a major success for over a decade.Council officials say that due to the challenges in planning such a major festival, securing commitments from participants and with the uncertainty caused to date by the pandemic, organising this yearrsquos event would not be possible.Some councillors believe that given the local authorityrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parades in Downpatrick and Newry are set to go ahead next month and with the further easing of Covid regulations, some form of airshow could have been organised for Newcastle this summer.This week, Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis urging the council to confirm that next yearrsquos festival will go ahead.The Ulster Aviation Society said it was ldquodisappointed and dismayed about the cancellation of the airshow and the fact that the organisation had not been consulted.Society chairman Ray Burrows said it was ldquoastonishing that the event had been ldquoshot down in secret, with no reasonable explanation.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has urged the local council to ldquograsp the opportunity and organise an alternative event, suggesting a large scale festival that incorporates and builds on the most popular elements of the Festival of Flight.He is keen to see an event showcasing the regionrsquos ldquooutstanding food and drink offering with Newcastle a designated venue for arts, culture and music events to create opportunities showcasing the entrepreneurial spirit and pioneering innovation of the district.Mr Burrows said while these were ldquoall excellent suggestions, he said as elements in addition to, or within, the Festival of Flight, surely not as a replacement for it.He continued: ldquoThat said, we would be pleased indeed to meet with the council or the mayor to discuss the matter. We want to help Newcastle demonstrate in a powerful, popular way how important our aviation future and heritage are to Northern Ireland.ldquoThatrsquos exactly what did in recent years, before Covid.ldquoWe [the UAS] had probably the most popular exhibition within the ground-based event and thousands of parents have brought their children for photographs in our Spitfire and our Alouette helicopter, at no charge.Mr Burrows suggested that unless the councilrsquos decision is reversed, or at least re-assessed, he expects there will be tremendous disappointment from the public.The international festival was cancelled in  because of bad weather and in  and last year because of the Covid- pandemic it was also grounded.Urging the local authority to confirm that it will be chocks away for next summerrsquos Festival of Flight, Cllr Lewis said that for the past two years, the organisation has been unable to deliver a tourism events programme due to the impact of Covid-.ldquoAlthough the possible impact of future Covid iants is dficult to predict, it is hoped that larger scale events can resume this summer. This will be a welcome boost to residents and the local trade and hospitality sectors, he continued.ldquoCouncil research indicates that almost poundm was generated in  for the district as a direct result of tourism events. Therefore, it is bitterly disappointing that this yearrsquos Festival of Flight will not be going ahead.Cllr Lewis said the income that it would have generated would be a welcome boost to traders in the town and benefit the collective tourism industry across South Down.He continued: ldquoWe must not underestimate the huge draw of this annual festival. I note that council officers have said that throughout this past  months they had continued to engage with key stakeholders including the RAF.ldquoIt was advised that due to challenges planning the festival, securing air assets and the uncertainty of the pandemic that it has not been possible to host the festival of flight this year.Cllr Lewis revealed that he has been contacted by many aviation enthusiasts who are bitterly disappointed that the festival wonrsquot go ahead.He added: ldquoI fail to see how the event couldnrsquot have at least been planned for later in the year, now that we know the majority of restrictions are to be lted.

This will y from congregation to congregation with regard to the timing and details of it.”However, Mr Greer stressed that as a denomination his church is fully aware that the pandemic virus is still within society. “Therefore, we will endeavour to proceed with care in the removal of remaining mitigations. For example, we will also show respect and liberty toward those who wish to continue wearing face coverings, either entering or leaving our buildings or while seated for worship.“Our worship services are open to all – our own members and adherents, and also any from the public at large who wish to visit. We must emphasise our gratitude to the Lord for His mercy in bringing us to this point where church le is more back to full ministry at all levels.”• The Free Presbyterian general presbytery, in a statement this week, said: “We give thanks to God for looking upon the nation in mercy, and withdrawing the more extreme symptoms of the covid pandemic, which caused death and serious illness. “We are grateful for removal of all statutory restrictions upon our public worship and have authorised our sessions and committees to take the necessary steps, transitioning our people back to normality. We continue to pray for all who have been affected by the pandemic through bereavement and illness and that they will know God’s grace and comfort.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

So I will just say this.I first encountered Christopher in the early s when covering politics and recall seeing him with the  DUP Westminster candidate in Newry and Armagh, when Sinn Fein won the seat off the SDLP. He was part of boisterous, but not unpleasant, scenes between the rival groups of supporters at the count. I later had dealings with him when he was a DUP press officer in a team that was not afraid to push the party’s case. Then I saw him mature into a thoughtful politician, as was so evident in his recent appearance on a BBC Spotlight Special.He was courteous with a dry wit. A year or so ago he arrived at the BBC to find that I too was waiting to go on The View, and said with pretend weariness but slight smile: “Ah, a vaguely conservative voice on commentators’ corner for once.”    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It was silly, but to give Jimmy his due there was always a wee message in it, just like the work I do with the Gang today. “Always, each side of the community got an equal send up, again just like what we do with Give My Head Peace. It was all very even.“At that time I was still working in the court house for Antrim County Council because in those days, unless you were wealthy, actors could never afford to give up their day jobs. You were in the performing arts for the love of it.Olivia and her late husband Bill whom she married on June , . The couple went on to have one daughter, Patricia“I would come out of the court house like the clappers and get a bus up Royal Avenue to the Group Theatre. Sometimes we would do double shows for three weeks over Easter and over Christmas, but it was so much fun, you didn’t resent being so busy.“Every six months we changed the show, but when we would do two shows, the same people who were into theatre would be sitting there every single Saturday. People would come to the play at half six, go to John Long’s fish and chip shop for their tea and then sometimes be back in time for the second performance.”Olivia recalls that the love of her le, her late husband Bill, whom she met through the Larne Drama Circle, died of an aneurysm in .“Bill and I were always trying to get married, and I would say, ‘I’ll just do another play, Bill, and then we’ll get married.’ Olivia as a cherubic child. She began elocution lessons at the tender age of three and has been performing in one way or another ever since“We got married on June , , and got a flat, and we put every penny we got into it, and we just thought we were the bees’ knees. “Then in August of ‘ internment came in and absolutely everything stopped, the city went dark and the curtains came down in the theatres. No plays, nothing, and there was Bill and I sitting like two prunes, albeit in love.“There’s not a day goes by when I don’t miss him, but after his death I had to raise my daughter Patricia who was just ten then, and le had to go on. My love of acting sustained me.”She first joined Tim ‘and the boys’ on BBC NI’sPerforated Ulster and then came the call to join the cast of Give My Head Peace for what would go on to become the now iconic satirical series in  and ever since nobody has dared cross, or targe, the inimitable doyenne of the dramedy.‘I’M ACTUALLY VERY SHY OUTSIDE A ROLE’“At age three I was signed up to do elocution lesson,” says Olivia. “I was always used to standing up and speaking.“Basically though, and people may be very surprised by this, but I am actually very shy, and I hate going into rooms with people who I don’t really know, because I always think, ‘well why would they want to talk to me ’ “So I was always nervous, but I never had any qualms about going on stage and I always did a lot of public speaking.“At first, when I started to do it, I used to pretend that I was somebody , for about the first two minutes and that’s what got me through.“With drama you can be very shy, but when you take on a role you become somebody , and there’s a real liberation in that because you no longer feel self-conscious - you are transformed when you play a particular part.”Nash added: “When I left school, I joined Larne Drama Circle at the age of  and it was the making of me as a performer and to this day all of us are like family, my family outside my family - %.”‘IF YOU CAN MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH TOGETHER, THAT’S REALLY OVERCOMING DIVISION’Olivia, who starred in the iconic Billy Plays in the s alongside a very young Sir Kenneth Branagh and the late Jimmy Ellis, whom she remembers as an “absolute gentleman”, received her MBE in  not just for the rich tapestry of her theatre work but also for her uwavering support for the Northern Ireland Hospice for whom she has gone on innumerable fundraising walks and loves to visit to chat and entertain patients. She feels all of us could learn some perspective, namely “how to stop grumbling about things that don’t matter”, from witnessing the incredible work they do there.But today she feels blessed beyond measure, that besides working in radio which allows her to play a “tall, slim blonde” when she feels like it, she is delighted to be part of a show that frequently flags up the absurdity of our sectarian politics and entrenched, ludicrous ision where we could have unity and fraternity.”No disrespect to Stormont, butthe cast of Give My Head Peace had a half an hour up there, I think it would get politicians on both sides of the ide working together much better. “If I had a pound for all the times people stop me in the street and tell me how much Give My Head Peace made them laugh and upllted them, whatever circumstances they were going through, I would be very rich, and I feel very privilegedto have been allowed to be a part of something so wonderful, which I think very much shows that whether you are orange, green or neither, there is so much more that unites rather than ides us in Northern Ireland. “There is barely a day when somebody doesn’t shout out ‘Ma!’ to me in the street.”It’s obvious the gang are thick as thieves and Olivia tells an hilarious story about a programme special they did on the continent when she fell a*** over face into a freezer trying to retrieve some prawns, with a passerby having to pull her out by the ankles, which became comedy gold in one episode, and on a special set in Rome when they had the full humour of Uncle Billy wanting to meet the Pope.How does Ma keep Da in line, I wonder  “Oh that’s my secret,” laughs Olivia. “Da gives her a hard time, but, as in so many households, it all runs off Ma like water off a duck’s back.\u2028“You know I’ve a fabulous family, great friends and an acting career that allows me to do one of the most wonderful things, which is to make people laugh even in the midst of their own personal struggles and to be able to spread joy.“And to me the arts and comedy deserve more respect than they are often afforded, becauseyou can make people laugh together, that’s really overcoming ision.”‘IF I HAD A MAGIC WAND, I’D MAKE EDUCATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND INTEGRATED’Olivia, who calls Dame Judi Dench her ultimate acting inspiration, not only because of the incredible range that has allowed her to do everything from Shakespeare to the Bond franchise but also because she seems “so lovely” in interviews, recalls being repeatedly in trouble at school because she was simply born a very chatty and bubbly livewire.“I was at school in the days of the slap, as it were, and I had lots of them. I hold my hands up, I was always talking too much in class.”After joining Larne Drama Circle at  she was involved in so many dferent productions and drama festivals, appearing in comedies and plays like Brian Friel’s The Loves of Cass McGuire, Tea in a China Cup and even musicals. “Our church had a very strong music society and I cannot sing for peanuts. If I joined a choir, they would pay me to leave, probably. “But one year we did The Music Man I played Mrs Paroo. It was like speak-sing, you spoke it to the beat. We went to Waterford for the festival of light opera and I actually won a prize for best comedienne and to this day I can’t stop laughing about that or marvelling at how it actually came about. “The next year, we did Brigadoon, and I had a part as Meg Brockie, and one of her songs was My Mother’s Wedding Day, and I won a prize that year as well!”If Olivia had a magic wand and could change anything at all about Northern Ireland over night, she would like to see integrated education implemented here.“I remember growing up in Larne, being wheeled about with my friend in a buggy. She was a Protestant, and she was my best friend. Then, because I was a Catholic, she and I had to go to dferent schools when we got older, and I could never understand it.”Olivia added:“We should be together and everybody should be allowed to follow whatever religion they want to follow without it being a question of you being right and the other person being wrong, or anyone trying to impose their beliefs on anybody . “We need to have mutual respect for each other and I think integrated education is the way forward in trying to make that a reality.”See Give My Head Peace  on tour on March -, at the Market Place Theatre, Armagh March , at the Alley Theatre, Strabane March , at The McNeill Theatre, Larne March -, at the Riverside Theatre, Coleraine March , at the Strule Arts Centre, Omagh March -, at the Millennium Forum, Londonderry March , at the Theatre at the Mill, Newtownabbey March , at The Braid, Ballymena March -, at The Ardhowen Theatre, Enniskillen March -, at the Burnavon Theatre, Cookstown and March -April , at the Grand Opera House, Belfast.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Bielsa helped one of the UK’s largest cities rediscover its sporting identity.A city centre street renamed after him and murals depicting Bielsa the saviour in suburbs such as Holbeck, Guiseley, Hyde Park and Wortley attest to that.As does the outpouring of sadness, indignation and even outrage from fans on social media at the manner of his departure.

Not in the Premier League.He came unstuck because he ran out of players. The ones he had moulded in a notoriously small squad, which he insisted was the only way he could operate.At one stage this season Bielsa was without  injured first-team players and the loss of Kalvin Phillips, Patrick Bamford and captain Liam Cooper to long-term problems was a conundrum too far.Bielsa’s critics said it had only been a matter of time, that the physical demands required to play his turbo-charged pressing brand of football would take their toll.You United a club, a city  a team going nowhere. I will be forever grateful for everything you and your staff did for me and my family. A club legend of our era. Gracias Marcelo 🤍 pic wiacGcoxmh— Liam CooperFebruary , In his fourth year at the club, Leeds have struggled to replicate the form which had swept them to a ninth-placed finish in their first season back in the Premier League.Bielsa’s great entertainers have still made for compulsive viewing, but the  goals conceded in February, a new top-flight record for a calendar month, and  in total during this campaign has left them facing relegation.Some boos were heard after Saturday’s - home defeat to Tottenham and chairman Andrea Radrizzani felt compelled to act.The Italian has been savagely criticised by a large section of fans for not giving Bielsa until the end of the season to try and turn it round.Bielsa the romanticist versus Radrizzani the realist.But it must not be forgotten, Radrizzani backed director of football Victor Orta’s romantic notion that Bielsa could be the one to stir the sleeping the giant in the first place.Radrizzani will argue he had no choice but to apply the brakes to a thrilling roller-coaster ride in order to protect the club’s wider interests, albeit as well as his own. vw,vw,px, px\"Marcelo Bielsa oversaw Leeds’to the Premier League The investment arm of NFL franchise the San Francisco ers, ers Enterprises, increased its stake in Leeds from  to  per cent in November last year and a possible full takeover could hinge on top-flight status.Radrizzani has always maintained that Leeds need deeper pocketsthey are to break into the Premier League’s ‘top six’.That is the reason why Radrizzani and his board decided Leeds’ love affair with Bielsa had to end.Bielsa does not deal in pragmatism. He admitted himself he could never change his style of play and Leeds’ joint-owners refused to risk more heavy defeats.Bielsa the maverick, the reluctant hero, delivered more than just promotion and the city will be forever grateful that he came.But whether we like it or not, it appears romanticism alone will never be enough to challenge in the Premier League..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Marcelo Bielsa us Leeds legacy runs much deeper than long-awaited promotion article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_baabedffafeeca   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_febfbaef   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?164508961700","title":"  people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line ","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland. The campaign promoted the unique nature of le onboard, with % time-off providing the perfect work-le balance for people wanting to live and work onboard for either a one or two-week sht and then spend equal time off. The positions available are part of the Onboard Sales and Servicesteam, with vacancies for service assistants and chefs. With January being the traditional time of the year when many people look for a new career, Stena Line had hoped for a favourable response but even the most optimistic of predictions could not have expected it to be so over-subscribed. Stena Line has now undertaken the initial stage of the selection process and, for the first-time, is hosting two Open Days for prospective candidates on Monday th February, where they will get a chance to meet members of Stena Line’s crews. The Open Days are taking place in Belfast and Birkenhead with the latter being held onboard one of Stena Line’s newest ferries, Stena Edda, giving candidates a chance to get a first-hand taste of le onboard on the Irish Sea. Stephen Bryden, Stena Line’s Head of Onboard Sales and Services, commented on the success of the campaign: “I am astonished by the public’s response to the A Le Less Ordinary recruitment campaign. We have never received so many applications. It really goes to show how many people are attracted to a le at sea with a company like Stena Line. Now our HR team has the challenge of how to sort and interview so many applicants, but that is a nice challenge to have. Thank you to every single person that has applied to work with us.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_baabedffafeeca   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_febfbaef   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
