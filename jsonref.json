Though we’re leaving the EU, there are still huge issues to play forIt’s as though a meteor like the one that destroyed the dinosaurs has landed in our midst. Overnight, Brexit has gone from dominating British politics to suffering a form of political extinction. When the electoral meteor hit on 12 December, Brexit became the issue that no one – not even Boris Johnson – wants to mention any more. In some ways it is a huge relief, not least to political commentators.We all need to heal our wounds. So does the country. But while the essential issue has been settled, the conspiracy of silence that has followed needs to end. The UK needs to learn to think about Brexit again.This is not a call to revive the passions of the recent past. Apart from anything else, that wouldn’t work. The intensity of those times is over. Neither the winners nor the losers in the Brexit wars have any appetite for reviving it. But Brexit must still be tackled, albeit in a changed way. Ignoring it would be a failure of democracy.Next week’s official departure from the European Union will not “get Brexit done”. The UK will cease to be an EU member state. Some will celebrate that. Others will mourn. Politicians will issue their statements and journalists will report them. But this is the end of the beginning, no more.The real challenge in the coming weeks and months is to get Brexit back on the agenda in a series of new ways. This means recognising and acknowledging that Brexit remains at the very centre of political and policy decision-making, not as an issue that must be refought from first principles as it was in 2016-19, but as a fact that will permeate almost every important policy choice facing Britain in the years ahead.The first of these new ways involves recognising that the Brexit process will itself generate more big choices, not fewer. Johnson’s victory in December effectively solves the withdrawal itself. Even so, the bill that enacts withdrawal has been controversial because it reneges on pre-election Brexit commitments on issues including the role of parliament, employment rights and refugee children. None of these is a minor issue. The government has been smart and lucky to drive this bill through so quickly.Yet the withdrawal bill says nothing about what happens next on Brexit. These regulatory and trade issues are all still to play for, and that must be done in public, with proper scrutiny. All this will come to a head, but will not be resolved, in June. That’s when Johnson must decide whether to extend the transition period beyond the end of this year. He is determined to avoid doing so because he wants to frame Brexit as finished business. But he also wants a deal with the EU. Sajid Javid said yesterday that an EU deal is more of a priority than one with the US. This makes June a crossroads moment for Brexit and Johnson.The act of leaving the EU also sees the government face a series of big domestic decisions that cannot be put off, especially if the 31 December deadline for completing the transition is to hold. These include things such as immigration policy, regulatory policy over sectors such as financial services, the future of agriculture and fishing, and the place of human rights in Brexit Britain. Perhaps most explosively of all, the government must handle the post-Brexit pressures on the UK union itself, from Northern Ireland and Scotland in particular but from Wales and the English regions too.On all of these major issues, Johnson faces formidable dilemmas. He has to deliver agreements, maintain confidence, keep his leaver base happy and avoid needlessly provoking all those whose support he may need in other contexts. He has to juggle party, economic, local and international interests in each case, while at the same time coping with the unexpected. Everything is shot through with Brexit, whether he likes it or not.Yesterday, the Davos conference showcased a classic example of Brexit’s complex but irresistible continuing impact throughout British politics. The UK is under pressure from the EU and the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to defer its planned digital services tax on US tech giants so that policy-makers can hammer out a watertight international system of controls. France has already done the same this week.The political problem is that the Johnson government’s priority is to live up to its own take-back-control rhetoric. It can’t work alongside the EU to achieve an effective regime against the lawless tech companies because the UK is supposed to be making its own decisions now. But it can’t back down on the UK tech tax because Britain doesn’t want to be seen to be bending the knee to Donald Trump. As a result, Johnson has been pushed into a position in which he both invites US retaliation and uncouples from the EU.Brexit wasn’t meant to look like this. The row about the digital services tax is merely one among multiple others that require the Johnson government to make vital choices about where its real interests lie. Johnson’s stances on Huawei and on relations with Iran can only be understood in the same light too. On the domestic front, so can the indecision about the HS2 high speed rail project,, the future of Heathrow or the shape of Sajid Javid’s March budget. All of these involve choices that will strain the Tory party.But the link between Brexit and these real-world choices can’t be ignored by other political parties either. That’s not a problem for opposition parties that are still confident in their anti-Brexit stances, such as the SNP. But it’s a real problem for Labour.

Business people may look again at their balance sheets in light of the ’s revelation that an investigation found the Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos had his mobile phone hacked after receiving a WhatsApp message apparently sent from the crown prince of Saudi Arabia’s account.For a long time, the kingdom’s piles of cash and strategic importance ensured that commercial and diplomatic partners played down its catastrophic role in the war in Yemen – spearheaded by Mohammed bin Salman himself – and human rights abuses including the arrest and alleged torture of women’s rights activists.Then, in October 2018, Jamal Khashoggi walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Within minutes, the journalist was dead. After unconvincing denials that he had been murdered, Riyadh described his killing as an unplanned rogue operation, later sentencing a number of lower-level officials to death. Suddenly people felt the need to put some distance between themselves and the kingdom, pulling out of the grand investment summit overseen by the crown prince. In June last year, the UN special rapporteur Agnès Callamard issued a report stating that there was “credible evidence” that the Saudi heir and other senior officials were liable for the killing, despite the kingdom’s denials.Now Ms Callamard and her colleague David Kaye, who cover extrajudicial killings and freedom of expression respectively, say they are gravely concerned by the information they have received regarding the possible involvement of the crown prince in surveillance of Mr Bezos, “in an effort to influence, if not silence, the Washington Post’s reporting on Saudi Arabia”. They demand an immediate investigation by the US and others. (The Saudi embassy in Washington has said it is “absurd” to suggest that the kingdom has been involved in hacking Mr Bezos’s phone.) Analysis suggests that the handset started sending vast amounts of data within hours of the businessman receiving a video file from the account of the crown prince during a WhatsApp exchange, five months before Mr Khashoggi’s death. They note that, if the analysis is correct, the case is a concrete example of the harms done by “the unconstrained marketing, sale and use of spyware”.It is not yet established whether or how the incident relates to the murder of Mr Khashoggi, a prominent and exiled critic of the Saudi government who was writing for the Washington Post, which is owned by Mr Bezos. There are many more questions to be answered. Last year the US tabloid the National Enquirer published intimate details about Mr Bezos’s private life, prompting him to hire digital forensic investigators. They concluded that the Saudis had accessed his phone and gained private information about him, though the tabloid’s owner, American Media Inc, said it was tipped off by his girlfriend’s estranged brother. The billionaire’s head of security has noted a “close relationship” between the Saudi heir and AMI’s chief executive, David Pecker – who is also a close friend of Donald Trump the president’s loathing of the Washington Post is well known.Mr Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was one of the attendees at last year’s Saudi investment summit. Only a year after Mr Khashoggi’s death, many of those who had pulled out of the 2018 event were present – including the interim boss of HSBC and chief executives of the asset managers Blackstone and BlackRock and of Credit Suisse. (Meanwhile, concerts by Mariah Carey and BTS, and events such as December’s Joshua-Ruiz fight have sought to improve the kingdom’s public image.) Yet many of those who have posed smilingly alongside the future king are doubtless in urgent talks with their digital security consultants. Though money and power will continue to compel, Saudi’s partners should ask themselves: with friends like these, who needs enemies?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f77966e19b203d10ec90d89cc396b8ed9846df3/0_496_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf5a11df1442f979985f48ef55ff1877","title":"veganuary animal foods plant vegan","story":"We seem to have forgotten that, just like meat, vegan food can damage the planetChoosing a healthy and environmentally aware diet is a modern problem. Well-intentioned people are puzzled. Should we pick up “plant chicken pieces” that come from a factory in Holland, or a leg of grass-fed British lamb? Which is the better choice for both personal and planetary health?If the Veganuary entreaty has struck a chord with you, your choice should be a no-brainer: fake, factory meat is clearly preferable to the real thing. No animals were killed for it, and even if no one other than a food technologist really understands the processes and ingredients that created it, it must surely be a boon for the planet. If it’s vegan, it must be green and healthy, right?Supermarkets, global food manufacturers and biotech and chemical companies have enthusiastically embraced Veganuary. Fast-food enterprises, formerly seen as the nemesis of public health and the environment, have recast themselves as their saviours. McDonald’s was feted when it launched its first vegan Veggie Dippers meal: nuggets that contain around 40 ingredients, many of which can’t be found in any domestic larder, served with chips and a soft drink. And although Greggs hasn’t made public the ingredient composition of its new vegan “steak” bake, this hasn’t stopped it earning extensive kudos for the product. The composition of KFC’s recently launched “zero chicken vegan burger” is a similar enigma, but that needn’t concern its marketing department. Just when ultra-processed food manufacturers were being skewered for the health damage their products cause, the plant-based push has given them a get-out-of-jail-free card.It’s a pity that the public food discourse has become so binary: animal foods bad, plant foods good. Perhaps it’s time to reacquaint ourselves with the defining characteristics of food that keeps us, and the planet, healthy. Whether it comes from the plant or animal kingdom is irrelevant. What really matters is how that food is produced. Though some animal foods are factory farmed in a way that harms animals and the environment, not all animal products are equally damaging.The sausage that sits on your full English platter at a motorway service station is, excuse the pun, quite a different animal to that which arrives in your box from a company such as Riverford, which sells food to consumers direct from its producers. Its milk and meat come from animals that are reared on organic farms, where they are free to range (weather permitting). Free-range farming produces food using the sun’s energy, on land that could often serve no other agricultural purpose.In turn, free-range livestock fertilise the soil, and the pastures they graze on soak up surplus water and prevent soil erosion. This is quite different from livestock reared indoors, using methods that contribute to deforestation and water pollution. Where livestock manure builds soil fertility, fossil fuel-derived pesticides and fertilisers sprayed on intensively grown plant crops have depleted it. Without fertile soil, vegans and omnivores alike go hungry. As livestock producers put it: it’s not the cow, but the how.These days it’s fashionable to eulogise plant foods as the secret for personal health and sound stewardship of our planet. But in the process of squaring up to the challenge of climate breakdown, we seem to have forgotten that plant foods too can be either badly or well produced. Wholemeal bread seems like a wholesome, peaceful, uncontentious food choice until you learn that two-thirds of bread sampled by Defra contained residues of the pesticide glyphosate. Classed as a “probable carcinogen”, glyphosate has no safe level in food, yet it has contaminated our web of life.Perhaps you agonise over whether you should ditch cow’s milk for almond milk. If so, did you realise that your pint of plant milk was almost certainly manufactured from almonds grown in California, where farmers deploy a chemical cocktail of insecticide and fungicides that kills off millions of honeybees every year? Might organic British cow’s milk be a more responsible choice?And think of all those avocados we mash on toast. Although they seem the pure embodiment of healthy plant food – so much better than the omnivore’s eggs or black pudding – they take on a sicklier hue if you know that the lucrative Mexican avocado trade is controlled by drug cartels, which are driving the clearing of Mexico’s native forests.As long as we demonise animal foods and eulogise plant foods, any prospect of a natural food supply is shattered. We are left to depend for sustenance on the tender mercies of the techno-food corporations that see a little green V and the word “plant” as a formula for spinning gold from straw through ultra-processing. I for one don’t relish that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a81b394d9e188f209e5a4d62951d80d86dd98b1/119_0_3533_2121/master/3533.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a6d4e41cf7447e7ce1a11607345b292","title":"why a black couple on love island has caused a happy hysteria","story":"British media is reluctant to feature one black person in a romantic relationship, let alone two. No wonder Leanne Amaning and Mike Boateng are trendingBlack Twitter is all aflutter about Love Island’s Leanne Amaning and Mike Boateng, the show’s first black couple. The lovebirds have had the hashtag #BlackLove trending, their his’n’hers durag and wig cap combo have delighted viewers and many a meme of their imagined traditional Ghanaian wedding has been mocked up. All this and it has not even been a fortnight.The hysteria over the budding romance perhaps looks excessive. But the #BlackLove hashtag long predates their dating and for good reason: it is something the media is not particularly invested in portraying, especially in the UK. This is why H\u0026ampM’s campaign featuring the footballer Raheem Sterling, his black fiancee, Paige Milian, and their children was a welcome gift when it landed last Christmas. It has been more than 30 years since the black British sitcom Desmond’s first aired, and while the US continues to roll out family sitcoms such as Black-ish and its spin-offs, Grown-ish and Mixed-ish, we aren’t much closer to our own “Black Brit-ish” equivalent. When attempting to portray erse couples, the media is hesitant to feature one black person, let alone two interracial romance being seen as able to depict aspiration in a way that a black couple – without a white participant – isn’t.Boateng and Amaning are not the first black contestants on the show, but the fact that they have chosen each other is of note, given research shows most races have an overall preference for white partners.When watching the recouplings through my fingers at 9pm, I often wonder what it must be like to enjoy these types of programmes as a white Brit. For black viewers, everything is personal: from Trevor McDonald on News at Ten to Makosi’s stint on Big Brother, the actions of black people on television have always been bigger than the inidual. Boateng and Amaning aren’t simply another good-looking couple, but community mascots. We will know black love is being consistently represented when black Love Islanders coupling up and splitting up is met with the same indifference as the others. Until then, the fate of #BlackBritishLove’s visibility rests on a 22- and 24-year-old, competing on the televised equivalent of freshers’ week, specifically engineered toward breaking up couples."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4aa8c068f8280797380389cdee026de5d319b7c5/0_127_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=3a4d961f46d60af7894c0bada587e180","title":"monarch butterfly population decline california coast","story":"Study finds 29,000 butterflies, compared with 4.5 million during the 1980s, as experts point to habitat destructionThe western monarch butterfly population wintering along California’s coast remains critically low for the second year in a row, a count by an environmental group released Thursday showed.The count of the orange-and-black insects by the Xerces Society, a not-for-profit environmental organization that focuses on the conservation of invertebrates, recorded about 29,000 butterflies in its annual survey. That’s not much different than last year’s tally, when an all-time low 27,000 monarchs were counted.“We had hoped that the western monarch population would have rebounded at least modestly, but unfortunately it has not,” said Emma Pelton, a monarch conservation expert with the Xerces Society.By comparison, about 4.5 million monarch butterflies wintered in forested groves along the California coast in the 1980s. Scientists say the butterflies are at critically low levels in the Western US due to the destruction of their milkweed habitat along their migratory route as housing expands into their territory and use of pesticides and herbicides increases.Researchers also have noted the effect of climate change. Along with farming, climate change is one of the main drivers of the monarch’s threatened extinction, disrupting an annual 3,000-mile migration synced to springtime and the blossoming of wildflowers.Western monarch butterflies head south to California each winter, returning to the same sites and even the same trees where they cluster to keep warm. The monarchs generally arrive in California at the beginning of November and spread across the country once warmer weather arrives in March.On the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains, another monarch butterfly population travels from southern Canada and the north-eastern United States across thousands of miles to spend the winter in central Mexico. Mexican officials said last year the butterfly population wintering there was rebounding but they have not yet released this year’s count.A 2017 study by Washington State University researchers found the species will probably go extinct in the next few decades if nothing is done to save it.The monarch is now under government consideration for listing under the US Endangered Species Act. The decision on whether the butterfly will be listed as threatened is expected by December.While helping the western butterflies could seem daunting, Pelton said the fact that the population had not shrunk any further is encouraging.Pelton said people could help by planting early-blooming flowers and milkweed to fuel migrating monarchs on their paths to other states.The Xerces Society is working with the state of California to protect the butterflies’ wintering sites and develop new sites in state parks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80ec5ba4011a30673f682a845f97cc2c902ced87/0_0_5256_3155/master/5256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0941d2ff5a10821c8ba608fbcf9aa7c","title":"us drinking water contamination forever chemicals pfas","story":"Highest levels of PFAS in Miami, Philadelphia and New Orleans, report by environmental watchdog findsThe contamination of US drinking water with manmade “forever chemicals” is far worse than previously estimated with some of the highest levels found in Miami, Philadelphia and New Orleans, said a report on Wednesday by an environmental watchdog group.The chemicals, resistant to breaking down in the environment, are known as perfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. Some have been linked to cancers, liver damage, low birth weight and other health problems.The findings here by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) show the group’s previous estimate in 2018, based on unpublished US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data, that 110 million Americans may be contaminated with PFAS, could be far too low.“It’s nearly impossible to avoid contaminated drinking water from these chemicals,” said David Andrews, a senior scientist at EWG and co-author of the report.The chemicals were used in products like Teflon and Scotchguard and in firefighting foam. Some are used in a variety of other products and industrial processes, and their replacements also pose risks.Of tap water samples taken by EWG from 44 sites in 31 states and Washington DC, only one location, Meridian, Mississippi, which relies on 700ft (215m) deep wells, had no detectable PFAS. Only Seattle and Tuscaloosa, Alabama had levels below 1 part per trillion (PPT), the limit EWG recommends.In addition, EWG found that on average six to seven PFAS compounds were found at the tested sites, and the effects on health of the mixtures are little understood. “Everyone’s really exposed to a toxic soup of these PFAS chemicals,” Andrews said.In 34 places where EWG’s tests found PFAS, contamination had not been publicly reported by the EPA or state environmental agencies.The EPA has known since at least 2001 about the problem of PFAS in drinking water but has so far failed to set an enforceable, nationwide legal limit. The EPA said early last year it would begin the process to set limits on two of the chemicals, PFOA and PFOS.The EPA said it has helped states and communities address PFAS and that it is working to put limits on the two main chemicals but did not give a timeline.In 2018 a draft report from an office of the US Department of Health and Human Services said the risk level for exposure to the chemicals should be up to 10 times lower than the 70 PPT threshold the EPA recommends. The White House and the EPA had tried to stop the report from being published."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3182adf50ec00a1f41c14ac1d6d103f2ae796cd7/0_14_2018_2963/master/2018.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=da15437e67618c1b22e02d6539d8f34f 1320w","title":"part of my psyche is forever pythonesque readers tributes to terry jones","story":"The Monty Python founder and Life of Brian director has died at the age of 77.

He was also the Python credited for inspiring the team’s consistent surrealist denial of conventional structure. It was Jones who took on the directing role for the Monty Python movies: sharing the credit with Terry Gilliam for Monty Python and the Holy Grail in 1975, but taking the helm on his own for their masterpiece, Monty Python’s Life of Brian, in 1979, and the rather more patchy Monty Python’s The Meaning of Life in 1983. His parallel and post-Python career was successful: with Michael Palin, he created the much-loved Ripping Yarns for BBC TV and wrote well-regarded popular books on medieval and classical history.But Jones’s face is stamped indelibly on my mind for the creation of two movie characters – one good, one horribly evil.In Life of Brian, he played Mandy, the woman who is at first mistaken by the three wise men for the Virgin Mary, and whose son Brian is, in adulthood, to be fatefully mistaken for the Son of God. Jones’s Mandy is one of his classic dressing-up-as-a-panto-dame roles, and yet he invests this tetchy, bewildered, cantankerous sketch character with a weird innocence, and her sayings live on in popular culture. As the mob of Brian’s deluded followers gather outside her humble dwelling, Mandy says, “He’s not the Messiah, he’s a very naughty boy!” and “There’s a mess here, but no Messiah!” These are lines that have been endlessly revived by headline writers and commentators, forever being used to puncture the hubris of politicians and sports stars. It is something in the lines’ simplicity. The messMessiah play on words is so simple, the sort of lame dad joke that a regular civilian might make, not an Oxbridge wit.Jones’s other claim to movie fame is a horrifying monster: Mr Creosote, the grotesquely fat glutton in The Meaning of Life who shows up in a posh French restaurant, presided over by John Cleese’s oleaginous maitre d’. Mr Creosote clears his palate by vomiting convulsively everywhere and then proceeds to eat himself to an explosion, the trigger being a final, incautious “waffer-thin” mint, and is shockingly still alive at the end, his stomach and ribcage wrenched open. Mr Creosote was co-created by Jones and Palin, and rewritten by Cleese and Graham Chapman, and his aggressive greed has become legendary – a meme before there was any social media to fit it into. And people forget the final, horrible thing about Jones’s creation: amid the blood, intestines and sick that have washed all over the floor, Jones reappears as an antisemitic cleaning lady mopping it up, musing that, whatever else has happened, at least she doesn’t “work for Jews”.What on earth does Mr Creosote mean? Is he a satire of greed? The arrogance of the rich? Maybe. The important thing is that his horrible aggression is indulged by the maitre d’, who is indifferent to the other, more polite but evidently less important diners who are upset, but know that they mustn’t make a fuss. Importantly, the restaurant is a traditional theatre of British embarrassment – like the Fawlty Towers dining room – a place where generations of postwar Britons were terrified that they would show themselves up as unsophisticated, or be humiliated by the waiters, or get served bad food and be too scared to complain. If you’ve ever felt uncomfortable in a restaurant, Mr Creosote is your worst nightmare and your greatest hero: the guy who spectacularly destroys all those painful little snob rules about fine dining. Or maybe Mr Creosote is just there to gross us out for the sake of it: a British La Grande Bouffe.After Python, Jones undertook a number of projects for film and television, including writing and directing a well-received, all-star movie version of The Wind in the Willows, starring himself as Mr Toad, Steve Coogan as Mole, Eric Idle as Rat and Nicol Williamson as Badger.But, for me, his most startling directorial outing outside Python was a bizarre film that only gets more bizarre in retrospect – Personal Services (1987), written by David Leland (who went on to write Wish You Were Here starring Emily Lloyd). It is the story of a brothel-keeper inspired by the case of Cynthia Payne, whose prosecution for her suburban BDSM establishment with its alleged top-drawer clientele caused much giggling in the press. The film stars Julie Walters as Christine and Danny Schiller plays her “maid” – weirdly, just the kind of drag role that Jones might have created for a Python sketch. The sheer tackiness and nastiness of Personal Services is what is striking now, not its alleged comedy-romp value. It’s like Britain’s last kitchen-sink movie, a film that focuses on pure domestic drear.I last saw Jones on stage in the summer of 2014, in London’s O2 Arena, when he took part in Monty Python Live (Mostly), their hugely lucrative reunion show. I remember being awestruck and even slightly tearful to see the old gang together. Jones’s illness was said to be advanced at that stage, but to me he looked absolutely sharp. He radiated innocence and fun."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e4b96fbb8e4f29ea38dbd5da1f114357dc24439/0_0_6908_4145/master/6908.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb7badffb01d99353775ae2d25d549d9","title":"maths experts secret perfect espresso","story":"It’s all in the grind, say mathematicians who turned to equations to solve mysteryWhat’s the secret of the perfect espresso? It’s a question that has long troubled cafe owners around the world, but now mathematicians say they have worked out the formula for achieving the perfect brew – and it all comes down to the daily grind.“There is a common experience, particularly for people making coffee in their homes, and baristas as well, that you brew two espressos one after the other, you use the same ground coffee and seemingly you brew it in exactly the same way, yet the two shots can taste quite different to one another,” said Dr Jamie Foster at Portsmouth University, a co-author of the research.But by using coffee that is ground coarser than usual, Foster and colleagues say there is less variation from cup to cup – a switch that also brings other benefits: it is faster, cheaper, and produces less waste.Writing in the journal Matter, Foster and colleagues report how they set out to explore how to optimise coffee making by developing mathematical equations to model the processes occurring in the bed of coffee as water is forced through when making an espresso.The team found that for a given water temperature and pressure, the model suggested that the finer the grind, the greater the proportion of coffee that ends up dissolved in the water.Foster said, intuitively that made sense: “If the little chunks making up the bed of coffee are smaller then there is more surface area for the water to come into contact with.”That would mean to reduce waste and produce the most efficient coffee, cafes should grind their coffee as fine as possible.However when the team carried out tests with a coffee machine in a real cafe, they found that at very fine grinds the model broke down beyond a certain point..The team says that leads to differences in the extraction yield from different areas of the coffee bed, and variation from cup to cup as different sized parts of the bed can clog up each time. That variability is reflected in the flavour: a higher “extraction yield” is typically more bitter, while lower makes for a more sour cup.“The key to making the shot reproducible is you want the particles just large enough that the flow is uniform and predictable, but as small as they can be to maximise the surface area,” said Foster.Crucially, he added, cafes typically use coffee that is ground too finely, meaning the taste is unpredictable.Foster and colleagues add that by grinding slightly more coarsely, the barista can subsequently lower the mass of coffee used for each shot – or the amount of water passing through it – to get the desired taste more consistently and at lower cost.But while there appears to be a sweet spot for grinding, quite what that is can vary – something Foster said means coffee-making remains something of an art.“A barista chooses the temperature and the pressure and the beans to make it taste the way they like, and then you make the extraction reproducible and efficient by fiddling with the grind setting,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/003071a354fb4a14fdb811bce3d594c43869ae74/0_94_3165_1899/master/3165.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac9de8c9bf1be2a50e534f00f928d0c4","title":"leicester west ham premier league match report","story":"Leicester got back their mojo but lost their talisman when Jamie Vardy limped off with a glute injury. “He’s a fantastic player and really important for us but you’re never going to succeed if you rely on just one player,” Brendan Rodgers said.The absence of the Premier League’s top scorer certainly did not matter against a dishevelled West Ham, as Leicester strutted to their first league win since New Year’s Day owing to two goals by Ayoze Pérez and one each by Harvey Barnes and Ricardo Pereira. Their position in the top four looks secure, with this result leaving them 14 points clear of fifth-place Manchester United.As for West Ham, a successful penalty by Mark Noble gave them fleeting hope of scrounging a point but they left with what they deserved, which was nothing other than a reminder that they need to get their act together quickly if they are to avoid being overtaken by at least one of only three teams below them in the league.David Moyes admitted he was “extremely disappointed” and he knows the fixture list offers no imminent respite, with West Ham’s next four leagues games including two against Liverpool and one against Manchester City. “The Premier League always throws up surprises and we have to be looking to make one of those shocks happen,” said Moyes, whose team were a different kind of shocking at the King Power Stadium.The previous meeting between these teams, just last month in London, led to the dismissal of Moyes’ predecessor, Manuel Pellegrini. The latest one offered more evidence that Moyes has a big job on his hands, as West Ham were, in his own words, “very poor,” especially in a first half in which their only response to Leicester’s vibrant start was an indecipherable blather.Leicester came into the game in stuttering form, having lost their previous two matches. Rodgers made two alterations to the lineup who began Sunday’s defeat by Burnley, with Ben Chilwell and Youri Tielemans coming back into the side. Wilfred Ndidi’s amazingly fast recovery from knee surgery was confirmed by his presence on the bench – “he’s genetically blessed,” said Rodgers, who had to throw on the Nigerian earlier than planned because Nampalys Mendy hobbled off with knee trouble after half an hour.Leicester were a goal up by then thanks to a fast start in which they fizzed with the intensity they had lacked in recent games. “We got our authority and personality back,” Rodgers said. Barnes created and scored the breakthrough goal, receiving the ball at the edge of the D before slipping it to Pereira and dashing towards the six-yard box in the hope of a return pass. Pereira’s dink over the advancing Darren Randolph might have reached the net without assistance but Barnes prodded the ball over the line just to make sure, claiming his third goal in four matches.West Ham’s guileless play suggested they would only get back into this game if Leicester lapsed into complacency or if their whole team were struck down by injuries.Vardy, as it happened, soon had to limp off but Leicester increased their lead before the break, Barnes scampering down the left before pulling back a cross for Pereira, who drove a fierce shot into the bottom corner from 15 yards.Moyes made a double substitution at half-time and West Ham at last carried a vague threat but they needed an intervention from the referee to make a breakthrough. In the 48th minute, West Ham were awarded a penalty when Ndidi and Sébastien Haller made a wholesome challenge for the ball and the striker fell to the ground. Noble applied dubious justice from the spot.After moderate pressure from the visitors, Leicester roared back. Tielemans, Barnes and James Maddison all went close before Angelo Ogbonna brought down Kelechi Iheanacho in the 79th minute. Pérez converted the penalty, and doubled his tally stylishly two minutes from time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82ec7cc543fa803cde416b586ac039cf9eead6a4/0_213_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=798e515733627654e6cd9af05916cf2d","title":"manchester city financial fair play breaches 2012 13 accounting sponsorships uefa champions league","story":"• Accounting rejected and £118.75m of sponsorships questioned• City could face Champions League ban in second Uefa inquiryManchester City were found to have made inadmissible submissions to Uefa over financial fair play in 2014 and were reported for not making their bank statements available, the  can reveal.City’s submissions for the 2012 and 2013 financial years were questioned in relation to £118.75m in sponsorships from companies in Abu Dhabi, the home state of the club’s owner, and their accounting methods over transfer fees and the formation of two new companies were rejected.Almost £60m was added to the club’s losses by the European game’s governing body as a result of findings relating to accounting methods, the ’s investigation can reveal.The findings against City were made by consultants appointed by Uefa in spring 2014 to delve further into the accounts the club submitted.  can reveal Uefa concluded City had made losses totalling approximately €180m in 2012 and 2013, vastly exceeding the €45m FFP maximum deficit allowed, provided those losses were covered by an owner.Uefa’s first inquiry into City over FFP has been known about for six years. So too has the deal which City eventually and reluctantly agreed with Uefa to limit their transfer spending. But the detail of the process, revealed today by the , has never officially been made public. understands that within Uefa there were people who believed the regulations should have been more strictly enforced in 2014 and one staff member working on FFP is said to have left shortly after the settlement was agreed.The exposure of these details has come as a second investigation into City’s FFP compliance, sparked by revelations in November 2018, is nearing completion.The Abu Dhabi sponsorships became bitterly contested issues in November 2018 when Der Spiegel published “leaked” internal City emails and documents which suggested the club’s owner, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, was largely funding the Etihad sponsorship deal himself, unknown to Uefa.The “adjudicatory chamber” of Uefa’s Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) is understood to be hearing the charges made against the club this week.If its panel finds the charges proven it could ban City from the Champions League, the trophy the club has most coveted since the start of Mansour’s £1.3bn project and transformational 2016 appointment of Pep Guardiola as manager. City are certain to appeal against any adverse finding to the court of arbitration for sport.In 2014 European football’s governing body was led by the now Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, and leaks published in 2018 by Der Spiegel appear to show he was personally involved in the settlement.The club risked severe sanctions for the scale of its deficit including possible exclusion from the Champions League, yet a controversial settlement was agreed in May 2014. City vehemently objected to the process and the conclusions, and were seriously threatening legal action against FFP, arguing that the break-even principle could be considered unlawful.The consultants reported to Uefa that City had not provided them with bank statements so that the payments, including from the sponsoring companies, could clearly be seen, the  understands.City did make available their online bank account, which went back 12 months to the spring of 2013, but that did not cover 2012 or most of the 2013 financial year, which together constituted the first accounting period of Uefa’s FFP regulations.City are understood to have replied that the paper bank statements were not accessible to the club’s management at the time the consultants came to Manchester. The club’s hierarchy suggested to Uefa that the consultants could have made further requests for statements before highlighting that they had not been provided.The consultants are also understood to have reported to Uefa that some multimillion-pound sponsorship contracts with Abu Dhabi companies had not been signed. City dismissed that as an issue, telling Uefa that they also had contracts with non-Abu Dhabi sponsors which had not been signed, and that it was clear the deals had been done because the sponsorships were being fulfilled.The FFP regulations, introduced in 2010-11, were aimed at dampening players’ wage inflation and encouraging European clubs not to make huge losses. Under FFP losses cannot be reduced by owners putting more millions in via excessive commercial partnerships with companies related to them.City were taken over by Sheikh Mansour of the Abu Dhabi ruling family in 2008 and he with his executives instantly transformed the club’s finances and ambitions.City faced a severe challenge to comply with the €45m loss limit when the club’s spending was escalating dramatically, with the multiple signings of star players City’s sponsorships with the Abu Dhabi entities were examined closely by the CFCB.In 2011 City’s sponsorship by the Abu Dhabi state airline Etihad was converted into a 10-year deal, to include the stadium, and by 2013, after City had won the Premier League for the first time, it is understood to have gone up to £67.5m a year. The deals with three other entities from Abu Dhabi are understood to have been £15m a year from the investment firm Aabar, £16.5m from the telecommunications giant Etisalat, and £19.75m from the Abu Dhabi Tourism Authority.In 2014 Uefa’s consultants, reported to be PwC, are understood to have advised the CFCB that Aabar and Etisalat were “related parties” to City because Mansour was the chairman of the investment funds which owned them. After further research Uefa was also advised that Etihad should be considered a related sponsor because of relationships of Mansour’s with members of the extended ruling family involved in the airline.City have strenuously rejected the conclusion that Etihad or the other two companies are related to City under the rules, arguing Uefa needed to show Mansour had substantial influence over their management, not just that he was the chairman of the funds owning them.Uefa is understood to have asked specialist sponsorship consultants to consider whether the money being paid to City by the Abu Dhabi companies was “fair value”. The Etihad deal is thought not to have been considered too excessive.In the ultimate settlement agreed with Uefa City committed “not to seek to improve” the value of two of the secondary sponsorships, which were not named, and Uefa is thought to have agreed not to press the argument that the companies are related.In relation to transfer fees the consultants added £31m to City’s deficit after rejecting allowances City had claimed for the cost of players signed before June 2010. The rules allowed a club to take off the wages of players signed before FFP was introduced but not the transfer fees.City are understood to have argued fiercely that despite Uefa issuing guidance that such annual accounting for transfer fees, known as amortisation, was not an allowance for FFP, the rules did not exclude it.A further £28m was put on to the club’s deficit by Uefa’s consultants regarding the formation in January 2013 of two companies, City Football Services and City Football Marketing. The companies were to provide resources including scouting, analysis and marketing to the group of clubs worldwide which Sheikh Mansour was intending to buy. City submitted that the club had in effect sold the companies, receiving approximately £11m for each, and that the companies had taken around £6m of staff costs off the club’s payroll.City argued strongly that this was a legitimate way of accounting for the companies but the CFCB’s consultants are understood to have concluded that it should not be allowed.Under a settlement with Uefa City undertook to repay €20m from the 2013-14 Champions League revenues, have a European squad limit of 21, constrain transfer spending, not increase their wage bill until 2016 and make a maximum €30m loss for 2014 and 2015. City’s chairman, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, made clear publicly that he disagreed with Uefa and the settlement but argued that given the club’s success they would comply with the break-even rules after 2014.Etihad, Etisalat, Aabar and the Abu Dhabi Tourism and Culture Authority did not respond to emailed questions from the  about the sponsorship contracts. Etihad has previously stated that the City sponsorship is the airline’s “sole liability and responsibility,” and that it “continues to deliver important ongoing and accumulative returns on our investments”.Uefa declined to comment in response to any questions about the 2014 assessment and settlement, or the current proceedings.A spokesperson for City said: “The 2014 settlement agreement resolved all open matters between the parties and was based on comprehensive information disclosure. The settlement agreement contains confidentiality provisions that prevent Manchester City from commenting on both the agreement and the investigation that it settled.“It continues to be our position that we will not be providing any comment on out-of-context materials. The attempt to damage the club’s reputation is organised and clear.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dab10d1b583788a343c3b6bbadd42eabbf3713ca/0_88_3416_2050/master/3416.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1342645bc965d3166183969bf2c324ba","title":"manchester united burnley premier league match report","story":"Burnley have a famous first win at Manchester United since 1962 and Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side must again regroup somehow. This was a defeat that spoke of their deep callowness and their inability to turn possession into goals.Burnley were sharper at the business end of the pitch, leaving United to rue a chance to close the gap to fourth-placed Chelsea to three points. Instead the deficit is six and United’s one-step forward, one-step back form continues.During a torrid evening there were anti-Glazer and anti-Ed Woodward chants from a Stretford End seriously disgruntled at the owners and executive vice-chairman. There were songs in support of Solskjær but the bottom line is that this was a new nadir in a rocky season.Solskjær had spoken of bouncing back from Sunday’s defeat at Liverpool and a slick move involving Andreas Pereira, Anthony Martial and Juan Mata ended with a Fred shot during a bright start. But, really, this was the first sign of United’s lack of bite. Daniel James slipped in along the left and won a corner. Next Brandon Williams switched the ball to Aaron Wan-Bissaka from the same corridor, whose cross deserved better control from Pereira.As they did in last month’s reverse fixture United were controlling the ball and, apparently, the contest. Sean Dyche’s men seemed content to sit deep and back themselves to defend better than United could attack.When Solskjær’s side picked up the pace Burnley struggled but this only occurred sporadically. The only peril United were in at this juncture was of complacency but when Mata then Fred took aim at Nick Pope’s goal they seemed to be up to the task.Moments later they were warned, though, in what was a dress rehearsal for Burnley’s opener. Chris Wood was able to take aim following a free-kick punted into United’s area by Dwight McNeil which was headed on by Ben Mee. While the No 9 could not score, David de Gea was left furious at his defence, whose aerial vulnerability led to Liverpool’s first goal at Anfield at the weekend.There was an equal lack of focus when Mata hit a shot from close range against his other leg: a surprise from a technically accomplished footballer. Far better was when Wan-Bissaka once more crossed the ball in and James rose, but his header was tipped over by Pope. Then, Nemanja Matic’s diagonal ball was allowed to run past by Mata and suddenly Martial had the goal before him. But a heavy touch allowed Charlie Taylor to intervene and so the Frenchman spurned the game’s clearest chance.Burnley were about to strike with a route-one special. Ashley Westwood pinged in a free-kick from halfway, Mee beat Matic to the header and Wood finished first-time past De Gea. Having been on the ropes here was a classic one-two counter that had Burnley fans gleefully singing about “anti-football”.By the interval there had been the first angry chants from the home fans and the manager had serious work to do. Solskjær reacted by replacing the misfiring Pereira with the 18-year-old striker Mason Greenwood. He then saw Williams take out Mee who inadvertently felled De Gea. The latter two were able to recover but the question was whether United could find a spark that had so far been missing in front of goal.The answer would prove to be a resounding no. Burnley were confident: Taylor and Jack Cork exchanged passes near United’s right corner flag, hemming them in. The sense was that having gone ahead the Clarets would fight ever harder to keep their opponents out.James has not scored since August and has struggled to be a creative factor all season. The latest illustration came when he breached Burnley’s backline only to produce an aimless pass that ultimately led to an easy clearance.There was nothing simple about Burnley’s second goal from Jay Rodriguez. With Harry Maguire off the pace – not for the first time in a United shirt – the striker fashioned a one-two with Wood before firing in a finish that rifled past De Gea at his near-post and ricocheted in off the bar. Cut to Solskjær rooted to his seat and the sense that United were slipping into disarray.“Stand up if you hate Glazers” chanted the Stretford End. On the pitch a Greenwood turn drew a yellow card for Taylor before Solskjær introduced Luke Shaw and Jesse Lingard for Williams and James. Despite a few shots and a disallowed Shaw goal, United’s lack of ruthlessness told in the end.Next up for Solskjær is an FA Cup fourth-round tie against either Watford or Tranmere Rovers on Sunday afternoon. They dare not lose that match, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8206c336e3aa54a1bc8026f09495cc8885df023/305_244_4561_2737/master/4561.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=168bca339dc060581c4fec20feecae24","title":"spurs norwich premier league match report","story":"The best anyone can say of this Tottenham performance is that it was a winning one and had the effect of putting an unhappy run to bed. They had not scored a league goal in open play since Dele Alli’s winner against Brighton on Boxing Day so it was to some relief that the same player moved that conversation along.However, for long periods it looked like being the sole redeeming feature: they did not deserve to beat a Norwich side who belied their position at the bottom and merited at least a draw.That did not escape the attention of a home crowd that showed audible frustration at a largely insipid night’s work. Norwich had equalised through Teemu Pukki’s penalty and were threatening more when Giovani Lo Celso, Spurs’ best player, slipped in Alli on the right-hand side of the area. The resulting cross-shot ricocheted off Christoph Zimmermann and looped up towards the one place Norwich could ill afford. Son Heung-min, standing virtually on the goalline at the far post, nodded in the winner that will not make it into the end-of-career scrapbook and peace could break out from the brink of small-scale mutiny.“How can we change the game? With the family spirit, the family character and desire,” José Mourinho said, referencing a general fatigue among his players and a lack of attacking options on the bench. “The 1-1 was obviously a bit scary for everybody connected with us. We didn’t want to lose points but then the reaction was very good. I saw players really tired but going over their limits to try to give us the points.”Whatever earned Spurs the win, nobody could attribute it to superior technique or cohesion. After surviving two close efforts from Érik Lamela early on it was Norwich who imposed those qualities for much of the night. A typically slick interplay with Todd Cantwell offered Pukki the kind of opportunity he usually gobbles up but this time the striker sidefooted wide, ensuring Hugo Lloris was not extended after returning ahead of schedule from his elbow injury.Alli promptly delivered at a time when Spurs were toiling, although Norwich should never have offered the chance. They had cleared their lines after a dangerous burst from Serge Aurier only for Cantwell to be dispossessed, ultimately allowing Son to tee up Aurier for a cross Alli finished on the run.Cantwell had a fine game beyond that aberration but diced with danger shortly after half-time when he slid in zealously to win possession and, in the follow-through, felled Lamela. He survived two minutes of VAR investigation and a booking sufficed moments later he inadvertently caught Harry Winks after the midfielder had blocked his effort and the outcome will have consequences for Spurs. Winks had to be substituted after sustaining an ankle injury the good news was that he was able to depart the stadium in trainers and Mourinho said the problem was “not a crazy one, hopefully weeks and not months”.The tension increased when Pukki squeezed his 70th-minute penalty, whose award was confirmed by VAR after Ryan Sessegnon clipped Max Aarons, past Lloris.Christian Eriksen’s introduction had been met with a few boos and they grew louder when he knocked an attempted pass out of play. The manner of his long goodbye is helping no one. Those jeers were aimed more widely when Cantwell shot over after another slick Norwich attack but, almost in the next breath, they became roars when Son converted against the run of play.“We won’t give up, we will try until the last to work on this little miracle,” said Daniel Farke, whose team is arguably one of the best in recent memory to be six points adrift of safety. The little details have cost them all season but they have a fan in Mourinho, who told Farke that Norwich deserve “a happy ending” in May.Mourinho had already enjoyed one of his own, for this particular night. He may be even more satisfied if Spurs complete a deal for the Real Sociedad striker Willian José. They look far from convincing but the Tottenham “family”, a word he continually returned to, can all get along for now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fe863e1953943bc4f3ba43a1a0b3231ae136cce/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=adb0d49b19e1da0936bd1a62b6b545eb","title":"i was living a secret life the agonising rise of women gamblers","story":"The number of women who report a gambling problem has been rising at double the rate of men. It is used as an escape from stress and pain – but the debt can be catastrophicNancy gambled away the £3,000 her father had saved up for his own funeral. It’s the thing she feels most ashamed of having done during her four-year addiction to online gambling. At the time, however, she barely thought twice about what she had done.“Female gambling addicts are just as bad as men. We will get money wherever we can and gamble it all away immediately,” she says. “The extraordinary thing is that during my addiction, no one suspected a thing. I was gambling online for hours every day. I’d sit down on the settee with my phone in the early evening and the next thing I knew, it was 3am. I hadn’t moved except to press the same button again and again to work the slots. But my bank account would be empty.”Nancy would never have gone into a bookies or an arcade. “I would never have even begun betting if I hadn’t been able to do it secretly, on my phone,” she says. “I had hundreds of different online gambling accounts. When I ran out of credit on one, I’d just go to another site and open a new one. I had five credit cards, multiple loans and loads of high-interest payday loans. I was entirely enslaved by gambling.”By the time Nancy sought help she had spent £75,000 on gambling and was £25,000 in debt. She used up all her savings, wages and any other money she could lay her hands on. “It’s impossible for a rationally healthy person to understand, but I was in this bubble and couldn’t escape,” she says. “It was all I thought about: gambling and how to pay back my debts. I remember one Wednesday, getting home from work and crying and shaking in the kitchen because I knew I had to gamble. I was a slave to whatever game I was playing.”Despite her obsession, Nancy didn’t show a single outward sign of not being entirely in control. Even today, only her two best friends know what she has been through. She can’t bear to tell her new husband. “I’m a very intelligent, sensible, caring person so it’s hard to say why I did what I did. But the fact it can happen to me means it could happen to anyone.”Eventually, Nancy went to see a health worker about a different issue and broke down. “All it took was for the counsellor to ask: ‘What do you do for fun?’ and it was all bought home to me: where had I gone? Why was I doing these things?” She went to an NHS counsellor and GamCare and is now in recovery.Ian Semel leads Breakeven, a charity supporting gambling addicts in the UK. He believes that the latest figures hide the true number of female problem gamblers, because so few reach out for help. “There’s such a stigma for women gamblers,” he says. “Society has very clear gender roles for women and expectations that they’ll be the caregivers.” To breach this risks “judgment, exposure, shame and guilt”, he says.Liz Karter is a therapist specialising in gambling addiction in women. She says the way women gamble is very different to men. “At Gamblers Anonymous meetings, the men were telling women they weren’t proper gamblers because they weren’t doing it for the rush and the winnings,” she says. Instead, “women gamble to escape, soothe, reduce stress and distract themselves”.“For women, gambling soothes them and numbs pain,” says Dr Henrietta Bowden-Jones, a consultant psychiatrist at Nightingale hospital in London who specialises in addiction. “Sometimes they begin gambling as a result of bereavement or because they’re a carer for someone they love, and it’s an overwhelming responsibility for them,” she says. “Many women won’t seek help because they’re afraid of having their children taken away. Many have embezzled or stolen money and fear prison if they’re discovered,” she adds.Typically, women begin gambling later in life than men, but their problems develop more quickly – which experts believe may be because they tend to choose quick, high-stakes games such as online slots and bingo.Kerri Nicholls, 37, had never gambled before she and her partner started making £1 online bets on the football games they loved to watch together. “It began as a way to make the games more interesting,” she says.Then the site they used gave her £200 of free bets (“Except, of course, those bets turned out not to be free they came with financial strings,” she says). “It was fun at first but then my partner went back to university and I was stuck, in a not-great job, in a not-great new flat. Because my partner was at uni, I felt I needed to earn more money for us and gambling seemed like a good way to do that,” she says.Within six months of making her first £1 bet, Kerri was gambling daily. “It had stopped being fun by then. I was chasing my losses. It had become an emotional thing. I was addicted,” she says. Kerri was betting increasing sums of money and suddenly found herself seriously in debt. “Having gone through counselling, I now know that I was using gambling to escape my other problems,” she says. “I felt neglected and gambling replaced what I was missing. I could invest my time in it and distract myself from my thoughts and difficulties.”The addiction lasted five years, cost her £50,000 and was, she says, “literally a 24-hour thing. I was setting my phone to wake me up at night with notifications of matches being played around the world that I’d bet on. My partner, sleeping right next to me, didn’t notice a thing.“I don’t know how I still had a job. I used to get up from my desk constantly to take my phone outside and gamble. I used to gamble on my phone while sitting opposite my dad in restaurants.“It made me feel very lonely. I was living a separate, secret life that completely obsessed me and it seemed no one cared enough to even notice. That made me feel even more alone,” she says. “I’m mostly ashamed of the lies I told everyone. I’m a very honest person and it was scary that I could lie so well. They just rolled off my tongue.”When Kerri first tried to stop gambling, she managed only six weeks. “I thought that once I admitted it, it would get better. My dad paid off my £25,000 debt, but because I hadn’t addressed the underlying issues, him clearing my debt just meant I could start again. In no time at all, I had doubled the debt he had cleared.”Kerri was close to killing herself after a row over gambling with her mother, her partner and her partner’s mother. “I felt my life was crumbling around me. I had had thoughts about different ways of ending things a few days before. That day, my feelings of hopelessness escalated. I was in a daze. I didn’t want to be here any more. I couldn’t see how things could be turned around.”She was sitting on the edge of a canal when an elderly lady stopped and talked to her. She asked if Kerri was OK and it made something “snap back to normal” in her head. Kerri contacted GamCare and the gambling-addiction charity Gordon Moody Association and arranged weekly, remote counselling by video link. She attended Gamblers Anonymous meetings every week.“I’ve never gambled since,” she says. “I’ve handed my credit cards to my mum, got a phone with no internet access and stopped watching sports. The most important thing was to start talking to people about it. I’ve become very open and reflective. I no longer bottle things up.”Kerri wants to urge other women gamblers to ask for help. “To any gamblers out there, I’d say they should talk to someone. Ask for help because help is available – and it really does work.”Some names have been changed.

That means that we don’t know whether they work, what’s in them, or even how they should be cleaned.Online, it seems that a buyer’s good intentions (in this case, a desire to be more environmentally friendly, thrifty and less wasteful) can be easily exploited, because Google is the place where people with a lack of information go to find things. It’s not just Google: anyone who doesn’t live under a rock will have also noticed the endless stream of vaginal eggs, candles and other nonsense coming out of Gwyneth Paltrow lately. So as a service to you, we are correcting the record on some of the worst vaginal products out there.Vaginal tightening sticks can be bought in online stores such as Amazon, where you can also buy fake hymens – so basically, don’t use Amazon.These sticks promise to give you the perfect “toned, narrow, tight vagina”. That’s right, in 2020, focusing on what’s inside means goodbye toned abs, hello slender vagina. Which is why vagina weight-training is also now a thing.Vaginas come in a variety of sizes and shapes, and the tightness of one’s vagina has nothing to do with how much pleasure can be derived from it. If you really want to tighten your vagina, kegel exercises are free.There is an array of weed products for the vagina that can be found on the internet, including but not limited to: weed tampons, weed lube and weed vibrators. People often say that smoking weed can help people to relax and eases pain, heck, it can even be fun, apparently.But in news that will shock the whole internet: just because something is nice doesn’t mean you have to put it in your vagina. While the compound CBD that is found in weed has been shown to help with some chronic pain, this does not automatically translate to working when put in the vagina. So please, stop.People order at-home creams, go into spas, and get laser treatment to lighten the skin around their vaginas. Needless to say, it’s bad for you: bleaching your vaginal area can result in irritation, inflammation and infections like thrush and bacterial vaginosis.In case you didn’t know, oak galls are a little ball of bark created when a wasp deposits its larvae into an oak tree. Which leads to the natural question: why shouldn’t I put that in my vagina? Some con artists online have taken to convincing women to boil up oak gall into a paste and insert it, causing it to dry and tighten.According to gynecologist Dr Jen Gunter, drying out the vagina increases your chance of getting abrasions during sex, destroys the protective mucous layer in your vagina, and can cause havoc with its good bacteria. In a blogpost on oak galls, she writes: “This is a dangerous practice with real potential to harm. Here’s a pro-tip, if something burns when you apply it to the vagina it is generally bad for the vagina.”Not just that, but the idea that a dry, tight vagina is desirable is a frankly depressing sexual idea, and misinformation of the worst, most misogynistic kind.Most experts will tell you to avoid washing your vagina with soap, and yet there are rows of shelves in stores stacked with vaginal douching products. The vagina is a self-cleaning organ, and soap often disturbs its natural balance. “Vaginal pH is maintained by lactobacilli. Soaps, cleansers and douches will only hurt this bacteria, so they are all bad pH-wise,” Gunter wrote in a recent New York Times piece.Not only that, this disruption can result in bacterial infections such as bacterial vaginosis. Among other things, bacterial vaginosis can result in an unpleasant smell – probably the last thing that someone buying a vaginal cleaning product is hoping for."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/764cf8db1237b1f26f540c4efb93d644af69a30a/0_591_4572_2743/master/4572.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34d0f5430713ac54a6e119fefa8c372c","title":"the poo panacea inside the strange surprising world of faecal transplants","story":"When treating antibiotic-resistant infections, injecting patients with other people’s excrement can be highly effective. Could it be the answer to dementia, anorexia and obesity too?The man and woman are wearing blue hospital gowns and clear face shields. Dr James Sones and Dr Indu Srinivasan are in a room in the Division of Digestive Diseases at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson. They are about to create something that has spread through medicine like, well, a shitstorm.Sones takes a brown gloopy material and spoons it into what looks like a regular kitchen blender. The camera zooms in to a label on it: faecal blender. The brown gloopy stuff is, depending on your profession and level of politeness, faecal matter, stool, excrement or poo. It has been donated by a generous volunteer and it is almost certainly going to transform the life of the person who is going to receive it.Once blended and mixed with saline, the brown stuff is poured into large syringes and infused into a willing patient by colonoscopy. (Nasogastric tubes and enemas are other delivery methods.) In the UK, this treatment is available for patients suffering from repeated infections of Clostridium difficile or C diff.These bacteria can live harmlessly inside us. But in patients who are given strong antibiotics, C diff can survive, overwhelm a gut wiped of its microbiome, then secrete a toxin that causes severe pain, awful diarrhoea and vomiting. In the worst cases, it can be fatal. Even when vanquished by antibiotics, it can return except if the patient receives an infusion of poo, a procedure known as a faecal microbiota transplant (FMT).Human waste is a misnomer. What we excrete contains nutrients and bacteria, and it can be a useful fertiliser or fuel. That the bacteria it contains can also cure ailing guts was known by ancient Chinese writers, who wrote of “yellow soup” (assumed to have been liquidised excrement), which was used to treat food poisoning and bad diarrhoea.In 2013, Dutch researchers halted a randomised control trial – the gold standard of medical trials – because FMT was so much more effective than vancomycin. By 2014, the procedure was accepted enough that the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence issued guidelines allowing faecal transplants to be used in clinical practice, but only for C diff.Partly, there was a supply problem: where was the poo to come from? In the early years of FMT, patients were often infused with faecal material donated by a close relative or friend. Slowly, though, the concept of a stool donor emerged. Now, MTC is one of only two licensed stool banks in the UK, and in its first year of operation sent out 150 samples, at a cost of £650 for each 50ml.Donors are recruited by poster and word of mouth. Iqbal says they need to drop off their stools for 10 days in a row before 11am (so they have to be regular in more ways than one). Although MTC is next to Queen Elizabeth hospital, healthcare workers are excluded because they are exposed to too many bugs.What does a finished FMT sample look like? Does it smell? Iqbal looks at my coffee cup. “It’s the colour of latte.” And yes, of course it smells. “It’s shit.” Patients, he says, have no problem accepting the procedure. They won’t smell it, for a start, in a nasogastric tube or colonoscopy. And you can’t afford an ick factor when you are desperately ill.James Elliot, 50, a company director from Dudley, developed ulcerative colitis in his 30s. He would take antibiotics and be well, then relapse. His diarrhoea was so bad, he had to go to the toilet 50 times a day. Then Iqbal told him about FMT. Although he didn’t have C diff, he could get the procedure as part of a planned clinical trial into colitis and FMT.Because it is so simple and widely available and seems so miraculous, the use of FMT has long since departed from sterile medical establishments into home bathrooms and YouTube. If it transforms the microbiome so well for C diff, why shouldn’t it do it for other conditions? If the microbiome plays a part in all sorts of body functions from mood to metabolism, as research seems to show, why shouldn’t a dose of healthy poo sort out other problems, too?There are more than 300 clinical trials listed on clinicaltrials.gov that are using FMT to treat a range of conditions including autism, dementia, anorexia, and obesity. The most recent wants to explore FMT as a treatment for faecal incontinence (the inability to control bowel movements) in women.But Mark Wilcox, professor of medical microbiology at the University of Leeds, is circumspect. “The thing that’s common about FMT is that, wherever you are, there are particular enthusiasts, and in the US in particular. It’s a major fee-earning opportunity in the US. But it is, like it or not, an experimental procedure.”Animal trials have shown that conditions and pre-conditions can be transmitted with the faecal material. “There are data that gut bacteria play a role in gut cancers, blood pressure, diabetes, obesity. You can turn fat mice thin and thin mice fat by transplanting their gut bacteria. Because we don’t know the full roles of the gut microbiome, you are potentially transferring someone’s bacteria that have something to do with cancer, diabetes, obesity and so on.”Last year, two people participating in trials in the US contracted E Coli from faecal transplants – one died – because samples had not been tested for that pathogen. But even this news does not stop people who can’t get FMT on the NHS or can’t afford it in the US (where it can cost $1,000) from doing their own thing. Adrienne Grierson, an Australian film-maker based in London, describes herself as “an antibiotic child”. Since then she has suffered “terrible stomach troubles” including “cramps, doubling over, vomiting, diarrhoea, boiling hot flush, sweating, agony”.In 2015, stuck in bed, she turned to Google and discovered faecal transplants and the microbiome. “I thought, my God, I’ve been playing here with half a deck of cards. There’s only so much I can do with what I’ve destroyed.” She paid for 10 FMTs from a private clinic and “by the third day, it was like somebody had switched my brain on, like the antibiotics used to do. And that was a shock. I hadn’t thought that far ahead. I just wanted my guts to not fall out.”Since then, Grierson has had faecal transplants every three months or so, although now she does it DIY, at home. When we spoke, she had had a faecal infusion two days earlier, thanks to a friend. “She poops in a bag and I plop it on a sieve, a couple of scoops. Then I pour saline and I mash it through so I don’t get all the big particles. Then I suck it up through a syringe and pretend I’m at a clinic.”Grierson paid for her friend to be comprehensively screened when she first started donating. Now, she trusts her to be healthy. “If you do pick up other people’s characters and personalities, I really hope I get hers because she’s really lovely. I have zero history of cancer in my family. I don’t come from sickly people. The concerns are, what if I can get all of that from somebody? You have to decide: do you want to take a risk and live really well or do you want to keep on living like that?”Iqbal has a clinician’s reaction to DIY faecal transplants. “I think doing it yourself really needs to be a thing of the past. Because we don’t know what we’re doing, really.” Although metagenomic tests to analyse bacteria are now far more affordable, there are countless unknowns about FMT and the microbiome. “When you do metagenomics on stool samples,” says Iqbal, “you still find a whole bunch of stuff that is not in the databases. It’s very early days.”FMT has even made its way into popular culture with a mention in an episode of South Park. But it is exciting enough for serious money to be invested in improving upon it. Vedanta Biosciences, a large pharmaceutical company, is one of several working on developing a “rationally defined consortia of human microbiome-derived bacteria”. In other words, distilling the useful stuff from poo into a safe, commercial product that probably won’t be the colour of latte or mixed in a blender.Iqbal is convinced this will happen sooner rather than later. “FMT is too empirical,” he says. “We need to understand the mechanisms. I hope in five years’ time we won’t be doing FMT any more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88f2763f0efa8c50f2ec6b8255405575b2fc09d7/62_582_1513_908/master/1513.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb313e9571496990d6b5c3439fc2b017","title":"zoe brock my case against harvey weinstein podcast","story":"Like dozens of women in the entertainment industry, the actor, model and writer Zoë Brock has claimed she had a traumatic encounter with the film producer Harvey Weinstein.

Two years of parliamentary warfare over Brexit had left deep scars on the personal relationships that once formed the glue for Corbyn’s radical political project.Speaking to many of the leading figures in Labour’s election campaign, a picture emerges of tactical spats, mixed messages and frayed tempers – not least Corbyn’s own.Many of the senior players were the same as in 2017 – the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, chaired the daily 7.30am calls to set the agenda for the day ahead the policy chief, Andrew Fisher, oversaw the manifesto the former Corbyn aide Karie Murphy led the operational side of the campaign, and Milne was in charge of strategy and communications. Jennie Formby, handpicked by Corbyn to be Labour’s general secretary, oversaw management and budgets.Yet this group had been on different sides in the painful dispute about Labour’s Brexit stance – McDonnell and Fisher were instrumental in helping to persuade Corbyn that backing a second referendum was the only way of safeguarding the leftwing political movement they had built. By contrast, Milne and Murphy – as well as the Unite union’s chief of staff, Andrew Murray, and the Corbynite PR Steve Howell, both of whom sat on the election strategy group – believed that fateful decision would cost Labour dear in leave-supporting seats.And this difference of analysis continued to reverberate throughout the campaign. There was a strongly held perception in Labour’s HQ at the outset that Labour still had more work to do to pacify remain voters, after its switch to backing a second referendum.As for leave voters, many of whom were heavily concentrated in a swath of Labour-held seats being targeted by the Tories, the plan was to change the subject – focusing as much as possible on other issues, including public services and the NHS.“It felt like the People’s Vote campaign in there,” said one senior member of the campaign team, who recalled being warned, in respect of Labour leave voters: “We don’t want to prod the beast!”Howell, who had overseen Labour’s digital campaigning in 2017 and was brought in this time to look at targeting and polling, was alarmed by the prevalence of the view that Labour could win by focusing on remainers.He and other sceptics about Labour’s shift towards a referendum always felt it was fruitless to try to skirt the issue. “In the end, you can’t just fight a battle and ignore your opponent. You can’t just say: ‘We’re fighting at sea’, if your opponent is mounting a land invasion,” said one party strategist. Even Labour’s attack line on the NHS – focusing on the risk that it would be handed to Donald Trump as part of a trade deal – had an anti-Brexit undertone to it. And focusing on austerity, which still featured heavily in Corbyn’s stump speeches, was perhaps a less potent weapon against a Tory party that had ditched Philip Hammond’s rigid fiscal discipline.“That was one of the things that we were a bit caught on the hop about: Boris suddenly started throwing austerity overboard. He had deprived us of our core message,” said the adviser.Labour’s approach to targeting was almost a mirror image of 2017’s. Then, Corbyn and his lieutenants blamed the excessive caution of party officials for blunting their attacking edge.This time, they began with an ambitious list of 96 targets – 66 of which were attacking seats, and 30 defensive.That was partly because the job of any opposition is to get into government, and it would have appeared defeatist to target fewer seats than Labour needed for a majority.But the campaign team also hoped some of the magic that propelled them to such a close result in 2017 would spark the campaign into life again: the rousing rallies, Corbyn’s comfortable-in-his-own-skin authenticity, Tory missteps. “We were all too hypnotised by our achievement in 2017, and we thought that however bad the situation was, once the campaign got going we would catch up,” said one party source.Some events – including an upbeat launch at Battersea Arts Centre, and the unveiling of the manifesto at Birmingham City University, where Corbyn held the document triumphantly aloft against a dark pink backdrop – almost recaptured the buzz of two years earlier. But veterans of that election remarked that the crowds in 2019 were generally smaller this time, and failed to build as the weeks went on.Labour’s manifesto itself was a casualty of the fractious working relationships that dogged the campaign. Milne was widely viewed internally as the most important single decision-maker in the 2017 campaign. But this time, a day before the crucial clause V meeting at which the manifesto was to be signed off, he had not seen the final printed version.Key policies had been thrashed out in discussions, including among the strategy group – but Fisher’s policy team kept a firm hold on the finished document, and his relationship with Milne had been badly frayed by the Brexit battle.“No one really knew what was coming until it emerged, from a process only really accessible to Andrew Fisher and John McDonnell,” said one Labour source. “And so major policies were coming out – free broadband, Waspi women – which really nobody knew was coming.” But Labour’s policy wonks insist they were just doing what they could to fill the hole where they felt an electoral strategy should have been. Unlike in 2017, policy and strategy were working in silos.The general election was Fisher’s final job for Corbyn, after he resigned in September, with an email leaked to the Sunday Times in which he gave a blistering critique of Labour’s incompetence, including what he called “a blizzard of lies and excuses” about the party’s failure to come up with a strapline for its conference until the last minute.The same indecision dogged Labour’s election slogan. “It’s Time for Real Change” was meant as a riposte to Johnson’s phoney claim to be offering a fresh start for Britain, but was the outcome of a fraught debate, including external consultants and focus grouping, and as such was little loved by anyone.As the campaign went on, and anxiety increased at the risks Labour faced in defensive seats, “Labour Is On Your Side” took over – though one insider laments with hindsight that voters in leave seats who felt the party had betrayed them over Brexit appear to have been moved to respond with “fuck off”.The “grid”, overseen by the combative Murphy, and discussed at a 10am daily meeting, was packed with policy announcements: but there was scant sense of a theme or direction for each week or phase of the campaign.“They had all these policies drafted and waiting, and that would lead the grid – a different policy announcement every day,” said one member of the campaign team. “I think it was pretty obvious that there was a lot of throwing a lot of stuff at a lot of walls and hoping it would stick.”As the campaign went on, and reports flooded into the Victoria HQ from anxious candidates in defensive seats, those who had always believed Brexit was Labour’s overriding challenge felt increasingly vindicated – and alarmed.On Sunday 24 November, about halfway through, the strategy group met to review how things were going – and agreed it was necessary to make more of a pitch to leavers – and to resource defensive seats more generously.As a result, Howell recommended adding another 16 seats to the target list, and it was decided to ask Labour’s regional directors for more recommendations – a process that resulted in a further 21 seats being put on the list, taking the total to more than 130, though not all of those were fully resourced.The group also decided to focus more on Labour’s bread-and-butter offer to working-class voters in leave-supporting communities – including giveaways such as free prescriptions and social care – and to extend the party chairman Ian Lavery’s campaigning Brexit bus tour.But in the event, much of the following week was overshadowed by Labour’s record on tackling antisemitism. On Tuesday, as the party prepared to launch its race and faith manifesto, the Times splashed with a letter from the chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, claiming Corbyn’s handling of allegations of anti-Jewish racism meant he was “unfit for high office”.At the Bernie Grant Arts Centre in Tottenham that morning, Corbyn was more than half an hour late for the race and faith event, and the MP Dawn Butler filled the time by reciting the lyrics to the Labi Siffre classic (Something Inside) So Strong, to a bemused audience of hacks, who bombarded Labour aides with questions and requests. Until the last moment, it was unclear whether she and Corbyn would take questions from journalists.Later that day, the Labour leader recorded a pre-planned interview with Andrew Neil. Corbyn was at his most petulant, as the broadcaster challenged him to apologise over antisemitism, grumpily interjecting “will you let me finish?” – a clip of which found its way on to that week’s Have I Got News for You.Colleagues say that throughout the campaign Corbyn was keener to be personally involved in day-to-day decisions than in 2017 – and grumpier, sometimes even angry if he felt his views had been disregarded.Labour tried to use a moment of political theatre to seize back the agenda the next day, by staging a press conference where Corbyn dramatically held aloft a 400-plus page leaked dossier suggesting the government was ready to put the NHS up for sale. “These uncensored documents leave Boris Johnson’s denials in absolute tatters!” he cried.But the impact was nothing like the furore in 2017 when Labour’s manifesto was leaked – or when Theresa May insisted “nothing has changed”, after executing a swift U-turn on her social care policy. “It worked for a day, and we had a 36-hour row about whether Donald Trump was going to buy the NHS, but that was it,” said one insider.And as the strategy group tried to hone Labour’s message, focusing on a bread-and-butter offer to leavers, some began to fear Corbyn’s straight-from-the-heart, unscripted authenticity was not the best medium for delivering it. “It’s just Jeremy, isn’t it?” said one exasperated member of the campaign team. “You judge him on a different marking scheme, almost. Did this person in this stump speech hit the five key messages to get on the evening news? No. Was he ever going to? No. I went to rallies where there was a billboard and he didn’t say what was on the fucking billboard. He just talked about whatever he wanted.”As polling day loomed, some aides would have liked Corbyn to make more aggressive attacks on Johnson, whose loose relationship with the truth was openly laughed at by the Question Time audience when the pair met in a head-to-head debate. But “no personal attacks” was one of the rules written for Corbyn’s 2015 leadership campaign by Fisher, and he stuck to it doggedly.The Labour leader told the  at the outset of the campaign, “they go low, we go high” – though one despairing party aide described it as “they go low, we go wandering across the country”.After six gruelling weeks of criss-crossing the country, including a dawn rally in Glasgow on the final day of campaigning, Corbyn watched the grim exit poll with his wife, Laura, his fiercely loyal sons – who released a statement shortly afterwards lambasting the media for treating him badly – and a few officials, including Milne.They had been on a long journey together, from the political wilderness to the brink of government, but they believed their electoral chances had been crushed, in what one rueful Labour source called, “the Brexit vice”.“This campaign was lost before it began,” the source added. “Even if nothing had gone wrong in terms of targeting, messaging, Jeremy’s schedule, TV interviews, anything – I still think we would not have won.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02b3d42fd9e16aa677ea9b1101b7dd7f2fee8a3b/0_162_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=243b2dfc5089cf08e2cd02e9a134a401","title":"has a member of your family applied for a different eu nationality","story":"We would like to hear from you if someone in your family has applied for another EU nationality because of BrexitHas a member of your family applied for a different EU nationality because they are resident in another member state and want to guarantee their rights, or because they have a birth right they never bothered with before Brexit?If so, we want to hear from you.

First her rival Jess Phillips pulled out of the Labour leadership contest and gave Nandy her backing. Then she picked up her third union nomination, ensuring she would make it through to the final ballot. But best of all she gave Piers Morgan a kicking on Good Morning Britain. If that doesn’t improve her poll ratings, nothing will. Most of the country has long been praying for a saviour to rise from these streets and knock him off his perch.Poor Piers. He just can’t get over the fact that Meghan Markle never followed him on Twitter, even when he was in full Megfest toady mode. Nor can he stand it that Laurence Fox has stolen his thunder as this week’s go-to bloke for making an arse of himself. So although only this week Morgan had promised not to bring up Meghan and Harry again, he couldn’t resist the opportunity for more self-harm. Any attention is better than none. Like Boris Johnson, his greatest fear is being forgotten.There was nothing at all racist about any of the royal media coverage, he said, reverting to rant auto-pilot. And he was fed up with professional PC wokes like Nandy saying it was. It was just that Meghan was a jumped-up, ungrateful LA princess who didn’t know her place and had disrespected Her Maj. Worse still, she had disrespected him. Which was unforgivable. And if she were ever to follow him on Twitter, he would make a point of blocking her. So what did Nandy have to say about that?Initially not much, as she had been under the impression she was on the show to discuss the Labour leadership. But recovering her poise, she first pointed out she had never said that all the coverage was racist, and then asked him “How on earth would you know?” about the prejudice people of colour experienced. Maybe it might be a good idea to keep quiet for once and listen to what they were saying. Piers turned puce and terminated the interview as soon as indecently possible.Over in the Commons, most Labour MPs were praying for Nandy – or someone like her – to take on Boris at prime minister’s questions. Anyone but Jeremy Corbyn would do, in fact, as he has already been airbrushed out of history. By himself just as much as by everyone else. Only his irrelevance is now visible. Even at its best, PMQs is a marginal spectator sport – a weekly rallying cry for the parliamentary troops: now it’s a near total irrelevance.There was a time when Boris might at least have spent 30 minutes preparing for PMQs. That’s as close as he ever gets to due diligence. Now though, he just swans in, straight out of bed, and wings it. He can’t even be bothered to hide his contempt for Corbyn and parliament. He’s in charge and can do what he likes.The Labour leader began by asking a perfectly reasonable question about the take-home pay of workers on universal credit. Boris clearly didn’t have a clue, but rather than go through the niceties of bullshitting, merely said that Corbyn should try asking different questions.It got worse as Boris all but started talking over the Labour leader. No, he wasn’t going to change universal credit because it had been very effective in streamlining some people into death, with Iain Duncan Smith as undertaker-in-chief. Labour just had to shut up and get used to its futility. It should save its breath instead of whining about poor people and child refugees. Nobody cared.“Answer the question,” Corbyn begged plaintively. Boris merely sneered. Why should he? Talk to the hand. He ended by just repeating a few lazy lies about 40 hospitals and 50,000 nurses that he doesn’t even believe himself.This was Johnson at his very worst. Both boorish and bored. As if he’s only happy when there’s some edge and he’s on the verge of self-destruction. After all, it’s not just Labour that’s supine. The Tory benches are stuffed with nonentities too.Boris occasionally tried to sound interested in something a backbencher had to say, but he’s a man who can’t conceal his insincerity. Not least when being served up a pathetic softball from someone like Alex Chalk. The voters of Cheltenham must already be regretting re-electing him. The only thing to vaguely disconcert Boris was Tory MP Caroline Nokes asking him “to pull out his plunger”.Just to underline the utter pointlessness of PMQs, Johnson left the chamber to troll the nation by tweeting that he would be having his own Facebook People’s PMQs later in the afternoon. Send in your questions, he said. And some people did. Several wanted to know where the Russia report was, and how many children he had. Strangely these questions didn’t come up. The only ones to make the cut were from a D Cummings of Chillingham Castle.Throughout the 15 minutes of narcissistic indulgence, Boris’s hands moved alarmingly. It looked suspiciously as if he was playing with himself. He was certainly playing with the country. Just a month after the election, he’s already taking us all for fools.

For Wordsworth it was shocks of passion that swiftly turned hair white.But while hair cannot lose its colour in an instant – at least not without help from a bottle of bleach – scientists at Harvard University have shown how stress can, over time, speed up the greying process.Ya-Chieh Hsu, a stem cell biologist, found that stress causes nerves involved in the fight-or-flight response to pump out a hormone which wipes out the stem cells used to make hair pigments.Because stress can be considered a form of accelerated ageing, the discovery has raised hopes for treatments that can slow down or even halt normal age-related greying. More importantly, it could shed light on how ageing depletes stem cells throughout the body, and perhaps point the way to general anti-ageing therapies.Prof Christopher Deppmann, a biologist at the University of Virginia who was not involved in the work, said he believed it had “profound implications” for how scientists think about stem cell biology, stress biology and potentially the ageing process.“Like any good study, it opens up at least as many questions as it answers, but it may represent an important stepping stone toward rationalising and developing pharmaceutical fountains of youth,” he said.The Harvard team made their discovery through a series of experiments that measured the effect of stress on the hair colour of mice. The animals were stressed over several days by being restrained for four hours a day, Monday to Friday, or through combinations of damp bedding, rapid changes to lighting and having their cages tilted.At first, the scientists suspected that stress triggered an immune attack on hair pigment-making cells, but ruled that out when they found that mice without immune cells still turned grey after episodes of stress. Next they considered cortisol, a hormone that rises in response to stress. This turned out to be another dead end: mice with no cortisol still developed grey hair.The researchers eventually found the culprit in a set of nerves that make up the sympathetic nervous system. The nerves, which prepare the body for action as part of the fight-or-flight response, reach into hair follicles in the skin, and it is here that they do their damage.Hair follicles contain a bulge that is home to a pool of stem cells. When a new hair is made, some of these stem cells turn into pigment-making ones called called melanocytes. A hair’s colour depends on the mix of light-absorbing melanin compounds that the melanocytes churn out.Tests showed that stress causes the sympathetic nervous system to pump a hormone called noradrenaline, or norepinephrine, into the hair follicle bulge. The sudden inrush of noradrenalin has an extraordinary effect. The hormone converts huge numbers of stem cells into melanocytes, but no sooner are they made than they begin to drift away from the follicle and break down. The next time the follicle tries to make a hair, there are few or no stem cells left to generate fresh pigment-producing cells.“Stress, through activation of the sympathetic nervous system, drives the loss of these melanocyte stem cells, the stem cells that are important in regenerating the pigment for the hair,” Hsusaid. “And once the reservoir has been depleted, that’s it.” The work is published in Nature.Hsu suspects that a similar mechanism is responsible for age-related greying. “There are definitely shared responses between how the melanocyte stem cells respond to stress and how they respond to ageing,” she said. “You essentially lose the stem cell pool in ageing as well.”It could take years of hard work to develop a safe and effective treatment to stop greying hair, Hsu said. What is more exciting, she believes, is that the work paves the way for understanding how the loss of stem cells throughout the body contribute to ageing.“This is certainly one implication that I’m particularly excited about,” said Deppmann. “There has already been evidence that stress and the fight-or-flight response depresses stem cells that are important for immunity. This may be the reason we often get sick after prolonged periods of stress.“I believe that we have only scratched the surface of whether and how stress and fight-or-flight mechanisms deplete other stem cell populations. Whether or not this is the cause of premature ageing remains to be determined, but I wouldn’t bet against it.”It is unclear whether stress-related greying came about by providing an evolutionary advantage to ancient beasts, among them human ancestors. “Because grey hair is most often linked to age, it could be associated with experience, leadership and trust,” Deppmann writes in an accompanying article in Nature. “Perhaps an animal that has endured enough stress to ‘earn’ grey hair has a higher place in the social order than would ordinarily be conferred by that inidual’s age.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50163ecb67bbb833d67c92bdd1496d3a8798faea/0_78_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6b82c271a85e3397e6de0c6544e71dd","title":"where has coronavirus spread","story":"Three maps illustrating the fight against the deadly virus outbreak in Wuhan, ChinaAuthorities in China are battling to contain an outbreak of a deadly coronavirus, which has spread throughout the country and beyond its borders. Latest official figures put the number of cases in China at more than 470 and 17 people have died, all of them in the central province of Hubei where the illness was first detected. UK infectious disease experts have doubled their estimate of the likely number of cases to 4,000.Cases have been confirmed in 13 Chinese provinces, as well as the municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin. Five other countries in the region have each reported a single infection while US health officials announced that a man who travelled to Hubei has been diagnosed with coronavirus in Seattle.The outbreak is centred on the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province and home to more than 11 million people. Authorities there have urged residents not to leave the city and visitors to avoid it, while fever scanners have been set up at highway checkpoints, the railway station and airport.Wuhan’s international airport serves 104 destinations including 29 outside China. There are three direct flights a week from Wuhan to Heathrow, where arrivals from the affected city will now enter through a separate area. Screening has started at the three US airports where Wuhan flights land. Checks are also in place at airports in the other east Asian countries that have confirmed the virus is present.The Wuhan coronavirus is mainly spread through the respiratory tract and officials are concerned about the week-long Chinese new year holiday that begins on 24 January when millions of people travel home to celebrate.This holiday also coincided with the Sars outbreak in 2003, which was similarly caused by a coronavirus. China’s handling of Sars was criticised because it played down the first cases. The virus spread to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting almost 8,500 people and killing almost 1,000."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e16b9d92ed5553e0c71daed22553d57cb798de0/0_70_5114_3069/master/5114.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8695d5be8f96fdcb243bbfd5aa462e69","title":"caroline wozniacki tennis retirement australian open 2020","story":"Caroline Wozniacki has spent the majority of her life in a fishbowl, her every move monitored and detailed. She never complained, accepting that it is part of the business of being a top sportswoman, that if she told paparazzi not to take photos it wouldn’t do any good. But now she is getting out, and she could not be happier.“I think I had my first interview when I was eight or nine years old, it’s pretty crazy,” Wozniacki said at the Australian Open. “My whole life I’ve been scrutinised, my career’s been scrutinised. So it’s nice to do what I want to do, not have to think twice about anything. Obviously I want to make right decisions but just be able to live life.“That’s the great thing about being an athlete, once you stop, there are always new people coming up and taking your spot, you can live a normal life, you can live a family life and have the best of both worlds, having your time in the spotlight but also just doing normal stuff.”Wozniacki announced last month that this year’s Australian Open, where she won her first and only grand slam title in 2018, would be her last event. The Dane, who topped the world rankings at the age of 20, spent 71 weeks as the world No 1 and has won 30 titles all over the world, from Stockholm in 2008 to Beijing in 2018.Few players can boast a career even half as good as Wozniacki, who has also won more than $35m in prize money. No one worked harder or was more dedicated and, as she showed yet again at Melbourne Park on Wednesday her desire remains undimmed she came back from 5-1 down in the first set and 3-0 down in the second to beat one of the young pretenders, the No 23 seed, Dayana Yastremska of Ukraine, in the second round, extending her career a few days longer at least.At 29, she is retiring relatively young by today’s standards. Her decision came after she was diagnosed in the summer of 2018 with rheumatoid arthritis, the auto-immune disease that can cause joint pain all over the body. Wozniacki refused to be pigeonholed, refused to believe she could not carry on being one of the best athletes in the world. But it opened her eyes to a disease she knew little about and a community of people who she hopes, in retirement, to still be able to inspire.“I love going to the gym, I love being active, so it’s something I’m always going to do. I hope I can inspire a lot of people and if I can even help a few people, I’ve already done my part.“But I hope I can inspire and help a lot of people, and educate a lot of people as well, because RA is something that not a lot of people are very familiar with.“I wasn’t, I had no idea what I was getting myself into, what was happening, so if I can help someone that was as confused as I was, that would mean a lot to me.”Wozniacki won junior Wimbledon in 2006 but she began her professional career the year before, in Cincinnati, where she was beaten in the first round by Patty Schnyder of Switzerland, then ranked inside the top 10. In some ways it seems a lifetime ago, in others like yesterday.“I think how fast all the years have gone, all of a sudden we’re back here in Australia, it goes so quick,” she said. “This is what I’ve done for my whole life, this is what I’ve trained for and it’s pretty crazy that it’s coming to an end.”This week she has been going about things as she always has done, with absolute professionalism, but keeping her emotions has not been easy, not least because so many players – from Serena Williams to Maria Sharapova, Simona Halep to Petra Kvitova – wanted to express their good wishes. If she is hugely proud of her attitude – “I never slacked” – her character has had as much an impact as her on-court achievements.On the court, though, becoming No 1 for a third time when she won her first grand slam title in Melbourne two years ago – one in the face for those who said she would never win one – ranks as her most proud moment as a player.“I think being No 1 for such a long period of time is probably much harder than winning one tournament, where you have a great couple of weeks,” she said. “But having the combination of the two is something very few people have done.”She has inspired a generation of players in her home country - Denmark has had both junior world No 1s in the past year – and family life beckons.But first there may just be time for one last hurrah if she can beat Ons Jabeur of Tunisia on Friday she is likely to face her best friend on Tour, Serena Williams, in the last 16.Wozniacki is adamant there will be no comeback – “I’d say the chances are very slim,” – and she plans to embrace family life and her responsibilities as a role model in the same way she conducted herself as a player. She has earned it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08fa181abc573644aa278838ec09f10276e5c235/0_3_4451_2670/master/4451.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7c192fae7d342fde43b658c0153ac6","title":"saracens keen publication salary cap report rugby union","story":"The disciplinary report that led to Saracens being relegated from the Premiership found the club’s owner, Nigel Wray, broke the rules by entering into ventures totalling £1.3m with the England players Maro Itoje, Billy and Mako Vunipola and Chris Ashton.That is according to a copy of the 103-page report by Lord Dyson, which was leaked to Sky News on Wednesday . It also states Saracens breached the salary cap in three consecutive seasons – with more than £1.1m of overspend in the 2016-17 season, just over £98,000 in 2017-18 and £906,000 in 2018-19.The club was docked 35 points and fined £5.3m in November for breaking Premiership Rugby’s £7m salary cap. Earlier this month Wray stepped down as the chairman and the club subsequently agreed it would be relegated at the end of this season.It has now come to light that the disciplinary panel advised against the club’s relegation, believing it would be a disproportionate punishment.“We accept the breaches were not deliberate but in our view they were reckless,” the panel wrote in their report. “We consider that to impose a deduction of 70 points in one salary cap year is disproportionate and is not required to satisfy the underlying purpose of the relegations.”The Saracens chairman, Neil Golding, had called for the report to be made public after Premiership Rugby said the club had requested it be kept secret.Itoje was also paid a lump sum for three years of £30,000, £30,000 and £35,000 by a company involving the chairman’s daughter, Lucy Wray, that did all the hospitality at Allianz Park.According to Sky News, the report noted there was no evidence Itoje had attended any hospitality events and was not paid on a per-event basis, meaning it was a salary benefit and not a commercial arrangement.Nigel Wray also made a series of investments into companies run by Saracens players – including £250,000 into Itoje’s company and £220,000 into one owned by Richard Wigglesworth. Another £450,000 was given to Vuniprop, a company owned by the brothers Billy and Mako Vunipola, to enable them to buy a house. Renovation costs were also loaned, interest free by Wray.In his witness statement, Wray said these payments were “bona fide commercial transactions with a number of players based on the merit of those investments, not, as PRL (Premiership Rugby Limited) suggests, in order to provide an additional reward to players for playing their rugby at the club.”There is also no suggestion or evidence that any player was complicit in any of the club’s actions.Saracens’ international players have been given the all clear by Eddie Jones and Warren Gatland to take a “sabbatical” season in the Championship knowing they will still be selected for England and the Lions next year if they remain fit and in form.Mark McCall, the Saracens coach, said the plan could lead to players such as Owen Farrell and Itoje staying at the club while making only occasional appearances in the second tier. This would enable them to recharge their batteries for the autumn internationals, the Six Nations and the tour of South Africa.“A key driver for our established international players is whether they would be selected by Eddie for the autumn internationals and Six Nations while playing in the Championship,” McCall said.“Obviously there is a lot who also want to go on the Lions at the end of next year. However Eddie is on the whole happy to select players who are established, Warren the same.”McCall cited the cases of Richie McCaw and Dan Carter, who went on a sabbatical and then returned to guide New Zealand to World Cup glory in 2015, as showing the benefits of such an approach.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsHe added: “A lot of these players are at the stage where they have been on this treadmill for 10 years.

The England and Wales Cricket Board retrospectively banned them for four of the Lions games they missed, fined them £2,000 each and ordered them to attend an educational course.With that punishment now served, Kohler-Cadmore has returned to the Lions set-up after another strong season at Headingley – the ECB insists Clarke’s continued absence is based solely on performance – and he appears keen to own his mistake.Kohler-Cadmore said: “One hundred per cent I was in the wrong. We all had our part to play in the group and it was meant as a bit of a joke. I know it’s not a joke now but it was never meant to be malicious.“They were my actions, I was part of it and I was the one that created the group. It was never meant to have any outcome like that, it was just us three being young, single lads. We were naive.”Kohler-Cadmore knows his proximity to the Hepburn case is “not something I am ever going to get away from” but insists he is a reformed character these days, having feared his career was “crashing down” when Andy Flower, the former Lions head coach, initially stood him down from the India tour 12 months ago.“The learning from it was that it was about you as a whole. You can’t allow yourself to be acting in that way, you have got to conduct yourself a lot better.“Since then my life has had a proper U-turn in how I conduct myself. I have actually taken myself out of every WhatsApp group I could possibly be in. I am more than happy to miss out on that because I don’t want the risk of being affiliated with something that I can’t control.The Professional Cricketers’ Association responded to the Hepburn case by rolling out a series of relevant courses to all 18 counties and the England men’s and women’s teams. Players have been taught about sexual consent and the law, as well as having attitudes challenged.Kohler-Cadmore has also volunteered to speak at the PCA rookie camp at Edgbaston on 25 February, where around 50 newly signed professional cricketers will hear his cautionary tale as part of their induction into the sport."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49c1c4b1254b155e344af606ee32969dfb77dfcf/0_387_3485_2091/master/3485.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6f6e188841d69eb3356e0250f22bb4f","title":"the best of the winter youth olympic games in pictures","story":"All the colour, drama and skill of the competitors are captured here in the best photographs from Lausanne"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae145e317b11a6ce56d3cc308de80a14de475e97/0_400_4959_2976/master/4959.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ab1507ff41f73168e7ba028448a2244","title":"click i agree un rapporteur says prince tried to intimidate bezos with text","story":"Information suggests alleged targeting of Amazon chief was part of a wider campaign to pick off iniduals close to KhashoggiThe message, it seems, could not have been clearer.On 8 November 2018, just one month after the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest man, received an unsolicited text from Mohammed bin Salman’s WhatsApp account.According to the UN, the text from the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, contained a single photograph that bore a striking similarity to the woman with whom the married billionaire was having a secret affair. It also contained what appeared to be a sardonic message.It read: “Arguing with a woman is like reading the Software Licence Agreement. In the end you have to ignore everything and click I agree.”For Agnes Callamard, the UN special rapporteur who is investigating the murder of Khashoggi, it seemed the message was evidence of an attempt by the future king, also known as MBS, to “intimidate” Bezos.She told the  it appeared intended to make him feel vulnerable, even as his own newspaper, the Washington Post, continued to publish hard-hitting stories about the murder of one of its own journalists.The new UN revelations, which follow the ’s report that Bezos’s phone was allegedly hacked by Saudi Arabia in the months before the Khashoggi killing, point to an orchestrated cyber campaign to target Bezos, and the close circle of iniduals around Khashoggi.Callamard said: “This shows that during this period, there is a concerted effort to hack into the system of people who are considered as a threat somehow to MBS or to the government system of Saudi Arabia. That does not mean it is aimed at picking up particular information. It is done to use that information in the future.”According to a timeline provided by the UN, the story began on 21 March 2018, when Bezos was invited to a small dinner party in honour of the crown prince.A fortnight later – on 4 April – the two men exchanged phone numbers at a dinner whose guest list included former basketball player Kobe Bryant and the Disney chief executive, Bob Iger.And a month after that, on 1 May, Bezos received “a message from the crown prince account … through WhatsApp,” the UN explained.“The message is an encrypted video file. It is later established, with reasonable certainty, that the video’s downloader infects Mr Bezos’ phone with malicious code.”This rapidly infected his phone – and a huge exfiltration of data began.That was the conclusion of a report undertaken for Bezos by FTI Consulting, an advisory firm, whose findings were passed to Callamard, and another UN special rapporteur, David Kaye. has seen this report.If the analysis is correct, the crown prince’s close circle had obtained the contents of the mobile phone of one of the world’s most powerful businesspeople .Bezos – like hundreds of other victims – would have had no reason to know he had been hacked.In the days and weeks that followed, Bezos – who was married at the time – sent private text messages to his girlfriend, describing his romantic feelings.Those texts would later be published in the National Enquirer, although the exact circumstances around their publication have yet to be determined.What is known is that the crown prince had twice met with the owner of the National Enquirer, David Pecker, who was known in Hollywood and Washington as a man who had ties to Donald Trump, and had a history of solving problems for the US president, including “killing” negative stories about Trump and his extramarital affairs.New information published by Callamard and Kaye, the UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression, suggest that the alleged targeting of Bezos was just the beginning of a broader campaign to pick off iniduals who were close to Khashoggi and in frequent contact with the journalist.The timeline published by the investigators on Wednesday refers to four other prominent Saudi critics who were targeted with malware in the weeks that followed: Yahya Assiri and Omar Abdulaziz, who were in frequent contact with Khashoggi, the London-based satirist Ghanem al-Dosari, and an Amnesty International official who was working in Saudi Arabia.On 2 October, Khashoggi entered the Saudi embassy in Istanbul and was killed. US intelligence agencies and Callamard’s own report would later allege that Bin Salman bore responsibility for the killing.Shortly thereafter, the investigators said there had been a “massive online campaign” against Bezos and Amazon in Saudi Arabia, principally targeting him as the owner of the Washington Post.Then, in January last year, the National Enquirer published an exposé of Bezos’s extramarital affair, including text messages that were sent after the billionaire’s phone was allegedly hacked by the Saudis.American Media Inc, owner of the National Enquirer, has denied that any “third party” was involved in it obtaining information about Bezos, and has insisted that it received its tip-off from the estranged brother of Bezos’s girlfriend. But the brother, Michael Sanchez, publicly stated last year that the Enquirer was already aware of the illicit relationship when he was first contacted by the tabloid in July 2018 and had already “seen” text messages between the couple.While experts contend that Bin Salman may have been seeking to silence Bezos, the Amazon CEO publicly accused AMI of trying to “extort and blackmail” him, after the company suggested that it would agree to not publish compromising photographs of the billionaire if he agreed to shutdown his investigation into the leaked texts. Bezos flatly denied the apparent deal.The FTI Consulting report says that Bezos obtained a detailed briefing about the extent of the Saudi campaign against him on 14 February. It was provided over two separate phone calls.UN investigators say the online campaign against Bezos ended on 1 April.At about that time, the  reported that Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, had privately urged the crown prince to cut his ties to a close adviser, Saud al-Qahtani, who had been known as a key architect of Saudi Arabia’s cyber warfare and Twitter campaigns.The Saudi embassy in Washington declined to respond to the ’s questions. But in a tweet, the Saudi government called allegations that the crown prince was involved in the hacking of Bezos “absurd”.“We call for an investigation on these claims so that we can have all the facts out,” it said.AMI said it had no further comment.Saudi Arabia has insisted the crown prince had nothing to do with the murder of Khashoggi. It has also denied using surveillance technology against critics of the kingdom.But, on Wednesday night, as the story continued to grow, Bezos remembered the journalist in a tweet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a951d2e98a7064fb8641bac6244a2f3ac11bdfd7/470_381_2610_1566/master/2610.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe242bd2b8c4ffd3e39ba958b1fc40bc","title":"elon musk on road to 50bn payout as teslas value passes 100bn","story":"Under pay scheme, founder must build electric carmaker into $650bn company by 2028The Tesla founder, Elon Musk, has taken the first step to becoming $50bn (£38bn) richer after the value of the electric car company surged past $100bn.Musk, already a multibillionaire with a net worth estimated at about $30bn, secured approval in 2018 for a pay deal that would dwarf existing records for renumeration if it was paid out in full.Under the scheme corporate governance experts have described as “staggering”, Musk must build Tesla into a $650bn company over the next 10 years.Hitting this landmark would make Tesla one of the world’s most valuable tech companies – worth more than seven times the combined value today of automotive powerhouses Ford and General Motors .Provided Tesla also hits ambitious revenue and profit targets, and assuming Musk remains its chief executive, such growth would also trigger payments in stock worth about $50bn over the course of the scheme.At the time the deal was agreed in March 2018, Tesla was valued by the stock market at $54.6bn. Its share price has nearly doubled since then, breaking the $100bn barrier on Wednesday.Improved sentiment about Tesla on Wall Street is partly down to a surprise third-quarter profit of $143m, which bolstered hopes that the company could end its habit of making significant losses.If Musk can keep the stock market value at above $100bn on average over the next six months, he will be entitled to the first of up to 12 stock payouts, worth around $350m each.The pay deal is staggered so that he receives further awards for every $50bn Tesla increases in stock market value, up to a maximum of $50bn in shares if the company achieves a valuation of $650bn by 2028.That is still some way behind trillion-dollar companies such as Apple, the first to reach the Wall Street milestone, and Google’s parent company, Alphabet.Tesla supporters have argued that the way the pay plan is structured will help keep Musk focused on the company at a time when he is also increasingly involved in SpaceX, his space exploration company, and other ventures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b5ce39d227d831c434210cdf35977916f8f876e/0_0_5124_3073/master/5124.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e00d6b308231638bc427a46750c8d36","title":"tell us about the websites your children visit","story":"We want to hear from parents and young adults about the non-mainstream sites they and their children accessWith new rules for technology companies to protect children online announced by the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, we want to hear about the non-mainstream sites children and young people access.Some of these principles include:We want to know about the surprising sites that children and young people visit.

But Lisa Garwood-Cross, 28, from Bury, has revolutionised her approach to it – by refusing to go more than twice a month and being mindful about what she picks off the shelves.“Shopping is one of those things you often do on autopilot,” says Garwood-Cross. “But simply switching on to what you need – taking 10 minutes to stocktake what’s in the cupboard before you leave the house – and then really thinking about what you put in the trolley, can save you a lot of money.”Mindset aside, Garwood-Cross has several tried and tested strategies for wiping off pounds at the checkout. “My number one tip is to check the price per 100g on what you’re buying,” she says. “We’re programmed to think that the biggest pack will be the best value but that’s not always the case. Look for the information on the shelf label and don’t assume bulk is best.”Garwood-Cross’s second tip is to be more flexible in your shopping and try some own brands. Often, we go for the market-leading brand through habit, but it may be that you won’t even taste the difference, she says.“I never thought I’d be able to ditch my favourite fizzy drink but actually, I really like a supermarket version – that’s 39p a bottle, compared with £1.50 for two litres. You don’t have to switch everything – my wife won’t ever change her ketchup brand – but just making some swaps will save money.”Finally, Garwood-Cross suggests filling your freezer with frozen vegetables and yellow sticker (reduced) meat and fish, and setting yourself a “pantry challenge” once a month to use up all the food in the house before heading out for another big shop.“I picked up a lot of this when I was young, as I was raised by a single mum on benefits,” says Garwood-Cross. Now studying for a PhD in digital health, Garwood-Cross’s savvy ways have enabled her to buy a two-bedroom house and enjoy two to three foreign holidays a year.For Kevin Egan, 49, from Chelmsford in Essex, being smart with his shopping takes barely any effort as he has an American Express Platinum Cashback Everyday Credit Card. This means Egan earns money back on all his purchases just by using his card, and he estimates having earned more than £1,000 since he got it in 2009.Egan says he keeps track of his spending using the handy Amex App.Indeed, these days your smartphone is your best friend when it comes to budgeting, moving money around and making savings. Clair Byrne, 31, from Greater Manchester is evangelical about the benefits of cashback shopping apps.With so many fun and effective tricks of the trade, it’s not difficult to see why a growing number of people get such satisfaction from being savvy with their spending. “I get a kick out of knowing that I’ve saved some money that can be put towards the things that really matter to me – such as experiences and holidays,” says Garwood-Cross.

I’m in a relatively good situation and I’m not going to seize up my spending.’”So what have we been spending money on in 2019? This year, the Office for National Statistics added smart speakers, baking trays, dog treats and electric toothbrushes to the virtual shopping basket it uses to calculate the country’s annual inflation rate, making our changing shopping norms clear as day. And there are more consumer trends that refect our changing world …Vegan sausage rollsWhen vegan sausage rolls hit the high street in January, they caused something of a stir, with bakeries struggling to keep up with demand. Their success influenced supermarkets, many of whom expanded their vegan ranges. Shoppers say they’ve adopted this lifestyle in the past five years, primarily because of animal welfare concerns, health reasons and because they want to be more mindful about the environment.Hannah Elderfield, senior behavioural analyst at the consumer behavioural specialist Canvas8, says it’s part of an evolution of beauty as a sector that combines notions of self-care, wellness and health into one. “People are now looking for beauty products that boost their emotional state, rather than just buff out so-called imperfections – it’s about feeling happier, empowered and more confident,” she says. “Part of this shift is due to a rising desire for products that align more closely with people’s values. In 2019, environmental concerns and sustainability issues grew even higher on the agenda.”It’s part of a broader trend of shoppers who are investing more in their “off time” at home. Research from American Express found this extends to hobbies – 11 million adults having taken up a new one this year, with artistic interests such as painting, drawing and creative writing topping the list. The most common reason people gave for spending money on a new hobby (an average of £23.50 per month) was to find a better work-life balance. Experiences as a whole have remained a strong category in 2019 when it comes to consumer spending, whether that’s at home or elsewhere, says Duckett.“We’ve got so much stuff and no place to put it,” he says. “This has filtered down to us thinking: what else can I spend my money on that I can get more value out of. People will look for experiences in leisure, entertainment and holidays.”American Express Services Europe Limited has its registered office at Belgrave House, 76 Buckingham Palace Road, London, SW1W 9AX, UK.

None of us want to miss out on that party invite or weekend away. Now you won’t have toYou’ve heard it a million times: the secret to staying on budget is to plan ahead. But, for many of us, that’s easier said than done. We work so hard that we don’t have time to organise things far in advance, nor are we able to devote as much energy to our finances as we should. But, also, it’s simply a lot of fun to be spontaneous and make the most of opportunities that come up.For that reason, it isn’t always easy to stick rigidly to a budget. Last-minute expenses, invitations for weekends away, or celebrations with friends and family can often come up unexpectedly. But if you’re canny with it, you can be spontaneous without going overboard. So here are 10 smart ways to spend that even the busiest person can stick to.Eat out smartWhen a friend suggests lunch or an evening meal on the town that you hadn’t planned for, you don’t have to miss out. Using restaurant-booking websites, you can find restaurants near to you that have special offers such as free prosecco, two- or three-course meals, or afternoon tea at reduced rates.Get rewarded for spendingOne great way to earn back some of your spending money is to use a cashback credit card. If you choose one that doesn’t have a limit on the amount of cashback you could earn – such as the American Express Platinum Cashback Everyday Credit Card – you’ll be paid back a proportion of your spending as cashback. The more you spend, the greater the reward, meaning that if you use your credit card for everyday spending as well as big-ticket items, you can reap the rewards in cashback. (See Important information panel.)Set aside extra cash each month for last-minute social commitments If you know you’re liable to go big on going out, or you regularly need to find extra cash for last-minute social occasions, add a contingency to your budget so you don’t end up short at the end of the month. If you don’t use it one month, you can carry it forward towards a bigger item later. Make sure you’ve set aside enough to cover all your regular and necessary expenses such as rent or mortgage and utility bills before you calculate your spending money.Buy an annual passSome museum and gallery exhibitions charge a comparatively high fee for a one-off ticket, but offer annual passes for the cost of two or three visits. These memberships often also include free guest or child passes, so if it is somewhere you’ll visit regularly, you can save a lot of money over the course of a year. Ask whether they have an introductory rate for new members.Use an appThere are lots of money apps you can use to alert you if your spending is higher than you’d like. Different apps provide different services, from providing smart insights on your spending and showing an overview of your finances, to alerting you to where you could reduce unnecessary expenses. Be specific with your needs when you look for the app for you, and always read customer reviews to see how others have benefitted.Make the most of retailers’ loyalty cardsMany stores and supermarkets give points on shopping that can be used as part payment in-store or exchanged for vouchers and money off. Often, the deals available are more generous than the face value of the points if you decide to convert them into meal vouchers or money off on days out.Enjoy the big screenThere are plenty of ways to go to the cinema for less. Some have deals on certain days and secret blockbuster screenings at reduced rates. Afternoon showings and Sunday mornings are often cheaper, too.Get your culture on the cheapIf the theatre is more your thing, you can turn up at the box office a few hours before a performance and ask for reduced seats. Some websites list popular shows for £25 per person or less. Many theatres set aside a number of cheaper tickets for under-25s, over-60s and students of all ages, too. Be flexible about your thrillsWhile many theme parks and attractions offer the cheapest price for advance tickets, some online bookings are valid for three months to a year from the date of purchase. So if you fancy an adrenaline rush, or a fun day out for the kids, you can pre-book and then decide later when you want to go. It’s particularly useful if you want to combine your trip with a favourable weather forecast.Last-minute getawaysWhether it’s a holiday cottage by the sea, a winter sojourn in the sun, or a weekend city break, leaving it to the last minute to book can bag you a bargain. Lots of travel sites use dynamic pricing, which means that what you pay will change in response to supply and demand. If you are flexible enough to have your suitcase packed and ready to head off within 24 hours, you can snap up some incredible deals. Hotels would rather fill a room than leave it empty, and might even throw in dinner to encourage you to stay. Being spontaneous can be wonderful.American Express Services Europe Limited has its registered office at Belgrave House, 76 Buckingham Palace Road, London, SW1W 9AX, UK.

This discovery about an actor the majority of American viewers know only as caustic doctor Gregory House in House is currently falling on US audiences like manna from heaven, courtesy of his starring role in Armando Iannucci’s new space-dystopian sitcom Avenue 5 (HBOSky One). It’s nice to think of them heading to YouTube to find out more and getting to see A Bit of Fry and Laurie (“You know what makes me really mad? It’s this belief that I’m John the Baptist”) before Trump blows the place to hell. Going out with a smile – it’s the best any of us can hope for.Laurie and the rest of the Avenue 5 cast will certainly help you do that. It’s something of an (inter)stellar lineup. Laurie plays Ryan Clark, captain of space cruise ship Avenue 5 and a man with a much-valued talent for soothing even the most fractious passenger on an eight-week jaunt around the solar system. This is particularly useful as his colleague, Matt Spencer (Zach Woods, of the US version of The Office and Silicon Valley), has no such talent, despite being the head of passenger communications. “I’m here to make sure your body wash gets replenished,” he explains to warring couple Mia (Jessica St Clair) and Doug (Kyle Bornheimer), who have taken the holiday to try to save their relationship, “not to rectify the catastrophe of human existence.” Spencer has many of the best lines, often as a hologram shilling the ship’s luxury services, including all-you-can-eat buffets: “If you’re not completely satisfied – you’re wrong.” Also in the mix, and a further cross for Spencer to bear, is domineering Karen Kelly (Iannucci’s rep-company stalwart Rebecca Front), who is married to the beleaguered Frank (fellow Office-mate of Woods, Andy Buckley) and has many ongoing complaints about their malfunctioning cabin. Forty years in the future we may be, but Karen’s gonna Karen.The ship is owned by billionaire manbaby Herman Judd (an anomalously repellent performance from Josh Gad – yes, even accounting for the fact that billionaire manbabies are not meant to be particularly likable) and all hell breaks loose when a gravity flip throws them off course, kills the ship’s engineer (“If it’s any consolation, he had very few loved ones”) and transforms their eight-week interplanetary hop into an epic three-year voyage. Experts at Judd’s earthbound HQ are at a loss, and head of mission control, Rav (Nikki Amuka-Bird, hitting it out of the park), is going quietly insane under the pressure.And then – well, then nothing much. Passengers and crew shuffle round, delivering acutely focused one-liners that – if they frequently lack the zing of vintage Veep-style Iannucci – still reward the extra half-second of attention they require to parse. When Judd’s right-hand woman, Iris (a brutally magnificent Suzy Nakamura), tells Captain Clark that the passengers exercising forms “the largest ever yoga class in space”, he replies: “Who’d we beat?” So perish all pride in human non-endeavours. See also a passenger’s awed sighting, at Judd’s exhibition of historical artefacts, of “Gone Girl on an original Kindle!”But there is – despite two not unexpected reveals in the opening three episodes – a pervasive sense of stasis about the whole affair, best symbolised by an incredibly laboured running gag about the 26-second time-lag between the ship and Earth that seems, in every instance, to play out in real time.Like the post-flip ship itself, Avenue 5 doesn’t seem to know quite where it is going or how long it might take to get there. Commentary on the uselessness of most tech, corporations’ concerns about the bottom line even with 500 trapped people’s lives at stake and the effortless climb to power by the Karens of this world in the wake of crises are all points taken, but Avenue 5 is taking its time to find a theme and story to coalesce round them. By the end of the four episodes available for review, the plot had been back and forth along a few grooves that were already beginning to feel well-worn. The rest remained a disparate collection of delights and longueurs, despite the formidable talent before and behind the cameras. Maybe things will improve in the second half of the eight-part run – and if not, well, God knows Iannucci is entitled to a slight misstep now and again. In the meantime, there is Veep, The Thick of It and all of Alan Partridge to rewatch, as well as all the bits of Fry and Laurie the internet has to offer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e441940eb649eb1d465e810fe3b7422de8c0f81/0_55_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aca53a3e2c9034c5eeef59eedc7173da","title":"iguanas cold florida freeze","story":"The weather forecast warned it would be raining reptiles and Floridians recorded encounters with lizards feeling the chillIt truly was the night (and day) of the iguana.After the National Weather Service (NWS) sent an unusual alert to south Florida residents on Tuesday night warning them of possible “falling iguanas” in light of unseasonably low temperatures, residents were indeed treated to a show of rigid reptiles out of the sky (or, actually, the trees).The not-so-small creatures were seen motionless in the middle of sidewalks and backyards. While they looked dead, they were actually just too cold to move. Iguanas start becoming sluggish when temperatures drop below 50F (10C) and are susceptible to freezing once temperatures drop to around 40F (4.5C). When frozen, they easily fall out of the trees they call home, appearing lifeless even though they aren’t dead.Floridians shared videos of the phenomenon, giving Twitter an up-close look at the green-scaled reptiles that are probably dreaming of warmer climates, or at least spring.One Twitter user happened to capture the resurrection of an iguana as it took in some warmth in the sunshine and slowly crawled back to life after being temporarily frozen.Iguanas are an invasive species in Florida and can be little nuisances when not frozen. They can damage infrastructure by digging small burrows into sidewalks or foundations and leave droppings on decks and inside swimming pools.Wildlife conservationists recommend people not touch frozen iguanas as they may come back to life and feel threatened if a person is close."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/561a8558839a031358d95c1179d0b4938a6253e1/0_67_2889_1733/master/2889.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ccaa471238bd56595fcc3ac37a9ff7c","title":"impeachment trial mcconnell sleep schiff","story":"Adam Schiff eloquently made the House’s case that the republic is in danger from Donald Trump but Republicans’ reaction was heavy-lidded He fought. Oh, how he fought. But Mitch McConnell’s battle with drowsy eyelids was a lost cause. The 77-year-old senator’s head bobbed and drooped. An alarmed aide sat at his side, powerless, as McConnell surrendered to the arms of Morpheus.It was 1.40pm on Wednesday and the House impeachment manager Adam Schiff was in full flow, prosecuting the case against Donald Trump. Over nearly two and a half hours, McConnell would not be the only Republican senator to nod off, yawn, rub their eyes or bolt the chamber.According to Schiff, the house was on fire, the republic was in jeopardy and democracy itself was threatened by “a president who would be king”. Yet the response on one side of the aisle was insouciance and somnolence. Was it mere fatigue, after Tuesday’s marathon that had run until nearly 2am? Or was it sheer boredom on the part of jurors who have already cleared the accused in their minds and are now just going through the motions?The session had begun with pointed comments by the Senate chaplain, Barry Black, in a prayer for the senators. “Help them remember that patriots reside on both sides of the aisle, that words have consequences and that how something is said can be as important as what is said,” said Black, sporting a bow tie. “Give them a civility built upon integrity that brings consistency in their beliefs and actions.”Then Schiff, chairman of the House of Representatives’ intelligence committee, stepped up to the podium to lead opening arguments. Reading from typed A4 sheets in a ring binder, he delivered a tour de force that was both epic and intimate, historically sweeping yet highly specific, offering a view from both 30,000 feet and the microscope.Schiff began by quoting from the founding father Alexander Hamilton in a 1792 letter to George Washington that refers to “a man unprincipled in private life” and “bold in his temper” who is “known to have scoffed in private at the principles of liberty” and is “seen to mount the hobby horse of popularity” with an intention to “ride the storm and direct the whirlwind”.History rhymes. The California congressman acknowledged the founders’ flaws but also their genius and prescience, though as the years passed, he noted, it became harder to imagine them as human beings. “This is no less true of Alexander Hamilton, notwithstanding his own return to celebrity.”It was a nod to Hamilton, the unlikely Broadway musical hit about the former treasury secretary. (The world now awaits Lin-Manuel Miranda’s sequel, a rap musical about Rudy Giuliani’s adventures in Ukraine.)Schiff set out a case painfully familiar to those who have been following the matter (which is by no means everyone). Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to publicly announce investigations into two discredited allegations that would benefit Trump’s 2020 presidential election campaign, he said.“When the Ukrainian president did not immediately agree, Trump withheld two official acts to induce the Ukrainian leader to comply – a head of state meeting and hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to a strategic partner at war with Russia. It was a corrupt scheme to secure foreign help with his re-election – in other words, to cheat.”Carefully and cleverly, Schiff portrayed a web that has Vladimir Putin has at its centre. In his version, the infamous Ukraine phone call was not separate and distinct from the Trump-Russia investigation but all of a piece.“The military aid we provide Ukraine helps to protect and advance American national security interests in the region and beyond,” he said. “America has an abiding interest in stemming Russian expansionism.”The Senate was shown, on video screens, clips including Trump the candidate urging Russia to find Hillary Clinton’s hacked emails and the former White House expert Fiona Hill warning against the repetition of Russia propaganda talking points about a Ukrainian computer server – her accent from the English town of Bishop Auckland resounding in the chamber.Another clip was of Mick Mulvaney, acting White House chief of staff, declaring: “I have news for everybody. Get over it. There’s going to be political influence in foreign policy.”Schiff commented: “Should we just ‘get over it’? Is that what we’ve come to? I hope and pray the answer is no.” Unless Trump was held accountable and removed from office, he warned, the next president mighty simply say: “Just get over it. I’m just doing what Donald Trump did. Just get over it.”Above all, Schiff made a masterly plea for the soul of the nation. He entreated senators to put the constitution before party and warned that every generation had to fight anew for democracy and freedom. “If we don’t stand up to this peril today, we will write the history of our decline with our own hand.”Watching from afar, David Axelrod, former strategist for Barack Obama, tweeted: “Devastating, epic presentation by @RepAdamSchiff to open trial. Will it matter?”He might as well have asked if facts matter. Think of Schiff as Clarence Darrow, a legal maestro who, at the “Scopes monkey trial” in 1925, challenged a Tennessee state law that banned the teaching of evolution. He was opposed by a defender of biblical creationism. He lost.Nearly a century later, the Republican defence appears to be based on blind faith in Trump and the verdict on his conduct is preordained. As Schiff went on, McConnell, the Senate majority leader, nodded off a few times. The aide at his side wondered what to do while remaining tactful, eventually summoning a younger staffer to place a glass of water on McConnell’s desk, thereby making him stir.Fellow Republicans dozed, slumped, rubbed their eyes or stretched their legs.When Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached, his successor Gerald Ford declared “our long national nightmare is over”. This time, the party refuses to wake up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d49688edfa1facc1b7ba7284953290b5dd11221c/0_84_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e5ed10aee7342212cdcf30de902214b","title":"revealed the saudi heir and the alleged plot to undermine jeff bezos","story":"Apparent targeting of Amazon billionaire’s phone fits into broader pattern of behaviour by Saudi ArabiaJeff Bezos, the billionaire owner of the Washington Post, had no reason to be suspicious when he received a WhatsApp message from the account of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia in May 2018.Bezos and Mohammed bin Salman had attended a dinner together in Hollywood a few weeks earlier hosted by Brian Grazer, the Oscar-winning producer, and Ari Emanuel, the powerful talent agent, as part of the young crown prince’s tour of America, which was hailed by some observers as an effort to rebrand the kingdom and set it on a new course.The then 32-year-old Saudi heir, known all over the world as “MBS”, had been greeted with open arms from Los Angeles to New York – with stops at the White House, MIT, and Harvard. He had rubbed shoulders with celebrities ranging from Oprah to Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson.It appeared to be a PR coup for the crown prince, who had previously been criticised by human rights campaigners about his decision to wage a bloody war in Yemen – and also the alleged imprisonment and torture of rich Saudis at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh. Amazon had even been in talks about the possibility of opening data centres in Saudi Arabia.The dinner engagement could have been the start of a promising relationship between two of the world’s most powerful men. But it would swiftly turn sour – and in spectacular fashion.According to sources who have spoken to the , the message sent to Bezos on that Tuesday 1 May from the personal account of the crown prince contained a video file – of what, it is not clear.But a forensic technical analysis of the file has found that it is “highly probable” it contained malware that penetrated Bezos’s mobile phone and exfiltrated a large amount of data within hours.Bezos, it seems, had been hacked. has no knowledge about the precise nature of the material that was allegedly taken or what was done with it.But this apparent targeting of Bezos’s phone appears to fit into a broader pattern of behaviour by Saudi Arabia.The crown prince and his inner circle have been criticised for attempting to undermine real and perceived critics of his regime all over the world.Was Bezos, the owner of the Washington Post, the paper that employed the eloquent Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi, considered one of them?Certainly, among all of the perceived enemies of the crown prince, Khashoggi was considered one of the most dangerous. His knowledge of the royal court – he had once worked within it – and the platform then afforded him by such a respected newspaper, gave his articles real weight.

Two months earlier he had had a private dinner with Donald Trump in the White House. Among the other guests was Kacy Grine, a financier who reportedly served as an advisor to Saudi royals.Pecker and Trump were longtime allies. A Department of Justice investigation would later reveal that Pecker had played a critical role in helping the Trump campaign to “kill” negative stories about the then-candidate’s extramarital affairs and pay hush money to women who were interested in telling their stories.Mohammed bin Salman, widely known as MBS, becomes crown prince of Saudi Arabia, designated heir to the king.Donald Trump hosts a private White House dinner for a western adviser to MBS and\u0026nbspDavid Pecker, the CEO of American Media Inc (AMI), which\u0026nbsppublishes the National Enquirer.Mohammed bin Salman meets with David Pecker and the western advisrr to the crown prince, in Saudi Arabia.Mohammed bin Salman\u0026nbspreportedly tells a top aide\u0026nbsphe wants to use a \u0027bullet\u0027 on Jamal Khashoggi, who is writing critical columns in the Washington Post.Mohammed bin Salman arrives in the US for a tour to boost Saudi Arabia\u0027s reputation with America\u0027s most senior VIPs, business leaders and government officials.Trump hosts Mohammed bin Salman at a meeting in the White House, where the US president calls them \u0027good friends\u0027.AMI publishes nearly-100-page glossy magazine praising Saudi Arabia and Mohammed bin Salman.Mohammed bin Salman is guest of honour at Hollywood dinner.

The target was an influential Saudi dissident who was living in Canada and was a close friend of Khashoggi.According to an analysis by the independent research group Citizen Lab, Omar Abdulaziz received a fake infected link about a delivery he was expecting in late June 2018 that contained malware that infiltrated his phone. understands Khashoggi and Abdulaziz traded “hundreds” of messages in the months that followed.Abdulaziz has claimed in a lawsuit that his communications were probably intercepted by Saudi Arabia – an allegation the kingdom has denied. But Abdulaziz fears his messages to Khashoggi could have given insights to the people who would later kill him.He was not alone. Two other dissidents, the London-based satirist Ghanem Almasarir, and Yahya Assiri, a dissident who was in frequent contact with Khashoggi, were also alleged by experts to have been targeted by Saudi cyber threats in that period.Two months after the killing on 2 October 2018, another story emerged. It was seemingly unrelated to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and was far more salacious.On 10 January 2019, the National Enquirer published a special edition that exposed Bezos had had an affair.More than a dozen other articles followed across various AMI publications, in what seemed to be a campaign against the CEO.The story of the extramarital relationship included intimate details – including the text messages he had sent to his girlfriend months earlier, text messages that were sent just days after Bezos’s mobile phone had been sent the WhatsApp message with the malicious file.Trump, an ardent critic of Bezos, the Washington Post, and Amazon, who was alleged in a media report to be “obsessed” with Amazon, appeared to revel in the news. “So sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post,” he tweeted. “Hopefully the paper will soon be placed in better \u0026amp more responsible hands!”The story did not end there. A few weeks later, on 7 February, Bezos published an extraordinary blogpost titled: “No thank you, Mr. Pecker” in which he described an elaborate “extortion” attempt by the owner of the National Enquirer, which had threatened in emails to publish intimate photographs of Bezos and of his girlfriend if the CEO did not agree to stop an investigation into how the National Enquirer had obtained its information.AMI insisted that it had not been “instigated, dictated or influenced in any manner by external forces, political or otherwise”.Bezos rejected the offer and published the email correspondence between them – which included a series of embarrassing descriptions of the photographs AMI alleged it possessed. “It’s unavoidable that certain powerful people who experience Washington Post news coverage will wrongly conclude I am their enemy,” Bezos wrote. “President Trump is one of those people, obvious by his many tweets. Also, the Post’s essential and unrelenting coverage of the murder of its columnist Jamal Khashoggi is undoubtedly unpopular in certain circles.”Other experts also weighed in. John Brennan, the former CIA director and CIA station chief in Riyadh, commented on MSNBC: “I have no doubt, given the Post’s relentless and appropriate condemnation of MBS for the killing of Khashoggi, that he would try to discredit, embarrass and hurt Bezos financially if he could.”A few weeks later, Bezos’s head of security, Gavin de Becker, published his own editorial in the Daily Beast, claiming that his investigation into the National Enquirer leaks had concluded that Saudi Arabia had accessed Bezos’s phone. He declined to publish any further details, but said he had given information about his investigation into the National Enquirer leaks to law enforcement officials. Both Saudi Arabia and Pecker’s AMI flatly denied the allegation and any suggestion that Saudi Arabia was involved in the matter.Bruce Riedel, a former CIA analyst and Saudi expert, said the potential “hack” of Bezos’s phone reflected the possibility of Saudi’s premeditation.It ultimately reflected a lack of understanding of how the US works, Riedel said, and how the Washington Post owner would react to such a threat. He also said the episode raised questions about what US intelligence agents may have known about the hack. It was another example, he said, of how the Trump administration had failed to hold MBS and the Saudis accountable for their alleged abuses.Last October, Bezos stood in front of the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and paid tribute to Khashoggi at a vigil to commemorate the one-year anniversary of his murder.“No one should ever have to endure what you did,” he said to Hatice Cengiz, Khashoggi’s fiancee. “You paced that street for hours, pacing and waiting. And he never came out. It’s unimaginable. And you need to know that you are in our hearts. We are here and you’re not alone.”Both Saudi Arabia and AMI have denied that the kingdom was involved in the publication of the Bezos story.A lawyer for Bezos who was contacted by the  said: “I have no comment on this except to say that Mr Bezos is cooperating with investigations.” asked the Saudi embassy in Washington about the claims. It did not immediately return a request for comment.Have you got new information about this story? You can message  investigations using Signal or WhatsApp: +447584640566.

I did the interview, it went very well, and for me it’s the best way to learn: it’s hands-on and you practise what you learn.”Property services is one of a raft of new “white collar” apprenticeships, with registrations jumping from just over 50 in 2018 to 90 this year.“There are people doing the course who have lots of experience, but don’t have the licences, so it’s also a route for them to do it,” adds Devery.While the basic salary is €20,000, he says there is also commission to be made from selling and renting, as well as expenses.“I could have ended up in a third-level degree course, studying for four years, working part-time to pay for it. But here I get paid to learn. I couldn’t recommend it enough.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4148230.1579730489!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"number of school leavers choosing apprenticeships doubles","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe bulk of apprentices are still in traditional craft areas which continue to be dominated by men.The number of school-leavers choosing apprenticeships has doubled in recent years as rising numbers of pupils look towards “earn and learn” options.Some 17,500 young people are now completing apprenticeships, more than twice the 8,300 in apprenticeships in 2015. Apprenticeships typically involve a combination of learning on-the-job with an employer as well as studying in college.Many new “white collar” apprenticeships in areas such as accounting, real estate and insurance pay learners between €17,000 and €30,000 a year.They typically offer a certificate or degree-level qualification at the end or a two- or three-year programme.While apprenticeships are growing in popularity, there is a major gender gap in the sector, with women accounting for just over 3 per cent – or 600 – of the 17,500 apprentices. The bulk of learners are still in traditional craft areas – such as construction, electrical, engineering and motor mechanics – which are dominated by men.Traditional craftOf the almost 6,000 or so new registrations in apprenticeships in 2019, almost 5,000 were in these traditional craft areas, while around 1,000 were in “new” apprenticeships.There is a much more even gender representation in these new apprenticeships which  areas such as financial services, laboratory analysis, hospitality and sales.In many of these new programmes, the number of potential apprentices applying for positions is higher than the number of employers available to employ them. For example, in the case of tech apprenticeships last year, there were more than 1,500 applications for just 34 apprentice jobs in the civil service. In the case of the accounting technicians’ apprenticeship, each year there have been on average three applications for every available job.Solas is planning for significant growth this year with a further 23 new apprenticeship programmes due to be launched. These new programmes will include training for the occupations of recruitment executive, sales specialists, advanced healthcare assistant and quantity surveyor.While demand is growing, Solas, the State body with responsibility for the sector, says take-up of new apprenticeships developed since 2016 by employers has been slower than envisaged.ObstaclesSome groups such as the Restaurants Association of Ireland say a key obstacle is the fact that employers must pay apprentices while they are at college.This is in contrast to other apprenticeships developed before 2016 – such those in the construction sector – where a training allowance is paid by the State to apprentices while attending off-the-job training. Solas has said this arrangement was a policy decision taken as part of the apprenticeship review in 2014. It says the new apprenticeship system was developed in consultation with educational institutions and industry and was aimed at allowing more flexibility in their design.Overall, it says, the number of participating employers is rising year-on-year.The numbers of employers hiring apprentices on the “new” apprenticeship programmes is increasing with a total of 540 employers in 2018 compared to around 1,000 at the end of 2019. Latest figures show there are more than 6,000 apprenticeship employers, compared to about 3,500 in 2015.To support apprenticeship expansion, the Government is due to provide an additional €27 million to develop the sector this year.Solas is planning to continue its “generation apprenticeship” campaign this year to boost awareness among school-leavers, and has also launched a new “apprenticeship jobs” platform online at apprenticeship.ie to make it easier to find vacancies."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Council chief made the offer over docklands liabilities in letter to Department of HousingWHO panel to decide whether to declare the latest outbreak an international emergencyRelative of Tuam baby says DNA scheme will help bring \u0026lsquojustice and closure\u0026rsquoSupport group says proposed DNA collection must happen as soon as possibleLee Devery is completing a two-year apprenticeship in property servicesFears of auction election grow as all parties make largely uncosted pledgesResearch lives: Dr Una FitzGerald, director of Galway Neuroscience Centre, NUIG, and founder of Galway Green LabsSecond Robert Boyle Winter School will examine critical contribution of Boyle and John TyndallUK prime minister\u0026rsquos post-Brexit promise a challenge to deliver, DUP\u0026rsquos Donaldson saysAfter Gavin Crowley failed to complete sale, Brian Leggett had issued proceedingsIrish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association published its election guide on WednesdayPerennial questions about Adams, opinion polls, paying for pensions and Bailey\u0026rsquos exitDeceased was carrying out repair work on a grain trailer in a yard in Whitegate near MidletonElection candidates should focus on policies with long-term social benefits, says coalitionDubliner fined \u0026euro500 over assault on one of Ireland\u0026rsquos best underage sportswomen"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4148434.1579735349!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 amicable splits and potential bedfellows in first leaders debate","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe two were  asked about what the public’s perception is of them conservative with a small c” for Micheál Martin, or “lacking empathy” for Leo Varadkar?Acrimonious break-ups, amicable splits and potential bedfellows.No, it was not an episode of Love Island, this was the first head-to-head leaders debate between Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Fianna Fáil leader Micheal Martin on Virgin Media News.“You could have dumped them much earlier,” Pat Kenny reminded Mr Martin, referencing the confidence and supply agreement. Not so, he retorted, they had to stay together for the sake of Brexit.Questioned about the philosophical difference between the two parties, Varadkar pointed out that in the past, in all of Fine Gael’s relationships with other parties they “parted as friends” and that it “ended amicably” with the Labour Party whereas the opposition’s pairings “collapsed in scandal and acrimony.”Asked if it was time that they both “got together and reunited” likes days of old, Varadkar admitted that if pressed, he would prop up a Fianna Fáil minority Government or even form a coalition.Observers outside the studio, who had pulled up a couch under a TV to watch the debate, whistled gently.In an anti-room, three ministers watched on. Paschal Donohoe, Simon Harris and Regina Doherty had arrived shortly after 9pm in a show of support for the Taoiseach. Mr Martin, in comparison, had arrived with his advisor.As was expected, the debate turned to the fortunes of the economy both past and present with the Fianna Fáil leader tackled on a claim that the economy has only just got back on track in the last two to three years partly thanks to the legacy of Fianna Fáil pre-2011.While Mr Martin did reference the “global meltdown” and admit his party “made mistakes,” Varadkar was quick off the mark to claim that there had been no real change since then.The two were then asked about what the public’s perception is of them conservative with a small c” for Mr Martin, or “lacking empathy” for Mr Varadkar?“I know people say that about me but I care deeply about the country and the problems that people face. I can’t put it into words as well as my opponent...but I do it in actions,” the Taoiseach faltered. It was a rare glimpse of emotion.There were skirmishes on housing and health with both leaders tearing apart each other’s election pledges resulting in Mr Martin asking his opponent “have you any shame at all.”The retort was swift: “we are both former health ministers, (but) I am willing to accept we didn’t get everything right. You’d swear he was a brilliant health minister... it is unbelievable arrogance.”Pat Kenny later mused that if either men had an unfortunate accident, both would get preferential access in an emergency ward.“In an emergency, if I have a heart attack or I have a stroke, or God forbid Micheál does...” at which a peel of laughter could be heard outside the studio. There was a more unusual moment later in the debate - which featured a silence that was around three seconds too long - when both were asked if they had ever taken illegal drugs. No, said, Micheál. The Fine Gael leader said he had answered that question in an interview with Hot Press many years ago. And that answer was? Yes. It was the most awkward moment of the debate, but mainly because of the prolonged delay in answering the question.After the break the two discussed Brexit and their problems with Sinn Féin. The Fianna Fáil leader took a hard line saying it was a moral issue.The debate ended the way it started, with musings and hand-wringing over who would do business with who after the election.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4148407.1579730286!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 record share of women running for d%C3%A1il seats","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe deadline has passed for candidates to get on the ballot paper for the general election on February 8th.

Candidates have another 24 hours until noon on Thursday to withdraw their names.The returning officer in Waterford declined to release the names or disclose the number of candidates ahead of the deadline for the receipt of withdrawals.Local estimates suggest there will be 13 candidates running in the constituency.The overall figures take account of businessman Peter Casey, who is running in two constituencies, Donegal and Dublin West, and Cork-based Sean O’Leary, an Independent listed as a businessman who is running in several constituencies in Dublin and Cork.Female candidatesOf all the parties, the Social Democrats has the highest proportion of female candidates with 11 out of 20 contenders – or 55 per cent of their representation.

The National Party has 10 candidates, six men and four women.The constituency with the largest number of candidates is the five-seater constituency of Wicklow – home to Fine Gael Minister for Health Simon Harris – which has 20 candidates running.The constituency with the fewest number of candidates is three-seater Cork North-West which has just nine people running.Wexford and the newly reformed Laois-Offaly have the largest number of candidates from a single party with Fianna Fáil fielding four contenders in both of the five-seaters.Kildare South stands out as the constituency with the highest proportion of women seeking a seat in the Dáil, with seven female candidates out of a field of 11. It is the only constituency with a majority of female candidates.The worst constituencies in terms of gender balance are Cork East and Donegal, which each have only one woman out of 13 candidates running.The youngest candidates are believed to be Louis O’Hara, Sinn Féin’s contender in Galway East, and Tate Donnelly, the Green candidate in Cavan-Monaghan, who are both 21, the minimum age to contest a general election.Among the oldest candidates are former Labour Kildare North TD Emmet Stagg who is 75, Fine Gael Kildare North TD Bernard Durkan who is 74 and former Fianna Fáil TD for Dublin South-West Charlie O’Connor who is 73.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4148410.1579731475!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord the left limbers up to woo mary lou","story":"Speaking at the People Before Profit general election manifesto launch, Richard Boyd Barrett called for a break with historical  Fianna Fail  Fine Gael government to create a fairer, more inclusive society in Ireland.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Everyone is jumping on the old age pension bandwagon now.It has become a major issue in the general election. Bríd Smith of People Before Profit thinks it’s going to be huge. “It will electrify the year of 2020.”She could have said “I told you so” at the party’s manifesto launch in Dublin on Wednesday, but her colleague Richard Boyd Barrett had that angle well covered. Richard and his fellow socialists were dead set against raising the pension eligibility age when it was neither popular nor people-before-profitable.They never wanted this “scandalous move” to happen in the first place. “We would like to emphasise that we are not johnny-come-latelys on that policy,” he sniffed, sounding ever-so-slightly piqued. “Everybody now seems to be talking about it.”Perhaps he should take it as a compliment, but he knows the main political parties have only come on board because they live in mortal dread of upsetting the cherished nanas and granddads of Ireland. The plan to raise the pension age in stages up to 68 has been in the pipeline for years, largely ignored because the people it will effect were not yet old enough to start getting properly angry.Over the topBut the first wave is fully advancing now and going over the top with gusto every day on Joe Duffy’s Liveline. Not good for the outgoing team in the middle of a tight election campaign. The power of Joe with a fearsome cast of incandescent pensioners queuing up to give out yards about the Government over the national airwaves has terrified Fine Gael. The other parties are also scrambling to protect their flanks as the expectant pensioners gather in strength.But can this campaign get any sweeter for angelic Sinn Féin – happily not among the ranks of the implicated? Well, the normally standoffish Boyd Barrett and chums came a-wooing on Wednesday, with even Paul Murphy going down on metaphorical bended knee (despite being a member of Rise) to seek Mary Lou’s hand in what he romantically termed “radically breaking the cycle”.It remains to be seen where that goes. Post-election promiscuity is almost guaranteed from all sides once the votes are counted. This makes Boyd Barrett (very keen on political abstinence) sad. “We are not going to trade away our principles and policies just to get a ministerial seat” like other political tarts.The living daylightsBut back to the pensioners, who may yet take to the streets to scare whatever is left of the living daylights out of Leo’s administration.Bríd Smith (Dublin South-West) wants people to “really pile on the pressure”. She starts the ball rolling on Saturday morning in her constituency with a protest in Cork Street and urges all People Before Profit candidates (27 in all) “and beyond” to do the same. “Call the grey vote together, get to your local social welfare office and demand they end this measure now.”The establishment, said Bríd, “always feel the pressure of the grey vote, in which I now include myself”.It’s a scandal, cried the permanently scandalised Boyd Barrett. Thousands of euro “will be robbed out of the pockets” of pensioners who worked hard all their lives by a heartless Government.As for the four political parties in the frame, “they have, between them, loaded the gun and pulled the trigger on the pension age and therefore committed a vast robbery of pensioners’ meagre finances,” added his proudly grey comrade Bríd.She can’t get over the U-turn. After standing by the age change, “now they’re all crying: ‘Oh, we wouldn’t do that. We wouldn’t.’”Amazing political influencerFrom being on the right side of the argument to seeing himself as an amazing political influencer, RBB decided to claim the credit for the different results in the two national opinion polls last week. The first, on Sunday, gave Fianna Fáil a huge 12-point lead over Fine Gael. The second, published by The  on Tuesday, saw that gap shorn back to a bare two points.At its campaign launch last week, People Before Profit argued that “the cycle of Fianna Fáil domination can be broken”. And lo and behold, didn’t that domination highlighted on Sunday shrink dramatically when the second set of figures came out.“In just a week since we put that message out – and I want to stress that we put that message out before anybody else did – we rejected the idea that this was a two-horse race between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael . . . Within a short week, that has become a reality,” boasted Richard.With such power over the electorate and a bigger three-week window, he should have considered running more candidates, along with an overall majority. Or then again, maybe the stunning result was not so much to do with Richard’s rhetorical powers of persuasion and more to do with the not-unusual case of two different polling companies, using different methods, producing different results.The ’ results indicated less than half of the electorate want to vote for the two big parties. Great news for People Before Profit.“We could be facing a historic moment,” carolled Boyd Barrett, daring to dream. “An earthquake where we finally break from the shackles of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael politics and set off towards a different future.”Seismic activityGino Kenny (Dublin Mid-West) was also hopeful on the seismic activity front. “A bit of an earthquake for the establishment parties.”He’s getting very definite tremors from the doorsteps. People want a change. “I think this will be actually a good election for the left.” The result might even turn out to be a “big surprise” for “the progressive left”.The thing is, though, in order to make an impression they need the weight of numbers from left-orientated Independents and parties. Paul Murphy (Dublin South-West) put it up to Sinn Féin.People don’t only want change. A substantial minority want “radical change”. That figure could Rise to a majority given the right conditions.“If Mary Lou McDonald came out and said clearly” she will not be voting for Leo Varadkar or Michéal Martin and that Sinn Féin will not prop up their parties in government, “there is a chance here for us to radically break the cycle.”Mary Lou might be flattered, but her party appears only to have eyes for Fianna Fáil at the moment.They should present a more united front, suggested Richard, particularly when the parties and Independents from the left have voted together many times in the Dáil on issues such as health, housing and the tax system. “We have often campaigned together and often very, very effectively.”So who might make up this grand, alternative coalition?“Look, I’ll let them categorise themselves.”That’s the end of that, so.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4148248.1579722463!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"targeting a d%C3%A1il seat like a military campaign","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCathal Berry is contesting the newly-enlarged Kildare South constituency. Photograph: Michael Donnelly. Dr Cathal Berry’s newly-opened campaign office in Newbridge has the air of a military command centre. In the middle of the room, a group are gathered around a table, discussing strategy. Smaller groups are dotted elsewhere, all engaged in deep conversation. One wall carries an Ordnance Service map with the newly-enlarged Kildare South constituency marked in purple. “I did that myself, by hand,” Berry says. There’s a reason for the somewhat martial atmosphere. Nearly everyone in the room is a former soldier, from sergeant to brigadier general. The few who are not are married, or related to soldiers.Until late last year, Berry was a Defence Forces commandant. Once, he was second-in-command of the elite Rangers. When he retired, Berry, who is also a medical doctor, led the Military Medical School. Now he is aiming to get one of the four seats up for grabs in Kildare South in next month’s general election. If successful, Berry will be the constituency’s first Independent TD.Political novicesAll of Berry’s some 30 volunteers are political novices, including his director of elections Brian Dowling, a retired colonel and the Army’s former director of ordnance.“I was volunteered for the role,” Dowling explains. It’s an army expression – you don’t volunteer, you are volunteered by someone else.” Like most people on “Team Berry”, Dowling had no political allegiances, until now.Berry and his team are driven by the Defence Forces’ “intolerable” pay and conditions, and a lack of respect, they believe, by the Government towards serving members and their families. This has driven the recruitment crisis, Berry says. Last year a record 850 personnel left the Permanent Defence Force, leaving it about 1,000 people below the establishment strength of 9,500.The third incumbent, Fianna Fáil’s Seán Ó Fearghaíl, is guaranteed one of the four seats due to his role as Ceann Comhairle in the last Dáil.Inexperience has led to one or two minor missteps. Sarah Walshe of the Wives and Partners of the Defence Forces campaign group had announced that she was running, ahead of Berry’s decision to contest.But she quickly withdrew, pledging to fight for a Seanad nomination. Equally, Berry avoided problems when a US-based former officer donated €4,000, an unwitting breach of election rules. The money was quickly returned.Despite inexperience, observers believe Berry has a good chance of picking up the last seat, not least because his online funding campaign has so far raised nearly €25,000. “And not all of it from military people,” says Berry.Equally, Kildare South has soldiers. About 3,000 serving soldiers, many based in the Curragh, live in the constituency. There are even more families, plus retired soldiers, living in and around Kildare.The question is whether they will vote. Traditionally soldiers do not, in large numbers, Berry concedes. “But they will turn out if you are motivated by someone.”If elected as an Independent Berry will support a minority government if Kildare South gets “our fair share”. Would he take a position as Minister for Defence? “Even if you look at Donald Trump’s original cabinet, there were four generals there who were the adults in the room,” Berry says. Trump soon got rid of all of them, he admits, but “who knows what they prevented?”If a ministerial post does not arise, Berry believes that having an ex-soldier in the Dáil would benefit everyone: “There’s a complete absence of information there right now,” he says.Defence policySuch experience is not just to argue for better conditions for former colleagues, it is also about shaping future defence policy, says Deirdre Carberry, who until last month was an infantry captain with 15 years’ service.She loved her time in the Defence Forces “and would recommend it anybody”, but she became frustrated by the lack of strategic thinking: “So it was time for me to try something else.” Today, she is Berry’s communications director. Berry was brave, she argues, to resign from the Defence Forces to campaign for better pay and conditions. “He’s someone who stands for something,” she says.Electing former soldiers is common elsewhere. Fifty-two Westminster MPs are veterans. Besides one or two former reservists, the Dáil has no veterans, “aside from maybe some of the Shinners”, jokes one of Berry’s team.This is maybe because Irish people “get a bit antsy” when they hear the subject of defence in a political context, Berry says. “It’s a bit of a taboo subject. It’s associated with wars, it’s associated with colonial domination.”However, Berry is not “a one-trick pony”, cautions retired Brigadier General Ger Aherne quickly. Indeed, Berry’s primary target is the health service, something he has seen first-hand as a front-line doctor.Irish patients could be treated in other European Union countries: “Ireland exports food because it has a surplus. Some countries have a surplus. We should be tapping into this, but nobody talks about it.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4148137.1579714933!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu to launch europe wide debate on future of the union","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA pro-EU,  anti-Brexit protester in London: The willingness of EU leaders to circumvent MEPs’ involvement in the election of commission president Ursula von der Leyen has led to calls to give them more teeth. Photograph: Ben StansallAFPIt’s an explicit recognition that the whole Brexit affair reflected a wide alienation of citizens across the EU. The EU must now find ways of bridging that gulf, and the Conference on the Future of Europe, to be launched in Dubrovnik in May – 70 years after the signing of the Schuman Declaration and 75 years after the end of the second World War – is supposed to do that.The two-year conference, we are told, will be broadly representative and tap into the perspectives of member states through the EU Council, MEPs, the European Commission, national parliaments, regional authorities and NGOs, as well as initiating dialogue between citizens at national level.They will all be “contributing as equal partners”, we are told – exactly how is not clear.On Wednesday, the commission outlined its view of the scope and organisation of the conference and MEPs did so earlier in the week. They even optimistically named former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt to chair the whole thing.Member state ambassadors have also discussed the idea and, it has to be said, reflected varying degrees of enthusiasm for the great project.One Irish diplomat suggests the exercise, although worthy, must not be allowed to occupy “too much bandwidth” in the EU’s agenda.The obsessive preoccupation of the union with its internal organisation during the last three years’ negotiations over Brexit, and the seemingly endless talk on how to complete economic and monetary union, are issues which, though important, have to become a thing of the past, critics say.If the union is to demonstrate its relevance to citizens and engage them more, they say, it must first of all demonstrate that it can bring real added value to tackling issues that affect them, from climate change to jobs, the digital economy or projecting the EU on the world stage.‘More streamlined’The ambassadors’ statement says the organisation of the conference should involve “shared ownership” by EU institutions, “equality between the institutions at all levels”, and calls for “respect for each institution’s prerogatives”. “The majority of member states would prefer a leaner and more streamlined governance,” the document says.The three institutions will come together to produce a joint position over the next month.Member states like Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden are particularly concerned at the ambition expressed by many MEPs to come up with treaty changes. In Ireland that would almost certainly mean a referendum, a prospect the Government is most keen to avoid.Even treaty changes intended to empower citizens risk being rejected by an electorate that has shown in the past on two notable occasions its willingness to vote down EU treaty changes for reasons that appear to have little to do with the question on the ballot.In December,\u0026nbspPortuguese prime minister António\u0026nbspCosta tweeted that he would call on European institutions and countries to “make use of the large untapped potential of the treaty to develop policies that respond to the legitimate expectations of our citizens, rather than embarking on\u0026nbspsterile institutional reforms”.“There will be treaty changes,” Brigid Laffan says. Laffan, a professor in the European University in Florence, says Ireland needs to prepare for referendums well in advance by initiating broad discusssion at home on the future of the union.Digital economyThe agenda will be as broad as participating citizens want, says commissioner Dubravka\u0026nbspŠuica, vice-president for democracy and demography.That will involve two major strands of discussion: first, an overview of the key policy issues the union faces, from climate change to the digital economy and second, the institutional reformdemocracy issues, notably the lead candidate system, known as spitzenkandidat, and transnational lists for elections to the European Parliament.The willingness of EU leaders to circumvent MEPs’ involvement in the election of commission president Ursula von der Leyen has led to calls to give them more teeth – a clearly democratic election system for the commission president will give voters a greater sense of ownership of the union’s executive.But that contention is not universally shared any more than the idea of electing MEPs from Europe-wide constituencies – a recipe for concentrating power in the larger member states, critics say.The conference agenda will also include, Suica promises, a discussion of improving the ease of decision-making through the further reduction of unanimity voting.Areas like foreign policy, economic management and taxation remain within the purview of veto voting – extending majority voting to these areas would also extend the remit of MEPs to contribute to these decisions. But perhaps that’s all too ambitious.You will be hearing more about the conference – much more. It’s coming to a location near you."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4145269.1579516519!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit eu citizens want physical card to prove right to stay in uk","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA report found nine out of 10 EU citizens in the UK would prefer a card over digital evidence  of their rights. File photograph: Will OlivierEPAThe British government is facing fresh calls to issue EU citizens with a physical document to prove they have the right to stay in the country after Brexit.A report found nine out of 10 EU citizens in the UK would prefer a card over the digital evidence they have now to demonstrate their rights in future to employers, banks or landlords.Fears over discrimination, loss of identity and a continuing lack of trust in the government’s willingness to deliver guaranteed lifetime rights emerged as serious concerns in the research – the biggest survey of EU, European Economic Area (EEA) and Swiss citizens in the UK to date.Tanja Bueltmann, a professor at Northumbria University who designed and conducted the poll along with the campaign group the3million, said: “The survey documents, without question, we have an ‘unsettling status’.“This extends beyond the application process, revealing an erosion of trust an erosion of wellbeing and an erosion of the sense of belonging among survey respondents.“The government has a duty to finally give EUEEA and Swiss citizens certainty. Hollow words are not enough.”The findings came just days after the government gave the European parliament’s Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, reassurances that EU citizens would not be automatically deported if they failed to apply for the settled status scheme.The survey, published on Monday, found that nine in 10 of those polled were unhappy about the lack of a physical document to demonstrate their right to remain in the country after they had been granted settled status or pre-settled status.As many as 11 per cent said they had already been asked for settled status proof, even though this is not legally required.This echoes a warning by private landlords that tenants could face discrimination because of the lack of a physical document.On the plus side, many of those surveyed reported a positive experience of the settled status app, with a majority of respondents saying the application process worked well.As many as 97.1 per cent of the 3,171 valid responses to the survey said they had received the status decision they expected.However, the emotional response to having to apply and the consequences of being labelled as someone with “settled status” was largely adverse. The words most frequently used by respondents to describe their feelings were “angry”, “anxious” and “unwanted”.Even those who had already been granted settled status felt worse off, with 80 per cent either strongly agreeing or agreeing that they felt anxious.Eight out of 10 said the process made them stressed and many thought citizenship was far more secure.Maike Bohn, co-founder of the3million, said the report underlined the lack of trust after three years of mixed messages.“Are we the much-quoted ‘neighbours, colleagues, friends’ or are we the ‘queue jumpers, benefits scroungers, unwelcome guests, draining the NHS’?“The government needs to step up local outreach and support, both to EUEEA and Swiss citizens but also to employers, landlords and others who will be forced to check the immigration status of these citizens in order to avoid huge fines.”The British Home Office said the scheme was working and a digital solution was better than a physical document. “This digital status future-proofs their rights and is linked to their passport or ID card, replacing physical documents which can get lost, stolen, damaged, tampered with and expire,” it said.–Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

His celebrity crush is Lily James.Meanwhile, the show has been sponsored by fast fashion brands (Missguided and then I Saw it First) for the last three years, giving viewers the opportunity to shop the female Islanders’ looks directly. Personally, I’ve always thought that Love Island contestants dress terribly: it’s Benidorm beaches meets Kardashian kitsch. But with prices starting at £5, the clothes are devastatingly cheap. Far cheaper than the designer garb we see on most TV stars. So I can understand the appeal. But I also know that every time someone buys one of those bikinis, or sparkly bodycon dresses, they’re adding fuel to fast fashion’s ever-blazing fire.But perhaps the onus is not on the consumer, or even the Love Island star. Lauren Bravo, author of How to Break Up with Fast Fashion, explains that the brands are the ones who should really be shouldering responsibility here. “These days we’re so used to instant gratification, and the idea that anyone can aspire to celebrity, that it seems reasonable for TV stars to sell us clothes and vice versa,” she tells me. “And it’s really hard, because I know what it’s like to love fashion and crave the clothes you’re seeing on people you admire, not to mention the huge social pressures on young people to keep that endless parade of new looks rolling over on their Instagram grid, so telling people who can’t necessarily afford to spend any more that their shopping habits are destroying the planet can feel snobbish and unfair.”Why I\u0027m giving up fast fashion #20PledgesBut, Bravo adds, the fact remains that those clothes simply cannot be made as cheaply as they’re sold. Somewhere down the line, someone is paying the price, whether it’s a garment worker barely surviving on poverty wages or a community grappling with industrial pollution.That’s not to say you can’t “get the Islander look” in a sustainable and eco-friendly way. Bravo suggests heading to secondhand shopping apps, like Depop, where you’ll find plenty of pre-loved items not dissimilar from the ones you see on the show. Some of them will be from fast fashion brands, but if you’re buying it there, you’re keeping that item in circulation as opposed to letting it wind up in landfill.\u0026nbspOr, you could take a closer look at some of the trends championed by Love Islanders, both past and present, and see that many (cycling shorts, mesh, high-waisted jeans and leopard print) hark back to another era, like, say, the 1990s. And what better way to shop Nineties fashion than by heading to your local Beyond Retro or Rokit, which will be jam-packed with original clothing from the decade that is not only more sustainable, but a hell of a lot cooler, too.How to Break Up with Fast Fashion by Lauren Bravo (£12.99, Headline Home) is out nowOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After the initial 18-month period comes to an end – which for many people will be next month – those who have not brought down their balances could be put on to a payment plan or face more severe options.Akansha Nath, credit expert at Credit Karma, which commissioned the survey, said: “It’s daunting to think that we might be well into April before we’re consistently back in the black, but rather than using ‘quick fixes’ to free up some extra cash, there are lots of simple ways to get back in control of our finances, from creating a new budget to reviewing all outgoings or transferring debts to a 0 per cent balance transfer card.”Borrowers seeking a zero per cent credit card now have less choice available to them as banks have withdrawn some cards from the market and reduced the interest-free periods.This month, Bank of England research showed that the length of balance transfer deals reduced markedly and the availability of unsecured debt decreased towards the end of 2019 as lenders became more nervous about the UK economy.Financial website Moneyfacts says the number of cards that allow balance transfers has dropped by more than a third in the past three years to reach a record low.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After the initial 18-month period comes to an end – which for many people will be next month – those who have not brought down their balances could be put on to a payment plan or face more severe options.Akansha Nath, credit expert at Credit Karma, which commissioned the survey, said: “It’s daunting to think that we might be well into April before we’re consistently back in the black, but rather than using ‘quick fixes’ to free up some extra cash, there are lots of simple ways to get back in control of our finances, from creating a new budget to reviewing all outgoings or transferring debts to a 0 per cent balance transfer card.”Borrowers seeking a zero per cent credit card now have less choice available to them as banks have withdrawn some cards from the market and reduced the interest-free periods.This month, Bank of England research showed that the length of balance transfer deals reduced markedly and the availability of unsecured debt decreased towards the end of 2019 as lenders became more nervous about the UK economy.Financial website Moneyfacts says the number of cards that allow balance transfers has dropped by more than a third in the past three years to reach a record low.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But with utilities like water and energy, she said she would give companies a chance to show they can deal with problems like excessive profits if they wanted to avoid being taken back into public ownership.She said she would not scrap the HS2 high-speed rail link between London and the Midlands or the renewal of the Trident nuclear deterrent.But she refused to say whether she would press the nuclear button if the country came under attack, insisting that she would follow former prime ministers including Margaret Thatcher in keeping the UK’s enemies guessing about Britain’s strategy.After playing video footage of her smiling as Ms Butler said that “if anyone doesn’t hate Brexit, even if you voted for it, there’s something wrong with you”, Neil told Ms Thornberry that her expression showed she was sneering.She responded indignantly: “I was not sneering… I really object to this.“When they say that I sneer at people, they forget who I am and where I come from.”Ms Thornberry, who was brought up in a council house in Guildford by her mother after her parents’ orce and went on to become a barrister, has previously been forced to defend herself against allegations of sneering over a tweet apparently mocking a white van driver whose home was decked with England flags.She told Neil: “It is the prime minister who has said that blue-collar workers like my brother, who is a builder, are largely unemployed, have low self-esteem and are drunk.“He is talking about my brother. No-one says that Boris Johnson sneers at people.“Somebody like me who comes from a council estate and from a single parent background, I don’t sneer at people, I listen to them.”Ms Thornberry said she had been “laughing at Dawn saying the most extraordinary things”, adding: “I have never sneered and it’s not right to say so, and I do not accept that.”Challenged over her decision to send her son to a partially selective comprehensive school 14 miles away from their north London home, Ms Thornberry replied: “As a politician, what I want to do is make sure we have good schools up and down the country.“But as a mother, I will never apologise for doing the best for my kids. Any mother watching this will agree with me.“As the victim of selective education who failed her 11-plus and went to a secondary modern, I feel very strongly about this.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The varied landscapes and lives of residents wedged in these borderlands speak of two different systems that have coexisted on one another’s doorstep.Far from the marches and salvos of tear gas and petrol bombs over the past half-year of anti-government protests that have convulsed Hong Kong, the residents in this border realm have borne witness to both rapid urbanisation, as China booms, and the preservation of a slower pace of life.About 20 miles\u0026nbsplong, this boundary meanders between fish ponds, farmland, sleepy traditional villages and grassy hills on the Hong Kong side, with the gleaming skyscrapers of China’s high-tech city of Shenzhen on the other. Shenzhen, once itself the bucolic backwater, has risen into China’s giddy vision of a digital, high-tech future.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHong Kong is world’s most visited city in 2019We may have won the elections battle, but the war is ongoingHong Kong police ‘hack into more than 3,700 mobile phones’Mr\u0026nbspLam, now in his eighties, lives in a house without mobile phone reception, where he farms and catches crabs. A narrow sliver of water separates him from mainland China. He recalls living in a wooden cabin along the Shenzhen River\u0026nbspwith his family 70 years ago. There were only “old and broken” sheds on the far shore back then, he says, gazing into the distance. “Of course, the mainland is much more advanced than before. Everything is good, even the streets are beautiful.”Over past decades of political upheaval in communist China, waves of mainlanders flooded across the border into Hong Kong, seeking peace and a better life. Lam still remembers the flashlights of the British-run police piercing the dark as they chased illegal immigrants making a dash for freedom.Andrew Kwok, an old fish farmer living in the area, recalls those who drowned making the perilous crossing. “There were a lot of them, hundreds of dead bodies in the river,” he says.The flickering, lonely torches have now been replaced by a vibrant mega-city with a million flashing lights. The living quality for people on both sides may have converged, but a gulf remains. For these two peoples, it remains a struggle to reconcile shifting eras, values and dreams.Merrin Ke, 23, grew up in Shenzhen but got her masters degree from Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University. She had flitted easily between both sides, up until recently, when she moved to Shanghai. “I think the situation in Hong Kong is quite sensitive now, which is easy for people to have conflicts due to different political stands,” she says. “That’s why I’ve decided to leave Hong Kong to work and get away from the intense environment.”Even though the protests in Hong Kong show no sign of abating, Ke remains optimistic unity will overcome ision. She says: “Hong Kong people used to come to have fun in Shenzhen and people from mainland China also liked to visit Hong Kong. But now such things are becoming less and less. I still hope everyone can put differences aside, and it’s not enough for just one side to do this. It requires the joint efforts of both sides.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She should have asked herselfshe was willing and able to behave in accordance with the expectations.Her Majesty’s words show great diplomacy but Meghan’s behaviour has so far not been diplomatic. A diplomat wouldn’t fall out with her own family.Her friends leaked negative comments about the “toxic” Royal Family. She also allowed damage to be done against our family via friends and PR advisers.She watched the media taunt and torture my dad, never springing to his defence like a true humanitarian would.Thomas was an incredible dad. He paid every penny of her education and cared greatly for her.He is now frail, with a heart condition. He doesn’t have a PR team to spin him a good story.The Queen, at , shouldn’t have had to face the stress of seeing her family torn apart.Meghan hasn’t stepped forward to minimise the damage.She knows how Harry leaving has affected them, but she hasn’t spoken up in their defence.Yet in her statement, the Queen says she is “particularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family”.Her Majesty is building bridges there. It would be goodMeghan could do the same.She could have expressed her thanks for the kindness of the Queen and Prince Charles.She could have expressed gratitude to her own father or her first husband, Trevor, who gave her career opportunities.My sister has become a totally dferent person, choosing wealth and fortune over family.Her decision to leave is nothing to do with the behaviour of the royals, or race.Her marriage to Prince Harry was so symbolic of ethnic unity.The preacher and choir were all of African heritage. It was a lovely joining together.The royals embraced that. They welcomed Meghan into their lives, into the culture, and allowed her to promote people of all races. I have never heard anything racist coming out of the Windsors about my sister.Supporters who claim a racist element forced Meghan out are frustrated their hoped-for fairytale princess didn’t work out.These social equality-obsessed people had pinned their hopes on Meghan. They hoped for an equality of race right at the higher echelons of society.At least Harry and Meghan were right to decide tothe £.million they received to renovate Frogmore Cottage and not take any more public funds.In the Queen’s statement, she hopes Meghan and Harry can “start building a happy and peaceful le”. We have to hope for the sake of my sister and for the Royal Family that this agreement achieves that aim.My fear is Meghan’s decision isn’t about moving to Canada for a quiet le as a young mother.Nothing about their actions so far suggest they truly desire a private le out the limelight.They have paraded themselves on the red carpet, tried to make deals with Disney, and become pals with the Clooneys and other A-list stars.Smooching up to Vogue magazine, to fashion and to the film industry is not consistent with taking a step back.Their objective is fame and fortune — to be Hollywood.Meghan’s goals are not consistent with those of the Royal Family. Personally, I don’t believe she ever expected to fit in with the strict structures and traditions of the Windsor household.Even after marrying she kept her lawyer and publicity adviser, suggesting she wasn’t willing to sever her ties with her old le.Perhaps she always had the idea toto her le as an actress and lestyle influencer.In the statement from Buckingham Palace, it says “the Sussexes have made clear everything they do will continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty”.My concern is that this is a face-saving statement, which won’t work in reality. The Royal Family has always been opposed to merchandising and corporate endeavours outside of them.If Meghan and Harry want to honour the Queen, they will consult her before doing deals.She thinks she can be at the top of the world, but using the royals to get that international notoriety is tacky.Meghan was a cable TV actress before marrying Harry and would not be on the front of every newspaper and magazine without him.In the US, the Press is still positive, praising her attempts to modernise the British monarchy and saying how cool she is.The media in Calornia and New York are likely to remain in her corner but I don’t think Meghan and Harry will ever be able to overshadow Prince William and his we Catherine.They are exemplary they are iconic. There is no comparison.It is clear Meghan cares for Archie, but I do worry about his future. There doesn’t seem to have been a lot of consideration given to his cousins George, Charlotte and Louis and how often he will see them. Harry has put Meghan above his brother, father and grandmother. A house ided cannot stand.I am worried that Meghan and Harry will never find true ­happiness. They could not find contentment with the Royal Family, will they be able to find it away from them Maybe they will meet up with counsellors who can help them to heal the wounds.Perhaps they will make amends by apologising.We need sincerity and dignity from Meghan in order to find peace. Then, perhaps, she will have the peace she needs to go forward.I loved my sister, but I do not like the person she has become.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He warned the Left’s obsession is providing a cloak for crime.The Sussexes’ decision to quit was “not racism”, he told a cheering crowd. “We’re the most tolerant, lovely country in Europe.”Signicantly, the applause came not from the far Right but from right-on BBC Question Time — an audience carefully chosen, stressed presenter Fiona Bruce, to reflect Britain by age, sex and politics.Fox — famous as DS James Hathaway in TV’s Lewis — was instantly denounced as a “privileged white male” and therefore with no right to an opinion.“Oh, God!” he cried. “I can’t help what I am, I was born like this. It’s an immutable characteristic, so to call me a white privileged male is to be racist.”His landmark moment went viral.Ricky Gervais spoke for the silent majority when he told the Golden Globes nominees “who know nothing about the real world” to tear up their political speeches.But it took the furore over Megxit — and Fox’s unanswerable case for the defence — to trigger Britain’s own fightback.Fox has given a voice to ordinary, decent citizens who are incensed by finger-wagging know-alls smearing them as racists, Nazis and fascists.These ugly insults were hurled at millions who backed Brexit and the overwhelming majority who voted for Boris Johnson.Until now we’ve been too polite to fight back, gagged by Thought Police who bark: “You can’t say that.”So we put up with politically correct sniping from such “identity” obsessives as rapper Stormzy, MP Clive Lewis and the entire Labour Party, who smell racism under every rock.Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan sparked uproar when he challenged black and Asian commentators to produce a “shred of evidence” of Press racism. They failed.Fox’s one-man mission is more than a poke at the PC brigade. It is about free speech — and hypocrisy.Scattergun charges of racism offer an alibi to serious crime, he says, citing the Pakistani sex gangs who systematically raped and trafficked white victims across Britain — with police blessing.“It’s one of the dangerous things about throwing racism around,” the actor told Question Time.“People become so conscious of it that things like the Manchester grooming scandal get ignored.”He spoke as police finally confessed to deliberately turning a blind eye to decades-long vile abuse of vulnerable, underage white girls.A police report confirms a -year reign of sex abuse went unchecked after an unnamed chief inspector ruled: “With it being Asians, we can’t afford for this to be coming out.”Fear of the race card also partly explains why police failed to halt the slaughter of mostly black victims by mostly black kne gangs.The same “cultural cringe” stops prison staff tackling dangerous Islamist gangs who have seized control in Britain’s terror jails.It’s why forced marriage and honour killings go unchecked.Now, at last, black and Asian voices are bravely confronting the race zealots.Leading commentator and ex-Equality Commissioner Trevor Phillips, son of poor immigrants, condemns “feel- good” racism detectorists.“It might make ‘right-on’ white liberals feel better,” he says. “But the price of their smugness is an ongoing bloody massacre of black children.”Home Secretary Priti Patel, daughter of Uganda-Indian migrants, has declared war on the race industry.The BBC strenuously denies “institutional bias”, despite abundant evidence from within the Beeb itself – including from former Director-General Mark Thompson.Now Boris Johnson is in power and the bloated corporation’s £BILLION subsidy is at risk.Perhaps that’s why Question Time is now apparently balanced, Andrew Marr is being polite to Tory guests and on Radio ’s Today, Nick Robinson has gone almost silent.“We live in a great country, a land of opportunity for all,” she said. “Institutionalised, corrosive behaviour that disregards victims has to end.“Tackling this abuse is a priority for the Home Office. There will be no no-go areas.”At last, perhaps, we have a senior politician of colour who is prepared to follow Laurence Fox’s advice and “speak truth to nonsense”.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On the contrary, it is an abdication that has sadly plunged him into turmoil.He is a man pulled in opposite directions, torn between patriotic duty and his deep love for his we, between his loyalty to the monarchy and his desire for a new, less constrained role.That explains why, throughout the recent crisis that he and Meghan inflicted on the House of Windsor, his stance has been so confused and contradictory.He speaks of his devotion to Britain but seeks a fresh start in Canada.He expresses his desire to serve but gives up the commitments that go with his position.He trumpets his yearning for privacy, yet he and his we appear keen to set themselves up as a millionaire celebrity couple - hardly the way to avoid attention.He continually wails about media intrusion, yet he resigns as Captain-General of the Royal Marines so he can spend more time on his social media accounts.He and the Duchess endlessly talk about their need for emotional support, yet they have shown little concern for the needs of their own families.Those inconsistencies were graphically exposed in the speech he made on Sunday night at a charity dinner in London to try and justy his recent conduct.His address was given in the immediate aftermath of the deal reached at Sandringham, where he and Meghan agreed to the loss of public funding and the use of their titles infor their independence.It was clear that the saga had exacted a heavy toll on him. In a voice often cracking with emotion, he told his audience that they would “hear the truth from me”.But what they actually heard was a catalogue of embittered anguish.As often, he moaned about the press, which he painted as a sinister, powerful force which needs to be curtailed.Unfortunately, despite all his professed love of Britain, Harry appears to have no understanding that a free, open media is essential to our democracy.He has proved unable to handle any criticism at all – even when it is justied, as in the hypocrisy of his green campaigning while indulging in the use of private jets.It is ashe thinks the media should be filled with fawning sycophants who never scrutinise but just lavish him with praise.That is the kind of regime that belongs to a totalitarian dictatorship, not traditionally liberal Britain.Much of Harry’s hostility to journalists stems from their relationship with his mother. But, however understandable, this is another myth.Princess Diana was not naïve when it came to the press. She was a shrewd, sometimes ruthless operator, who was quite willing to exploit the newspapers when it suited her.With some indignation, he complained that the Sandringham deal was not what he wanted. But it was foolish of him to believe that he and Meghan could have semi-detached Royal status, enjoying its privileges without its obligations.The Queen could never have tolerated that, especially because any commercial deals reached by the Sussexes could have badly compromised her family, just as their cherished fashionable causes could have undermined the Crown.Royalty cannot be a vehicle for self-enrichment or political posturing.The Duke’s inner agony was at its most obvious when he spoke of his regrets for the le he is leaving.Having revealed that he and Meghan were excited to “fly the flag and carry out our roles for this country with pride”, he referred to his “great sadness” at the step they have taken.Yet he claimed that they had “really no other option”. It was another moment of self-deceit, for there were certainly other courses open to them.They could have either stuck to their Royal positions without creating such a psycho drama about themselves, or,they really wanted freedom without scrutiny, they could have retired to live quietly as ordinary citizens, as some other members of the Royal family have done in the past.But such modesty would not have fulfilled their ambitions to be globe-trotting celebrities.It is this craving for fame that highlights the emptiness of Harry’s language about his devotion to service. “I will continue to be the same man who holds his country dear and dedicates his le to supporting the causes, charities and military communities so important to me,” he declared at the charity dinner.Yet this is the same man who was revealed to have touted his we’s voiceover skills to Disney bosses at the London premiere of the Lion King last summer.In the eyes of their critics, the real dedication that Harry and Meghan will probably soon show is to TV deals, book advances, and brand partnerships.In a further attempt to justy their actions, Harry implied that they had been suffering for a long time through the crushing restrictions of Royal le.The final move had been made, he explained, “after so many months of talks and so many years of challenges.”He and Meghan have only been married for  months. A true model of stoical determination, the Queen has been on the throne for almost  years without any public complaint.That just illustrates Harry’s lack of perspective. Insulated by privilege, he has little understanding of the lives of ordinary British citizens, many of whom have endured far greater struggles than anything he has ever experienced.After the Queen had been so publicly generous about him and Meghan in her statement from Sandringham at the weekend, saying that “they will always be much loved members of my family,” it was bad manners of Harry to complain about the deal he had just accepted.He should have responded to his grandmother’s generosity in the same spirit.But what’s done is done. Our monarchy has survived its latest crisis. The moment for recriminations has passed now that a new chapter is about to begin.As he settles in Canada, Prince Harry is bound to miss aspects of his old le in Britain, which even now he describes as “my home and the place I love.And the British public will miss him. At his best, he brought a lovable humour, spontaneity and lack of convention to the Royal Family.We can only hope that now, after taking this drastic decision, he finds the peace that he and Meghan crave.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Which makes Hall’s defence of the licence fee even more ridiculous.In an era of multiple-choice subscription TV it is absurd for one broadcaster to be funded by a tax enforceable by criminal penalty.It is even more laughable to claim it “ensures independence­ . . . obliges us to serve everyone and reflect every part of the UK”.Hall’s BBC spent his entire tenure turning a deaf ear to half the UK. Hence its shock at last month’s Tory triumph.Hall’s decision to rob over-s of the free licences he agreed to in  was equally outrageous.The idea that the £million cost will harm vital BBC services, when so much of its content amounts to needless competition with commercial rivals, is fatally flawed.His successor must run a smaller Beeb, more in touch with the public, less in the grip of suffocating “wokeness”, focused not on gratuitous expansion but the high-quality shows it does best.This new chief should accept that non-payment of the licence must be decriminalised and the levy finally replaced with a voluntary subscription.Only then will the BBC join the st Century.THE problem with Harry saying he and Meghan had no option but to move abroad to avoid our “powerful media” is that not a word of it is true.It is sheer paranoia to say the Press has done anything but legitimately scrutinise a publicly-funded couple.And the reality is they do not want to avoid media. They want to avoid criticism.Indeed they crave media attentionit meekly writes their PR puff pieces. Corbyn’s Labour is the same.As for having no choice, what drivel.They could have grown up, developed a thicker skin and done their royal duty as they first promised.To pretend that dark forces made them seek a vast fortune as A-list celebs in the LA sunshine is self-serving cobblers.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You have to be creative and aggressive and think two steps ahead of the celebrity.”And therein lies the rub. Largely stripped of his royal status, Harry is now a common-or-garden celebrity who has to take his chances with the rest of them in the jungle of hustling for work amid bustling premiere crowds.Then there’s news website TMZ and its myriad wannabe imitations. They’ll be dogging his every move with a video camera, hoping to catch a magical clickbait moment.Its website — together with a frenzied voiceover — is already jokingthat Meghan might sign up for The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.As a former actress on cable show Suits,Meghan was of little interest to the Hollywood glitterati and the parasites that feed off them.But now  She’s gold-dust — particularly as her inner circle includes A-listers such as the Clooneys, Serena Williams, Oprah and the Obamas. And therein lies yet another rub. If you attend premieres of movies you’re not in, holiday on rich people’s jets and yachts and hang out at members-only clubs where the hoi polloi are only allowed in to clean up after you . . . then you are wilfully choosing a “celebrity le” and, with that, comes media attention, particularly from the Wild West of online.They need you for clickbait, and you need them to maintain the “popularity” upon which you trade and, without which, you are nothing .Unless, of course, you have a God- given talent like Meryl Streep, Judi Dench, Gary Oldman, Benedict Cumberbatch etc, etc — all of whom put on a suit frock when they have a film to promote but otherwise live a perfectly normal, unremarkable and, therefore, largely “peaceful le” unbothered by the media.Or a member of the British Royal Family who can retreat to one of their many estates for a spot of fishing and contemplation.So . . . “a more peaceful le” outside the protective environs of the monarchy  Dream on.But then, deep down, one suspects that Harry and Meghan both know that and are simply using it as a smokescreen for the real story.His we was homesick, found royal duties restrictive and dull and wanted toto her old le with royal knobs on.And because Harry loves her: “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.”Good luck to them. Genuinely. But let’s not pretend they had no other option because of something this country did or didn’t do.HARRY and Meghan might be forced to ditch their proposed Sussex Royal brandThe Queen sees it as cashing in on their former royal status.As they’ve already registered it for everything from magazines to mugs, dropping it altogether could prove expensive.So perhaps a little tweak — to  Sussex Royle — might be an easy and appropriate compromise As the incomparable Jim Royle, aka Ricky Tomlinson, might say: “Have their cake and eat it  . . My a***.”SHORTLY after actor Laurence Fox’s sterling, anti-PC performance on Question Time last week, he was predictably hosed down on Twitter by the usual virtue-signalling suspects.Including this from singer Lily Allen.“Sick to death of luvvies like aLawrence Fox going on TV and forcing their opinions on everybody , when he’ll never have to deal with what normal people have to deal with in his gated community.“Stick to acting mate. Instead of ranting about things you don’t know anything about.”Lily, for those in blissful ignorance, is a former public school girl fond of forcing her opinions on everyone  from the comfort of, among other locations, her former mansion in the Cotswolds which, according to Vogue, was: “Hidden away down a deliciously long drive.”That, folks, is what they call irony.Or should we now call it Alleny ROSIE Huntigton-Whiteley says she looks this way because most days she doesn’t eat past pm.She adds that, since having her two-year-old son Jack: “Things don’t sit where they used to, but I’ve come to terms with it.”Yep, I think I could also come to terms with things not sitting where they used tothey sat whereRosie’s things do.EVERY so often, amid all the headlines of gloom and despair, we are bathed in the warm glow that comes from a small slice of humanity.Remember when little Oscar Saxelby-Lee needed a le-saving stem cell donation and thousands  of people from his home city of Worcester queued up to seethey matched Ultimately, a crowd-funding campaign raised £k to send him to Singapore for pioneering treatment and, this week, it was announced that he’s free from cancer.Or what about the two Tesco workers in Southend, Essex, who, upon noticing that a regular customer hadn’t been in, looked through her letterbox and found her lying unresponsive in the hallway.Thanks to them giving a damn, she is now recovering in hospital.Local heroes, every last one of them.THE Duke and Duchess of Cambridge hosted African leaders and our own PM at Buckingham Palace.

They also expose non-smokers to nicotine and other harmful chemicals.They are particularly risky when used by adolescents. Nicotine is highly addictive and young people’s brains develop up to their mid-twenties.Exposure to nicotine can have long-lasting, damaging effects.When askedvapes were less dangerous than regular cigarettes, the organisation would not give a definitive answer.They said: This depends on a range of factors, including the amount of nicotine and other toxicants in the heated liquids, but we know that e-cigarettes pose clear health risks and are by no means safe.Despite this, top doctors have hit back at the World Health Organisations comments, instead claiming that e-cigarettes are substantially safer.Dr Nick Hopkinson, Reader in Respiratory Medicine at the National Heart and Lung Institute Imperial College London, said: We know that e-cigarettes are substantially safer than smoking, because the toxic substances present in cigarette smoke are either completely absent, or present at much lower levels.Similarly, Prof Peter Hajek, Director of the Tobacco Dependence Research Unit at Queen Mary University of London slammed the World Health Organisation.He added: The WHO has a history of anti-vaping activism that is damaging their reputation. This document is particularly malign. Practically all the factual statements in it are wrong.Since  Public Health Englandhas encouraged smokers to switch to vaping, claiming it is  per cent safer than smoking tobacco.However it has since emerged that a study used by PHE to advise that vaping was safe was funded by the e-cigarette industry.And some experts have now questioned the  per cent figure and called for PHE to stop recommending e-cigarettes.Latest figures from the Department of Healthshow that one in  adults now vapes, and nearly one in five current smokers also uses e-cigarettes alongside normal cigarettes.Theyre not completely risk free, but they carry a small fraction of the risk of cigarettes.E-cigarettes do not produce tar or carbon monoxide, two of the most harmful elements in tobacco smoke.The liquid and vapour contain some potentially harmful chemicals also found in cigarette smoke, but at much lower levels.While nicotine is the addictive substance in cigarettes, its relatively harmless.Almost all of the harm from smoking comes from the thousands of other chemicals in tobacco smoke, many of which are toxic.Nicotine replacement therapy has been widely used for many years to help people stop smoking and is a safe treatment.Theres no evidence so far that vaping causes harm to other people around you.This is in contrast to secondhand smoke from smoking, which is known to be very harmful to health.Source: NHSThe proportion of youngsters who haven’t smoked but have tried vaping is increasing, the DoH said in its last report.Commenting on the new warnings, Prof John Newton, Director for Health Improvement at PHE told The : We continue to keep the evidence on e-cigarettes under review.However smoking kills half of le long smokers and accounts for almost  deaths in England every day.“If you don’t smoke don’t vape. Butyou smoke there is no situation where it would be better for your health to continue smoking rather than switching completely to vaping.The World Health Organisation, said there is ‘no doubt’ that e-cigarettes are harmful, but said it was too early to tell the long-term impact.They also warned that e-cigarettes can burn skin and rapidly cause nicotine poisoningswallowed or absorbed through the skin.They said there was a risk of the devices leaking, or of children swallowing the liquid, and have been known to cause serious injuries through fires and explosions.The experts said that for tobacco users looking to quit, there were other proven, safer and licensed products, such as nicotine replacement patches and gums and dependence treatments.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its a devastating thing.While fellow councillor Jane Evison is now calling on the Government to provide funding to help cover costs of relocating for residents, which she said can be as much as £,.She said: The council is in a position where theyre not allowed to defend a coastline and neither are the private householders, clearly theres erosion taking place, one or two homes are at very high risk, yet theres no funding.I dont think its a fair situation when were not allowed to provide any protection but were picking up the bill to keep people safe. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Everybody was looking.I was fuming. In the end I said, aposright, I’m ringing the bank, because Iaposve paid and you are stealing my moneyapos and he said aposyou are stealing our shoppingapos. So in the end I rang the bank, virtually in tears. The manager went away, he did something at the till and it produced the last receipt from the till and it wasn’t my shopping.

In the end the bank put the money back into her account which allowed her to pay again. Iaposm warning everybody, do not use their self-scanning systems, Ms Hopcroft said.

Doug McCallum and Charlotte Middleton, both , got the keys to the three-bedroom property in July , but say they have been in dispute with developers Persimmon Home ever since. They claim the upstairs toilet didnapost flush properly and, after repeated attempts to fix this, an eight-inch metal rod was found stuck in the plumbing, according to Chronicle Live. Since then, a hole in the ceiling and a leak at the home in Wallsend, North Tyneside, have angered the couple. Charlotte, who is due to give birth on February , and Doug have now told of their frustration at Persimmon Homeaposs service. Doug said: The new plumber cut a hole in my ceiling and took out the pipes and found an eight inch metal rod stuck in the bend of the pipe. I was shocked and outraged. Safe to say this definitely wasnapost our fault. They have just been unbelievable. This is not what we thought we would be buying. The aftercare team are awful. It took five visits from plumbers to discover the rod in the pipes, he claims. A plasterer recently filled in the hole in the ceiling with Polyfilla but, due to it still being wet, he was unable to paint.  Doug has had to take several days off as annual leave for the appointments to get completed. And in December, after forking out £, for a shower and shower screen to be installed in their new build home, Doug noticed there was a leak coming from the bath. But when he contacted Persimmon he claims they told him they would not fix the problem after their two-year warranty expired. He said: I took the side  off and there was quite a lot of water stains, so this had obviously been happening for a while.  The leak was persistent. I explained to them about how it was obviously an incompetent plumber who was working on my house that day. I said I had purchased the shower for over a grand, and all of the issues we have had with that room but they werenapost interested. The bathroom is over our living room and we were worriedit went through the ceiling downstairs. Persimmon acted by sending out plumbers and a labourer to reseal the bath before fitting a new shower screen. Despite the work now being carried out, the couple have said they will never use Persimmon Homes again. Doug added: Theyaposd be lucky to get a one out of  from me for what they have put us through. We will definitely be moving house. We used to Help to Buy to purchase our home so after our first five years of interest free is up weaposll be going where. A spokesman for Persimmon Homes said: “We are sorry the customers are unhappy with the service they have received from Persimmon Homes. While we understand it is an inconvenience to have works carried out within a home we have acted swtly to attend their concerns and to make good in a timely fashion.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThey were once called the most evil men in Britain and were by a distance the most infamous gangsters the East End has ever produced. Murderers, torturers, hardened criminals… but, to their mother, Violet, twins Ronnie and Reggie Kray were her “lovely boys”. It was a sentiment shared by the identical twins themselves. “They were classic narcissists... image was important to them,” says world renowned criminologist David Wilson, who took a fresh look at their le and crimes. Wilson, a professor of criminology at Birmingham University, adds: “The Krays were very able manipulators. “There is still a fascination with them and the organised crime associated with them from the s.” They were arguably the most notorious criminals of the decade, heading a criminal empire, built on intimidation and brutality. When they moved to Bethnal Green from nearby Hoxton as children, Ronnie and Reggie quickly became involved in juvenile crime. Both were promising amateur boxers. Yet this and National Service in the Army did little to instil discipline or control the violence that would become their trademark. In the s they first moved into “protection” – demanding money with menaces from businesses who would face brutal reprisals for not paying up. And it paid off handsomely for the twins. By the following decade, their Firm had spread its operations west, open gambling club Esmeralda’s Barn in wealthy Knightsbridge. There they wined and dined celebrities, including Judy Garland and Barbara Windsor flocked to the club.It is said Reggie, the charming one, could have been a straight businessman, but his brother’s psychotic tendencies made that impossible. Ronnie loved the gangster image, insisting the pair had identical suits and slicked-back hairstyles. Unlike most villains the pair revelled in the spotlight. “They came managed to create an image for themselves in a way that nobody  had done,” says criminology lecturer Dr Ruth Penfold-Mounce of York University. “Most criminals become famous when they get go to jail. They achieved it while they were still active.”  When rumours about homosexual Ronnie’s friendship with Lord Boothby surfaced in  he became front page news on the Sunday Mirror. A portrait of the twins taken by David Bailey cemented the twins’ position in the public consciousness. Despite their growing fame, they continued their reign of terror, seemingly beyond the reach of police. But the law finally caught up with them as their ruthlessness reached new heights.  First, Ronnie shot George Cornell in Whitechapel’s Blind Beggar pub in . “He was a drunkard and a bully and I done him,” Ronnie would later say. “Me – not my brother.” In December that year, the Krays, helped Frank Mitchell escape from Dartmoor Prison. Once out, they put him in a friend’s flat in East Ham. But Mitchell, known as the “Mad Axeman”, became hard to control. He disappeared without a trace. Then, in , Reggie murdered Jack “The Hat” McVitie, a minor member of the Firm who had failed to fulfil a contract to kill Leslie Payne."},{"url":null,"title":"inside rogue landlords slum rentals","story":"NewsInside rogue landlords slum rentals including flat with toilet in the showerA crackdown on rogue landlords found one offering up a mattress in a garden shed as a home and another renting out a room featuring a huge hole in the floorShareCommentsByOlive Loveridge-GreeneTalia Shadwell:,  JAN NewsThis rental came with a three-in-one toilet-shower-sink feature \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

The list of shame includes garden sheds masquerading as bedrooms, and a shower that doubles as a toilet and sink. Inspectors in Oxford revealed the catalogue of the worst homes theyaposve seen, including a room with a view - of a brick wall. Oxford City Council staffers released the pictures of some of the worst es, including a flat with a garden full of junk. The council workers found the flats while inspecting houses in multiple occupancy- properties containing three or more tenants who arenapost a family. Have you had a bad experience with a rental  Email webnews@mirror The shocking discoveries have led the authority to launch a new £, scheme to crack down on poor quality privately rented homes. Other nightmare homes in the city included a property with a huge hole in the floor one room and smashed windows left with shards of glass poking out. Deputy leader of Oxford City Council Linda Smith said: We have found countless examples across Oxford of homes where even these most basic of standards have not been met and vulnerable tenants have been left in illegal and dangerous conditions.  Rogue landlords are not a small minority in Oxford - currently the landlords that own % of privately rented properties in Oxford are breaking the law by not having an EPC certicate . The new scheme was funded by Ministry of Housing, Communities  Local Government earlier this month. The council plans to find more rogue landlords by building an algorithm to identy properties in the private rented sector that are unlicensed.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid Email A pair of newlyweds who saved £, for a dream honeymoon with Thomas Cook will likely never get their money back.Sophie and Luke Fleetwood had set up a honeymoon fund on the travel firmaposs website and were accumulating gt cards with help from generous family and friends. They had managed to collect £,, which was sitting in a Gt of Travel account on Thomas Cookaposs website, but the funds were lost when the firm went bust last September. The Fleetwoods, who have three children, were planning a two-week trip to Mexico to give them some much-needed alone time - and now they might not go on a honeymoon at all. For months they had been contacting firms involved in Thomas Cookaposs insolvency and waiting to find outthey would get their money back. But it appears they will not get any money back because gt card holders are unsecured creditors. Sophie, , told : We are thinking of wiping a honeymoon out of our heads as we just can’t afford to pay the total cost, hence the honeymoon fund to help towards it.  We had set up the honeymoon fund via their website. So our wedding guests, friends and family paid into this account. And we’ve supposedly lost all the money. No-one is getting back to us about it all. The stay-at-home mum, whose children are aged one, three and four, added: We felt absolutely devastated [when Thomas Cook ceased trading].  We are parents to three children aged under five, so knowing we had lost all of that money, which would have helped us go on our honeymoon, was quite upsetting. She said she has followed the refund advice listed on Thomas Cook and Government websites, adding: We don’t know what  to do now really.  Sadly, it appears the money put into the Gt of Travel scheme will never be ed because gt card holders are unsecured creditors in the insolvency process. Sophie and gas engineer Luke, , who tied the knot at Silchester House in Reading in May last year, were accumulating gt cards, including those donated by family and friends, to put towards a trip.  Unlike the hundreds of thousands who have already been refunded because they were ATOL protected, the Fleetwoods hadnapost yet purchased a holiday and their savings were in the form of gt cards. After the firm collapsed, customers who had Thomas Cook gt cards were told they were likely worthless, but to register as a creditor in a bid to claim the money back. They were warned they might not get anything back.  If they do, it could be just a fraction of the value. For gt cards purchased using a credit or debit card, people might be able to make a claim to their credit or debit card provider. The Fleetwoods have registered as a creditor, but they were recently told in an email: At this stage, there is no further update available in respect of s to unsecured creditors. On its website, Money Saving Expert wrote: If you have a Thomas Cook gt card, you will have to register as a creditor in a bid to try and claim some money back from Thomas Cook – but bear in mind that youaposll join a long list of creditors, many of whom will be owed a lot of money by the business.You may well not get anything back via this route, andyou do, expect it to be a fraction of the value of the gt card. Earlier this month, the Civil Aviation Authority said it had settled more than  per cent of all the claims it had received from people who had booked holidays that were ATOL protected.

Kate spoke candidly about her experience as a first-time mum living in Anglesey with a tiny, tiny baby during a visit to a childrenaposs centre in Cardf on Wednesday. After arriving at the centre, Kate said it was nice to be back in Wales before telling her hosts: “I will have to remember my Welsh!” The Ely and Caerau Children’s Centre is located in an economically deprived area of the city and offers a welcoming environment for parents and kids. Kate said: “If only I had had a centre like this. It was the first year and I’d just had George – William was still working with Search and Rescue and we came up here and I had a tiny tiny baby in the middle of Anglesey it was so isolated, so cut off. I didn’t have any family around and he was doing night shts. During the visit, Kate also mentioned Charlotte and Louis, adding: “We will be taking a trip down to Anglesey at some point.” Kate spoke to several parents about the centre and the facilities it offers to locals.  Speaking to mum Rhi, , who uses the centre with her -month-old daughter Eleanor Logue, Kate said: So many families now are so spread out. “It’s much harder to rely on other generations for support.” Rhi told her: “You can come here and tell people, ‘I haven’t slept’. “And everyone  is like, ‘I haven’t either!’” laughed Kate.  “It normalises it. No one is going to judge you for it. And it’s a social thing for you.” Afterwards Rhi said: “We talked about post-natal depression and how hard it is to have a kid and how important centres like this are. I would have been in such a dark place without it. “It’s lovely to see her in a place like Ely. It’s such a deprived area and there have been so many funding cuts. Sometimes you are scared to walk the streets, but coming here you feel safe. You don’t feel like you are going to get mugged.” In another room, Kate was charmed by -month-old Indie Corten-Maynard and one of her two mums Estelle Corten.  Estelle said: “She was asking me what it was like coming here as a same-sex couple and I told her how welcoming the centre has been. “It was amazing to have the future Queen here in Ely!” In the English language part of the centre’s bilingual nursery, Kate sat down with older children who were playing with dough and joined them in making doughballs as she was told how the children spend lots of time outdoors. One little girl told her: “We are talking about your nursery! It’s so cool I would love to come here. What’s your favourite thing about it  Do you like playing outside ”  She then took the little girl by the hand and asked her to show her the outdoor area, stopping to meet the resident guinea pigs Willow and Bella in a wooden hut, appropriately bearing the sign “Cath’s Cottage” She crouched down to stroke the black-and-white pet, Willow, telling the children: “I had guinea pigs when I was little. I think your nursery is the best. She’s so soft, isn’t she ” Watching as the children fed them carrots and sprouts, she joked: “I did not know that guinea pigs liked Brussels Sprouts!” Introducing herself to another group of youngsters who were drawing, Kate said: “Nice to meet you, I’m Catherine.  These guinea pigs are a lot quieter than the ones I had at home!” She told Carolyn Asante, head of the centre: “They are so happy in there! It’s like their own little world.” In the centre’s Welsh medium nursery, Kate was presented with flowers and a drawing of herself by four-year-old Erin Jones, who briefly hesitated when prompted to hand them over. “Are you shy ” asked Naomi Asante Chambers, a senior teaching assistant.  “Don’t worry, I am too,” the Duchess told the little girl. “Is this my dress ” she asked, pointing at the drawing. “I love your hair, I should have done mine like that today. I love the drawing too, thank you! Thank you so much, what a special morning I have had.” She also joined three-year-old River Roson, who was playing with pretend food.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are now spending time in Canada after stepping away from royal le. They reached an agreement with the Queen and senior royals and in a statement issued on Saturday it was revealed they would no longer use their HRH titles.Harry and Meghan will also repay the £.million of taxpayersapos money they used to refurbish Frogmore Cottage in Windsor.It remains unclear thoughHarry and Meghan will be required to strip the word aposRoyalapos from their SussexRoyal website, and who will pick up the hefty bill for their continuing security requirements. In a statement earlier this month, the couple had said they wanted to become financially independent after aposstepping backapos as senior royals. From the spring they will no longer be working members of the royal family and will not perform any official duties on behalf of the Queen. Harry, Meghan and Archie are also planning to spend most of their time in North America and are expected to make a fortune in their new roles. But the couple are far from the first royals to earn their own living - although some have managed it with more success than others. Hereaposs how the other members of The Firm have fared. The Earl and Countess of Wessex Before becoming full-time royals, Edward and Sophie tried to carve out dual roles, combining working in business with royal duties - but it ended in disaster. Sophie, who co-ran a public relations firm, R-JH, was tricked by a fake sheikh undercover reporter offering a lucrative contract. She hinted he would get greater publicity because of her royal role. Edward had his own television production firm called Ardent. Many of its films dealt with the royal family and its history but it made substantial losses. The earl sparked a bitter feud with his brother the Prince of Wales when one of his crews were found filming at St Andrews University shortly after Prince William began studying there. It was in direct defiance of a request for the media to leave the young prince alone. Stricter guidelines on royal business activities were introduced after a palace review following the Sophiegate scandal. In the end the Wessexes gave up their businesses to become full-time royals in . The Duke of York Prince Andrew has been accused of exploiting his previous role as Britainaposs trade envoy to further his financial interests. A Mail on Sunday investigation claimed the duke had conflicts of interest between multi-millionaire property developer David Rowland and his role as the UKaposs special representative for international trade and investment. But Buckingham Palace insisted the duke was promoting British interests and not the interests of iniduals while in the post. The duke earned himself the nickname Air Miles Andy for his lavish use of helicopters and other aircraft at public expense. In , he sold his Sunninghill Park mansion - a wedding present from the Queen - for £ million more than its £ million asking price to the son-in-law of the president of Kazakhstan. Andrew stepped down from public royal duties amid the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, but it is not known what his future working plans will be,any. The Queen uses an unknown amount of her £. million a year Duchy of Lancaster income to partly fund her second son. The Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton gave up working for her parents party paraphernalia firm when she married Prince William in . She was previously a part-time accessories buyer for the fashion chain Jigsaw, owned by friends of her family Belle and John Robinson. Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie Andrewaposs daughters Beatrice and Eugenie are not full-time working royals and both have their own jobs. Beatrice is vice president of partnerships and strategy at Afiniti, an articial intelligence software firm, while Eugenie is a director at the contemporary art gallery Hauser  Wirth in London. They do have some charity patronages and sometimes appear at royal events such as palace garden parties and Trooping the Colour. Eugenie accompanied the Queen to a Royal Maundy service last year. It is likely that as HRHs, they may have to consult the Lord Chamberlain before taking on new business activities - a rule which forms part of the guidelines for working royals. Peter Phillips The Queenaposs eldest grandson runs the UK arm of events and sponsorship agency Sports and Entertainment Ltd , after a previous career working for RBS and in Hong Kong on a Williams Formula One sponsorship deal. Mr Phillips, who is not an HRH and does not carry out royal duties, has also appeared in an advert for milk in China, the Daily Mail revealed. Questions were raised in  when Mr Phillipsaposs agency staged the Patronaposs Lunch street party for the Queenaposs th birthday. It was Mr Phillipsaposs idea, but the event was not put out to tender. SEL Ltd was paid £, for organising the celebration, but the Patronaposs Fund charity defended the payment, saying there were running costs and Mr Phillipsaposs company had made no profit. He was criticised in  for selling photos of his wedding to Canadian bride Autumn Kelly to Hello! for a reported £,. Zara Tindall The Queenaposs granddaughter Zara Tindall has forged her own career as a champion equestrian. She has won an Olympic medal and secured numerous brand ambassador deals, including with Land Rover, Rolex, iCandy prams and clothing brand Musto. Zara has her own range of equestrian-inspired jewellery with Calleija, including saddle-shaped cufflinks and coronet rings. But she has no royal title and is much further down the line of succession than her cousin Harry. Mike Tindall Not a royal as such, but an in-law of the royals, Zaraaposs husband, former England rugby player Mike Tindall, has been able to pursue his own work in the limelight. He appeared as a contestant on the Channel  show The Jump, and on Bear Grylls: Mission Survive, shown on ITV. Tindall revealed he does not have to ask permission from the monarchy before taking on a public role but does think about possible consequences for the royals. He said: That would always come up, yes, of course, but ultimately itaposs what we want to do first. Princess Michael of Kent Married to the Queenaposs cousin Prince Michael of Kent, the controversial Princess Michael of Kent does not carry out royal duties. She is the author of a number of books, including The Cheetahaposs Tale and the Serpent And The Moon. The princessaposs own website describes her as a writer, historian, lecturer, interior designer and art consultant.  The Kents sparked a scandal in  when it emerged they paid a peppercorn rent of £ a week for their grand apartment in Kensington Palace. Dubbed the Rent-a-Kents, the couple were criticised for being subsidised by the taxpayer when they did not carry out official royal duties. The Queen later paid the full £, rent on their behalf for the next few years, but the deal did not last forever and they eventually had to take over the cost in .

Casper the lurcher was worked so ruthlessly he had no fat or muscle left on him and his ribs were sticking through his fur.The dog was thrown from a car which sped away on Halloween night last year and staff at Rescue Me Animal Sanctuary in Merseyside, Liverpool, cared for him round-the-clock to keep him alive.Staff said Casper had been exposed to the ‘the worst of humanity’ and was one of the worst cases of poor treatment theyaposd witnessed. Sam B’stard, from Last Chance Hotel in Cornwall, said Casper – who they believe is around eight years old - was one of the most tragic cases the rescue centre had ever seen. She said: “His heart was so weak, it was touch and go for a long time whether he would make it or not. “We had to give him miniscule portions of food to start with – eight really tiny meals a day - because too much could have put a strain on his heart and killed him. “It was very sad, it was just pure neglect. He didn’t have any other illness or physical problem – he’s a big lad who’d simply been starved.”  Casper was put on an intensive feeding regime that saw him eat small meals every two hours, to slowly build up his body without putting a strain on his vital organs. Vets were also able to begin treating painful growths on his body, overgrown nails and sore toes. A week later, when he started to show signs of improvement, Casper headed to Last Chance Hotel Animal Rescue in Cornwall where he has made an incredible recovery. Now, less than three months since he was abandoned in a heartbreaking state, he is ready to be re-homed. Despite his horric past, Sam says Casper still has a gentle, affectionate nature. She added: “He loves people, he loves dogs, he’s just lovely. “He enjoys one to one attention and he loves being near you – on your lap, by your side, under your feet – he wants to be in your space, he just craves love.” "},{"url":null,"title":"spurned mistress hsbc boss spread","story":"NewsSpurned mistress of HSBC boss spread rumours about him because she was jealousMadeline Luckham, , claimed her former boss Robert Clegg, , had sex with another woman in the unisex toilet at their HSBC workplace, a tribunal heardShareByLaura Sharman:,  JAN NewsMadeleine Luckham outside the Stratford Employment Tribunal in London \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Madeline Luckham, , who had a relationship with dad-of-four Robert Clegg, , claims she was the “victim of bullying, harassment and discrimination at the hands of HSBC and Rob in particular” in her six figure role. The former contractor and head of delivery for HSBC staff digitisation claimed Mr Clegg had sex with another woman in the unisex toilet at work. But Mr Clegg’s barrister today said this claim was untrue and that Mr Clegg had gone into the stairwell to have a private conversation with the woman. Jane McCafferty QC, for HSBC and Mr Clegg, accused Ms Luckham at Stratford Employment Tribunal of aposputting two and two together to make fiveapos. She said: “You have publicly put an allegation of a female that you accept to be a rumour that you do not know to be true.” She added: “These extracts are examples of sexual jealousy. When you see Mr Clegg together with another woman, you get so jealous you put two and two together and get five. “They were not in the loo together. They had gone out to the stairwell to have a discussion of a private matter. You did not see them go into the loo itself, did you  “On the basis of seeing them walk through a door, you make a public allegation that they were having sex in the loo. “You say because he ed looking sweaty and flustered and that is the basis you make this allegation of sexual misconduct.” But Ms Luckham said she did know it to be true and that she did see the pair go into the toilet itself while she was having a meeting by a nearby sofa. She said: “I do know them to be true because I saw them go into the loo together. I saw her knock on the door and it opened.” She added: “I was standing outside where the glass  is. She walked to the one which is furthest away which I believe is the unisex one. She knocked on the door and it opened.”  Ms Luckham said she and Mr Clegg would squabble during their relationship but that she was terried of him by mid May, a month after ending their relationship. She described him as having a “Jekyll and Hyde” behaviour and said he would be nice to her one minute and would shout at her the next. Mr Clegg claims he ended the relationship in January during a trip to Hong Kong and had realised the relationship was a mistake soon after it began. The tribunal heard Ms Luckham made five claims of sexual harassment against Mr Clegg including touching and flirting which his barrister said were untrue. Ms Luckham described this as an awful time and claims she raised these issues with HSBC during a grievance interview but they were “shut down.” Speaking at the tribunal today, she said: “At this point I was terried of him. He would be nice to me one minute and not the next. “I had raised Rob’s sinister behaviour in my grievance and grievance interview, the touching and flirting in public.” She added: “This was an awful time. I did raise issues of sexual harassment in my interview but I was immediately shut down with ‘that does not really constitute sexual harassment.’” But Ms McCafferty QC said there were no incidents of unwanted touching and that Ms Luckham did not mention these allegations to HSBC or until the final draft she submitted to the tribunal.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailIt was the voice of the Titanic, a rust covered radio, now two miles below the surface of the icy Atlantic Ocean and at the centre of a furious international row. More than a century ago the state-of-the-art Marconi equipment relayed panicked SoS messages to other ships. Today it’s the subject of a race by ‘pillaging’ relic hunters to reach and salvage what is seen as the most important artefact from the Titanic, as the UK and US government announce a “momentous agreement” to deny scavengers permission to enter the wreck and remove items. The aim behind the treaty, according to Maritime Minister Nusrat Ghani, is to “give the respect owed to the final resting place of more than , lives.” But private firm RMS Titanic Inc, which was awarded sole salvage rights to the Titanic nearly  years ago, said the new treaty has no teeth and declared that they would “entirely ignore” it. They have retrieved over , items - including dolls, diamonds, crockery and passengers’ shoes - from the sea bed around the Belfast-built liner so far. But removing the radio would mark the first time they have taken anything from inside the wreck, which lies in international waters km off the Canadian coast. They plan to chop off part of the deckhouse roof to allow robots inside to extract the radio, which they hope to exhibit in Las Vegas before taking it on a worldwide tour. Politicians have accused the firm of attempting to “pilfer and pillage” the sunken ship to make money, in a move akin to piracy. The Titanic, the largest passenger liner in the world at the time, struck an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York on April  with the loss of , lives. It had , leboat seats for the , passengers and crew members. The tragedy has fascinated generations and inspired multiple documentaries and movies, including the Oscar-winning  film starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. It is barnacled with myths and legends. But one rarely-told tale focuses on the radio room which is the cause of the deepening international salvage row. Surrey-born telegraphist Jack Phillips worked there, and his heroism is one of the most enduring stories of self sacrice on the Titanic. Jack, just , battled tirelessly to send messages to other ships as the Titanic sunk. But what is less known is thatit weren’t for Jack’s hard work - and rule breaking - the radio may not have been in fit enough repair to save any passengers at all. For Jack and junior wireless operator Harold Bride, from London, took the initiative to repair the ship’s wireless equipment just a day before the sinking. On April  , Jack and Harold detected an issue with a component of the wireless equipment which had led to a decrease in power output.  According to the Marconi manual, telegraphists were not allowed to try to fix the equipment. Mia Fernandez, a researcher and Titanic expert, said: “Just two days after his th birthday, Jack Phillips and his colleague Harold Bride faced a decision. They could follow the rules, or they could break them. Unbeknownst to them this decision would ultimately mark the dference between le and death for hundreds of people.” Ultimately Jack decided to break the rules - and his action saved the hundreds of passengers picked up by The Carpathia. Mia added: “According to the Marconi manual and company policy, telegraphists were not to attempt to fix this particular component and were to wait until getting into port whereby a Marconi engineer could be called to repair the fault. “But Jack and Harold were not unlike any -something ‘technowhizz’ of today and Phillips made the decision to troubleshoot and fix the problem, working through his allotted time to sleep. “After hours of work, the fault was repaired by the afternoon of the th, just hours before the Titanic’s fatal collision with the iceberg.”  That disaster struck at :pm, and Jack stayed at his post sending the newly-established SoS signal to ships hundreds of miles away until moments before his own ship succumbed. His calls were picked up by the Carpathia - a ship which was alerted to the crippled Titanic’s plight and raced  miles to save  lives. Jack did not survive, as by the time he emerged from the radio room all the leboats had gone. But Harold, who clung on to an upturned boat, lived to tell Jack’s story.  He remembered Jack working in the radio room till the very end. He said: “The water was pretty close up to the boat deck. There was a great scramble aft, and how poor Phillips continued to work through it I don’t know. He was a brave man. I learned to love him that night and I suddenly felt a great reverence to see him standing there sticking to his work while everybody  was raging about. I will never live to forget the work of Phillips during the last awful  minutes.” Harold later told of seeing Jack’s frozen dead body, which was never recovered, as he was rescued by The Carpathia. He said: “One man was dead. I passed him and went up the ladder, although my feet pained terribly. The dead man was Phillips. He had died on the raft from exposure and cold, I guess. He had been all in from work before the wreck came. He stood his ground until the crisis had passed, and then he collapsed, I guess.  In Jack’s home town of Godalming, in Surrey, a pub bears his name, there is a headstone in the shape of an iceberg at his family grave and the Phillips Memorial Park. But will the radio, which Jack fixed and frantically used to save hundreds of lives before his own, ever be recovered  The Government has said it would lobby the US and other Atlantic nations to “ensure the wreck of the Titanic is treated with the sensitivity it deserves”.

Robyn Emma, , met Dlair Mahmood at a nightclub in Nantwich and agreed to a nightcap at his house as it was just a few streets away from a friendaposs where she was staying. But Robyn, who was studying criminology and criminal justice at Bangor university, was so tired that she fell asleep fully-clothed on Mahmoodaposs bed and only stirred when he began undressing her. Mahmood - who told her he was a -year-old widower called Alan - began undoing her bra then flipped her onto her back. Terried Robyn realised there was a lock on his bedroom door and didnapost know how to escape. Robyn, who bravely waived her anonymity to tell her story, said: I was scared he would kill meI stirred. I came round and realised what he was doing but I thought he would panicI opened my eyes. There was a laptop right next to us and I was convinced heaposd hit me over the head with it or strangle me. When Robyn thought the ordeal was coming to an end, she acted as she was awaking. There was no kissing, no touching, although he undid my bra, and it hurt. I was crying inside but I forced myself to act asI was asleep and not react because I thought Iaposd never see my mum againI did, she added. When I thought it was almost over, I began to act like I was waking up. I made a noise and he jumped off me, and by the time I slowly woke and eventually opened my eyes he was dressed and sitting down. I was petried he was going to strangle me so I had to act asnothing had happened.  Forcing herself not to panic or to look flustered, Robyn told Mahmood she was tired and said she would like to go home. Mahmood unbolted the door and insisted heaposd drive her home - just three streets from where she was staying. She added: He had a lock on the door and as soon as he opened it I wanted to bolt out, but I couldnapost as he would suspect I knew, so I forced myself to walk slowly. She didnapost want him to know the house where she was staying, so told him to drop her a few houses away. When she was safely in her friendaposs house, she saw a chilling text message from Mahmood saying aposDonapost forget you let me do itapos. Robyn immediately told her friend sheaposd been raped then called the police who asked her to show them the house where sheaposd been attacked in Crewe, Cheshire. She was also examined at a rape specialist in Manchester.  It wasnapost long before Robynaposs fears were confirmed about Mahmood, as he carried out an attack on a man where he cut him aposlike a pigapos. Mahmood, who was  at the time he attacked Robyn, had become defensive after a man confronted him about an offensive text message. He stabbed the victim through the lung and gashed his arm so deep it revealed muscles and tendons. The victim was so certain heaposd die, he said goodbye to his girlfriend. Luckily, he survived but called Mahmood aposa devil.apos Warrington Crown Court sentenced Mahmood to five years for raping Robyn and  years for the stabbing. He has also been added to the sex offendersapos register and has an indefinite restraining order against her.  During the trial at Warrington Crown Court, Robyn had to re-live the nightmare twice after the jury failed to come to a unanimous decision. Robyn cried when she heard the verdict, but was determined to try again.  She added: Yes Iaposd been drinking at the club but drinking isnapost a crime - rape is. She then chose to waive her anonymity in a bid to get justice at a re-trial at Liverpool Crown Court. She was on the stand for  minutes during the two-day trial and the jury unanimously found Mahmood guilty of rape. Robyn, who believes Mahmood should have got longer for the crime as it left her le in tatters, said she couldnapost hug her dad for a year and gave up her dream of working in criminology because of the rape. I didnapost trust anyone and had severe anxiety and depression, she said.

She clicked on the profile and slowly realised it was him. She contacted Trevor, , from Kent, and the pair chatted before meeting last Friday. The electrician said: “I knew I had a child but not the sex. I was on Facebook and this message popped up from a lady saying she liked my photo. “I saw the resemblance straight away with my three other daughters. I could see she was my daughter. It’s early but I feel we know each other quite well.” Karen, from Penryn, Cornwall, said: “I’ve found connection and completion, and I’m cherishing it. Those adopted understand the moment you first see someone other than yourself in a mirror with your cheekbones, eyes and chin.”  Karen traced her mum  years ago. Her parents had her out of wedlock in their teens, which Karen said “wasn’t the done thing in those days”. Algorithms sort posts and friend suggestions based on relevancy to users. Trevor added: “If it wasn’t for Facebook we wouldn’t have met. It’s surreal. And the grandfather Trevor, who has now retired, said he did not even know the sex of his adopted child until Karen got in touch. He said: “When she was born she was adopted straight away.

Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets.

The Millennium Wing meets the standards that would be required in a new building. There would be very little point in wasting money knocking down something that works really well.

This is a fascinating and picturesque structure from the th century, which lies semi-hidden amongst the trees that cling onto the steep sides of the slope.Dunglass is such a beautul area, and the ancient Dunglass Collegiate Church, dating from the th century, is one of its architectural jewels. Itrsquos open to the elements now, but well preserved and a popular place for weddings.The castle that once stood nearby is long gone. A more modern house sits on the spot where a mansion once stood, and before that the castle. Being on the main route south, the castle inevitably saw action during the ious times of war with England, being burned and damaged on a number of occasions in the s.But in August , the castle was effectively blown up in a huge explosion, and a version of events emerged which placed the blame on a vengeful servant called Edward Paris.It was a time of war and religious rage. Thomas the nd Earl of Haddington was leading a Covenanting force charged with defending this important route from the south, as the Covenanting army had entered England a few days earlier. He had established his force at Dunglass Castle, an obvious strategic location, to defend the armyrsquos rear.On that fateful day, August , , he was said to be in conversation with some fellow nobles when a huge explosion erupted from the vaults, instantly demolishing the central part of the castle which became little more than a pile of debris.Thomas and many others were killed, their bodies pulled from the rubble. They had been crushed by the collapse of the walls in the explosion.History has repeatedly recorded the names of the nobles killed on that day, but there were many others, as the castle was busy and full of people. Fty-four unnamed lsquocommon servantsrsquo were killed, and more than  other people badly injured, some later dying of their injuries.Edward Paris was Thomasrsquos servant and he has been blamed for this tragedy. The th-century writer Andrew Stevenson claimed Edward had the keys to the vault in which huge amounts of gunpowder had been stored, and he had been ldquoseduced by the enemies of the covenant to commit this act. He was an Englishman and another account says he was incensed at derogatory remarks made by Thomas about his countrymen.Irsquove always thought this explanation never really had the ring of truth. It was initially deemed an accident, and the story of Edwardrsquos role emerged later, instigated by a writer called William Lithgow, a man who had certain axes to grind. In one account, Edward is said to have thrust a hot poker into the gunpowder or set fire to it. The detail of this is suspect in itself, for who survived as a witness to this act  I suspect that a dreadful accident, possibly caused by incompetence and carelessness, was turned into a deliberate act of vengeance as it made a more useful explanation.Of course, it is very possible that Edward was offended or annoyed at things said by his master, and perhaps he mentioned this at some stage, later to be used as evidence of his guilt. But in truth, most servants will have seen or heard things which will have offended them, it was a part of their job.Imagineservants had been able to write and publish the things they had overheard and seen, what dferent historical narratives we would have!Motives for wanting to interpret the cause of the explosion in this way can be guessed at. It was a time of atrocity and massacre, with religious, political and national hatreds. Who was responsible for the dangerous stockpiling of the gunpowder in such a manner  It seems just too easy to blame a disgruntled servant. Even later, when writing up this period, religious and political loyalties influenced interpretation.If Edward Paris really did venture down to the vaults of Dunglass Castle on that fateful day, with the intention of committing suicide in order to kill his master, along with dozens of others, then he must have been infected with a deep hatred, as well as a total disregard for the lives of his fellow servants and his own.The truth is we will never know what really happened. But Edward Paris is a servant whose name we know. Countless numbers of so-called lsquocommon servantsrsquo whose lives and fates are deemed unimportant by history remain unrecorded just as the things they witnessed remain absent from our history books.Irsquove often thought it would be fascinating to meet Edwardrsquos ghost and ask him what really happened on that day.Silly idea, of course, but you never know."},{"url":null,"title":"public-exhibition-held-plans-revive-dunbars-east-beach","story":"Dunbarrsquos East Beach, which hosts the townrsquos annual Loony Dook, was once a magnet for tourists but the disappearance of its golden sands over the years due to coastal erosion has led to fewer visitors.East Lothian Council has already been given permission for the first phase of work on the beach, which it is hoped will help sandwhile also protecting the shore.A public exhibition detailing plans for a second phase of work ndash and the project overall ndash takes place in Dunbarrsquos Bleachingfield Centre on Monday afternoon.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, explained the desire to see the beach restored to how it was previously.She said: ldquoIt has been a long-held ambition.ldquoPeople reminisce about how wonderful the beach was and there has been a lot of disappointment that it has been so rocky for so long.Dave Northcott, East Lothian Council structural engineer and project leader, visited the community council shortly before Christmas to outline the plans.Consent is already in place for the construction of a breakwater at the southern end of East Beach.Refurbishment of the existing groyne at the same end of the beach has also been approved, alongside the placement of rock armour at the toe of the seawall. A marine licence is in place until the end of May, with work to be complete before then.At the same time, plans are being drawn up for a second phase of work, which would see the creation of a breakwater at the northern end of the beach.A marine licence will be needed for that piece of work, with the hope that could be in place before the end of May to allow work to simply continue from the first phase.If that is not possible, the contractor will leave the site andat a later date to construct the northern breakwater.Mrs Swan, who is also chairwoman of Dunbar Shore and Harbour Neighbourhood Group, encouraged people to head along to the public exhibition, which takes place between pm and pm.Those in attendance can speak to the consultants and East Lothian Council about the plans.Mrs Swan added: ldquoI think it is really, really important for people to come to the exhibition for two reasons.ldquoOne is to understand the thinking that has gone into the regeneration project and the other one is to become aware of the impact it might have on them during the construction weeks because it is going to be at least six weeks and it could run into months.ldquoThe nature of the breakwater is they are built of huge rocks, between three and six tonnes, and they are all coming from the quarry at Markle.

He was said to have been martyred at sea with an anchor round his neck and was therefore regarded as the patron saint of sailors. The cult of Clement spread to Scandinavia in about the th century and then to Britain.ldquoSt Clements Wells were probably named by Scandinavians living in the Tranent area.ldquoWe know they were here because of the presence of a powerful landholder of likely Scandinavian descent, Thor of Tranent, son of Swain, who is mentioned in many th-century charters. He held extensive lands in the area and granted the church of Tranent to Holyrood Abbey.Mr Hadden said: ldquoI am sure the new stone sculptures will add another piece of culture to our area when in place to the east and west sides of Wallyford alongside those we have already.ldquoThese include the mining memorial stone and coal hutches located at St Clements Housing estate just off Salters Road, the  mining stones at the Wallyford Bing, a community woodland depicting dferent mining scenes, and also the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh memorial at the west side of Wallyford.The shapes and patterns proposed relate to the themes of the wells, water, ripples, distilling, agriculture and the sense of space and open skies of the site as it is now. The overall idea is that the artwork reflects past, present and future heritages of the area.There will also be two St Clements Wells name  per entrance in stone, either hand carved or sandblasted.The idea for a stone village sign for Wallyford is also being explored in a design reflecting the ideas of crossing a river or burn by a ford.A spokesman for East Lothian Developments said: ldquoEast Lothian Developments are delighted to be working with Susheila and James to deliver ious artworks at St Clements Wells.ldquoThey have shown real enthusiasm and creativity with the ideas they have brought forward to capture something of the history of St Clements Wells and design pieces which we hope will do justice to the entrances of the development, and spark interest from all those who will pass them.ldquoWe were very grateful to the community council for their comments and input to the designs.Elaine Di Troia was appointed vice-chairman at the AGM, Sharon Jamieson secretary and Beryl Stevenson treasurer.

Christmas time had been dficult because it was the first Christmas without her granny, who had died earlier in the year. But now she was back at school and into the routine with her friends.Her parents had hoped this would help, but her sense of loss was still overwhelming for her. Perhaps at her age she didnrsquot understand exactly what was going on inside, but all she knew was that her granny shersquod loved was gone and she missed her.Then one evening during a bedtime story, Jessica started to cry and told her dad that her granny was melting like a snowman. At first he wasnrsquot sure what she meant, but then he understood.Jessicarsquos memory of her granny was fading. This was a second loss for her. The first loss was of her grannyrsquos physical presence, her actual hugs, her voice and care and love, even the smell of her perfume. Now Jessica was losing her memory of all this and she knew it. So she felt that something inside her was melting too, something that had been so much of her was vanishing.And this made Jessica fear that others in her le could disappear and then melt away as well, even her dad or mum. It was a terrying thought and it made her not just sad but scared and insecure inside.Her dad tried to reassure her that he or her mum werenrsquot going to die, but despite being only six years old, Jessica now knew that such promises couldnrsquot be kept forever.ldquoNana didnrsquot want to die either, but she did. And now shersquos melting.The next day at school was another dficult one for Jessica, and home time often didnrsquot make it better because in the past it had usually been her granny whorsquod picked her up.Her dad was waiting for her.ldquoWe are not going straight home today, he told her.ldquoWhere are we going ldquoTo Nanarsquos seat.A cloud suddenly came over Jessica. She didnrsquot say anything and just looked at the ground. This was a seat that overlooked the sea, where her gran had often taken her. They would sit together and look out to the Firth, spotting boats and looking for whales, while eating sweeties.Her dad had realised that Jessica hadnrsquot been there since the death of her grandmother.ldquoOnlyyou want to, he said.Jessica was silent and looked at the ground. Inside, her emotions were spinning. Then she looked up.ldquoI donrsquot want to, it will just make me sad, she said to her dad. So they didnrsquot go.But later that day, Jessica began to talk about Nanarsquos seat. ldquoShe always gave me sweeties and wersquod look for whales and pirates. She told me a story about how a pirate once landed here at Prestonpans, but he didnrsquot leave treasure, he just built the town.ldquoGreat story, said her dad.The next day, Jessica agreed to go to her nanarsquos seat. When they arrived, she hesitated to sit and had a wave of emotion.ldquoI miss Nana, she saidldquoSo do I. Shall we sit on her seat and miss her together.ldquoBut we have to eat sweeties.ldquoJust so happens Irsquove got some in my pocket, said the dad with a smile. His daughter smiled back and sat on the seat. Her dad joined her.ldquoNo, dad, that was Nanarsquos place, you sit this side instead.And so they sat, missing Nana together, being sad together, but also remembering her together.ldquoCan you tell me the story about the pirate  asked the dad.ldquoDonrsquot want to.ldquoOK, maybe next time.The next day, they ed to Nanarsquos seat. This time, Jessica told a bit of the pirate story. The dad remembered it from his childhood and realised that his own grief in losing his mother had closed him down to talking about her. It had felt too painful.He began to sit on lsquoNanarsquos seatrsquo by himself when Jessica was at school, even though he had never done it with his mother when she was alive he had always been lsquotoo busy to watch the sea with her. But his daughterrsquos anecdotes and stories about the seat made it feel like a place of remembrance for him too.The power of stories, to rekindle memory and ease the sense of loss, became very real for both Jessica and her dad. At home, they made a special box with drawings and photos of memories, and things that reminded Jessica of her gran. Theyrsquod take them out and tell stories and share memories. Her dad even began to tell funny stories about his mum from when before Jessica was born, when he was a boy.lsquoNanarsquos boxrsquo was put in a safe place, but where Jessica could take itshe wanted to. As time passed, she opened it less, but it was always in her room. Sometimes she would put things in it, such as shells from the beach, because her granny had loved beautul shells.The loss of a loved one can never be completely moved on from, so there were always going to be times of sadness.

And, when the women speakers pointed out the irony and injustice of this set-up  Calm down dear, yoursquore getting hysterical.Question Time provided perhaps the most eye-watering example of this when actor Lawrence Fox - who had been invited to sit in the ldquovoice of the people chair - unleashed a shocking but very revealing attack on a mixed-race member of the audience who suggested Meghan Marklersquos treatment by the media and others had been racist.:The curse of the House of Windsor: how love has torn apart the royal familyMr Fox, a Harrow-educated member of an established acting dynasty known for his role in the detective series Lewis, tore into the woman - who it turns out is an academic researcher in race and ethnicity - talking over her, aggressively calling the suggestion of racism ldquoboring, adding imperiously: ldquoWersquore the mostly tolerant, lovely country in the world.\" The actor compounded matters by using the tired and predictable ldquoyoursquore the racist defence when quite reasonably questioned on how a spfing white chap like him could be so sure about what racism is and is not.:Netflix chief confirms interest in deal with Harry and MeghanI donrsquot doubt that from Mr Foxrsquos privileged perch, Britain is indeed tolerant and lovely.

That is true ndash and thatrsquos the trouble. Scottish independence means freeing ourselves from precisely this delusion of an essentially benign Britishness. It means acknowledging the fact that since its creation by massive bribery and corruption in , the British state has been congenitally and irredeemably, an imperialist construct. The problem is that Scotland has a schizoid identity. We were on the one hand, the perpetrators of imperialism, while being at the same time its victims. Perhaps this lies at the root of Hugh MacDiarmidrsquos infamous ldquoCaledonian antisysygy.Mr Bone boasts that Scotland did well from this ldquoprecious Union. Indeed, a few did profit handsomely from Empire rich capitalists and servants of the state did nicely, thank you. But at what a cost. While the common men were far from home fighting for the imperial masters, their wives and children were being evicted from their homes and their houses burnt to the ground.The soldiers ed to poverty and destitution, and drted into the cities seeking a living. The empty landscape we regard today as beautul is a painful witness to past injustices, just as is the present grotesque ownership of vast swathes of our land by a handful of plutocratic landlords.But nostalgia for imperialism is still a very potent element in political le. Mr Bonersquos letter is powerful proof of this.Brian M Quail, Glasgow G.MARK SMITHwrites that many Scots ldquowant to stay the same ndash British ndash within a changed system, and then argues that the change needed is toward ldquoa federal system based on proportional representation [meaning] less chance of a Tory government at Westminster and so, by extension, less dference with Scotland.There are two major errors in this. First, in  the British electorate rejected the Alternative Vote , about the simplest method of PR there is. Only the Liberal Democrats, SNP, Plaid Cymru and most of the Green Party were in favour, while the Conservatives were resolutely against and Labour ndash perhaps an indication of things to come ndash adopted no official position. The UK vote to reject was almost  per cent, with England voting  per cent against and Scotland  per cent.Secondly, it is all very well to speak of federalism but just how would it be introduced  For instance, what relative powers would continue to be held at UK level  Just how centralised would it be  Westminster with a few ldquoparish councils  And how many ldquoparish councils A federal UK would be composed of four members, one of whichis almost  per cent of the whole by population. Of course, perhaps England would be happy to balkanise itself to create a more equal structure though even then, London and the south-eastwould alone constitute  per cent of the population, as well as being economically way ahead of everyone . And does anyone really believe Boris Johnson would introduce a system with ldquoless chance of a Tory government A federal UK, therefore, would pose its own issues, and in any event, given the short shrt AV got, implementing federalism may be a solution to something they might not even consider a problem.Therefore, the most egregious error in Mr Smithrsquos thinking is that while he sees the aim of a federal system to be ldquoless dference with Scotland, perhaps the view at Westminster is that it is Scotland that needs to change so that there is less dference between us and the rest of the UK Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.OWEN Kellydoes not appear to have high hopes for the pending visits to Scotland by Boris Johnson.I confess to having some sympathy with the challenge to re-establish the Tory Party in Scotland which Boris faces. He has to manoeuvre past the still-dark shadows cast by people like Michael Forsyth, Malcolm Rkind and Ian Lang. I cannot help but visualise them having afternoon tea with Jacob Rees-Mogg.Many people will rightly see the success of the SNP in Scotland as people simply voting for the least unappealing of the political parties on offer rather than a sympathy vote for independence. Most obviously, I expect very many SNP voters are really lapsed Labour voters who are still bewildered by the swings between the New Labour of Tony Blair and the failed far left Labour of Jeremy Corbyn.I anticipate that Mr Johnson may well be received better in Scotland than might be imagined.

Of this, pound million will be allocated to the Territorial Offices.\"Amazingly, \"Territorial Offices\" is the actual UK Government official term for the Office of the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Office of the Secretary of State for Wales and the Northern Ireland Office. So Scotland is one of the UK \"territories\", just like the British Virgin Islands or Gibraltar.Mr Johnsons first act as Minister for the Union will be to place the \"Territory\" of Scotland on a new international customs frontier running from Islay, via Campbeltown and the Firth of Clyde to Stranraer.While Whitehall is spending pound million to save the Union, it has committed pound. billion to planning for a no-deal Brexit.Councillor Tom Johnston , Cumbernauld.IT is clear that Boris Johnson is indeed a \"One Nation\" Conservative.

From a safety and operational perspective, we welcome the developments.But he added:The key questions to be addressed are around the economic impact of the removal of jobs from the island communities and how it will be ensured that the transition can be achieved given that the current ATC units will need to be fully manned right up to the day of transition to the new systems.ldquoIn a world where air traffic controllers are amongst many groups facing skills shortages, this is a signicant challenge that should not be underestimated.Hial said the change, which would be phased in, would modernise air traffic control.But the union Prospect said the plan puts  jobs at risk and described it as ldquopoorly thought through.Unmanned towers would feed information to a new combined surveillance centre at New Century House in Inverness.The building near the Kessock Bridge at Inverness is currently the offices of Highland News and Media, publishers of the Inverness Courier newspaper.The change would be phased in over the next few years, but Prospect understands it could be  before it takes effect at Dundee due to the complexity of the air space there.Comhairle nan Eilean Siarsaid that the project would see Benbecula downgraded to an Aerodrome Flight Information Serviceresulting in a loss of jobs and an inability to grow air services in Benbecula.ldquoTogether with a loss of jobs at Stornoway as a result of centralizing air control services in Inverness, there could be a loss of up to  jobs in the Islands, a signicant number of skilled jobs in an Island location, said the council.Uisdean Robertson, Chair of Transportation and Infrastructure, added: ldquoIt seems to me that Hial are looking at Stornoway and Benbecula Airports as burdens rather than assets.

Post-Python, he enjoyed a successful and wide-ranging career as film director and writer, popular historian and author.My impression from meeting him and most of the other Pythons was of a jolly inidual with an infectious enthusiasm and interest in everything around him. He had little of the angst that drove John Cleese and seemed more inclined to laugh at the absurdities of le than rail against them. I remember him laughing pretty much all the time, at everything. Well, almost everything. He was deadly serious in his opposition to the Gulf War. He wrote books for adults and children and one of the adult ones was entitled Terry Jonesrsquos War on the War on Terror: Observations and Denunciations by a Founding Member of Monty Python.But he had a great ability to laugh - and make others laugh - it was infectious, while at the same time making a serious point. The central character in Le of Brian is born in the stable next to Jesus and repeatedly mistaken for him, despite his mother [Jones] telling the crowd that he is not a Messiah. ldquoItrsquos the whole history of the church in five minutes, Jones said. ldquoYou find somebody to believe in and then within five minutes everyone splits up into factions, and they end up killing each other.The film came out in , but was banned in Glasgow for  years, even after it had been shown on television. The ban was finally rescinded in , four years after it was voted the greatest comedy film ever in a Channel  poll - a scenario that I suspect that would have infuriated Cleese, but amused Jones.Born in Colwyn Bay, Wales, in , Terence Graham Perry Jones was the son of a banker. He was head boy and captain of the rugby team at the Royal Grammar School in Guildford in Surrey, though he had no opportunity to act at such a traditional establishment where ldquodrama was a synonym for homosexuality. is earliest ambition was to be a poet. He studied English at Oxford University and joined the Experimental Theatre Club. It staged an annual revue as light relief and Jones wrote material with another undergraduate by the name of Michael Palin.The two of them built up their partnership on the Oxford revues of the early s. The shows attracted impressive audiences and played at the Edinburgh Festival and in the London West End. Their final revue together marked a move away from satirical material to the more zany and surreal style of comedy that would characterise Python.Jones graduated in , Palin in , and they subsequently wrote for, and occasionally appeared in, comedy and satire programmes, including The Frost Report and The Complete and Utter History of Britain, which featured TV interviews at the Battle of Hastings, an anachronism that would become a favourite device of the Pythons.Palin and Jones worked with some of Britainrsquos finest comic actors, satirists and writers, the end result of which was Monty Pythonrsquos Flying Circus. It premiered in  and ran for four seasons, pushing the boundaries of acceptability both in terms of content, including nudity, and style, with sketches simply ending when actors walked off. Python became a full-blown phenomenon, with books, records, ldquoconcert tours and feature films.Continuing his working relationship with Palin, Jones co-wrote the comedy series Ripping Yarns in the s. Subsequently he wrote and or directed the David Bowie fantasy film Labyrinth, Personal Services, a comedy-drama about a suburban brothel, inspired by the story of Cynthia Payne, and an adaptation of The Wind in the Willows, in which he played Toad.On TV he presented the history series Crusades, Ancient Inventions and Medieval Lives. Latterly he described himself as a ldquoquasi-academic and said he liked laughing and ldquosilly things.Critic George Perry once said Jones could speak eruditely on any subject from fossil fuels to Rupert the Bear, while Python colleague Eric Idle good-naturedly maintained he was the most boring man in the world. One feature that perhaps typied his gallery of Python characters more than any other was their cheeriness, no matter how ridiculous the situation.He would have made a good Santa Claus, delighting the children with his warmth and silliness, and then enthusiastically explaining the origins of the character to their parents.In later years he suffered from dementia. Palin said: ldquoThe thing that struck me was how Terry reacted to his diagnosis. He was very matter-of-fact about it and would stop people in the street and tell them: lsquoIrsquove got dementia, you know, my frontal brain lobe has absconded.rsquoHe is survived by his we, Alison, and two children."},{"url":null,"title":"scotrail-stop-skipping-rise-according-new-figures","story":"In response to a written question from John Finnie, Transport Secretary Michael Matheson revealed , services failed to stop at all the designated stations on their route last year.Mr Matheson said . per centof all trains booked to run in  were affected by the problem.:ScotRail fined more than pound.m over service failuresIt compares to , trains being reported to Transport Scotland for missing some stations between January   and January  .Mr Finnie, the Greensrsquo transport spokesman, said: ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that instances of stop skipping have increased by almost a fth in a year.ldquoFolk rely on our rail services for work, education and so much more and it is simply unacceptable that this level of inconvenience occurs.ldquoIt is not unreasonable to expect that your train calls at all the stations advertised.While current ScotRail operators Abellio will cease running services in March  after Mr Matheson decided not to run their contract for the full  years, Mr Finnie said the issue of stop skipping must be considered when the franchise changes.He added: ldquoGiven that stop skipping is only treated as a lsquopartial cancellationrsquo in the franchise agreement, there are times when deliberately bypassing stations could be financially advantageous for the operator.ldquoIt is vital that the Transport Secretary ensures this arrangement does not continue when the next franchise agreement is drawn up.He also urged ministers to invest more cash in rail travel, saying: ldquoIt is particularly important in light of the climate emergency that we encourage more people out of their cars and onto public transport.ldquoIncreased inconvenience and higher fares are not a combination that would appeal to many, itrsquos therefore vital that the Scottish Government urgently prioritise investment in improving rail travel in Scotland.A ScotRail spokesman said: ldquoMissing out stations is never done to meet targets or for financial gain.ldquoIf a train fails to stop at a scheduled station then it automatically fails to meet our very challenging targets.:ScotRail franchise cut short as SNP ministers strip Abellio of contractldquoItrsquos a very rare occurrence for a train to miss a stop and is only done as a last resort measure to limit knock-on disruption to customers across the wider network.ldquoCompensation is available for customers who are delayed by  minutes or more as a result of a missed stop or cancellation."},{"url":null,"title":"tyrannosaurs-exhibition-make-european-appearance-scotland","story":"Tyrannosaurs will open at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh on Thursday and feature rare fossil specimens, one of the largest and most complete T-rex skeletons in the world and models of feathered dinosaurs.Among the skeletons on show is one named Scotty, which was discovered in Saskatchewan, Canada, in  and named by the Royal Saskatchewan Museum excavation crew after they toasted the find with malt whisky.:Scotlands myths and legends: the real storyDr Nick Fraser, keeper of natural science at National Museums Scotland, said: ldquoFor any of us who are fascinated by dinosaurs, T-rex is surely the most recognisable, whether in popular culture or on the front of your first dinosaur book or poster as a kid.ldquoI think there is a real sense of wonder that such a seemingly fantastic animal actually walked the Earth.ldquoTyrannosaurs shows visitors not only the mighty scale of T-rex but also their fascinating family tree, including early Asian feathered tyrannosaurs which are some of the most exciting recent discoveries in dinosaur palaeontology.:University of Edinburgh team spot monster crocodileThe interactive exhibit created by the Australian Museum runs until May , having also already been shown in New Zealand, Canada and the US.Its director and CEO Kim McKay said the fossils are the building blocks of everything we know about these awe-inspiring creatures.She added: ldquoThe Tyrannosaurs exhibition will not only take visitors on a remarkable journey to our Earthrsquos ancient past but will also provide a real sense of scientic inquiry and discovery from the latest breakthroughs and research programmes."},{"url":null,"title":"new-calmac-ferries-long-way-off-completion-construction-stand-off","story":"There was not enough room on the slipway to construct the vessels side-by-side, and not enough space to get a mobile crane between them for vital work, it was claimed.When workers warned managers about the problem they were criticised for ldquonegativity. The jaw-dropping claims were made on the opening day of a Holyrood inquiry into the fiasco at the recently nationalised Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow.MSPs also heard the ferries were ldquosignicantly less than half-built and that  per cent of the design had yet to be agreed five years after a deal was signed to build them. A paralysing financial dispute between the yard and the public body buying the vessels was likened to a ldquostand-off at the OK Corral.:Itrsquos time for islanders to make decisions on leline servicesThe boats ndash one destined for the Arran route, the second for the Skye, Harris and North Uist triangle ndash are currently running four years late and at double their original budget. The last commercial yard on the Clyde, Ferguson Marine was bought by engineering tycoon Jim McCollrsquos Clyde Blowers empire in .The next year it won a high-profile poundm contract to build two dual-fuel ferries for Caledonian Asset Management Limited , the state-owned body behind CalMac. However bitter disagreements over design changes led to a breakdown in relations until the two sides could not ldquosit in the same building.With work at a standstill, and CMAL refusing to pay extra for the changes, Ferguson Marinersquos finances deteriorated and it went into administration last August. Unable to find a commercial buyer, the Scottish Government nationalised the yard in December to ensure the completion of the boats and to safeguard  jobs.Finance Secretary Derek Mackay who blamed the ldquodisastrous previous management for the problems, also installed ldquo turnaround director Tim Hair to get the project back on track. Mr Hair calculated that finishing the ferries would cost another poundm, on top of poundm already paid to Fergusonrsquos.The Scottish Government has also written off poundm in loans to the yard. Mr Hair said there had been a lack of project management on the contract, with no single person understanding it all, work down out of sequence, inadequate stock-taking and storage, and poor upkeep of the partly-built hulls. Mr McColl has refuted the criticism, and blamed CMAL for the problems. Holyroodrsquos rural economy and connectivity committee yesterday began its inquiry into what went wrong.Alex Logan, GMB convener at Fergusonrsquos, said the yard, which is constrained on one side by historic Newark Castle, was not big enough to build the ferries side-by-side. He said: ldquoYoursquove got a concrete slipyard. It can take one big vessel and possibly a small vessel.:Ferguson bosses lsquofairly and squarely to blame for ship debaclersquoldquoBut in my opinion, we could not facilitate to build two vessels that size so close together because the ground wasnrsquot sufficient enough.He said there was a plan, which he called ldquofine in concept, to build one hull on the slipway then launch it to make way for the completion of a second partlybuilt hull, but it didnrsquot work. The hulls were called  and .Mr Logan went on: ldquoWe started the  hull and it was moved to the side towards the castle side, and it was all kind of soft ground. ldquoIf you started putting hundreds of tons of units on that then itrsquos going to sink. It wasnrsquot sustainable to do that. ldquoFor the build schedule we had, we couldnrsquot have done it because it would come to a complete standstill on  while  was prepared for launch. He claimed said staff concerns had been dismissed by managers.He said: ldquoItrsquos plain to see - the size of the vessels that they were building, and the breadth of them on the berth, that the two vessels werenrsquot going to [fit]. ldquoWe needed a mobile crane to go down in between them, and the space as you started building the two together, there wasnrsquot enough space.Askedthe workforce had warned managers about the looming problem, Mr Logan said: ldquoThe management team said they didnrsquot like our negativity.He also said managers caused problems by hiring agency workers to cope with the contract who arrived earlier on site than full-time staff and commandeered vital machinery.He said that left skilled welders with little work bar sweeping up. Mr Logan said design changes had been made ldquoconstantly and there was still not a finalised design for the boats. Without it, the work was ldquolike building a jigsaw when yoursquove got missing parts. Yoursquore never going to complete it.Mr Logan said CMAL and Ferguson managers ldquocame to loggerheads. He said: ldquoThey wouldnrsquot agree on the design so we couldnrsquot move forward, so it just came to a standstill. It was just a stand-off at the OK Corral, who was going to cave in first.He added: ldquoIt came to a situation that CMAL and our own management team couldnrsquot sit in the same building. ldquoThat started affecting the workforce, because the work stopped on the vessels.Mr Hair said the vessels were ldquosignicantly less than half built, and % of the shipsrsquo design had not been agreed with CMAL, but that more naval architects and marine engineers had been hired to do this job. He said aspects of the design change process were a ldquomess, compounded by the breakdown in relations.ldquoThere were some changes that were agreed but were not signed off because the relationship had broken down to the extent that they were unable to sit in the room, he said.He told sceptical MSPs it would cost poundm to finish the vessels, as they were ldquomuch further away from completion than they look from a distance.Even the one ferry in the water was ldquostill a very long way off completion. The cost of scrapping the ships and starting again over would not be ldquodramatically dferent from the poundm bill for completing the hulls, but would take more time, he explained.

While the Government continues to dither, local people will feel the impact as we move from being rule makers to rule takers.“Last week I spoke in the house about the risks that new tarfs and trade barriers could have for businesses in the Northern Isles. Food and drink production are a staple part of the isles economy. The impact that continued and intensied tarfs could have on rural communities is signicant and organisations such as the SWA are understandably concerned.“This could be just a taste of what is to come as we leave the EU and our economic clout is reduced. If there were any doubt about the limits of our leverage in future trade negotiations with the US, this is a reminder of the precarious position that the Government is putting us in.“I will be writing to the Secretary of State for International Trade to explain what efforts they are making on these tarfs as a matter of urgency. With the UK losing our seat at the table in these trade talks at the end of this month, the next two weeks are crucial. We must give a voice to our local producers in these trade talks while we still can.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While HIAL has gone through the motions of consulting, having clearly failed to take on board any of the concerns raised, it is dficult to see what purpose this has served.“Since the announcement last week, I have been in discussions with local ATC staff who feel badly let down by HIAL.  Nobody disputes the need for modernisation, but even HIAL’s own consultants concluded that the remote tower model was the most costly and risky option. Alternatives were identied that could have delivered the improvements needed at a fraction of the cost.“While I welcome that HIAL is to carry out an island impact assessment, given its approach to consultation so far, there have to be questions over how robust or independent this assessment will be.#In the meantime, ministers must wake up to the scale of opposition and dissatisfaction amongst HIAL’s ATC staff. They should also recognise the clear threat this poses to delivery of leline air services in Orkney and across the Highlands  Islandsstaff choose to vote with their feet. That alone should give Ministers pause for thought and allow more time for alternative options to be explored”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The charity will build and equip the paediatric operating room at the Kakuma refugee camp in North West Kenya.The largest refugee camp in Northern Kenya, Kakuma is home to over , refugees, , of which are children. It aims to make the facility operational within the next six months. The announcement follows a call from Prince Jamie de Bourbon de Parme, Senior Advisor to the United Nations Agency for Refugees, of a desperate need for facilities to perform paediatric surgery in the Kakuma refugee camp.Philanthropists Garreth and Nicola Wood set up KidsOR in January  with the goal of providing access to safe surgery to children around the world. Over two billion children worldwide do not have access to surgery facilities and more children between the ages of five and fourteen die each year from surgically-treatable injuries than from TB, HIV and Malaria combined. The charity installs paediatric operating rooms in places where there are no surgery facilities, or where the only operating rooms are designed for adults with instruments too large to be used for operating on children. It has so far opened  paediatric operating rooms, including those in Haiti, Ecuador, Peru, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia and Malawi. The equipment to build each operating theatre is shipped from the charity’s warehouse in Dundee. Since its foundation over , operations have been carried out as a result of KidsOR equipment. Speaking today at Davos, Founder of KidsOR Garreth Wood said:“Nicola and I are so proud to be announcing today at Davos, this project at the Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya.

I want to make sure the Assembly reflects the new opportunity we have and have said to members both publicly and privately that I have to try and set a standard here of respecting everybody no matter who is in that chamber, they are all equal. The people who vote for them are equal. It’s about respect at the end of the day and I have to earn that as well.”The West Belfast MLA said that his take on the dynamics of the new ing Assembly going forward is that “it’s very important that it rises to occasion”. Having met with British Prime Minister Boris Johnston, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney, Mr Maskey said that both governments need to “respect that as well”. “We’ve got to respect political dference and we have to manage those,” he said. “I had very constructive engagements with them on Monday, obviously the substance of their visits was dealt with by the Executive.”Impartiality in his role as Speaker is a core element of the post, he said.“I had been pushing very hard on securing the funding that was announcement by the Department for Education for West Belfast schools. When it was announced about St John the Baptist I couldn’t even comment on it as I was in the ‘chair’ and that is the type of thing that your constituency needs to see a result on.

The Reds battled back from Leroy Millar’s early opener in the second half to stage a smash-and-grab - win and McLaughlin felt his side emptied everything into their search for a route back into the game. “I’m delighted,” reflected McLaughlin. “You saw how much effort that players put into the second half and you’ve got to give Ballymena credit – they were good on the break, got their lead with a soft goal we gave away and they defended their lead really well. But you saw how much our boys put into the second half, they emptied their heart on to the pitch and gave us everything.“To get the equaliser, we were happy with that and to go into extra time because I thought the momentum was with us. But to go and win it a minute later was an incredible finish to the game. It’s a sore one for Ballymenayou’re a Ballymena fan or player tonight. I’m sure they’re going back absolutely devastated at losing the game in the th minute. Unfortunately someone had to lose and you don’t want to see young players going off with their heads down but you can’t take it away from our boys. They gave it everything and they probably slightly deserved it in the end.” McLaughlin refused to take any credit for substitutes Thomas Maguire and Ryan Curran popping up with the late goals, but he praised the duo for putting their personal disappointment to one side for the good of the team. “The players on the pitch did the business,” he added. “The players on the pitch worked Ballymena really hard, they tried their best to work opportunities, Ballymena defended brilliantly well, you can’t deny them that, but when the seven minutes went up we looked like we had a goal in us. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to be one of those days where it would be a sad story – could we have done this and should we have done that “I felt we would get one chance in that seven minutes and take it to extra time, I felt we were finishing the game the stronger. For Thomas [Maguire] and Ryan [Curran] to pop up, fair play to them because I’m sure they were disappointed not to be starting the game. They put their own personal disappointment to one side to go and do a job for the team.”Such was the intensity of that seven minutes of madness, McLaughlin was unable to remember his feelings during the late drama but acknowledged the backing of the Red Army and paid tribute to their “incredible” support. “I pulled two hamstrings running on to the pitch celebrating and anything after that, I don’t know what happened,” admits McLaughlin. “Your emotions take over you because you can see what it means to the players and what it means to the supporters. You can’t go through any interview and not talk about the supporters tonight. “That was incredible support that Cltonville brought tonight in the County Antrim Shield on a Tuesday night. I think there is only one team in the ision that has that support and it’s Cltonville. You saw what it meant to the players and supporters from the goals went in. My mind went blank straight away and only now am I settling down.”Tuesday’s victory ends a four-year wait for silverware and McLaughlin hopes it will give his players a taste for future success. “Sometimes the first trophy is the hardest one to get. “I didn’t come here to make up the numbers, I came here to try and establish Cltonville back as a contender for the ision and as a team who should be challenging to win trophies. “If I didn’t see that potential in them, I wouldn’t have come up,” said the Derry man. “When I see the quality within the playing squad and the support they get when things are going well, when I see how hard they work, I know they’ve got potential to win trophies. All that hard work’s been justied tonight. “It’s one trophy but we’re not going to rest on that, we want more. It’s such a young squad and for a lot of them it’s their first senior medals. Hopefully now they’ll get that appetite for success and to challenge for trophies even more and you never know where this team might go.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"nicole starts new year at home","story":"NEWTOWNABBEY woman Nicole Adams has finally been allowed tohome after six weeks in hospital.We’ve been following the journey of cystic fibrosis suferrer Nicolewho last year won her battle for access to le-changing drugs.But Nicole was admitted to hospital at the end of November where her condition deteriorated after she caught a flu.Despite her sickness, she was still keen to start the drugs Symkevi and Orkambi after the Department of Health agreed a deal with US pharmaceutical company Vertex to make them available in the north.Unexpectedly, Nicole’s body reacted badly to Symkevi and she was taken into intensive care on December  as she fought for her le.Brave Nicole battled through and has now been given a more powerful drug – Trikafta – as she continues on the road to recovery.This week, Nicole completed a remarkable turnaround as she ed home with one month’s supply of the new drug.“I have one month’s worth of Trikafta in my grasp and it is so surreal,” explained Nicole.“What it has done for me so far is amazing.

John Dallats introduction to politics came quite by chance.An invitation to join a new branch of the SDLP was sent to his brother, but John went instead and almost got selected to run for council.He declined, pleading that he was living and teaching in Donegal.Four years later, after ing to Kilrea to take up a teaching post at St Paul’s College, he was chosen to run and so began a letime of council work which culminated in John becoming the first ever nationalist mayor in Coleraine.This period also represented his involvement in rejuvenating the local Credit Union which was in danger of closingA new Conference of Saint Vincent de Paulwas also being set up in Kilrea which would do amazing things for people.Around the same time, the man who was about to become one of Ulsters most hated sectarian killers, was placed by the Probation Service in the very town John lived, and worked in.Just before committing the Castlerock and Greysteel atrocities, UFF murdererTorrens Knight was placed on a local community employment scheme in Kilrea.He left without completing the year of work he was ordered to do by the courts.“The rest is, of course history,” said John. “He and his cronies murdered my friend Gerry Dalrymple, who was in my house the night before the Castlerock murder of four workmen.“His last advice to me was to pull my curtains.“The following morning, he was dead and so too were three of his workmates.“These were dark and dangerous times with armed cops sitting outside the council chamber.“In the beginning I thought they were protecting unionists but when I complained that they could be better used other places I was told by the Divisional Commander it was me they were looking after because I had no control over my mouth!“Yes, Ulster Resistance had brought in guns which were ided among the UDA and UVF and in the future innocent people would die at Castlerock, Greysteel and where.“Among those in the security forces to die was Bertie Gilmore who lived in the same lane as me.“We played together, grew up together and Bertie joined the UDR and I the SDLP. googletag.cmd.push  John Dallat ready for the road in his beloved Morris Minor car. Photo: Mary K Burke “He had retired three years and was recovering from a severe heart attack when he and his we were riddled with gunfire beside the retirement site he was going to build.“Today his daughter is among those who have helped me in challenging times.”Johnwas born and bred in Rasharkin, Co Antrim.“On reflectionI was asked to be born into a dferent house in a dferent place I would turn it down.“I was happy growing up by a Tilley Lamp, carrying water from the well and waking up in the morning with ice on the inside of the windows.“Later on I loved the ‘put-put’ of our ‘Start-o-matic’ generator and Peeke my pet pigeon was never from my side.“She had fallen out of the nest and my mother nursed her back to le while she grew the most beautul brown and white feathers.“An amazing creature of God. I knew why we couldn’t get a council house and I know it was more than just because we were Catholics. “Poor Protestants didn’t get council houses either because they might also be unable to pay the council rent.“Anyway, we kept a goat for the milk which was good for my wee brother Gerard who was special needs both physically and mentally.“He died when he was  and part of my mother and father died too.”John said that being the “underdog” was second nature to him growing up.And it was something he carried with him into his politics career.“It just seemed right and at times didn’t go down well, especially when I sided with the travellers when they came to town but the travellers were good people and attitudes changed,” he said.“When a young girl from a dferent part of the world suffered horric le-changing injuries after losing her job and was left homeless, it seemed right to have her for Christmas in our home and it was one of our best and happiest times ever.“Today she and her family are our best friends and we love them to bits.“When an African student was going to be deported because her visa ran out and her sponsor died suddenly it seemed only right to bring her home and set about stopping her going back to a country where she had only a blind grandmother and no one .“Luck had it I met the head of the Border Agency in Stormont on the corridor and he extended her stay for two years.“In the meantime, she met an amazing husband, married and is among our best friends.“Brian Kennedy played at the wedding and we dressed up in African traditional dress!There is one battle, not yet won, which has had the most impact on John in his role as a public representative.He said: “Perhaps the one story which doesn’t have a good ending just yet is the dreadful murder of Inga-Maria Hauser whose mutilated body was found in Ballypatrick Forest  days after her neck was broken in an attempted rape.“Early next year I will meet her only sister Frederika at a special conference in Queen’s University.“That will be an amazing occasion and hopefully the prelude to her murderer being brought before the courts for one of the most brutal killings I have ever read about.”At the heart of it all has been one thing, John’s family.“Politics had its mixed blessings. I got to see places in the world that I could never have been but it also brought its problems – searching under the car for booby traps, bullet-proof windows and doors and a gun that I know I would never have used.“But politics also gave me the most incredible family.“My poor we Anne was parachuted into the north at the height of the Troubles to a small town which was bombed from one end to the other.“Our daughter, Helena, now a councillor, became the youngest detainee when we were arrested by the British army in Derry shortly after crossing the border.“She was ten days old and our mission was simply showing her off to her Donegal grandparents.“Sixteen years later as a member of the Foyle Harp School she played for President Bill Clinton when he first made that history-making appearance in Mackey’s Foundry.“Later, she would entertain other leaders including President Robinson and McAleese as well as John Major and member of the Royal Family.“I felt honoured when she was invited to play in the Russian Embassy in Washington on Saint Patrick’s Day.“Today the same harp is never out of sight but not played in public anymore.”John added: “Our two sons, Ronan and Diarmuid have been amazing and in one dficult and dangerous year we were on the Aran Islands three times for our safety.“For  years Inishmore, the largest of the three Aran Islands has been our refuge, our safety valve and our friend.“Two weeks ago when I was in hospital after breaking my arm while canvassing, Vincent Mc Carron, one of our friends, left the island during a storm, drove to Kilrea to collect Anne, go to Derry to collect me from hospital and bring me home. He stayed for several days helping with my recovery.”In , one week after his mother sadly passed away, John became Deputy Speaker, a post he held for ten years.“I found it a strange place and certainly not reflecting my background where the term ’Mister’ was hardly order of the day.“In time I persuaded the doorkeepers and others to call me by my first name and I felt comfortable about that.“I felt I was dismantling a bit of the old Stormont that was in danger of being rejuvenated!“All these people were my friends by simply showing them a bit of respect, nothing more and I have missed them dearly over the last three years when I see little of them anymore.”Reflecting on challenges and achievements in his political career, Mr Dallat spoke about stopping the closure or the Belfast-Derry railway north of Ballymena.”The twenty-year project nearly went off the rails several times,” he said.“The Civil Service had a plan to save money by closing the railway north of Ballymena and use the savings to make a start on the A roadway though Toome.“Today the Belfast-Derry railway carries many more passengers than the Belfast-Dublin Enterprise service, but still needs connected to the Irish Rail network and that is a priority for me.John added: “Stopping the closure of the Irish Coastguard Radio Station at Malin Head, announced by Leo Varadkar when he was Minister for Transport.“I gave evidence to a Dail committee with two of my councillors and told the TD’s this was one of the best examples of cross-border bodies, seamless, transcending partition and two world wars, costing very little and actually working! Varadkar had to back down.”As vice-chair of the Public Accounts Committee I exposed wanton waste of public money and brought about important changes which the civil service didn’t like.“Effort to cover up who was responsible for bad mistakes and neglect were strenuously resisted.“Later I was invited to Georgia and Armenia to share my experiences and I felt so honoured and privileged.“I just couldn’t believe that a boy that grew up in a house with no electricity, no running water could be involved in helping democracy grow in two of Russia’s former territories.”With the Assembly back up and running, John says he has great hope for the future.“I have been through the best and the worst of times and see an amazing future for this part of Ireland.“I see wonderful people all around me in both communities and I want to be part of that community for the sake of future generations that will create a new Ireland and one we can all celebrate.“I would encourage every young person to do likewise.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We will be talking about things like spaces to play and meet friends, being healthy and feeling safe” googletag.cmd.push Childrens rightsAt the event young people will learn more about children’s rights globally and nationally and hear about the local picture.In the afternoon, attendees will work in groups to look at what’s going well and what needs attention for children and young people in the Council area.The agenda also includes a performance from young local musician ROE, winner of the Best Emerging Artist at the Northern Ireland Music Prize and support to Snow Patrol, Kodaline, Robbie Williams and The Coronas.ROE is taking time out of her busy schedule as she embarks on her very first headline tour of the UK. Claire Lynch, DSCDC Children and Young Peoples Coordinator, added: “ROE is passionate about supporting the community, especially on topics like mental health, the focus of some of her heart felt and quirky music.“The performance will add value to the discussions and creative workshops planned for the day.“It will give participants an alternative way to explore emotions and encourage them to be open about challenges while focusing on the importance of facing those challenges head on.“Consultation has identied that one of the biggest priorities for young people is mental health.“We need to work with the relevant partners to ensure that we develop more child friendly and accessible services, tailored to our local needs.“The partnership with Unicef UK gives us an opportunity to focus our attention in a joined up manner through the Community Planning approach”.Youth Advisory Member, Liam Mc Clintock looked ahead to the event: “I joined the group so I could give my opinion about things going on to try make Derry and Strabane a better place,” he said.“I’m looking forward to the day to see what happens.“I’m organising for a video I created with Third Space about Disability to be shown at the event.“I have experience of going through things that could help others and I want everyone to know that people with learning disabilities can do what other people do.“I want people to know thatyou have a learning disability you can do the things you want to do in le”.Anyone interested in taking part in the Youth Discovery Day should register their interest at youth@derrystrabane. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

But with our lives being so busy we often forget the simple activities bring the happiest times and memories. As parents, and childminders too, we can also feel under pressure to always be teaching our children, so this week I’ve combined these two themes, baking and learning. The curriculum for our young children talks about three prime areas of learningand these are Personal, Social andEmotional Development - this is all about learning to share, to wait, taking an interest and participating in activities, being responsible for tasks, having opportunity to feel valued and able to contribute, talking about what you are doing together, asking questions and having a special bond etc. googletag.cmd.push Communication and Language - this is about listening, paying attention, being able to focus and concentrate, being able to follow instructions, naming dferent items and actions, speaking in sentences, asking and answering questions, having a two way conversation etc Physical Development - is about small finger movements and large movements too, it’s about being able to use and control items, objects and tools etc and also self care, personal hygiene, having own likes and dislikes, being safe and using equipment safely etc. If we consider these and look at all that baking involves we can see all the learning that is going on from collecting all ingredients, selecting and organising bowls, spoons, whisks etc, washing hands, putting on an apron, then reading instructions, following a receipe, talking about what next, weighing, counting, pouring, breaking, mixing, adding, stirring, smelling, washing implements, waiting for cakes to cook then cool before sharing and tasting! googletag.cmd.push  Recipes For You To Make Together Scones - g oz self raising flour, g oz butter, g oz caster sugar, ml fl oz milk, pinch of salt . Method Heat the oven to C F Gas . Lightly grease a baking sheet. Mix together the flour and salt and rub in the butter. Stir in the sugar and then the milk to make a dough. Put onto a lightly floured work topand knead. Roll out the dough to about cm thick and shape into scones. Brush the tops of the scones with a little milk. Bake for - minutes until well risen and golden. Then leave to cool on a wire rack and add whatever you like! If you want to add sultanas or choc chips before you bake then why not! Cheese Pancakes -   cup flour,  frac tsp baking powder,  frac tsp sugar,   tsp salt,  egg,  cupof grated cheddar cheese - too much cheese will make them too sloppy,  cup milk ,  tbsp melted butter. Method Mix together the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt. Stir the grated cheddar cheese into the flour mixture until everything is evenly combined. Beat together in a separate bowl the egg, milk and melted butter. Stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients just to moisten. Heat a lightly oiled frying pan over medium high heat. Spoon the batter onto the pan, using approximately   cup for each pancake. Cook till brown on both sides and enjoy! Cupcakes - g butter , it’s a good idea to get the butter out of the fridge much earlier so it is soft!,  large eggs, g caster sugar,g self raising flour . Method heat oven to C   F  Gas . Fill a cup cake tray with  cake cases. Whisk together butter, sugar then add beaten eggs bit at a time, whisking in between. Add vanilla extract and sieved flour then pop the mixture into the cake cases and into the oven for about  minutes. If you’d like to decorate with buttercream after they have cooled , then to make the butter cream mix together g butterand g icing sugarthen add  tbsp milk and food colouringyou like. You can use a spoon or fork to add the buttercream to the cupcakes or even use a piping bag! Biscuits… - p vanilla extract. Method Heat oven to C C F Gas  and line a baking tray with baking   greaseproof paper. Put the butter in a bowl and beat until soft and creamy. Beat in the sugar, then the egg and vanilla, and then the sieved flour to make a dough - knead. If the dough feels sticky, add a little bit more flour. Roll out to about   cm thickness and cut out shapes using a biscuit cutter or rim of a cup. If you feel adventurous then gently press some clean toys into the biscuit - car tracks, lego shapes etcor add sultanas to make a face! Then bake for - minutes before eating!

A decision is then made as to as to whether they need to be seen face to face or can be given advice over the telephone.“Should a patient need to be seen by a GP, they will be offered an appointment at a suitable time. If there is no GP on sht in Mid-Ulster at that time orthe GP is unavailable because he or she is making home visits, patients will be offered the option to attend another base such as Ballymena, Antrim or Coleraine. On all occasions, patients can be assured that their medical needs will be safely met.“Dalriada Urgent Care continues to work with the Health and Social Care Board and local GPs to maximise the numbers of GPs available to work in the out of hours service.”The County Derry Post revealed last week that a number of people had experienced issues accessing the out-of-hours doctor service at its new Mid Ulster Hospital base.Sinn Fein MLA Emma Sheerin said she had been contacted by two local mothers who both, on separate occasions, had been forced to travel to Antrim after being told the facility wasnt open on Saturday evenings. The Mid Ulster Assembly woman highlighted the concerns to Northern Trust Chief Executive Tony Stevens.Ms Sheerin said yesterday: I welcome the response from HSCB, and indeed the invitation to meet with the team in Ballymena, which I am arranging for the coming week.I understand that pressures on staff have implications on services, and that no one can be in any two places at one time. However, a local GP in an emergency context is a necessity, and thus I believe this should be prioritised.The MLA added: I am constantly getting told by local constituents that waiting time for GP appointments are irrational and unfair, and I know from personal experience that it can be stressful to get seen in a timely manner. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Derry City and Strabane District Council is inviting children, young people and parents to take part in a special consultation event in the Guildhall next month, as part of its bid to achieve Unicef Child Friendly Community status. The Unicef Community and Youth Discovery Days will take place on Thursday February  and Friday February  in the Guildhall and will allow children and young people to discuss how they feel within their local community, as well as how their rights are respected or violated. googletag.cmd.push The event is being facilitated by Unicef UK in partnership with local statutory, community and voluntary sector organisations. Local young people from the Unicef Youth Advisory Panel will take a leading role, presenting and facilitating on the day. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor Michaela Boyle, encouraged organisations working with children and young people aged - to get involved. “Child Friendly Communities aim to create cities and communities where all children, whether they live in care, use a children’s centre, visit a leisure centre or local library have a meaningful say in and truly benefit from the local decisions, services and spaces that shape their lives,” she explained. googletag.cmd.push “With expert training and guidance from Unicef UK, the partnership sees politicians, staff and volunteers turning to children’s rights – as set out in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child – to guide decisions that affect children and young people. “Ongoing work has been taking place at a local level and a range of youth and adult stakeholders have already been involved in remote consultation. “This event allows children and young people to have an input into the decisions that affect them – from major policies, to decisions around the care they receive. We will be talking about things like spaces to play and meet friends, being healthy and feeling safe” At the event young people will learn more about children’s rights globally and nationally and hear about the local picture. In the afternoon, attendees will work in groups to look at what’s going well and what needs attention for children and young people in the Council area. The agenda also includes a performance from young local musician ROE, winner of the Best Emerging Artist at the Northern Ireland Music Prize and support to Snow Patrol, Kodaline, Robbie Williams and The Coronas. ROE is taking time out of her busy schedule as she embarks on her very first headline tour of the UK. Claire Lynch, DSCDC Children and Young Peoples Coordinator, added: “ROE is passionate about supporting the community, especially on topics like mental health, the focus of some of her heart felt and quirky music. “The performance will add value to the discussions and creative workshops planned for the day. “It will give participants an alternative way to explore emotions and encourage them to be open about challenges while focusing on the importance of facing those challenges head on. “Consultation has identied that one of the biggest priorities for young people is mental health. “We need to work with the relevant partners to ensure that we develop more child friendly and accessible services, tailored to our local needs. “The partnership with Unicef UK gives us an opportunity to focus our attention in a joined up manner through the Community Planning approach”. Youth Advisory Member, Liam Mc Clintock looked ahead to the event: “I joined the group so I could give my opinion about things going on to try make Derry and Strabane a better place,” he said. “I’m looking forward to the day to see what happens. “I’m organising for a video I created with Third Space about Disability to be shown at the event. “I have experience of going through things that could help others and I want everyone to know that people with learning disabilities can do what other people do. “I want people to know thatyou have a learning disability you can do the things you want to do in le”. Naomi Danquah, Unicef UK’s Director of Child Friendly Cities and Communities, added: “This day is key in ensuring children and young people have the opportunity to contribute equally to decisions, share their views and help shape the direction of Derry City and Strabane’s Child Friendly Cities journey. “Guided by their ideas and experiences, we can work together for better outcomes for all children and young people in the community.” Anyone interested in taking part in the Youth Discovery Day should register their interest atyouth@derrystrabane.

She also visited the Cornstore Creative Hub, home to Glasgowbury, which provides training and services to develop creativity, artists and audiences in the local area and across Northern Ireland.Welcoming Princess Anne to the Workspace Group, Chief Executive Georgina Grieve said:“Today’s visit recognises the impact the Workspace Group has had in Mid-Ulster since we were established in . Workspace has created hundreds of jobs and supported countless businesses in their own growth and expansion plans, creating much-needed employment in the region. Our community projects such as the Recreation Centre, After School Club and Community Fund have provided vital support for the Draperstown community. We have also been integral to the growth and development of many local community organisations through providing them with grants and free space to conduct their services. “I am delighted that we have been selected to host this visit and to welcome Princess Anne to the Workspace Group to introduce her to the broad range of businesses, social enterprises and community organisations with whom we work,” she added.Karen McGuigan of Steps Mental Health, said: “Steps take every opportunity to get Suicide and Mental Health talked about openly. Steps started in  and in  due to its growth Workspace provided us with a venue where we run classes, meetings and training. In  Steps Counselling was established. As we start  Workspace have provided us with additional space so we can meet the demand for our counselling service. Steps was set up by the community for the community and shows great things can be achieved when communities and organisations such as Workspace work together for change.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Thirteen thousand homes in Derry have been using the bins since last year, and the scheme has already been making a dference to homes across Strabane and rural areas.Plans are now underway to deliver , additional green wastebins with the aim of encouraging better composting and recycling practices and helping Council increase its composting rates. Collections will take place every fortnight on the same day as normal black blue bin collections . Areas will be notied of when the first collections will take place as the bins are delivered.The scheme is part of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s drive to reduce the amount of material being sent to landfill and the move towards a zero waste economy.Welcoming the news, chairperson of Council’s Environment and Regeneration Committee, SDLP Councillor Brian Tierney, said: “I am delighted to see Council being proactive once again in raising awareness of environmental issues, and providing people with the means to support the growing campaign to become more environmentally responsible. “Council is working to embed best environmental practice throughout its services, and this is the latest step in that process.Councillor Tierney concluded: “We are the first local authority to have a dedicated Zero Waste Circular Economy Strategy, Green Infrastructure Plan and Climate Adaption Plan. I want to encourage local people to support us in this drive to make our city and district a cleaner, greener place that we can all be proud of.”The pilot scheme has already been making an impact, and Council’s environment team are hoping to complete the extension of the initiative by the summer of .Head of environment with Council, Conor Canning, asked that people be patient while the additional bins are delivered.“Our team are currently making the necessary arrangements to complete the scheme and we would ask that people are mindful that due to the scale of the roll out and resourcing it will take a number of months to reach all areas. Information on what can be disposed of in the new bins, and the collections will also be issued in the coming weeks.“The bins provide a quick and convenient way to dispose of garden waste and will help Council in its aim to increase compost production which can then be utilised in parks, green spaces and cemeteries. “It’s a great way for people to contribute at no additional cost or effort to the upkeep of facilities across Derry and Strabane, and the campaign to enhance and improve our local environment to everyone’s benefit.”Anyone with a garden will be able to dispose of leaves, grass cuttings, dead plants, ashes, and small amounts or shredded paper and animal waste in the new bins.Find out more about the scheme and how you can improve recycling activity by visiting www.derrystrabane  greenwaste and the free recycling Bin-ovation app. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We came out and played after that and created a few half chances but I didnt think there was that much in the game.“I thought we battled until the end and we got our reward because we worked hard all season and its something we can be proud of because we came through it together as a team.”Leroy Millars goal for Ballymena had looked to be enough for David Jeffreys side but McDermott admits that the seven minutes of added time at the end of the game gave Cltonville renewed hope.“We saw the board and there were seven minutes left so that gave us a wee bit of a lt when we seen that,” he explained. “We rallied as a group and we got the important goal which, at the time, I thought was going to take us to extra time, but then Curny popped up with a great finish to send the place mad. It was unbelievable to be honest.“It was a sucker punch for them because obviously they have one hand on the trophy in the th minute and we looked down and out. But once we got the goal we got an extra -% in our game and it showed when we got the goal. “I thinkthe game had gone to extra time we would have won it anyway after that, but thankfully it didnt have to go that far because the old legs were starting to go a bit at that stage.” googletag.cmd.push BeliefThe victory is as timely for Cltonville as it was dramatic, with Paddy McLaughlins team still in the hunt for the league title in one of the most intriguing title races for years. Having lost the last two league games, the Shield victory, and the nature of it, could be the boost the club needed according to McDermott.“It instills a winning mentality in the group,” he said. “Not many people have senior medals to their name. Its not the biggest win but to be fair in the County Antrim youre beating all the top teams youre beating the likes of Linfield, Glentoran and Crues, so its still important to us and its one on the board now, and we cam focus on the league against Coleraine now on Monday. To get that win is important to lt the group going forward.”McDermotts renaissance in Belfast continues, with the -year old loving his football once again. “Its brilliant,” he said. “Im back playing football with a smile on my face. Im happy. Its just about getting through games now and playing every week for me. “I dont think Ive missed many games, maybe one or two at most with injury, which is brilliant for me with my track record. Thats something that hasnt been happening for a couple of years so its good to get games under my belt. Im back to where I was a few years ago to be honest. I feel really fit and healthy and the football is taking care of itself now which is great.

We came out and played after that and created a few half chances but I didnt think there was that much in the game.“I thought we battled until the end and we got our reward because we worked hard all season and its something we can be proud of because we came through it together as a team.”Leroy Millars goal for Ballymena had looked to be enough for David Jeffreys side but McDermott admits that the seven minutes of added time at the end of the game gave Cltonville renewed hope.“We saw the board and there were seven minutes left so that gave us a wee bit of a lt when we seen that,” he explained. “We rallied as a group and we got the important goal which, at the time, I thought was going to take us to extra time, but then Curny popped up with a great finish to send the place mad. It was unbelievable to be honest.“It was a sucker punch for them because obviously they have one hand on the trophy in the th minute and we looked down and out. But once we got the goal we got an extra -% in our game and it showed when we got the goal. “I thinkthe game had gone to extra time we would have won it anyway after that, but thankfully it didnt have to go that far because the old legs were starting to go a bit at that stage.” googletag.cmd.push BeliefThe victory is as timely for Cltonville as it was dramatic, with Paddy McLaughlins team still in the hunt for the league title in one of the most intriguing title races for years. Having lost the last two league games, the Shield victory, and the nature of it, could be the boost the club needed according to McDermott.“It instills a winning mentality in the group,” he said. “Not many people have senior medals to their name. Its not the biggest win but to be fair in the County Antrim youre beating all the top teams youre beating the likes of Linfield, Glentoran and Crues, so its still important to us and its one on the board now, and we cam focus on the league against Coleraine now on Monday. To get that win is important to lt the group going forward.”McDermotts renaissance in Belfast continues, with the -year old loving his football once again. “Its brilliant,” he said. “Im back playing football with a smile on my face. Im happy. Its just about getting through games now and playing every week for me. “I dont think Ive missed many games, maybe one or two at most with injury, which is brilliant for me with my track record. Thats something that hasnt been happening for a couple of years so its good to get games under my belt. Im back to where I was a few years ago to be honest. I feel really fit and healthy and the football is taking care of itself now which is great. The main thing for me is keeping that going and being happy.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Bangor attacker played in Kurtis Bell, who slotted the ball into the inside side-netting after Saintfield were dispossessed at the edge of their own box.Saintfield raised it a few gears and struck three times in the  minutes before half-time.The first came from Andrew Clarke after James Sofley was played down the line. After beating two defenders, James played in Andrew, who passed the ball into the bottom right-hand corner past the lsquokeeper.It took less than five minutes for left back Oliver Duff to score Saintfieldrsquos third. A long ball found Adam Childs on the left wing.He played it back to the edge of the box for Duff. He took one touch to set himself before striking a powerful left-footed shot into the bottom right corner.The Saints scored one more goal before the break with Andrew Clarke playing the ball across the face of goal for Tony Liken to finish at the back post. Saintfield went into half-time in the driving seat and - up.The second half started much like the first ended with Saintfield scoring an early goal.Ryan Sofley was the supplier of an own goal after bombing into the box and fizzing a cross into the near post which ricocheted off the Bangor defender into the net.At - up, the Saints took their foot off the gas and conceded just over five minutes after scoring.Bangor gained possession from a loose ball in midfield and played it into Matty Hall, who turned well to beat the Saintfield defender before striking the ball low and hard into the bottom corner.The Saints were again quick to respond with Andrew Clarke getting his hat-trick with half an hour still to go.Clarke started the move in midfield and finished it expertly after James Sofleyrsquos effort was parried by the lsquokeeper.Saintfield had a penalty and rebound saved less than two minutes later after James Sofley was brought down in the box.However, the Saints werenrsquot finished yet and Clarke had one more goal left in them with  minutes left to go. Possibly the best goal of the game, as he showed real determination and skill to score his fourth. Another counter-attacking goal from the Saints as they broke fast from a Bangor corner.Clarke received the ball just inside the Bangor half and stood tall after several attempts to bring him down. He beat three defenders before slotting home a cool finish into the bottom corner.This goal also signalled the end of the goalkeeperrsquos game after he strongly disagreed with the refereersquos decision to allow the goal to stand.

The cabinet was later found along the side of the Carrickmannon Road, near Ballygowan.The drugs taken included heroin and cocaine, both of which are dangerous even in small doses. They are types of hard drug in big demand on the black market. Additives like glucose are used by drug pushers to multiply the volume and increase profits. Other drugs, including morphine and strychnine, were also taken.The raid was the latest in a spate across the province and police fear that the addiction problem could be more serious than previously realised.Police chiefs have backed chemists pressing for an urgent review of the Home Office regulations about the keeping of prescribed drugs in steel cabinets.The present procedure is making things too easy for the thieves. It has meant that the hard drugs are all kept in the same place and the professional thief knows that.Before  regulations, chemists had better safeguards, evenit meant hiding the hard drugs on the general drugs shelves.

The Ballynahinch venture was unique in having a large amount of surviving documentation.Mr Reid says it is clear from these papers that the scheme organised by the First Presbyterian Church was sophisticated, comprehensive, self-funded, and cradle-to-grave in scope. It included widowsrsquo and old age pensions, end of le and burial grants, and support for orphans.Finance allocated to the project was known as lsquoThe Poorrsquos Moneyrsquo. The scheme operated late in the reign of William III and was continued into the time of Queen Anne, George I and George II.Nowadays benefit claimants unable to work through illness or injury, are paid Employment Support Allowance, .In  a similar scheme was obviously operating in Ballynahinch. The church carpenter at that time was John Gough, and that year he suffered a signicant injury, perhaps a broken arm or leg. He was unable to work or to earn a living for over a year.John had been married six years earlier in , in his home congregation by Rev James McAlpine. His we was Elizabeth, neacutee Ferguson. Their children soon followed mdash Christine, who was five in  Rebecca, who was four, and their twin boys, George and James, who were just one year and one month.With four young children and no income, John and Elizabeth were soon struggling financially. But in April the church stepped in immediately, with payments for an initial three-month period, at six shillings per instalment. In August John tried to resume work, but couldnrsquot. The church continued payments, but now at a reduced rate of d. Another attempt at work in October  failed again, and again payments resumed.John eventually recovered and ed to work permanently in August , having received a total of  support payments from First Presbyterian. He resumed his valuable role in maintenance of the fabric, receiving church contracts in ,  and .The problem of unwed mothers and absent fathers is one that troubles every age and every generation. Back in the early s, the Ballynahinch Session took a stern approach to fire-and-forget fatherhood.Their starting point was an interview with the expectant mother to ascertain the identity of her co-responsible male partner. If she proved uncompliant, exclusion from church attendance was then threatened. Faced with resultant near-total social ostracism, the mother-to-be soon cooperated.The next stage involved the errant couple appearing some Sunday morning before the entire congregation, kneeling on the Stool of Repentance and confessing their extramarital transgression. After that they were received back into the congregation. Their child was baptised and recognised as a church member.In a -year period the Ballynahinch Session dealt with  such cases. In six, they identied both parents. In six other cases only the mother was identied in seven, only the father. In one case the origins and surname of a lsquofoundlingrsquo child were known, but neither parent actually came forward.By st century standards, these church procedures sound draconian. But they had the purpose of protecting the rights of the child and of offering an opportunity to the parents for their reputations to be salvaged,possible.The alternatives were a lot worse. It was common in the s for the sexton at Magheradroll Parish Church to discover live newborns abandoned overnight on his church doorstep, ordead through neglect or infanticide, to find their bodies surreptitiously concealed in adjacent graves.In Ireland such surviving infants were sent in large numbers to the Foundling Hospital in Dublin, which who received between ,-, orphans annually. The hospitalrsquos mortality rate was some %.In Ballynahinch, under Presbyterian auspices, some such infants were spared this grisly fate. The lives of a number of potential orphans were actively protected by the church in their home town.Under the Welfare Reform Act of , Disabled Living Allowance was controversially replaced with Personal Independence Payment. DLA payments were made to claimants who often had long term medical conditions. The amount of the award ied according to the degree of disability.Interestingly, in Ballynahinch in the early s, First Presbyterian made a number of long-term DLA-type awards to some lsquosupplicantsrsquo.Ms Grissel Foreman was on such a benefit from -. Some financial records of the Poorrsquos Money still exist. But all its other documentation is lost, so we donrsquot know what Grisselrsquos ailment actually was. It was obviously slow and progressive, perhaps something like tuberculosis, or multiple sclerosis, or Parkinsonrsquos.As her condition deteriorated, the church increased its amount of financial support. In  she received seven payments totalling s d. By  this had escalated to  payments totalling pound s d.She died in  and was buried at church expense. Over  years, amounts paid to her totalled pound s d. This was an enormous sum, considering the church ministerrsquos annual stipend at the time was pound.These and many other such stories will be outlined on Monday night at Down Museum.

Rail chiefs, who had been hoping for investment after the railways had proved so crucial to the war effort a few years earlier and that the buses would be barred from competing with the trains and instead provide a feeder service to stations, were devastated at the outcome.ldquoThe recommendation, accepted by Stormont, was that the entire Belfast and County Down Railway main line from Belfast to Newcastle, including the branches to Donaghadee, Ballynahinch and Ardglass, should be closed.The only route to be saved was the Belfast to Bangor connection, which continues operating successfully to this day.Mr Gardiner continued: ldquoThe attitude of Stormont was that it would be cheaper to move everything to the roads than to invest in railways that had been run down during the Second World War. People would use the buses instead. They developed huge road building schemes mdash most were never completed mdash but closed the railways first before these were even started. It seems incredible today.ldquoThe most puzzling element of the decision was the axing of the Belfast to Newtownards line, which served the east of the city mdash Dundonald, Knock and Comber areas in which the suburbs were developing and likely to provide increased commuter traffic had they been spared.ldquoIndeed, there were more than enough new diesel trains ordered to operate both the Bangor and Newtownards lines mdash and evidence suggests that the Transport Tribunal expected Stormont to spare the Comber line as a compromise option and as late as , before the tracks were lted, they were calling on the minister responsible to reverse the decision and trial these new diesel trains on this section of track mdash a call that fell on deaf ears.The  closures were the first steps in a plan which was to see the reduction of the Northern Irelandrsquos railway network from  miles to  miles mdash a decrease of  per cent.A decade later, the Great Northern Railway was ided between the UTA and its counterpart in the Republic, CIE, and further closures to lines to Armagh, Dungannon, Omagh and Strabane occurred.Willie Watterson and James Magill, who were porters and ticket clerks at Newcastle and Tullymurry stations, recalled their memories of the last train in an interview recorded for the BBC documentary lsquoRaising Steamrsquo in ldquoThe last train was a Sunday night. It was a cold winter night, January , , said Willie. There was twelve coaches, and two engines and two guards. She was packed. Packed to the doors. So I lit all the lamps, and put detonators on the line to give her a send-off.James added: ldquoI think every station did the same thing, so when the train came in there was a salute of bangs. I felt terrible about it, terribly terribly sad. I still felt it couldnrsquot happen. Still felt theyrsquoll come back, theyrsquoll run again. I couldnrsquot believe therersquod be no more railways, after working on them so hard.Adam Hamilton, who was a fireman mdash the person who stoked the fire on the steam locomotives mdash said: ldquoIt broke my heart, because the railways were in my blood.

Maybe its just a bit of magic dust, but itrsquos definitely a unique ability to get players to play for him.ldquoIt doesnrsquot matter what age you are. If you are good enough, he will give you a chance, he added.ldquoDonrsquot forget we won the Ulster League last season with five or six minors starting regularly every week.ldquoThat injection of youth sure helped the lads get a great start to the season and everything fell into place after that, he continued.Gilligan also believes that Moranrsquos love for the game and the way it should be played has rubbed off on the players.ldquoMickey is extremely keen on discipline. He insists the players play the game and let the referee do his thing without being shouted at.ldquoHe doesnrsquot rant or rave from the sidelines and expects that same response from the players and gets it, he added.Dedication and team structure are what he has instilled at Eoghan Rua Parc and a love for the game along with a winning environment.Kilcoo have been the benchmark in Down football for the past decade, but Moran has taken them a stage further in just  months.Corofin may be blessed with several players who have turned out regularly for Galway and in Kieran Fitzgerald, Liam Silke, Kieran McGrath, Gary Sice and Ian and Daithi Burke they have the nucleus of a talented outfit.However, Kilcoo believe they bigger they are, the harder they fall..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Minister.jpg","title":"Minister vows to end strikes with pay deal  ","story":"HEALTH staff across the district were yesterday digesting the news that new Stormont Health Minister Robin Swann had confirmed that pay parity with their colleagues in England can now be restored.He told the Assembly that it would cost an extra poundm that would come from within existing Stormont finances.Mr Swann met with representatives from a number of leading health trade unions to brief them on the decision, describing the talks as ldquoconstructive.The new man in charge of the Provincersquos health portfolio said the ldquobreakthrough that we all wanted has been achieved this isa good day after some very dficult days.Mr Swann announced that the Department of Health had already gathered together poundm to increase pay for health workers, with an extra poundm being pulled from existing finances at Stormont.His decision to address the pay issue came after a series of strikes involving staff across the health and social services sector over pay and staffing levels.Nurses and other health workers in Northern Ireland have been taking industrial action over pay and staffing levels, with Mr Swann confirming that his officials would work with the unions on the issue of safe staffing levels in the health service and hopes a plan can be drawn up to establish such levels ldquowithin a reasonable period of time.Today, representatives from trade unions representing nurses and all health and social services staff will meet with Department of Health officials, with Mr Swann hoping for a ldquoswt end to their industrial action.He added: ldquoOur nurses and great social care workers can come off the picket-line.Prior to yesterdayrsquos announcement, local nurses said that they hoped that theof Stormont would pave the way for the pay parity and staffing issues to be finally addressed.Ahead of yesterdayrsquos meeting, the RCN said while welcoming the restoration of the Stormont administration, nurses had been made many promises.The RCNrsquos Northern Ireland Director, Pat Cullen, said nurses wanted to see those promises converted into action.Last Wednesday and Friday, nurses based at the Downpatrick hospitals took part in the latest round of stoppages and were buoyed by the support of passing motorists and others as they manned the picket-line at the entrance to the Downshire Civic Centre.Braving bitterly cold conditions last Friday morning, nurses were hoping for positive news from Stormont, hours after Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney had published the New Decade New Approach document.Nurses, who had sacriced another dayrsquos pay, were joined at one stage on the picket-line by South Eastern Trust interim chief executive Seamus McGoran and Roisin Coulter, the organisationrsquos director of planning.Nurses said that they hoped that the political parties would go back into government and that their demands for pay parity and safe staffing levels would be met.ldquoWe believe that the collective pressure of health service staff has ensured that politicians know that they must get back to Stormont, said nurse Irene Murray.ldquoWe do not want to be used as political pawns and hope that there is cross-party agreement for politicians to get back to work. While pay parity and safe services are key issues for us, the key thing is that there are enough recurrent resources in place to deliver this now and in the future.Irene said the RCN is about putting patients first, describing the scale of the hospital waiting list issue as ldquounacceptable.She added: ldquoEmploying more nurses can help bring waiting lists down. This is not a new phenomena. It is tough to work as a nurse and it is not an easy job. But we currently have a situation where some nurses are taking on extra shts to earn more money, but that is just an unacceptable way to live.Alison Megarry said patients are nursesrsquo primary concern and at the heart of what they do, highlighting the need to keep staff working in Northern Ireland to ensure they donrsquot go across the water and donrsquot come back.She revealed that she was talking to a nursing sister last week who was working on international recruitment for nurses in Mumbai to work in Northern Ireland.ldquoThe nurses in India said why would they come here when the pay is less than it is in England, Scotland and Wales. I believe thatwe can keep our nurses here, it will help to tackle the waiting list issue, she said. ldquoThe big issue we have is that the population is ageing and people are living longer which therefore impacts on waiting lists.Nurse Sonia McCoubrey said that while pay parity is one issue, additional nurses are also required. She said many newly qualied nurses are choosing to go to England, Scotland or Wales because the money is better.She also said she worries about the safety of newly qualied nurses managing dficult situations and the patients they are caring for.ldquoYou have trolley waits and people lying in corridors. There is no privacy, no dignity and the situation is appalling. You go home at night after a sht burnt out and worried about what you have seen, the nurse added.Nurse Donna Boyd also expressed concern about waiting lists and said she fears that the situation is going to get worse, forcing many people to go private.ldquoIf more money is put into the system nurses are quite happy to do even more to help reduce waiting lists. All nurses go and above what is required of them when they are working, often staying after their scheduled quitting time which is unpaid work, she said.ldquoWith more people going private because of y waiting lists, a lot of the doctors and consultants are taking on private lists which then impacts on the NHS list. I have friends who were nurses who have left the profession to work in supermarkets because they have burnt themselves out. They canrsquot cope with the demands being made on them, she added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Now.jpg","title":"Now is the time for delivery – McGrath  ","story":"THE restoration of the Assembly and Northern Ireland Executive should herald delivery for people at the start of a new decade, according to South Down SDLP MLA Colin McGrath.Mr McGrath was able to take his seat in the Assembly chamber for the first time in three years last Saturday, an occasion which he described as a ldquomomentous day for Northern Ireland and its future.He said that with so many issues staring people in the face including Brexit, y hospital waiting times, workersrsquo rights and wages, welfare issues and an education system in crisis, Northern Ireland needed a restored and fully ing Assembly and Executive to deal with these mammoth issues.The Assemblyman described his partyrsquos decision to re-enter the Executive as an act of ldquotrust and goodwill.He continued: ldquoWe all know the reasons why the last Executive failed and these have been well covered.

Across the resort,  street lights are not working.The figures are available on the NI Direct website under the reporting fault problems menu with other districthot-spots including Ballynahinch where  street lights are currently out of order.Elsewhere,  faults have been reported in Killyleagh, with  brought to the government departmentrsquos attention in Castlewellan and Crossgar. In Saintfield,  faults have been reported.In Ballygowan,  street lights are currently out of order with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Sixteen street lights are out of order in Dundrum with  faults reported in Drumaness. The figures for the Spa and Clough are  and nine respectively.Last month, the Department for Infrastructure confirmed that its current budget for street lighting repairs was approximately poundm, explaining that the figure was much lower than the pound.m needed to provide a full street lighting repair service.It also revealed that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce which only consists of five full and three part time electricians.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran described the number of reported street light faults across large parts of East Down as ldquoalarming and hopes that the money to expedite much-needed repairs will be earmarked by the new Stormont Executive.He said broken street lights in many areas represent a health and safety issue, explaining that an examination of every town and village across the district will reveal a signicant number of faults.Cllr Curran described faulty street lights as a ldquohot topic with politicians being contacted about the issue on all almost daily basis. He said the legacy of underfunding the roads department has experienced is now clear for all to see.The politician said many will be concerned that the Department for Infrastructure does not have the money it requires to carry out much-needed repairs.ldquoWhile I understand the decision to prioritise emergency repairs, there is no doubt that the alarming figure of almost  faulty street lights across East Down is simply going to increase. Clearly the issue is going to get a lot worse before it gets better, he said.ldquoStreet lights which are not working in areas where elderly people and indeed young families live poses a major problem. A fully working street lighting system provides residents with a sense of security and helps deter would-be criminals.Cllr Curran said that while the new Stormont Executive will inevitably face calls for investment in many key areas including health and education, the Department of Infrastructure also required an injection of funding.He added: ldquoWhile the focus for some will be on major new roads schemes which is understandable, it is clear that the creaking infrastructure the government department is responsible for, including street lighting, requires major cash injection.ldquoThe street lighting issues requires immediate attention. We are still in the grip of winter and several months away from the clearer evenings. Now that we have a local minister in place, I hope to meet her on this issue and other matters of local importance.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure said that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continued to face budget challenges and resources were currently not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service.She added: ldquoDue to this restricted service, outages are taking longer than usual to be repaired.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is events like this in the very heart of Penarth which demonstrate how lucky we are to have such a ying and vibrant collection of businesses, which are so accessible.It was great to witness how the streets opened up to more traditional businesses of selling hand-crafted Christmas gts and roasted chestnuts, adding to the selection of businesses we already have on offer.Many of you will be aware of Small Business Saturday, which this year falls on December . The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

The event was well attended, and we estimate over two hundred turned up.ldquoAt present we have organised an exhibition in Chepstow Museum celebrating the tradition, with over  artists displaying work. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They each received weekly book vouchers, provided by Egmont, to spend at Grfin Books, and coffee shop vouchers donated by local businesses.In , the families committed to reading with their children for  minutes per day.The bookshoprsquos owner, Mel Grfin, said:\"We were delighted to be selected to participate in this exciting project. The idea was to encourage children to experience the joy of reading for pleasure, rather than seeing it as just something they have to do for school\"Research shows that being able to choose their own books, as well as sitting down regularly to read with a parent, makes a real dference to childrens enjoyment of reading. This in turn benefits their schoolwork across the whole curriculum, not just in literacy.\"We are also grateful to the local businesses who generously donated the coffee shop vouchers to help make this happen.ldquoThe contributions of local businesses show once again what great community spirit we have here in Penarth!\"In total,  local businesses donated coffee shop vouchers.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.

The firm is marking two decades leading the way in the industry, and according to founder Terry Moore, the firm is well on its way to doubling its size and embracing the latest technology for its clients Outsource Solutions is a firm which is ahead of the curve when it comes to emerging technologies and a company which embeds itself in a client’s business to ensure total integration – ultimately helping to boost it and help it grow.“Our approach is to embed ourselves into the customer’s business, and take IT out of the boardroom,” Terry says. “What we do is try to get ahead of some of the problems, understand the business and recognise that the technology is there to benefit the company.“We are there to make sure that business is possible – enriching lives, making things easier and safer. An important part of this is the relationships that we have.”Terry formed Outsource Solutions  years ago, around the time of the so-called ‘millennium bug’ when he says some firms were using scare tactics to get businesses to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds, often unnecessarily. “For me, one of the things I felt was missing was understanding a business and factoring that refresh into it over a few years – letting them get on with what they do.”The company – which now has five locations, including Belfast – is a full service IT firm which manages every element of a business’s infrastructure, including security, enterprise wi-fi, telecoms and networking.“We now have just over  staff and are we are on a five-year plan to double in size again. There has been considerable growth in areas such as enterprise wi-fi, converged networks and telecoms,” Terry says.Client retention is also something which Terry and the business prides itself on. “Every customer that we signed up with in , we still work with,” he says. “We will give a recommendation as to how we think a network should be built. If they accept that, then we take it on as a risk.“Technology is just a toolbox for us to allow us to deliver IT – technology to allow them to really access and control their data.”Outsource is a business which has been at the forefront of emerging developments in technology, including cyber-security. Terry says, even just a few years ago, it wasn’t being taken seriously by many businesses. That has now changed signicantly.“In the last couple of years, cyber has completely exploded – but we were ahead of our time,” he says. “My experience of last  years and the last five in particular is that there has been a massive job to do in educating businesses and their users about the cyber threat.“We have reached the tipping point and the human firewall is becoming much stronger – people and users are more sensitive to what it means, making it all a far better place. But there are still businesses which are happy to cut fast and loose, and take risks.”While the company’s client base started off in professional services businesses – such as law and accounting – it’s grown into a host of sectors, including transport, logistics, manufacturing and engineering.“We have carved out a niche in hospitality as well – particularly in areas such as enterprise wi-fi, converged networks and communication, generally.”Terry says Outsource is seeing business growth among many of Northern Ireland’s medium-sized businesses, with more than  staff.“Our job is to enhance, improve and optimise the performance for as many users as we can. Our aim over the next four years is to be able to deliver those services outside Northern Ireland, across the rest of the UK and into the Republic of Ireland.“For us, the constant is that we are always there at that point of where technology is consumed. The role we play is being integrated and a trusted advisor. That’s how we will continue to be successful.”As for the next  years, with a rise in automation and articial intelligence – something Terry says has to become a little more intelligent and a little less articial – the next major leap will be the advent of quantum computing. It’s something which remains in its infancy.“While it’s still early, we are on the verge of the most aggressive technological change that any of us have ever seen,” he says.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
