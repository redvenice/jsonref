It took a long chain of bad decisions and worn-out policy to allow a fridge fault in a fourth-floor flat to turn into the biggest single loss of life in London since the Blitz.Not many of those involved will come out unscathed, and firefighters are not alone in thinking it ironic that the first people to be humbled in the report are those who came to the rescue.Little wonder Matt Wrack, boss of the Fire Brigade Union tweeted angrily: \u0027Firefighters did not put flammable cladding on Grenfell Tower. Firefighters risked their own lives time and again during the fire.\u0027 To which he added: \u0027Government has done nothing substantive in 28 months.\u0027All this is true, and not just this government. Successive governments and their fire ministers have been shamefully complacent. I will come back to that disgraceful issue in a moment.And not only is it true that firefighters risk their lives, as Mr Wrack says, but they work in frighteningly hostile conditions.To see what they go through, often fumbling on hands and knees in blazing heat and almost zero visibility, is shocking to those unaware of how dangerous, uncomfortable and distressing many rescue operations are.         The families (pictured) of some of the Grenfell victims held a press conference at Church House, Deans Yard, London, after part of the Grenfell Tower Inquiry was publishedAnd spare a thought for the control room staff and the harrowing life-and-death calls they had to manage.But justified public admiration for firefighters has protected them from the need for a different sort of boldness. If only they had been as plucky with their political masters as they are in rescue operations. How did they allow the building regulations to become so out of date?How did they accept without loud and persistent protest a system of building control that tempted designers and contractors to cut corners?And a big bugbear for me, why had they not mounted a rumbustious and powerful campaign to demand that sprinklers be fitted to all new and refurbished housing, as is compulsory in Wales? Sprinklers are cheap. People don\u0027t die in homes with sprinklers. There\u0027s often little damage. Usually the fire is controlled by sprinklers alone.It must be said that there were many fine fire chiefs — I was recruited by them to the cause of fire safety and I campaigned alongside them — who stuck their necks out to push for more protection in social housing. But the National Fire Chiefs Council, like London\u0027s fire chief Dany Cotton, only came out with full-throated support after so many died in this gut-wrenching disaster.The appointment of fire chiefs has long been politicised, favouring people who conform rather than independent thinkers and if anything the introduction of elected commissioners has pushed them to be more compliant.          Following the blaze, London Fire Commissioner Dany Cotton (pictured) defended the advice given out to residents to stay-putIt is important to be process-driven in any complex, high-risk emergency but it needs audacious leadership to know when to discard the manual.Unquestionably, the failure to evacuate for an hour before they did was catastrophic.But the stay-put policy was designed to protect residents in fire-resistant concrete compartments and to stop people dying in high-rise stairwells. It had largely served its purpose over decades, and, though Dany Cotton has been castigated, would you have done any different?In the intensity of the moment it always seems riskier to break the rules than follow an ingrained procedure, and stay-put was a nationwide policy. In fact, according to the report, her commanders had \u0027no training for how to recognise the need for an evacuation or how to organise one\u0027.What is more surprising is that even with hindsight Dany Cotton has said she\u0027d do the same again. I fear that speaks volumes not just about her but about the sort of people promoted into fire service leadership.The report is right that the fire service was stuck in its ways. Years before Grenfell it was obvious that some forms of cladding posed a fire risk.All around the world there had been instances, some of them dramatic and widely publicised on social media, where flames had shot up the outside of structures, not least in one of the tallest residential buildings in the world, the aptly named Torch Tower in Dubai.It should have been fire chiefs hammering on the doors of regulators to make sure flammable cladding was categorically banned. At the very least risks should have been identified and procedures thoroughly revised.Sir Martin thinks there is \u0027compelling evidence\u0027 that building regulations were breached, and will look at those next year. But I can tell you now that the regulations had not been revised for years, were poorly policed, and there was so much wriggle room that it might take months of argument in court to establish what was legal and what was not.Yet still, I feel sorry for Dany Cotton and her team. As Sir Martin concedes: \u0027They showed great courage and dedication.\u0027What he should have added, but so far hasn\u0027t, is that we need urgent solutions, not scapegoats. Sadly that does not seem to be what everybody wants to focus on. Blame is in the air. Most of it wide of the mark, and none of it likely to prevent similar tragedies.Some has been rancorous and frankly tribal.Even allowing for high emotions, Labour\u0027s John McDonnell must surely now be embarrassed at making political capital out of the disaster soon after the fire, with his outburst that the victims were \u0027murdered\u0027 by political decisions made by Tories.In fact, as I can attest after spending decades pressing for better fire safeguards in social housing, seven of the nine government ministers we met and who turned down our pleas were Labour.Then there are the activists who have been flyposting Marxist slogans across London: \u0027Justice for Grenfell, Austerity Kills\u0027. In fact the fire took hold because the cladding was part of an improvement package costing £8.6million — a package which the report concedes, \u0027was intended to promote safety in the event of fire\u0027.The refurbishment was agreed, as was the cladding, by a tenant management organisation whose board had a majority of tenants, and was signed off by the council\u0027s housing scrutiny committee which included a councillor who is now the constituency\u0027s Labour MP.And in a similar vein, a firefighter who attended Grenfell blamed cuts to the London Fire Brigade.Taking a headline from the Moore-Bick inquiry beside a photo of Boris Johnson, he tweeted: \u0027I am truly disgusted by what this country has become. This picture sums it up perfectly. Man who closed 10 fire stations, cut 30 fire engines and 500 firefighters not to blame. But Fire Brigade cut to ribbons, fully to blame.\u0027It is nonsense of course. Fire stations were being closed because over the past few decades fire-related deaths had plummeted, down some 40 per cent in the decade leading up to Grenfell.Firefighters have done much to help the trend, offering safety advice and smoke detectors. But it had meant there was now less call for the service.Another 10 fire stations, 30 pumps and 500 firefighters would not have made much difference to those trapped in Grenfell Tower. It is true some specialist equipment might have been useful but that is a different issue.It is equally nonsense that the local council is to blame. At least 430 other residential towers in England had risky cladding, many if not most, in Labour-held boroughs, and several in private ownership.Ten years ago it was a Labour-run council, Southwark, that pleaded guilty to breaking fire safety regulations in what was then our worst tower block fire which killed six at Lakanal House.Kensington and Chelsea have acknowledged they handled the Grenfell disaster badly, exposing poor disaster management. The failures also laid bare how distant blue-collar North Kensington was from the preoccupations of a borough run by Tories from South Kensington and Chelsea.But many local authorities have been in one-party control for decades and are equally aloof. Many can thank their lucky stars that Grenfell didn\u0027t happen on their patch. They too would have been like rabbits in the headlights.Not that the political Right should come out of this with their heads held high. What is essentially a noble idea of simplifying rules long ago became an obsession and then a doctrine.Insulting phrases were routinely used to smear regulation as \u0027bureaucracy\u0027 and \u0027red tape\u0027, sometimes backed by a largely unfounded dogma, bordering certainty, that regulation damages the economy or is an afront to freedom, and that sweeping it away is a good thing in itself.In reality, there is always a trade-off between recklessness and being overcautious. That was the calculation the specifiers and contractors made when refurbishing Grenfell Tower, and it turns out they weren\u0027t cautious enough.But whoever is to blame, we should beware of blame itself. In the next phase of this inquiry attention will shift to the people who designed and carried out the Grenfell renovations.It might be therapeutic to find heads to put on platters, but, as so often, the focus will be on the little guys, the inidual designers and builders who, like most people, could never have imagined such a catastrophe could happen.We might call it justice, but it never does much good to punish people for making a genuine mistake, even if on reflection, they might or should have known better. In fact, blame can be inimical to safety — ask doctors or pilots.The police have a separate inquiry but criminal proceedings gag witnesses and reporters, and chasing essentially honest people will guzzle up another £40million.It is also a huge distortion for the already hard-pressed police. In any case, Grenfell has caused enough misery without ruining more lives.But above all, blaming iniduals will distract us from the big issue: complacency. Complacency which goes to the highest levels of the corridors of power.The complacency which for decades said we didn\u0027t need more rules and regulations, and insisted the cost equation for safety wasn\u0027t worth it.The complacency with which ministers and their mandarins maintained their insouciance even after the Lakanal House disaster in 2009.The complacency with which they still haven\u0027t brought forward plans to make sprinkler systems mandatory for social tenants.The people who made, or rather didn\u0027t make, those critical decisions are hiding in plain sight.Sir Martin promises he will uncover them as witnesses in phase two of his inquiry. But yet again we have to wait."},{"url":null,"title":"STEPHEN GLOVER cynical MPs claim sisterly solidarity Meghan Markle","story":"Share this article        The letter was spearheaded by Halifax MP Holly Lynch (pictured above) who said the MPs would \u0027stand with\u0027 the DuchessThis did not prevent Meghan from telephoning Ms Lynch yesterday to thank her for her support. According to the MP, she was ‘pleased to have seen that letter’.There is one wild and unsubstantiated accusation in it which tops all the others. It is that ‘some of these stories’ — naturally, no examples are given — have ‘outdated, colonial undertones’.Is this a suggestion that there is an element of anti-Americanism in the supposed hounding of Meghan by the vicious media? After all, the country of her birth, the United States, was once a colony.It’s possible, I suppose, but I think the MPs are getting at something else. They are implying, without quite daring to say as much, that news-papers’ criticisms of the Duchess of Sussex are partly motivated by racism.Of all the smears in this ill-conceived epistle of nonsense, this is easily the most outrageous — and also potentially the most damaging. What could lower the Press more in public esteem than the insinuation that it has a secret racist agenda against Meghan?It’s rot. And dangerous, politically driven rot at that. I have read countless articles about the Duchess in the mainstream media, and I haven’t come across a single example of anything remotely resembling racism in the faintest sense.If the MPs can dig up one shred of evidence to support their disgraceful innuendo, they should produce it forthwith. But, of course, they can’t — because it doesn’t exist.What they would very probably do, if forced to defend their idiocy, is to say that while there are no instances of racism to be found in Press coverage, it nonetheless underlies all the criticisms that are made of Meghan.In other words, if newspapers grumble about the hundreds of thousands of pounds spent on Meghan’s six-day ‘baby shower’ trip to New York earlier in the year (flying there and back by private jet), that is a clear case of racism.When some in the media express surprise that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex should conceal the names of the godparents of Archie, who is seventh in line to the throne, that is another appalling manifestation of racism.         Both Meghan and Harry (above) have been critised for their actions - especially concealing Archie\u0027s god parents       And if columnists harrumphed after Harry delivered a lecture about the perils of global warming before he and Meghan took four journeys by private jet in 11 days, it was, of course, another expression of sublimated racism.Could anything be madder? Harry and Meghan are immensely privileged people in receipt of considerable public funds. For example, their home, Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, was refurbished at a cost of more than £2.4 million of taxpayers’ money.But it would appear that whatever inconsistencies the Duke and Duchess may display, the Press is enjoined to stay schtum for fear of being accused of the worst form of bigotry.Such is the debased level of public debate in modern Britain. We are not talking about louts name-calling on a street corner but Members of Parliament (four of them in the Shadow Cabinet) who might be expected to show discrimination, intelligence and discernment.Let me add that I wish Harry himself would supply chapter and verse when lashing newspapers. He recently accused them of running ‘knowingly false and malicious stories’ and other such excesses without offering a single example. But he hasn’t — at least, not yet — accused them of racism.So what we have here are insidious and baseless accusations circulated by a group of female MPs. I don’t doubt that there is at least a smidgen of sisterly affection for the Duchess.         Jeremy Corbyn (pictured above) is thought to want to bring newspapers under a measure state control But the deeper motivation behind the letter is, of course, political. As I say, most signatories are Labour. And it is Jeremy Corbyn’s intention to bring newspapers under a measure of state control.Although details have not yet been revealed, the Labour leader spoke four years ago of the need for a ‘multiplicity of ownership’ in the Press. That might imply confiscation.Last year he warned news-papers that ‘change is coming’. A Labour administration could set in train a second Leveson Inquiry into newspapers. He has questioned Press freedom by claiming titles are ‘controlled by billionaire tax exiles’.The motives of many of the signatories of Holly Lynch’s letter should be partly interpreted in this light. If the Press is to be curbed, it is necessary to demonstrate that it has overstepped the bounds of decency and ignored people’s privacy.But, as I’ve argued, the women MPs have shown no such thing. They have made charges without foundation — without, indeed, bothering to adduce any evidence at all. Their cunning purpose is to disseminate the idea that newspapers are not to be trusted, and so should be regulated.How a handful of female Tory MPs could have been caught up in such a devious plot is bewildering, though it seems that some were astute enough to smell a rat, and refused to sign.It is even more regrettable that Meghan should have thanked Holly Lynch for her support. She has done what no member of the Royal Family should ever do by entering the political arena — whether deliberately or inadvertently I can’t say — and given comfort to the enemies of a free Press.Prince Harry is taking legal action against two national newspapers, and Meghan is suing the Daily Mail’s sister paper, the Mail on Sunday. The rights and wrongs of these cases need not concern us here.What should concern us, though, is the possibility that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex might foolishly broaden their battle with the Press and line up with Labour MPs intent on undermining its freedoms."},{"url":null,"title":"Students unconditional offer university place likely drop out","story":"Share this article The analysis, of 18-year-olds in England at English institutions, showed across the 201516 and 201617 academic years combined, this rate equated to 185 students dropping out.But the OfS\u0027s Nicola Dandridge warned if trends continue it could be \u0027a couple of hundred students per year who have made a significant investment of time and money in a degree from which they are unlikely to benefit\u0027.In 2012 and 2013, less than 1 per cent of university applicants held at least one unconditional offer.

Kurdish SDF commander Mazloum Abdi said he had been in touch with the ISIS spy since at least April, when Baghdadi was first moved to the Idlib compoundWhile most people were blindfolded for the journey, he was allowed to look out of the window at least in the initial stages of the drive.At a certain point, Abdi said, the official was made to lower his chair and lay down, looking up at the car roof.But he was still able to distinguish whether he was driving through a village, forest or open ground, the SDF commander said.Once inside the compound itself he was allowed to look around freely, identifying several points of interest including a red water tank on the roof, which were then used to pinpoint the exact location.The meetings were regular but erratic, Abdi claimed, saying the official had to wait to be summoned by Baghdadi before being granted an audience.

Everyone is drunk and riding their horses. Get out of here – it’s too dangerous”’ Here, this horseman has broken away from the pack, but he wasn’t the frontrunner. The horses were racing on a track alongside a road. I don’t know exactly how many participants there were, but there were cars everywhere. Each family wants to drive next to their horse, everyone is beeping their horns, shouting. It is like a car race too, some slowing down, others speeding up, people overtaking on all sides. There’s some crazy driving, and so much dust in the air.I tried to take pictures before they started, but nobody really wanted to speak with me then and everyone was really nervous. When the race began, I took some shots from the ground, but then I jumped into a car and just hoped the photos would work out. I couldn’t really focus on what I was doing – you’re just trying not to have an accident. There were maybe 40 to 50 cars, and they were all quite beat up. You could tell they’d had accidents before.Afterwards, there was a huge party, right there, in the middle of the steppe. The horses were all beautifully dressed up and traditional Tuvan music was playing. The shaman had prayed the evening before for the spirits to be gentle. People come there to ask for healing.In Soviet times, Tuvan culture was suppressed. The shaman masks and  spirits – little puppets, sculptures, stuffed animals – were destroyed, and the people who continued to follow their ancient religions and traditions were persecuted. Now there’s this big revival, a newfound sense of pride.I grew up with Slavic fairytales about shamans and Baba Yaga. My mother is Russian and my grandfather was from Siberia. But I never really saw more of the country than Moscow, where I’d go to visit my grandmother in the summer. So last year I decided to go an exchange to Tomsk State University, in Siberia. I wanted to explore my roots.My plan was to travel the length of the Yenisei river. I couldn’t get to the actual source, which is further south in neighbouring Mongolia and only accessible by private helicopter. So I travelled to Tuva. You drive through what feels like endless Siberian woods and forested landscapes, you traverse one last mountain and suddenly you emerge on to the steppe. It feels like you’ve entered another world.People have gone there in search of freedom: adventurers, apostates, the Cossack riders pushing deeper and deeper into Siberia, criminals fleeing the Tsar. I met a man called Yuri who lived on a landfill. He told me if they chase him away, he’ll just find another landfill to live on. An ex-army officer I met, called Valentin, described himself as an anarchist ecologist. He sleeps outdoors, even when it’s -50C. This is one of the last remaining places where you can be removed from all western cultural influence, and live at one with nature.People in Tuva are tough. I’m attracted to people who are shaped by their environment, who choose to live or work in extreme situations. I think this kind of life fosters a certain kind of character. Not everyone chooses to live here, though. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Tuva has become a place of great isolation, spiritual, physical and social.One day I went to a village where mostly Tuvan people live. Two grandmothers came outside. Perhaps because of the way I was dressed, they thought I was American. “What the hell are you doing here?” they said. “It’s Friday today. Everyone just got paid. Everyone is drunk, on their horses. Get out of here, it’s too dangerous.” And right then, two very drunk guys rode up to us. Nothing happened. But the horse came to symbolise for me this dualism – the quest for freedom and the pervasive isolation.• Nanna Heitmann is the winner of 2019’s Leica Oskar Barnack newcomer award for her series Hiding From Baba Yaga.Training: Photojournalism and documentary photography, University of Hanover.Influences: “The Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow with its old Russian masters, the Magnum archive, Joel Sternfeld, Tarkovsky.”High point: “Every time I go out to photograph, to e into other people’s worlds.

The tower is one of the most significant examples of brutalism – an architectural style popular in the 1950s and 1960s, based on crude, block-like forms cast from concrete.Brutalism was popular throughout the eastern bloc but the former Yugoslavia made it its own – seizing on it as a way to forge a visual identity poised between east and west. Interest in the style is soaring – particularly since a 2018 exhibition in New York’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) called Concrete Utopia: Architecture in Yugoslavia, 1948-1980.“We have dozens of people every week interested in taking our Yugo tour around city landmarks built from the 1950s to 1980s,” says Vojin Muncin, manager of the Yugotour sightseeing agency which guides tourists around the Serbian capital in Yugos, the former Yugoslavia’s once ubiquitous car. “Genex Tower is among the most interesting sight. People see it on their way from the airport and it immediately draws their attention.” Today one of the pillars is empty, while the other is residential. The rotating restaurant was last open in the 1990s.After the second world war, socialist Yugoslavia led by Josip Broz Tito set out to reconstruct a land destroyed by fighting. Initially allied to the Soviet Union, Tito broke with Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in 1948. Residential blocks, hotels, civic centres and monuments all made of concrete shot up across the country. The architecture was supposed to show the power of a state between two worlds – western democracy and the communist east, looking to forge its own path and create a socialist utopia.But after Tito died in 1980, and economic crisis took hold, the new elites sought to distance themselves from the socialist regime, including its architecture. In 1991 the series of wars began that led to the collapse of Yugoslavia.“Now enough time has passed (since Yugoslavia fell apart) and people have begun to appreciate the architecture of Yugoslavia,” says Alan Braun, lecturer at Zagreb University’s architecture faculty. He explains that the style was unique because of its visible influence from the west, reflecting Yugoslavia’s unique position. Residential areas were planned to have enough parks, cinemas, swimming pools and even parking space.Keen to capitalise on the interest, Belgrade authorities are now considering opening parts of another masterpiece of Yugoslav brutalism – the Palata Srbija (Palace of Serbia) government building, which is currently only open once a year.The Palata Srbija building hosted former world leaders such as US presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford and Russian leaders Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev. Each of the former Yugoslav republics had its own salon with a central room called the hall of Yugoslavia.Furniture and carpets were custom made and prominent artists produced paintings and mosaics. The outside of the building is concrete, but the inside is marble. Its centrepiece is a crystal chandelier beneath a 19-metre dome weighing more than nine tonnes. “It is a shame to keep such a master piece away from the eyes of the public,” said Sandra Vesic Tesla, curator of the building.Other examples of Yugoslav brutalism include the huge memorials commemorating the struggle against fascism by Tito’s partisans, often placed in dramatic rural settings. Many of those pieces of art remain in disrepair, such as the monument to the uprising against fascism in Petrova Gora in Croatia.However, the Tjentiste memorial, commemorating the killing of 7,000 people by the Nazis was renovated last year. Miodrag Zivkovic, the 91-year-old sculptor of the 19-metre-high concrete Tjentiste memorial, was among the first artists in the former Yugoslavia to use concrete.“It is stable material, resembling stone but it is easier to work with,” he said. “For every project back in those days there was a national contest, and artists from all over the country had the opportunity to apply, and that competition produced quality.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07dbfba106485ebb38806be7eb156dca2eaf901a/0_92_3444_2066/master/3444.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25f44e8d43ecd8bc20734f19654ab340","title":"word of the week zombie","story":"Some MPs think Westminster is full of zombies. Well, at least the cocktail is quite niceThis week the prime minister succeeded in calling a general election, and members of what his own cabinet had been calling “the zombie parliament” prepared to shamble off to their constituencies. The origin of the word “zombie” is west African (“compare Kongo ‘nzambi’ god, ‘zumbi’ fetish,” advises the OED), and its use to mean a walking corpse is thought by some to be related to the experiences of west African slaves transported to work on plantations in Haiti.Yet zombies are not always bad. The American pianist Mary Lou Williams once recalled how she and her friends admiringly christened Thelonious Monk’s playing “zombie music”, because “the screwy chords reminded us of music from Frankenstein or any horror film”. And the cocktail known as a zombie (since the early 1940s) presumably induces in the drinker a pleasant state of thorough irresponsibility.Just as zombies in films cannot work complicated machinery, so the “zombie parliament” proved incapable of passing legislation. But given “zombie” has, since the 1930s, also meant a slow-witted idiot, there is no guarantee that the next lot won’t be equally deserving of the name.• Steven Poole’s A Word for Every Day of the Year is published by Quercus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e2c666cc5fa4a02f7e0758552ed809e09aa789f/0_283_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aed2b3e5dca00e442507239369f3af4e","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First up, an admirable post from steevieb, who has had a change of heart about Elizabeth Strout’s Olive Kitteridge:Some time ago (years) I began reading Olive Kitteridge. Just couldn’t get on with it though, got bored with the small town America bit. Last week I decided to give it another go, I am so glad I did, totally blew me away, beautifully written, I loved every page so much that I immediately bought Amy and Isabelle, which to me was even better. How I could have been bored by it (Olive K) the first time around is a puzzle. Moods, I guess.Tom Mooney has also been rereading some classics:Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea, not for the first time. It is wonderful, perfect even. I found some of it a little tougher to read this time, particularly the killing of the sharks (I had been reading a LOT of Cormac McCarthy around the time I read it before so was likely very desensitised!) but it stands up magnificently to repeated reading.I must be in the mood for old stuff as I also recently reread The Swimmer, John Cheever’s glorious masterpiece of a short story. It’s one of my all-time favourites and shows what a sharp writer he was.Night Waking by Sarah Moss has satisfied BobHammond2:Set on the fictional Scottish island of Colonsay, academic Anna is trying to juggle the challenges of motherhood, marriage, her academic career and a fair amount of sleep deprivation - and then a mystery around a baby’s skeleton buried outside her house on the island. Overlaid on top of this is a separate timeline where we see, throughout the book, a series of letters written by a midwife sent to the island back in the late 1800s to improve infant mortality. So, Moss has a lot to juggle but she does it brilliantly and the two separate stories and all the loose threads are brought together at the end of the book for a very satisfying conclusion.fuzzywuzz has enjoyed The Body by Bill Bryson:What a marvellous adventure I have been on, taking a tour of the various organ systems within a human being. Although I studied biochemistry and physiology in my student days, I have learned some interesting new things and revisited already known facts.What I particularly like about Bryson’s style here is that he has taken some complex subject areas such as immunology and transfusion science and distilled them into something which can be mentally digested by those without a scientific background and does so without patronising the reader.ID673795 has enjoyed Caravan of the Lost and Left Behind by Deirdre Shanahan:The story of a woman traveller and her son returning from chaotic lives in England to live on a traveller’s site in Ireland with her father, where she also hopes to find her daughter, left there as a baby. The landscape is beautifully described and the story very sad but in the end hopeful.BanjoGuru has just finished But Beautiful by Geoff Dyer “which I enjoyed a lot”:I was expecting straight biographies of some jazz greats, but it’s an altogether stranger beast - part imagined, part true, full of shifting perspectives and illusions and some really perceptive and evocative prose. I can recommend it if you like jazz, or even if you don’t.Now this is a funny and wise book. The quips and cultural insights are ridiculously true. Especially about the X and Y generations. Professor Chandra himself is a true delight … I found myself asking, “So who IS this smart guy who wrote this fine book?” That’s when you know it’s a good’un. This book is smart, hilarious, and best of all ... kindhearted. Yes, filled with an open hearted way of looking at the people we love and our struggles as well as struggles of our world and culture today.Finally, MarGar65 has just finished Penelope Fitzgerald’s Innocence:I loved it. I am so glad her books have come into my life! What an observant author ... What trust she places in us as she unfolds her stories. She refuses to bend to the expectation of a happy ending. I fear I am running out of To-Be-Read Fitzgeralds ... This is most alarming in a sense because I will run out of new Fitzgeralds, but I am relieved when I think that I can go always go back and reread them all.Going back to reread Fitzgerald sounds like an admirable idea. Just the kind of thing that should get us through winter…If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Hope school was OK. Are you buying that? Hope you have a lovely dinner.’ That can be an encouragement – the world is a safer place than they think. And actually that transmission of kindness shows maybe there is a possibility of communication, particularly for those who are shy or withdrawn. It’s really important that they expand their experiences to learn that while they might have had really difficult experiences, there could be other people who actually can be protective and supportive.”Talking to younger childrenGetting people, especially children, to open up, and share their feelings and thoughts can be trickier than we sometimes think. But Bush suggests that the best reason to reach children is to remember that they are people, albeit a little younger than us.“Remember, children and young people are people. The reason I say that is, we like to be spoken to in an empathetic and understanding way. Most of us prefer someone to talk to us at our own eye height.“Let’s say a six-year-old child is banging two toys together. Instead of jumping to a conclusion, try: ‘Oh, I see Superman really wants to hit Batman today, what are they fighting about?’ You never know where those kinds of questions – which start with the experience of the young person, in their world, using their metaphors – can lead to. The way into it is just by allowing the person to talk in the way they want to talk.”Listen, understand, empathiseMaking sure we’re really listening, and understanding what a person is saying to us, might sound simple, but it’s all too easy to trivialise without even realising it. “The other really important thing is not to be overly reassuring, and not to dismiss things,” says Bush.“For instance, a 21-year-old comes home and says: ‘I’m having a horrific time at work. I feel bullied, I’m failing, I feel I need to just walk away, I’m really stressed.’ Someone might reply: ‘Yeah, we all feel like that’. This kind of response is so demeaning, so dismissive. It doesn’t recognise their pain and distress.“Listen, acknowledge and be understanding. The sheer amount of people who just wanted to hear ‘Wow, that sounds really difficult. I can’t believe you’re been going through that’ as a first response … They didn’t need platitudes or complexity. They just wanted to be understood.”Connections mean resilience“There’s a lot of evidence that shows that social connectedness, a feeling of belonging – particularly connecting with people who have had similar or shared life interests or experiences – is actually very protective,” says Bush. “So young people who feel like they belong, who feel they have a sense of community, and feel able to talk to others in some way, are more resilient in the face of adversity, difficulty or mental health problems.”Britain Get TalkingTo find out more about ITV’s Britain Get Talking campaign, run in collaboration with mental health charities Mind, YoungMinds and SAMH, visit itvbritaingettalking or stv.tvbritaingettalking"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fbafae36b22949b43d68faf5f984ca1a6da76b9/0_28_2171_1303/master/2171.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1309152504cae9e4cc80ec75c3e42811","title":"last minute ppi claims wipe out lloyds bank profits","story":"Surge of mis-selling claims before August deadline slashes quarterly profit from £1.8bn to £50mLloyds Banking Group has put aside a further £1.8bn to cover a surge in payment protection insurance (PPI) complaints before the August claims deadline, which nearly wiped out its quarterly profit.Including the PPI charge, the bank’s profit before tax slumped to £50m for the three months to 30 September, from a profit of £1.8bn in the third quarter last year. The result was weaker than expected.The latest charge is at the top end of estimates, and takes the group’s total bill to £21.8bn. PPI has become the banking industry’s biggest mis-selling scandal and Lloyds accounts for the lion’s share of the total bill, which has risen to £48bn and is expected to top £50bn.The City regulator had set a 29 August deadline to make a claim for compensation for mis-sold PPI, which sparked a surge in complaints in the final weeks, prompting Lloyds to suspend a share buyback programme. PPI was sold alongside loans and mortgages to cover repayments if customers fell ill or lost their jobs, but the insurance was often sold to people who did not want or need it.António Horta-Osório, the chief executive, said: “I am disappointed that our statutory result was significantly impacted by the additional PPI charge in the third quarter, driven by an unprecedented level of PPI information requests received in August.”William Chalmers, the bank’s new chief financial officer, said the charge reflected its “best estimate of what PPI might come out as” but he could not rule out further provisions. “When George walked out the door he said: ‘Never say never’ on the issue,” he quipped about his predecessor, George Culmer.Lloyds also said its chairman, Lord Blackwell, would retire at or before next year’s annual meeting, after serving nine years on the board, including seven as chairman. The firm’s chief operating officer, Juan Colombás, will step down in July after four years in the job."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c8b8d0f774a4f1e3f3eea67c1d8dcba2d421bf8/0_371_5558_3334/master/5558.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=825537be9355c3171fbef421a9c1e947","title":"uks business rates system broken says treasury committee","story":"MPs tell government to urgently review tax it claims is high and unfair on physical stores The business rates system is broken and the government must undertake an urgent review to find alternatives, an influential committee of MPs has said.The Treasury committee said business rates in England and Wales were high, complex and placed an unfair burden on bricks-and-mortar shops and manufacturers compared with businesses that operate online.The cross-party group of MPs released their unanimous report as the economy teeters on the edge of recession, retailers and factory owners cut jobs and high street stores close.The MPs highlighted a complicated web of business rate reliefs and a system that punished investment. The committee also criticised a backlog of 16,000 appeals against business rate decisions and called for the government’s valuation office to be properly staffed.Business rates have risen faster than inflation since 1990 and grown as a share of taxes paid by companies, generating £31bn of income for the government last year, the MPs’ report found. The UK has the one of the highest property taxes as a share of output in the developed world, the report said.The committee called on the government to explain whether this was a deliberate policy and to consider the impact on economic growth. It said the chancellor should launch a review and report on alternatives in the spring.Alison McGovern, the MP who led the inquiry, said: “The current business rates system is broken. The tax represents an increasing burden on businesses, particularly those with a physical high street presence struggling to remain competitive.“The government must ensure that business rates align with its aim to boost productivity and do not disincentivise growth. The government must examine such alternatives in time for spring statement 2020.”Retailers and other industries have protested for many years about the burden imposed by business rates. In August more than 50 large retailers, including Marks \u0026amp Spencer and Harrods, wrote to the chancellor calling on him to cut business rates to support declining high streets.Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said: “Business rates are a significant driver of store closures and job losses, and retailers have been getting a raw deal for too long. We urge political parties to support local shops, local shopworkers and local communities by including these recommendations in their manifestos.”A Treasury spokesman said: “We concluded a fundamental review of business rates in 2016 and have since introduced reforms and reliefs saving businesses more than £13bn over the next five years. We will respond to the select committee’s report in due course.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/208a5fc1560c53db4a87f36a7d2b654b0f777ac6/0_0_4057_2435/master/4057.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc480b6f8c1cd68f850d6d825b983d06","title":"chinese factories shrink eurozone gdp germany italy pound business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, as Hong Kong’s economy tumbles into recessionThe protests in Hong Kong began against a bill that would have allowed Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to mainland China, or scores of other countries where there’s currently no extradition treaty.Critics of the bill, which was abandoned last month, feared it could allow any citizen to be arrested and swept out of the City state to face charges.But as protestors in this video explained, the demonstrations became about other issues too - including police brutality, and attempts to undermine the “one country, two systems” formula created when Britain handed Hong Kong over in 1997.Many of the protesters are young people, also angry about economic issues such as unaffordable property and income inequality.But some older people are on the streets too, trying to protect the younger generation. One, called Uncle Wong, told us his story here:Reuters is reporting that Hong Kong police have fired tear gas to try to break up anti-government protests in the densely populated district of Mong Kok on the Kowloon peninsula today.Demonstrations were expected on Hong Kong island to coincide with Halloween celebrations.Some protestors are wearing masks, to challenge an anti-mask ban brought in by the Hong Kong authorities earlier this month. AP has more details:Organizers are calling on supporters of the protest movement to take part in a “masquerade” that will put to the test a recent government ban on masks at public gatherings aimed at quelling the increasingly violent protests now in their fifth month. Digital fliers circulated online called on people to wear masks depicting Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and Chinese President Xi Jinping and other senior officials. They also said people could wear a mask and dress in red for the march, which was set to begin at a large park and proceed to the Lan Kwai Fong bar and nightclub district. Just in: the protests in Hong Kong have helped to force make-up and fragrance firm Estee Lauder to cut its profit forecasts.Estee Lauder has told shareholders that net sales in Hong Kong fell in the last quarter. It blamed “events impacting key shopping areas” in recent months namely, the widespread protests that forced shop closures and kept tourists away.Estee Lauder also warns that it faces various social, economic and political risks, including “cContinued challenges in Hong Kong impacting key shopping areas”.It also cites Brexit, and the US-China trade wars, in a list of various “geopolitical tensions, regulatory matters, global security issues, currency volatility and economic challenges” that could hit consumer spending. The company now expects 2020 adjusted profit between $5.85 and $5.93 per share compared with its prior range of $5.90 to $5.98.Associated Press have written about the impact of Hong Kong’s recession on the tourism industry:Kong’s main tourist strip, Ashfaqur Rahman’s tailor shop usually is a mainstay for tourists dropping in to peruse neatly stacked rolls of fabric and get measured for custom-made suits. Business has dried up since anti-government protests began in early June in the Asian financial center.The once-common lines of Chinese shoppers outside Hong Kong’s glittering luxury stores are gone. Jewelry stores have no customers and related businesses like transportation are languishing. His shop is tucked away in a passage off Nathan Road in the Tsim Sha Tsui district, which teems with posh hotels and upscale jewelry and fashion boutiques, set against the stunning backdrop of Victoria Harbor.But on recent weekends the neighborhood has become a protest battle zone, with black-clad demonstrators clashing late into the night with riot police unleashing tear gas and water cannons.“This is the worst we’ve seen,” said Rahman, a Bangladeshi immigrant who opened the shop 14 years ago. His sales now barely cover the rent and he and his business partner are dipping into their own pockets to pay the salaries of their five staff. He’s not sure they’ll be able to carry on if there’s no resolution to the increasingly violent protests.Tommy Wu, a Hong Kong-based economist with Oxford Economics, says:“Much of the pressure is now coming from the political unrest.The trade war itself would cause Hong Kong’s GDP growth to slow but not a contraction, while the political unrest could.”Hong Kong’s economy looks to be in even worse shape than feared, says CNN.It blames months of protests that forced shops to close, paralyzed public transportation and scared off tourists, saying:With no immediate resolution to the city’s political crisis on the cards, Hong Kong’s first recession in a decade could extend into the new year.....As a major trading hub, Hong Kong was already hurting from the US-China trade war and China’s slowing growth. Five months of mass demonstrations is now pushing the city toward an economic crisis.That may be a sign that Britain’s economy returned to growth in the last quarter (we’ll find out next month, when UK GDP is released).Capital Economics has predicted that Hong Kong’s economy will continue to shrink in the current quarter, but probably at a slower rate.“Any recovery will be constrained by weak business investment, however, as the city’s political crisis has done lasting damage to its reputation as a stable and autonomous financial hub.In another blow to Hong Kong - and the rest of the global economy - China apparently doesn’t believe it can agree a trade deal with Donald Trump.Bloomberg has the story:Chinese officials are casting doubts about reaching a comprehensive long-term trade deal with the U.S. even as the two sides get close to signing a “phase one” agreement, Bloomberg News reported.In private conversations with visitors to Beijing and other interlocutors in recent weeks, Chinese officials have warned they won’t budge on the thorniest issues, according to people familiar with the matter. They remain concerned about President Donald Trump’s impulsive nature and the risk he may back out of even the limited deal both sides say they want to sign in the coming weeks.This has worried investors, sending stocks down across the globe. A protracted trade war is bad news for growth, at a time when most advanced economies are slowing.Hong Kong’s economy has also been hurt by the ongoing trade war between the US and China.Here’s the AFP newswire’s take:Hong Kong on Thursday confirmed it had plunged into its first recession since the global financial crisis as months of seething pro-democracy protests and the US-China trade war exact a heavy toll on the financial hub.The semi-autonomous Chinese city has been upended by nearly five months of huge, often violent, pro-democracy demonstrations with little end in sight as Beijing and city leaders adopt a hardline approach. Clashes between protesters hurling bricks and petrol bombs at police wielding tear gas and rubber bullets have become a weekly occurrence, hammering the city’s once-solid reputation for stability and safety. The unrest has hit the city’s tourist and entertainment industries hard, compounding economic woes that were already being caused by the global trade war. That means the city is experiencing a technical recession, with two back-to-back periods of contraction. It is the first time the city has witnessed a recession since early 2009 at the height of the financial crisis. Hong Kong’s economy was already facing strong headwinds at the start of 2019 as it was hit by the US-China trade war, battering a city that is hugely reliant on the world’s two largest economies. The Financial Times points out that several economists predict the recession could intensify in the next few quarters:Iris Pang, an economist at ING, an investment bank, forecast that the economy would shrink in all four quarters next year.

But one priority has always been clear: it is vital to protect consumers who are exposed to high-cost credit providers.Quite right, too. And there is a fair argument that the FCA, which was given responsibility for this area in 2014, has scored successes. On the regulator’s website, you will find a long list of interventions. Price caps were imposed on payday lenders in 2015 in attempt to quell the outrage caused the gouging tactics of the likes of Wonga. Overdrafts, credit cards and automotive loans have also been scrutinised.Not everybody is convinced the measures have gone far enough, but give the FCA some due. The regulator reckons its rules save consumers, many of them classed as “vulnerable”, £1.7bn a year and it calculates that firms have paid £900m in redress.So how could a former director of the owner of QuickQuid, the payday lender that went into administration last week, be deemed a suitable appointment to the FCA’s regulatory decisions committee (RDC)?This is an important body that is described as “the final stage of decision-making within the FCA”. In extreme cases, it can close down firms. Yet Nick Lord, as the  reported on Wednesday, was appointed in 2017 when he was still a non-executive director of QuickQuid’s parent, CashEuroNet.Rules around conflicts of interest will have prevented Lord from opining on any matter related to QuickQuid. And, yes, it is important that the RDC includes not only consumer champions but also iniduals with experience in financial services.Even so, hiring a director of a payday lender – in this case, a company that has now folded with thousands of claims for mis-sold loans unresolved – is a strange way to promote your consumer protection credentials.Lord has other entries on his CV that might have been attractive to the FCA, including former membership of the Financial Services Consumer Panel. But his QuickQuid gig ought to have been a turnoff, which may be why it is not mentioned on his biography on the FCA’s website. Common sense in this instance seems to have been lost in one of Bailey’s fjords.At the start of last year, before Sutherland threw a silly tantrum when De La Rue lost the contract to print British passports, the shares stood at over 600p. Since that episode, shareholders have suffered a separate profits warning and news of a Serious Fraud Office inquiry tied to suspected corruption in South Sudan. Meanwhile, the Venezuelan central bank has stopped paying its bills to De Le Rue. And the rise of cashless societies is bad news for all banknote printers.In theory, the group’s authentication ision, offering “identity solutions” and security features, offers a path to salvation. That, at least, was Sutherland’s big plan. We wait to see if the new boss, Clive Vacher, agrees when he unveils his thinking next month. It is alarming for investors that it has taken him only three weeks in post to determine that the profits outlook was wonky. The idend looks the next casualty.De La Rue, almost incredibly for a company that prints a third of the world’s banknotes, is now worth just £160m. In normal circumstances, you would say it is a takeover candidate but an open investigation by the SFO may deter decent offers. If shareholders want another reason to be miserable, here’s one: Sutherland somehow got a £197,000 bonus last year.Dennis Muilenburg, the chief executive of Boeing, should count himself lucky. He has been verbally mauled by a Senate committee this week for “hiding” information about the anti-stall system that has been implicated in two 737 Max crashes that killed 346 people, but he is still in his job.Would the boss of a foreign company operating out of the US be in post in similar circumstances? One doubts it. Tony Hayward did not last long at BP after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, which killed 11 people. Some of Muilenburg’s comments in recent weeks have been as crass as any of Hayward’s back then.

The response has been overwhelming, with thousands of you across more than 100 countries making the choice to support us with a contribution.Many of you have told us how much you value our commitment: to be truthful, resolute and undeterred in pursuing this important journalism. We made this pledge because we recognise the climate emergency as the defining issue of our lifetimes.As  editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, wrote, “We have always led the way in environmental reporting … but now, more than ever, we believe the ’s specialist team of reporters, editors and writers has a vital role to play in working with our readers to understand the unfolding climate crisis and all its ramifications.”Reader support means we are all becoming part of a global community with a shared set of values and a vision for a more hopeful world. It also means we can give reporting on the environment the urgent attention and prominence it demands. We can report on the climate crisis with consistent rigour and ground our journalism in scientific fact, never driven by political or commercial interests. Our independence makes this journalism possible and support from our readers helps protect that independence.In our pledge, we acknowledge that the planet is in the grip of an emergency. We have made a commitment to continue our long-standing record of powerful environment reporting, which is known around the world.By this, we mean undertaking investigations into the economic and political structures that underpin the carbon economy, such as our recent series, The Polluters, and examining the role the climate crisis plays in many other critical issues – including inequality, migration and the battle over scarce resources.Alongside our journalistic commitments, we also looked at important steps we could take as an organisation. We committed to the  achieving net zero emissions by 2030.Some of our senior environment correspondents have shared with us the mix of hope and despair they experience in the course of their roles. But despite the challenges, they are united in a shared sense of urgency, and the need for change.Reflecting on covering the climate crisis, Jonathan Watts, the ’s global environment editor, wrote this week:“I report from the Amazon to the Arctic on the disappearing wonders of a rapidly deteriorating world. Along with a growing number of colleagues, I investigate who is affected, who is to blame and who is fighting back. This is both depressing and exciting. The trends for the climate, the oceans, the forests and the soil are unrelentingly frightening. Humanity has never faced a more wicked problem than the collapse of these natural life support systems. Nobody is free of responsibility. Everybody has something to lose, especially those with the most power. The challenge is huge, urgent and beset with opponents. But change is happening nonetheless.”Thank you to our readers and supporters for joining us in facing this challenge. Your responses are galvanising, making us even surer of our approach.

Pearl-studded Nicholas Kirkwood shoes (£200) and round, oxblood Mulberry bags (£465) are displayed in an uncluttered, brightly lit space that also features a rack beneath a backlit sign inviting customers to deposit items to sell.Among a handful of expensive, rare pieces – such as a red-velvet Gucci suit designed during Tom Ford’s time as creative director, on sale for an eye-watering £4,275 – there are high-end items available at Zara-level prices, including a pair of Acne jeans for £45.“The customer mindset has changed,” said Fanny Moizant, the co-founder and president of Vestiaire Collective. “In the car industry, it is perfectly normal for customers to ask themselves – do I buy new or secondhand?

Resale makes luxury fashion accessible to the middle classes.“Our affordable luxury brands such as Maje and Sandro are at fast-fashion prices when they are resold secondhand.”Selfridges is one of several traditional luxury brands that has moved beyond viewing resale as a threat. Ralph Lauren, for example, has launched “ReSourced”, a collection of vintage products sourced by sellers on the resale app Depop.

I still remember a suitably childlike awe at the size of the room and my glee when the film began with a glittering dance sequence. The occasion was my older brother’s seventh birthday and naturally he had chosen the film. Like any self-respecting seven-year-old in the mid-1980s, he wanted to see Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. So my first big-screen movie was a supposedly family-friendly film that features ritual sacrifice and pits of fire as well as a banquet of baby snakes, monkey brains and eyeball soup – not to mention the scene in which a man’s heart is ripped, still beating, from his chest.Overimaginative at the best of times, my tiny brain was overwhelmed by each new horror, and I was terrorstruck by the thought of what gore might spurt next. I even squirmed 180 degrees in my seat, only to see the adult next to me averting his eyes too. Subsequently, Temple of Doom was heavily criticized for its dark and offensive imagery, but it was too late for five-year-old me. To this day, I feel a frisson of nervousness as the lights go down in the cinema – the fear that the chorus line will be pushed off the screen by a parade of bloody monstrosities. And yet, I keep going back … PHI wasn’t allowed to see horror movies when I was a little kid, certainly not allowed to stay up late and watch scary films on television, and this was in that ancient pre-internet and pre-VCR era when it was physically impossible to get your hands on them covertly. So I was shocked – really shocked – by the public information films on safety which reached out of the TV screen around teatime and punched you in the face, about the same time of day as Jackanory or Hector’s House. This one is a classic, Lonely Water from 1973, sometimes called Dark And Lonely Water (although no title appears). It was commissioned by the government’s Central Office of Information (COI) in response to an increase in child drowning accidents: written and produced by the COI official Christine Harmon and directed by Jeff Grant, who blogged about his experience.Lonely Water is brutally addressed to children, not to the adults who are supposed to be taking care of them. A dark, hooded figure appears to be walking on the dangerous stretches of water, looming up behind the kids, with Donald Pleasence doing the creepy narration. Like so many chillingly contemptuous teachers that I remember from those days, this Angel Of Death sneers knowingly at the “showoffs” who mess about near water and fall in and drown, and also at the simply “unwary” who don’t know what they’re doing. The dark cloaked figure appears disturbingly behind them, as if walking on the misty water itself. Lonely Water is often compared to the beginning of Nicolas Roeg’s Don’t Look Now (and it is eerily similar) and Pleasence might bring to mind John Carpenter’s Halloween from 1978, in which he starred. But for me the film-maker who most comes to mind is Peter Watkins, who made the chilling The War Game and Punishment Park: film-making with a clinically icy establishment voice whose clear, cruel purpose is to disturb. PBScary movies and I have never gotten along. Life is frightful enough.I’m pretty sure I was dragged to see Freddy vs Jason as a kid because my parents did not want to sit through whatever else was out at that time, like Freaky Friday or Uptown Girls. I was eight years old and officially tall enough to ride the cool rollercoasters – I wanted to prove that I was mature enough to withstand blood and gore. But I still didn’t understand that everything on TV and film was fake. Because how can you fake getting your head chopped off? So imagine my horror when I saw Kelly Rowland of Destiny’s Child, my favorite girl group ever, on the big screen. There she was, pissing off Freddy Kruger by calling him a faggot (Rowland’s release of gay circuit party staples like Commander make up for this uncomfortable moment, in my opinion). And then, BAM! Rowland gets smacked with Jason Voorhees’s machete out of nowhere.I could not fall asleep that night. Kelly Rowland was dead! Destiny’s Child would never make music again. And my mom was no help with my eight-year-old anxieties. She just brushed off my pop music concerns with: “It’s not real. Go back to bed.” A few months later, I saw Rowland on TV in a live appearance. She was healthy. Her head was still intact. And there were no traces of blood. The world could go on. Every member of Destiny’s Child was still alive. AWI was eight when I first saw Nicolas Roeg’s sadistic adaptation of Roald Dahl’s The Witches, a horror film for children made with a cruel, adult sensibility. I was at a friend’s house, too embarrassed to admit that I was terrified and too terrified to stop watching, and by the time it was over, I was left with a horrifying new outlook on life. Many of the films that rank among the scariest for children subvert a traditionally harmless character into something monstrous (it’s why Pennywise and Chucky had such a profound effect on so many) and at an age when I still defined women in soft, simplistic terms, I was suddenly made aware that not all of them wanted to coo over me – some of them might want to kill me instead.It wasn’t the grandiose unmasking of the witches that stuck, as gruesome as it was, but instead I was haunted by the smaller moments, the scenes when they were still in full disguise, insidiously targeting vulnerable children, overcome with pure hate. There was the witch who trapped a girl in a painting, the witch who tried to lure a boy down from his treehouse with chocolate and a snake, the witch who pushed a pram toward the edge of a cliff – insidious scenes designed to provoke nightmares and that they did. I remember not sleeping well for months, horrified that they were hiding in my suburban setting, disgusted by my existence, waiting patiently to eradicate me.I was eager to grow up for a number of reasons – my own money, an escape from my bleak small town, the ability to devour a second and third portion of dessert without restriction – but the most overwhelming of all was the knowledge that once I turned 18, I’d be safe from the witches. BLThe first time I saw The Ring I was about 12, and the viewing was basically forced on me during a classroom movie day. Looking back on it now, it’s a pretty quiet, atmospheric film for most of its runtime, but for the entire duration I was scared out of my wits, watching it behind my fingers. What Gore Verbinski does so well in The Ring is imbuing the most mundane objects with menace. I couldn’t look at TVs, chairs, ladders and mirrors for a while without feeling spooked, all because they featured in Samara’s video. It’s weirdly the chair that haunted me for years after: the image of it spinning upside down returns to me occasionally, and the eerie wrongness of it still unsettles me.It’s also a movie that taught me early on about futility, and that kindness is not always repaid: despite finding Samara and giving her a proper burial, Rachel’s man still dies, and her son would have too if she hadn’t made a copy of the tape in order to infect the next person. It’s ultimately a sad film about a very harsh, dog-eat-dog world, and that really bothered me as a kid. GSAs a sensitive, if not to say delicate, child, I always steered well clear of scary films – still do. But there was a time in my mid-teens – the early 1980s – when I felt I should investigate this horror movie thing, and (before the video-nasty scare really took hold) they were often on late-night TV. I managed to get through The Amityville Horror, Alien and Halloween without incident, but the one that really shook me up was an Australian film that I never heard of again until it was remade to little fanfare in 2013.Kicking off with a gruesome scene where the murderous title character chucks an electric fire into a bath containing his mother and her lover, Patrick is a classic spin on the old kill-everyone-with-telekinesis-you-are-sexually-threatened-by trope, popularised by Carrie a couple of years earlier. The main twist here is that, shortly after the electric fire incident, the glassy-eyed teen of the title slips into a coma, and does all his nastiness while lying in a hospital bed. I think it was the fact that he was unconscious the entire time (as well as the very creepy touch of communicating via a possessed typewriter) that really freaked me out. And there’s an amazing final flip-out: I won’t give it away exactly what it is but it’s far worse and shocking than any Hitcher-type unkillable killers. I’m getting worried again just thinking about it. APGiven that people the world over cower in fear of them, it’s strange that arachnids haven’t been more of a major player in Hollywood horror over the years. Sure, there was the giant spider in Harry Potter, and the final hideous transformation of Pennywise in It, but they were minor elements rather than the main event. Instead, for the most part they have have been restricted to sub-Sharknado B-movies with titles like Lavalantula.The one respectable exception was Arachnophobia, a genuinely terrifying effort that sadistic TV schedulers would regularly drop in before the watershed when I was a child. The genius of Frank Marshall’s 1990 film was that, rather than making the spiders giant, he made a virtue of their smallness: the gist was that a deadly South American spider mated with a common house spider, producing hundreds of lethal offspring that lay waste to a small American town. Here, the deadly killer could appear at any moment, lurking up a coat sleeve, or lying in wait in a dusty corner. In the end Jeff Daniels’ heroic physician does the decent thing and kills the spider queen with fire, but I never enjoyed this cathartic conflagration, having long since legged it from the living room. GMEncountering genuinely frightening material in a Disney Channel original movie feels as unexpected and scandalizing as discovering a razor blade in a candy apple – these things are supposed to be for children! I watched this kiddie horror flick (the last that the Disney Channel ever produced, due to an influx of aggrieved letters from parents tending to their hysterical offspring) through the wide, terrified eyes of a boy in 19-never-you-mind, having come in prepared for a spooky good time about a girl and her imaginary friend battling the Boogeyman. What I got instead was a demented funhouse fantasia of fear, real fear, the kind of immediate visually – sourced fear completely alien to a child theretofore frightened only by the figments of his own imagination.There are lots of psychologically unsettling elements to the script: the notion of a loved one transforming into something monstrous and turning on you, the transition from being a dependent toddler to a semi-autonomous grade-schooler, the locus of danger being the safe confines of your bedroom. But as a youngster, I was hit hardest by the old-fashioned stuff. The Boogeyman character’s design – long nails, rangy hair, sharp teeth – and the Twin Peaks-style eeriness of his slow, creeping approach laid me right out. If one day I do become a father, my only priority will be protecting my progeny from this film. CBI have no idea how old I was when I caught 20-odd minutes of the 1972 portmanteau horror Asylum on telly. I had no idea that’s what I had seen until I did some Googling for this feature and figured out this was the origin of those images seared on to my brain. The inidual limbs wrapped in brown paper heaving their way up the cellar stairs. The severed head, similarly packaged, rolling slowly into the kitchen.These body parts, it turns out from rewatch, belong to Ruth (Sylvia Sims), who has been chopped up by her cheating husband, Walter (Richard Todd) so he can pop off with foxy Bonnie (Barbara Parkins). But Ruth has been taking African voodoo classes, so her bits and bobs don’t stay shut in the newfangled deep freeze Walter has bought specially – instead they conspire to strangle him to death and so mess up his mistress that she’s wheeled off to the institute.I expected the scenes to look a bit clunky to my 40-year-old eyes – a touch hokey, perhaps, the scares maybe over-signposted. Actually, the whole thing was atrocious: completely without chills, poorly played and appallingly paced. All you can think about is what an incredibly meticulous job Walter has done with his brown paper and string (no seepage at all!) and what a smashing utility room they have in their basement. CSOne day when I was about five, I found my dad watching ET. I don’t remember meeting Drew Barrymore all I can recall now is the scene in which one kid searches for ET in the woods and finds him, splayed and freezing and nearly dead from homesickness, in a creek bed. Something about that image has haunted me since – maybe it was the inhumanness of his half-dead pale body, or the idea that an alien could be found clinging to life in the creek behind my house, or even worse, that I, too, could become so detached from my home that I would die.Whatever the case – and I am sure there are many valid reasons why ET is considered a classic – I stopped watching, and have never seen it since. Sometimes I wonder if that’s the root of my aversion to Halloween-themed or scary movies – my first impression seemed less thrilling than sad. Regardless, I finally rewatched the scene on YouTube, and I’m relieved that my brain didn’t make it all up I’m not relieved to learn that ET is also pestered by a raccoon while catatonic in the woods, which makes the prospect of death in the creek seem more grounded in reality than I remember.

It’s both.Some people don’t get hungrier when the seasons change and think it’s one of those things that happens to women, and bears. Those people are the outliers they just don’t know it. A drop in ambient temperature increases energy expenditure in both sexes (also in bears). It shouldn’t matter enormously on a basic calories-in-calories-out model, because we’re talking just 150 calories a day. You use extra energy, you eat a banana this is the smallest inconvenience the change in seasons has to offer, less annoying than having to find your cagoule. However, the human body being somewhat more complicated than a basic book-keeping system, all your appetite hears is the activation. It’s like the Hulk. It doesn’t want to do just one job. It’s a force of nature, not a supplier of goods and services. It wants to burst out of its clothes and keep on going until you, too, have burst out of your clothes.There’s also a serotonin angle, as the sunlight recedes and your hormonal pathways try to source joy from other places, at which point a banana won’t cut it. And then, of course, there’s a feedback loop. You start by craving refined carbohydrates for a reason, but then you want more cake because you just had cake, as with heroin.There’s a strong argument that says: who cares? Be your winter weight. And, sod it, while you’re there, why not eat one more potato than a pig? But let’s say you’re one of those people who hates being at the mercy of uncontrollable forces under the skin. There are things to eat in winter that don’t come from Greggs.The point isn’t that you should eat hot food because it increases your body temperature from the inside. It doesn’t create a little pocket of heat in your stomach that emanates to your extremities for the rest of the day – it’s food, not uranium the Ready Brek ad was basically mis-selling. But complex carbohydrates take more energy to digest, so will be both satiating and warming, which leads inexorably to the stew or hearty soup.I start with pearl barley. I’m always bored with it by Christmas and by June I’ve forgotten how to cook it (it’s easy, like rice, only takes four times as long), but in the first cold snap it is powerfully cheering and fills your kitchen with a delicious, heady smell, as if you were living in a 16th-century brewery and will be ready for a massive knees-up in six months’ time. Delia Smith’s One Is Fun – perhaps the most controversial work in her canon, having caused lifelong rifts since the 1980s as friends presented it to each other as a passive-aggressive gift item (“You’re going to be alone for ever, at least eat nice soup”) – has a pearl barley soup of such substance, such rough but pleasing texture (squishy no, wait, chewy no, wait, slightly sticky ah, hang on, also crunchy) and such an ancient vibe – you can taste the centuries of embedded knowledge, one generation passing carrot-wisdom on to the next, back into the mists of time – that while you’re on the first bowl, you feel as though you could eat it every day, for every meal, for ever. This will, unfortunately, turn out not to be true.I don’t want to bang on about meat, painfully aware of how often I’ve claimed to be nearly vegan and then had a salt-beef sandwich. But the classic stew is barley with lamb, and William Drabble’s recipe is as close to perfect as it gets.This will all take a lot longer than pasta and someone is sure to bang on about their slow cooker, and how it revolutionised their lives, because suddenly they were chopping onions at 7.25 in the morning and coming home to a delicious meal of very intense onions. I find this a slightly saddening life fix because part of the pleasure of making a stew is feeling that it was your skill – browning it, poking it, going back to have a look at it – that brought it to that point of excellence.

But one coach looks like he will still be standing after a dramatic finaleMaybe the best way to grasp what happened on Wednesday night and what it meant is to pause it and watch it back again frame by frame, a thousand things in a single shot, a thousand more in the next. Look at Celta de Vigo: you can actually pinpoint the second where their hearts rip in half. It’s the same second when life floods back into Betis. The clock shows 89.47 and the ball drops to Nabil Fekir, near the penalty spot. Stop it there: everyone’s looking at him, close. Only Iago Aspas isn’t in the area. Of those that are, only Stanislav Lobotka isn’t on him. Just to his right is Sergio Bermejo. The rest stand before him and salvation: Hugo Mallo, Néstor Araujo, Joseph Aidoo, David Juncà, Gabriel Fernández, Fran Beltrán, Brais Mendez and Rubén Blanco. In front of him, a line of five men. Behind them, two more. And behind them, another.Press play and somehow Fekir’s shot finds a way through them all and into the net.Pause it again. Aspas, in shot now, pulls his shirt to his face. Juncà slips to his knees, arms out. Blanco turns to the sky. Lobotka is bent over, staring at the ground, beaten. They all are. Now let it run. Let Fekir run, faster than he thought possible in those final desperate, exhausting minutes. Teammates chase. Turn the volume up, the noise. Pointing, Fekir sprints towards the touchline. He slides to his knees and into the wide, welcoming arms of the Betis manager Joan Francesc Ferrer ‘Rubí’ and four of his staff, led by the goalkeeper coach Diego Tuero. Emerson bundles in, E Royal on his shirt, and then Joaquín. The physio is there, in blue rubber gloves. Rubí’s face looks like it might crack open, holding Fekir. In a green tracksuit behind, the assistant Jaume Torras looks like he’s seen something. Maybe it’s Fran Escribá, the Celta coach, a little further down the line.It’s all there in an extraordinary photo, which is soon shared on the Betis coaching staff’s mobile group: a portrait of what football is and what they had been through together, a picture of suffering but also hope. Relief, maybe revival. Something to hold on to the way they hold on to each other. A similar shot is being prepared for the cover of Estadio Deportivo and every one of the sports dailies do the same, the pictures in Marca, AS, Mundo Deportivo and Sport all variations on the same theme. “This one is for you,” the headline on the front of Estadio Deportivo says. For Rubí.Betis v Celta was supposed to be the end, one way or other. Escribá and Rubí were under pressure, on the verge of the sack 11 weeks into the season, parallel lives that finally met. When the managers spoke about each other in the build-up, they were speaking about themselves, too. “These are two squads who aren’t where they could be. I’m convinced that both will end up more or less where they should be,” Rubí said. “In terms of potential, strength, both Betis and us are going to get out of it,” Escribá agreed. But as Diario de Sevilla put it: “Winning is the only way out” – and for the managers, especially.The pressure built, as much in the boardrooms as on the benches, which only ever makes it worse down on the touchline. Both clubs had already started to sound out replacements, and while nothing was done or decided, while there had been no real time to change things, both had gone back to what they knew: Celta had spoken to their former coach Eduardo Berizzo, Betis were even contemplating a return for Quique Setién – a baffling idea, given how bitter the end had been. This was an ultimatum, or so it goes. That is how it was set up, certainly. El Faro de Vigo summed it up: “Mission: save Escribá.”Only one man would be left standing, they said, but as the final minutes slipped away, you wondered if both would live to die another day. Or maybe that would be it for the pair of them. Betis scored first but Celta equalised. Celta were the better team too, dominant, yet Joel Robles stood before them. Time ticked away, heading towards a 1-1 draw that was damning but might delay the inevitable. Celta sought victory more Betis, in the words of the commentator were a flan – wobbly, soft, “hanging on any way they can”. Rubí waved them forward but without much conviction. Then into the 90th minute, Aidoo – you don’t – made an unnecessary tackle on Diego Laínez, deep in the corner, and was punished. They all were, especially Escribá.The free-kick was taken, the ball crossed in and headed away but poorly, straight to Fekir – ready to deliver Rubí’s salvation and Escribá’s sentence. Left footed, he finished it, through that burgundy barrier. “The miracle of the Villamarín,” Marca called it. “Rubí’s Betis were sunk at the bottom of the swimming pool, chained to a chair and showing signs of drowning, their attempts to break free in vain,” Estadio Deportivo said, “but that was when, in a Hollywood ending, the French Houdini appeared. We’d hardly seen Fekir in the second half: he must have been preparing his new trick.” From somewhere, Fekir found enough energy to race to the touchline, everyone piling on, a picture that sums up sport. When finally the bodies broke, he kneeled, kissed the floor and prayed. Then he stood up, nodded and raised his thumbs. The verdict was in.There was no time for more. At the whistle, Rubí shook Escribá’s hand, a little apologetically. Aidoo stood, a lost look on his face. Hugo Mallo crouched, just staring into space. On the touchline, the reporter was waiting. “What a blow, right?” he asked when Mallo finally reached him. There was a prolonged, uncomfortably telling silence, Mallo’s eyes and mind somewhere else. “Yes, a big blow,” he mumbled eventually. Another question, another lost response. “I can’t find an explanation,” he said. “Football is cruel. It’s a pity.”Betis’s fans were not fooled – there were whistles still, and chants for the board to resign – but their team had escaped and so had their manager. In celebration, they had expressed something at least, signs of life and community. “We embraced like that because we’re all together, players and coaching staff,” Emerson said. Feddal insisted: “We’re with the manager and the manager is with us. We’re doing good work, even if things aren’t coming off as we would like.” Now perhaps that work can continue, or perhaps not? Asked if this was a “match ball” saved, Rubí said he didn’t know it wasn’t a question for him.He should at least make it to the Bernabéu on Saturday, maybe beyond. There is some willingness to believe in a coach who has done impressive things in his career, who might yet make this work, however bad it looks now, if only he can hold on. And this goal means there is a chance. Marca said Rubí had been “given an extra life, like in a video game”. “Fekir is Rubí’s lifesaver,” El País said.And it is his life, too. Rubí admits that football has cost him a lot, including his marriage. “You have a passion that can break families,” he has said. When he was at Benidorm, he left his three kids behind and didn’t get paid. After that, he went two years without coaching, unable to find a job, but then Girona turned up just when he had been ready to give it all up and go to work in the family travel agency. He had even bought himself a suit and tie but at the last minute, he was rescued. He didn’t need the suit then and he doesn’t need it now either. Not yet.• Once upon a time, Atlético 1-0 up meant game over. Not any more. And not when Lucas Pérez is around. Álvaro Morata opened the scoring and might have got a second, only to be denied by the first of two one-on-one saves from Fernando Pachecho, the goalkeeper who really should get talked about more. But Lucas scored an absolutely belting goal, turning away from one man, escaping another and bending a rocket of a shot into the far corner to secure a draw at Mendizorroza. That’s his fifth in as many games, the first Alavés player to do that since the magnificently named Wilson Alfredo Jones Rodríguez in 1953. As for Simeone he says he sees things “ever more clearly”. And what he sees doesn’t look good.• Two assists, two goals, both stupidly good and yet so very seen before, and two nutmegs – one of them with a pass. That Lionel Messi can play a bit, eh?• “I don’t think so,” Zidane said when he was asked if Real Madrid’s 5-0 win over Leganés was Madrid’s best game of the season, but it’s hard to think of a better one. In truth, it’s hard to think of many good ones. This one was, though: 22 shots, five goals by five different players, including Rodrygo and Jovic, and a very comfortable night. • Eh? That’s not supposed to happen, but it did. Levante beat Real Sociedad at Anoeta, the win set up by a superb dinked finish from Bardhi."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a86d83831e6d9824e263821e38a08b68dd141711/0_78_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b080038087226f9ebd843c8bbfb4cf70","title":"luigis mansion 3 nintendo switch review professor e gadd gooigi mario","story":"Nintendo SwitchProfessor E Gadd and new clone Gooigi are among the inventive innovations aiding Mario’s timid twin. A breath of life for the hunt-and-chase formatLuigi never seems to learn his lesson. It’s been 18 years since he was first lured to a haunted house and tortured by its spooky inhabitants. Now, having been duped again, he’s trapped in an even bleaker building – the Hotel of Last Resort – as he races to rescue a familiar cast of Mushroom Kingdom characters.Although it treads very familiar ground to its predecessors, there’s a lot to love in the third instalment of the adventure series that lets Mario’s timid twin take charge. You still guide the character through uniquely themed sections of the building, relying on his flashlight and multi-functional Poltergust vacuum to rid the place of ghosts.Luigi keeps track of his progress through the 15 main hotel floors with the help of a digital assistant, amusingly called a Virtual Boo, as well as the quirky Professor E Gadd, who’s on hand to offer tips and tutorials.The game was never likely to stray too far from its roots as a hunt-and-chase adventure, but Nintendo has attempted to breathe new life into the format, and it’s these changes that truly elevate the game. The most innovative addition is Gooigi, a glowing gummy bear-like Luigi clone made of, well, goo. Previously appearing in the 3DS version of Luigi’s Mansion, his malleable nature allows Gooigi to squeeze through grates and pipes, helping to solve puzzles and reach previously inaccessible areas.The presence of Gooigi enhances the experience a great deal, especially when playing in co-op mode, where you partner up with a friend and explore different parts of a room at the same time. While many puzzles are straightforward, some don’t have obvious solutions, so being able to call on a second pair of eyes for clue-spotting is a welcome addition.The game’s painstakingly detailed levels, featuring themes ranging from ancient Egyptian to medieval to modern-day Hollywood, also have much more depth than its predecessors. Each level, including the one set in a sewer, has its own kind of serene beauty that invites you to explore every corner.Curiosity is readily rewarded with stacks of money and treasure. Much of it just lying around, but some is hidden away and requires you to experiment with your tools in suspicious spaces. Creative players will enjoy discovering ways to access the most hard-to-reach treasure. Your stash can later be traded for a small selection of items in a shop accessed via the Virtual Boo.As is traditional, an end-of-level boss awaits you after you have cleared each room. These battles with an eccentric array of ghouls and goblins can be slightly maddening due to the trial-and-error approach needed discover their hidden weak spot. If you’re really struggling, though, a few clues will occasionally appear on screen to help you out.The random equipment and characters you find scattered about the hotel can prove useful too, once you figure out the best way to use them it’s deeply satisfying – and hilarious – to use a rescued Toad as a weapon, for example. One floor also requires the near-continuous use of a giant rubber duck to navigate the obstacle-strewn surroundings, which was by far one of the most enjoyable experiences I’ve had playing any Switch game.Multiplayer fans have two options to choose from (separate from the co-op mode). ScareScraper lets you play in a team of up to eight, online or locally, to complete missions such as collecting Toads or cash, or engage in further ghost busting activities. And ScreamPark offers up three Mario Party-style mini-games that work best with four or more players. It offers short bursts of frenzied fun but those looking for a longer, more immersive experience are likely to find ScareScraper the more entertaining of the two modes.Luigi’s Mansion 3 is a captivating and charming game, but it’s not without its flaws. If you follow the main storyline without breaking off to collect treasure, it can start to feel repetitive – a more substantial range of side quests less reliant on the Polturgust would have been welcome. And while it’s satisfying to be able to collect so much cash, the items you receive in exchange are underwhelming. In the later stages of the game, we deserve a sizeable new gadget or tool.However, like many of Nintendo’s best-loved franchises, Luigi’s Mansion 3 is imaginative, humorous and highly inventive. It may be nearly two decades old but the series continues to evolve in pleasing ways."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18d3d9f5c5283ddeaec1aa4558da2e0f75663411/0_82_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a1b8959612bab4a0790772aad1685fd","title":"conker contests and pumpkin picking autumn in the uk in pictures","story":"Keats called it the season of mists and mellow fruitfulness we call it an excellent excuse for a grand day out.

She also claims that when she raised salary concerns with management she was told by a senior BBC executive that “the BBC doesn’t do equal pay”.Ahmed said she had more input into writing her programme’s scripts than Vine and also highlighted the extra demands placed on female presenters: “It is likely that Jeremy Vine spends less time in make-up than I do. Women are more likely to be criticised for their appearance on air.”The broadcaster arrived at the central London tribunal to give evidence on Wednesday accompanied by supporters including fellow BBC presenters Jane Garvey, Richard Coles and Aasmah Mir, in the first major employment tribunal case since the corporation become embroiled in the gender pay row.Ahmed is bringing the case against the BBC on the basis that she was paid £440 an episode for presenting Newswatch since 2012, at a time when her male equivalent at the broadcaster, Vine, was paid £3,000 an episode for presenting Points of View. Both are short television programmes of similar length that deal with viewer feedback about BBC output, with Ahmed claiming the pay difference is an example of gender discrimination.She said there was little logic to how the BBC paid its top talent: “It seems to me that men are more likely to be seen as stars, or at least stars that should be paid very highly. I don’t think it is clear what criteria the BBC use to decide whether someone is a star.”In supporting documents, she said she had been brought in to “transform the look and ambition” of Newswatch following the departure of its previous host Raymond Snoddy, but was kept on a similar salary.As part of her case, Ahmed’s team have said Newswatch attracts about 1.6 million combined viewers across the BBC News channel and BBC One – more than double that of Points of View.In response, the BBC has taken the unusual decision to play down the reach of its own output, saying its rolling news channel is a “relatively niche” service that airs little-watched programmes. It also said the only reason the corporation repeated the Newswatch programme on BBC One on a Saturday morning was to “fill out the programme at the weekend”, suggesting it was only watched because viewers had already turned on their TV in the hope of seeing BBC Breakfast.The BBC’s initial evidence at the tribunal claimed the two viewer feedback programmes were different shows for different audiences, which justified the different salaries paid to their presenters. The corporation claims Points of View is an entertainment show which has always attracted high-paid, high-profile presenters who have the skills to deal with a topic in a “light-hearted way”. By contrast, Newswatch is a “serious programme, which deals with matters seriously”, presented by a news journalist, which means it has always commanded a much lower salary.The broadcaster said Vine earned substantially more because of his star status across the broadcaster’s output, having negotiated a bumper pay contract in early 2008 when an unnamed commercial broadcaster was offering the Eggheads host a salary of about £1m to leave the BBC.Vine stopped presenting Points of View last year and was replaced by Tina Daheley, who receives £400 an episode for providing a voiceover. Ahmed will claim that the decision to cut the presenting fee for Points of View is related to her employment tribunal claim.However, the broadcaster has chosen to contest her claims over Newswatch, which could result in her winning more than half a million pounds in back pay.Equal pay is different to the wider issue of the gender pay gap. It covers specific cases where iniduals doing the same, or equivalent, work are paid less than their colleagues."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6442f64d2ec39b3d8809eb3404a68b291f6fed1b/0_40_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e80e0a3abeaeaa2f6bc8d0c6a4df477","title":"hotels com booking pay at hotel cancel refun","story":"I booked through Hotels for a hostel room for the UEFA Champions League final in Madrid.

From Ol’ Dirty Bastard and Eazy-E to XXXTentacion and Lil Peep, it seems no rap artist is capable of going to the grave, however prematurely, without having their unreleased recordings turned into product following their death. Tupac Shakur managed to crank out seven new albums in the decade following his murder. His nemesis, Biggie Smalls, unexpectedly popped up 20 years after his death thanks to a new album of duets with his widow, Faith Evans. And revered producer J Dilla’s posthumous discography vastly outweighs the solo releases he put out in his lifetime.Whether you file this kind of thing under merciless exploitation or giving fans what they want, DJ Premier’s reactivation of the Gang Starr name, 16 years after their final album and nine after rapper Guru died of cancer, is a cut above. As indeed were Gang Starr during their career. They never sold vast quantities of records – their biggest commercial success, 1999’s Moment of Truth, went gold in the US, respectable rather than earth-shattering sales by the standards of the era’s blockbusting hip-hop hits – but from their second album, Step in the Arena, onwards, the duo seldom put a foot wrong artistically.There’s a compelling argument to be made that Guru was the most gifted east coast rapper of his era. Premier’s production style, meanwhile, proved hugely influential: commercial but raw, big on grimy drums, filtered bass lines, samples that literally sounded gritty – the crackle of old vinyl as proud testament to his crate-digging skills – and old lyrics from the artist’s back catalogue scratched into the mix. In the 90s, his signature sound ended up everywhere from Nas’s Illmatic to D’Angelo’s Voodoo to, alas, Limp Bizkit’s Significant Other. Two decades on, more than one writer has been moved to suggest it embodies the spirit of pre-gentrification New York itself.It’s a sound much in evidence here: you never want for boom-bap beats, artfully warped orchestral samples, evidence of aged vinyl or scratching. One of the Best Yet is released into a very different hip-hop landscape to Gang Starr’s last album, 2003’s The Ownerz, but it doesn’t make any attempt to relocate Gang Starr into a more contemporary setting. For all Guru’s talk of “real hip-hop” and “true artists” on the brilliant Bad Name or the bemoaning of fly-by-night talents on So Many Rappers, this is clearly not an album designed to lure kids away from today’s massed ranks of face-tatted mumblers. Rather, it’s squarely aimed at existing fans, who may well be inclined to remark on how brilliantly the old tricks still work: the drama of the strings on Take Flight (Militia, Pt 4), or the muted, soundtrack-like backing of Bless the Mic.Premier avoids the pitfalls of posthumous releases. The material he has to work with isn’t stretched too thin – tracks linger long enough for Guru to make his point, then stop the whole thing clocks in under 40 minutes – and the cameo roles seem to have been filled on the basis of compatibility rather than commerce. The one big contemporary name is J Cole, whose position as upholder of traditional hip-hop values and conscience of mainstream rap is well-established. “Who’d have thought J Cole would be rhyming with ghosts?” he wonders, over a beautifully mournful piano figure on Family and Loyalty. Mostly, the guest microphone is ceded either to Guru’s contemporaries or Gang Starr associates: Q-Tip, Jeru the Damaja, Big Shug, and Group Home, whose turn on What’s Real belies the obscurity into which the duo have fallen since the mid-90s.There was a time when Gang Starr’s story seemed to have ended rather sadly. The duo’s split clearly wasn’t without acrimony. Worse, on Guru’s passing, his controversial latter-day producer Solar published a bizarre letter, supposedly written by the rapper on his deathbed, insisting that he wanted Premier to “have nothing to do with my name, likeness, events, tributes etc”.Some people insisted the letter was faked by Solar, and alleged abuse and neglect on his part. But you didn’t have to take sides to think this was no way for one of hip-hop’s most intelligent voices to go out. In that context, a genuinely strong final album with Gang Starr’s name on it, even an artfully patched-together one, feels not unlike righting a historical wrong. One of the Best Yet does exactly what long-term fans might expect a Gang Starr album to do. As a full stop to their career, it works perfectly.

Here are five factors that could make the difference:1) Is it all about Brexit?Labour has settled its Brexit policy, and will hope to stand out as the one party offering to “let the people decide” by offering a referendum within six months of taking office.But Jeremy Corbyn knows that will not be enough for many ardent remainers in his own party, and among its voters, who believe, as his deputy Tom Watson put it in a speech earlier this year, “our members are remain, our values are remain, our hearts are remain”.If remain voters feel more motivated by stopping Brexit than any other issue, they may feel tempted to opt for Jo Swinson’s “bollocks to Brexit” Liberal Democrats.Corbyn will therefore hope to recast the campaign away from Brexit, towards Labour’s “transformative” domestic agenda, including wholesale renationalisation, radical labour market reforms and a dramatic increase in public investment.2) Is the big squeeze on, or can smaller parties flourish?In 2017, the Lib Dems had hoped to rally disgruntled remainers to their cause – and the party’s then leader Tim Farron even suggested they could “do a Trudeau”, and overhaul the official opposition.But as the gruelling seven-week campaign went on, Farron got tangled up in questions of sin and sexuality while voters appeared to have decided their choice was about which party would be in government – and that meant Labour or the Tories.Swinson is already pressing to be included in TV debates as she attempts to break in on that duopoly, and her supporters hope the electorate will warm to her.And Boris Johnson’s fate will also depend on how successful the Brexit party can be in scooping up disgruntled leavers – and how aggressive its leader, Nigel Farage, will be in pursuing the PM for failing to meet his “do or die” pledge of leaving on 31 October.3) How will the leaders perform on the campaign trail?Corbyn’s uplifting rallies and Theresa May’s stilted stump speeches helped turn around voters’ perceptions of the two leaders in 2017.Johnson’s team, many of whom are Vote Leave veterans, are convinced he can recapture the rough-and-tumble of the 2016 referendum campaign, which saw him outshine David Cameron.But he has sometimes appeared chaotic or undisciplined during public appearances since becoming PM – and campaigns can be unpredictable.For Labour, meanwhile, it may be hard for Corbyn to recapture the freshness of 2017, when he was barely known to many voters, and before he became sucked into the mire of Brexit in parliament.And while his poll ratings as a leader were poor back then – and improved during the campaign – they are now even worse. Ipsos Mori says he has the lowest leadership satisfaction rating for any opposition leader since 1977.4) Can Johnson do better than May at winning over Labour voters?May’s ill-fated manifesto launch in 2017 was held in Halifax – one of a swath of Labour seats across the Midlands and Northern England they hoped to take.In the event, May’s “strong and stable” slogan was much less successful than her boosters hoped at winning over former Labour voters: aside from a handful of seats, including Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, and Mansfield.However, Labour majorities were squeezed in many Brexit-voting former industrial areas, such as Gloria De Piero’s Ashfield seat, and Paul Farrelly’s in Newcastle-under-Lyme. (Both are standing down).This time around, the Conservatives have discarded the austerity policies that have characterised their last nine years in power – and will have a manifesto aimed squarely at working-class, former Labour voters.Johnson has been visiting a hospital or a school almost every day in recent weeks and Tory strategists hope Priti Patel’s tough stance on law and order will help them to exploit what they regard as a weak spot for Labour, and for Corbyn in particular.Patel, the home secretary, said at last month’s Tory conference that her party’s message to criminals was “we are coming after you” – and senior party figures were keen to tell stories of the warm welcome they were receiving on the doorsteps in Tory heartlands.Corbyn’s fancy footwork on Brexit is partly about allowing Labour to have an offer to make to voters in seats like these – and the party also has a list of snappy retail policies, including free prescriptions and funded social care. But Johnson’s allies believe he can cut a swath through the Midlands and the North of England.5) Where do Tory remainers go?The departure of a string of high-profile moderates from the parliamentary Conservative party has underlined its rapid transformation in just months, during Johnson’s premiership.Some, including Amber Rudd and Oliver Letwin, have had the whip removed, while others, including David Lidington, have announced in recent days that they are quitting parliament.Several have voiced fears that traditional Tory voters in constituencies like theirs will have nowhere to go. Former justice secretary David Gauke, who represents South West Hertfordshire, suggested what he called Johnson’s “Farage-lite” strategy could cost his party millions of votes.Will the fear of a leftwing Corbyn government sting longtime Conservative voters into returning to the fold? Or will they be disillusioned enough to find a home elsewhere – perhaps most likely with the Lib Dems.Swinson told St Albans MP Anne Main – a leaver representing a remain seat – that she had already visited her constituency, and hoped to do so many more times in the weeks ahead.Many of these commuter-belt seats will be high on the Lib Dems’ target list – and the more of them Johnson loses, the more ground he needs to make up elsewhere.• This story was amended on 31 October.

For example, in a constituency where the result is usually tight between a party you dislike and a party you somewhat dislike, and the party you support usually comes a distant third and has no chance of winning, you might choose to lend your vote to the party you somewhat dislike. This avoids ‘“wasting” your vote on a party that cannot win the seat, and boosting the chances that the party you dislike most will lose.Tests of the website suggested there were many examples of advice to vote Lib Dem in seats where there was little hope of victory and a vote for Jo Swinson’s party would be likely to lead to a win for the Tories. A senior Labour party source said: “The only person who benefits from this bogus advice is Boris Johnson and the vested interests he protects. This false information makes Johnson’s sell-out Brexit deal more likely and its peddlers should be ashamed of themselves. A vote for the Lib Dems in almost every seat in the country helps put Johnson in Downing Street.”Naomi Smith, chief executive of Best for Britain, defended the voting guide. “Our tool uses MRP analysis, which is the only model that correctly predicted the shock wins for Labour in 2017, like Canterbury and Kensington,” she said.Earlier, Best for Britain launched new research suggesting that tactical voting could swing a victory for pro-remain parties in the December election.Its analysis found that Johnson would fail to get a majority if one in three pro-remain voters in England and Wales switched their vote.In this scenario, the Conservatives would win 309 seats, Labour 233, the Liberal Democrats 34, Plaid Cymru four and the Greens one. When the Scottish National party, Democratic Unionist party and the Commons Speaker are factored in, this would give pro-remain parties a slim majority.Smith said: “If we vote tactically we can stop a Boris Johnson majority and return a parliament that much more accurately reflects the state of the country’s views on the issue of Europe, which is now a majority pro-European country and we need a majority pro-European parliament.Best for Britain’s assessment was done on a seat-by-seat analysis with a poll of 46,000 British people in September and October. Without any tactical voting, the Tories would win a majority of 44, taking 364 seats to Labour’s 189, it said.There are concerns that the remain vote is split across five political parties, including Labour, while the leave vote is split between the Tories and Brexit party.Lewis Baston, an election expert, said at a launch event for the study in Westminster that in the current climate casting an “effective vote” was “all the more important because the remain tribe is more ided than the leave tribe”.Baston said the elections in 2015 and 2017 were hard to predict because of the number of people switching parties, and he expected the same to be true in 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14600e50d9d94a79f506135ee52b179c94376148/0_48_2192_1315/master/2192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=598a4375e37cf217e2633c106d6eeed0","title":"corbyn vows to get brexit sorted out at election campaign launch","story":"Labour leader says: ‘It’s not about me’ as he launches party’s campaignJeremy Corbyn has declined to say whether he would step aside if Labour fails to win the 12 December election, insisting: “It’s not about me.”Asked at his party’s campaign launch what he would do if his party failed to get in to government, he replied: “It’s not about me, it’s not about any of the people on this platform, it’s not a presidential election, it’s about each and every one of us.”By contrast, during the 2017 general election campaign, Corbyn made clear that he intended to stay on as Labour leader, regardless of the outcome.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, recently told former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell in GQ magazine that he “can’t see”, either himself or Corbyn staying on, if Labour doesn’t win.“What we’d do is, as the tradition, which is have an election for a new leader,” McDonnell said.The Labour leader was speaking at Battersea Arts Centre in south London, where he was launching his party’s “people-powered” general election campaign, on the day the PM missed his “do or die” Brexit deadline.Labour is entering the campaign significantly behind the Conservatives in national polling, and with Jo Swinson’s Lib Dems hoping to capitalise on the frustration of remain voters with what she claims is Labour’s willingness to enable Brexit.Many Labour MPs also have significant concerns about fighting a campaign in the cold weather and dark nights of November and December. But Corbyn insisted the party’s army of members were up for the fight – even if “the rivers freeze over”.In a rousing speech, he said Boris Johnson was to blame for the failure to take Britain out of the European Union on time, and promised to get Brexit “sorted out”.Johnson has sought to blame the Labour leader for the fact that the government’s Brexit deal was not passed in parliament. But Corbyn insisted Johnson “has failed, and that failure is his alone”.“After three long years of Brexit isions and failure from the Tories, we have to get this issue sorted out. We need to take it out of the hands of politicians and trust the people to have the final say,” Corbyn said.Unlike Johnson, who is promising to “get Brexit done” if he is handed a Tory majority, Labour’s plan is to negotiate a new Brexit deal within three months – and put it to a referendum within six. Corbyn said voters would be asked to choose between a “sensible” Brexit deal, and staying in the EU, a policy Corbyn said “really isn’t that complicated”.With his shadow cabinet sitting on stage behind him, and to noisy cheers and whistles from the packed hall, Corbyn told his audience: “The choice could not be clearer,” at a general election he called a once-in-a-generation chance to reshape Britain.He said Johnson’s party would “only ever look after the privileged few” – and highlighted Labour policies, including free prescription charges and personal care for the elderly, an end to university tuition fees, and 30 hours free childcare for 2-4-year-olds.Corbyn repeatedly asked his audience: “Is that too much to ask?” They shouted: “No,” in reply.And when he promised Labour would not open up the NHS to US corporations as part of a free trade deal with Donald Trump’s White House, his audience repeatedly chanted: “Not for sale! Not for sale!”Afterwards, in response to questions, Corbyn declined to say whether all members of the current shadow cabinet would retain the corresponding job in government. “It really would not be appropriate, here on this platform,” he insisted.The shadow cabinet has been riven by tensions over a number of issues in recent months, most clearly over Brexit.In his speech, the Labour leader styled himself as the enemy of an “establishment elite”, afraid of paying their taxes. “We know whose side we, the Labour party, are on,” he said – in a bid to neutralise Johnson’s claim to support the “people”, against parliament.The 12 December general election was triggered on Tuesday, after Labour dropped its objections to Boris Johnson’s plan for an early poll.The Labour-supporting campaign group Momentum is launching a toolkit for supporters, urging them to host “phone bank parties”, encouraging them to create video content that can be shared online, and asking supporters to volunteer two full days of their time between now and 12 December to help the cause of putting Corbyn in Downing Street.Labour came under scrutiny on Wednesday over its links with the SNP, after Corbyn’s spokesman confirmed the party’s policy would not allow a fresh independence referendum in the “formative years” of a Labour government but would not block one after that.Corbyn was introduced by Battersea MP Marsha de Cordova, who described herself as a remainer, and said only a Labour government would “sort out this Tory Brexit mess”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb11acc138b362fe39a6271d7c4ebcf0f564922d/0_95_3095_1857/master/3095.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=800ca404358cd169593b87c2609ab086","title":"general election latest news brexit labour tory real change is coming says corbyn at labours campaign launch live news","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest developments in the 2019 general election campaignThis is what Jeremy Corbyn said when asked about his own personal extremely low approval ratings.He said it was not a “presidential election”. It was Labour’s platform that mattered, he said. He explained:It’s not about me. It’s not about any inidual on this platform. It’s not a presidential election ... It’s about each and every one of us standing as Labour candidates – the Labour shadow cabinet or any other position – with all the ersity that we’ve got and all the different life experiences we bring to this country and to our party and to our parliament.The event is now over. I will post a summary shortly.Corbyn is now taking questions from Labour supporters at the event.Q: What will Labour do to improve youth services?Corbyn says we should be cherishing and supporting young people. Some councils have been able to maintain youth services. He says he wants to say thank you to youth workers for what they do.At this point his voice seems to give out for a moment. He recovers, and jokes about there only being seven more weeks of this to go.He says Labour will properly fund youth services.Q: How will Labour fix the education system?Corbyn says the Tories said they were introducing a fair funding system for schools. But that was Orwellian, he says. It was cut after cut after cut.He says he wants to remove the stress on children they suffer under the education system. League tables are great things, he says. He says that as an Arsenal supporter. But he says they do not work for education. They are contributing to rising stress for chldren. That is why Labour would end testing at key stage one and key stage two.Q: Are you part of the Islington elite? And, whatever position he has held, he has always worked flat out to represent the people who elected him.Q: Would you appoint all your shadow cabinet to the same jobs in cabinet?Corbyn says it would not be appropriate to decide who will serve in cabinet now.Q: Would you serve a full five-year term as PM?He says he loves meeting people, he loves campaigning, and he will be so proud to lead a Labour government that ends universal credit and builds the homes the country needs.When he joined Labour in the 1960s, he wanted a more just society and a peaceful world. Nothing in those beliefs has changed.Corbyn says the manifesto is still being written. He says it will be discussed at the clause V meeting. For starters, Labour will ensure public schools have to pay their taxes in full.Q: Do you think all leaders should publish their tax returns? Corbyn says he and John McDonnell publish theirs in full. The first time he did this, it turned out he had overpaid tax by about £300.Q: When did you last speak to Nicola Sturgeon?About 10 days ago, Corbyn says. He says as a political leader he has to keep in touch.Jeremy Corbyn is now taking questions.Q: Your pitch to the public is similar to your one in 2017. Why do you think the message will work now when you did not win then?Corbyn says he is putting a pitch to the public about what can be achieved. He says there have been three Tory leaders since he became Labour leader. And the government has been defeated in parliament 48 times. He is prepared for this campaign.Q: In 2017 you defied your critics. But now you have the lowest polling ratings of any opposition leader since 1977. How will you get the public to feel the same way about you as people in this room do? And if you lose, will you stand aside?Corbyn says it is not about him, or any inidual on this platform. “It is not a presidential election.” He says it is about Labour candidates, “with all the ersity we’ve got and all the life experiences we bring to this country”.He says he asks the media to just report what he says.Q: How will you vote in the next Brexit referendum?Corbyn says Brexit has ided people, communities and families. He says there are people who voted leave and remain who experience the same problems.He says Labour wants to take no deal off the table. That is why he refused to support any move that might allow Boris Johnson do to this.He says a Labour government would open negotiations with the EU about a sensible relationship with the EU, that would not destroy jobs. There would be a customs union, which would keep the border in Ireland as it is now. And the Good Friday agreement would be intake. And a sweetheart trade deal with Donald Trump would not be an option.Q: The private sector provides services for thousands of people already under the NHS. Would you end these arrangements?Corbyn says private companies that do not get NHS contracts sue the NHS. He says he asked Richard Branson to give the money Virgin Health got form this to the NHS.He says he wants everyone delivering NHS services to be NHS employees.From the Scotsman’s Paris GourtsoyannisCorbyn is now on his peroration.Boris Johnson thought he was being smart holding this election in a dark and cold December. He thinks you won’t go out to vote. He thinks you won’t go out to campaign.Well I say this: Labour will be out there in every city, town and village with the biggest and most confident campaign that our country has ever seen, bringing a message of hope and change to every community.Even if the rivers freeze over, we’re going out to bring about real change for the many, not the few.All we need to keep us warm is the thought of removing Boris Johnson’s Conservatives from government – and the chance to rebuild and transform our country.Back in Battersea Arts Centre Corbyn says: when Labour wins, everyone wins.Hundreds of thousands of people in every part of our country who will make this the biggest people-powered campaign in history.We’re young, we’re old, we’re black, we’re white, we’re straight, we’re gay, we’re women, we’re men, we’re people of all faiths and none, from the north and from the south.And when Labour wins, the nurse wins, the pensioner wins, the student wins, the office worker wins, the engineer wins. We all win.The Conservative party press office is posting tweets rebutting Corbyn’s speech as he delivers it. Here are some examples.Corbyn says Boris Johnson wants people to think that Brexit is being blocked by an establishment elite. But people know that the Conservatives are the establishment elite, he says.Corbyn is now using the “whose side are you on” passage I quoted earlier.

Sue George helps her find out more than she imaginedWhen you start researching your family tree, you never know what you might find. Sophie Morgan – TV presenter and campaigner – knew very little about her family’s dark past.“We knew a few things about my mother’s side,” she says, “but nothing about my father’s.”As I delve into Morgan’s dad’s side of the family, using Ancestry, I’m soon introduced to someone whose life was punctuated with multiple marriages, domestic violence and even a proposed suicide pact.The life of John Andrew Towle (JAT senior), Morgan’s great-great-grandfather, not only highlights the absence of contraception in the 19th century and the infancy of modern medicine, but also the lack of women’s rights.JAT senior was born in Salford in 1826 and began his working life as a pawnbroker, like his father before him. JAT senior must have been energetic and ambitious, as he later became an engineer, while remaining a pawnbroker.He was married three times, the first two of which were to women who lived near him in the lively Broughton Road shopping district. His first marriage, to Catherine Dixon, took place in 1855.His second marriage, to Morgan’s two-times great-grandmother Mary Ann, took place in Paris in 1867. They went on to have six children together in the seven years they were married. Mary Ann died in 1874, around the same time their final – and her 10th – child, Octavia Ventnor Towle, was born.But it was his third marriage that was the most tumultuous. JAT senior married Jane Dunster Holliday in June 1875. But they soon went their separate ways. In her orce petition, dated August 1876, she states that he harmed her physically six weeks after their marriage, when he bruised her arm and tried to “pitch her out of the window”. Soon afterwards, he suggested that they take poison together. The litany of cruelty continued until January 1876. She finally left him after he violently pushed her and “hit her with severe blows, feeling the effects of it for some time”.At that time, orce was both unusual and expensive. The grounds for women to orce their husbands were fewer than those for men and their wives women had to prove cruelty, whereas for men, adultery on the part of their wife was sufficient.JAT senior didn’t marry again after the orce. He lived until 1914, dying aged 88.Many of his children, including Octavia, didn’t marry. Morgan’s great-grandfather, also called John Andrew Towle, finally married at the age of 49, and had his only child three years later.Unsurprisingly, Morgan was shocked to find out about her ancestor’s past. “We are uncovering a secret life, a dark side we didn’t know about, which is intriguing,” she says. “Clearly he was a very dodgy character. I wonder how the rest of the family will react? When you find out something you don’t like, how do you feel?”Meanwhile, Morgan’s mother’s side had their fair share of scandal too – from illegitimacy to fraudulent marriage certificates.Ancestry reveals that several branches of her mother’s line came from the Scottish Borders between Jedburgh and Berwick-upon-Tweed. Morgan’s great-grandmother, Ann Drummond Ferguson, lived and died in Scotland. Ann was born in August 1886 the word “illegitimate” was marked clearly on her birth certificate. However, when her mother, Agnes, married her father, John Ferguson, six months later, Ann’s birth certificate was amended to show her legitimacy.However, the illegitimacy wouldn’t have been the only thing raising eyebrows. Agnes was 30 when she gave birth to Ann, while John was just 18 – having been 17 when Ann was conceived. John clearly felt the strain of going against societal norms, as he lied about his age on the marriage certificate, listing himself as 21 when he was still 18, while Agnes, who by then was 31, said she was 30.They married in the manse (the minister’s house), rather than in church. This implies that they had a small wedding, which was quite normal because the couple were not well off.Their marriage endured, and they had another six children. However, a new family mystery emerges around Eliza Taylor Drummond – born illegitimate to Agnes two years before Ann, and not John’s child. Eliza was part of their household until 1901, but there is no trace of her after that.Finding out about her mother’s roots in Scotland made Morgan keen to visit the part of the country where her ancestors were based. “I love the idea that there’s this woman in the family who married a much younger man,” she says.The whole experience has made Morgan determined to keep searching for answers about her family’s past.“I’m so curious to take it further,” she says. “I want to go further back, and I’d like to find living relatives.”Discover your backstory by charting your family tree.

The last three tournament winners have all named unchanged XVs for the final and Eddie Jones has now done likewise. Injuries aside, it was always going to be tough to look beyond the side which flattened New Zealand in the semi-final.There is also the encouraging little stat that no World Cup winner, to date, has ever lost a game en route. England are so far unbeaten on their Japanese odyssey while South Africa lost to New Zealand in their opening pool game. Completely irrelevant or a trusty barometer? We will find out soon enough.Jones, either way, could hardly have sounded more sure that England will rise to the ultimate challenge. There is wishful thinking and then there is the natural confidence generated by reaching the business end of the world’s biggest rugby tournament unbeaten and in tip-top shape. As the head coach put it: “We’ve got good tactical clarity about how we want to play, we’re fit, we’re enjoying the tournament – the only sadness is that it is about to end.”It is certainly a boost that tight-head prop Kyle Sinckler has been cleared to start after limping off early in the second-half against the All Blacks last weekend. By retaining George Ford at fly-half Jones has also effectively put the Springboks on notice that England feel they have the tactical variation to outflank the powerful South African pack and a kicking game capable of putting significant aerial pressure on the opposing back three,Above all, it is a team-sheet designed to show South Africa that England are not scared of them. “We want to play with no fear on Saturday,” said Jones. “We know South Africa aren’t going to give us the game and they are going to come hard. We’ve got to meet their physicality but we are looking forward to that and being able to impose our game on them.“We can definitely play better, there’s no doubt about it. The players know that. I have been so impressed by their preparation throughout the tournament and particularly this week. There’s a steeliness about them but also a nice relaxed feeling because they know they’ve done the work. We’ve spent four years getting ready for this occasion. That’s why the players and I can be relaxed.”The chosen XV, interestingly, is almost an exact replica of the one which kicked off the tournament against Tonga in mid-September, with only the fit-again Mako Vunipola for Joe Marler at loose-head prop altering the symmetry. As recently as 18 months ago Jones was still agonising over whether to keep faith with elder statesmen such as Dylan Hartley, Chris Robshaw, Mike Brown and Ben Te’o. It says everything about how far the squad have subsequently come that the side’s fifth-place finish in the 2018 Six Nations feels several decades ago.Jones has never made any secret of the fact that peaking on the 2nd November 2019 was always his priority. If he has been slightly fortunate that both Vunipolas, Manu Tuilagi and Anthony Watson have all recovered from long-term injuries in the nick of time, the players concerned have all worked incredibly hard to make it happen. “This time last year I couldn’t lift my heel off the floor and I could barely walk without a limp,” said Watson, reflecting on the emotion he felt when England clinched their final place.Now it is simply a question of whether England can subdue a Springbok side bolstered by the return on the wing of the electric Cheslin Kolbe, the only change to the side that beat Wales in the semi-final, and cope with the scale of the occasion. “We have to go out there and take the game to South Africa,” cautioned Jones, who will be taking charge of England for the 50th Test. “Our only concern is whether we can play better than the previous week. For us that simple approach has worked. It frees us up and allows us to play with discipline but also freedom. That’s why we feel like we are ready to go on Saturday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5dd25aa7c53e73c4adb6e2a5a5fd5e1064ee22f/0_115_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39cd5db6011cc99e3f3015b3684a9977","title":"rugby world cup final watching win england south africa","story":"England and South Africa face off in Yokohama on Saturday.

Frankie Dettori has five booked rides on Friday and Saturday and four have been handed double-figure draws on the tight turf track. “It’s in the lap of the gods,” he said. “You’ve got to ride as it comes, perhaps take chances and hopefully it comes off.”Dettori has ridden only 64 winners in Britain in 2019, far removed from the 233 that earned him the first of his three jockeys’ championships in 1994. It has not been about the numbers for Dettori for many years and he is in no doubt that 2019, in which he has set a personal record for Group One winners with 19 so far, is the best season of his exceptional career.That brings expectation too, however, and while he is widely recognised as the finest big-race rider in the business, Dettori cannot work miracles. To deliver aboard horses such as A’Ali, drawn 10 of 12 in the Juvenile Turf Sprint on Friday, and Fanny Logan, 14 of 14 in the Filly \u0026amp Mare Turf on Saturday, he will need to draw on all his guile and experience, while also hoping for a big slice of luck.“It’s like Chester,” Dettori said. “How many horses win from 10 in sprints? Not very many and it’s the same scenario here. It’s not about how fast he jumps out of the gates because if he jumps too fast there’s a possibility that he’ll go too wide. In the turf sprints, you can’t go six wide because you can’t win so sometimes you’ve got to take a chance and if it comes off, it comes off.”A’Ali remains one of the market leaders for the Juvenile Turf Sprint at around 4-1 despite his tough draw and will go to post as the best horse in the race on ratings, having won three Group Two events so far this season, including the Norfolk Stakes at Royal Ascot and the Prix Robert Papin in France.Fanny Logan is an outsider for her race on Saturday but comes into it on the back of four successive wins since John Gosden decided to apply a hood after a disappointing run at Royal Ascot. “She’s done nothing but improve since she’s had the hood on and won four in a row now. She’s an outsider and the race looks tough but she deserves to take her chance. She hasn’t stopped improving, so who knows?”Dettori will also be aboard Aidan O’Brien’s Etoile (drawn 14 of 14 in the Juvenile Fillies’ Turf) and Hey Gaman for James Tate from 13 of 13 in the Mile. The American sprinter Imprimis, in the Turf Sprint, is Dettori’s only inside draw all weekend in stall three.A’Ali is trained by Simon Crisford, whose long association with Dettori stretches back to the 1990s when he was the racing manager for the Godolphin operation and Dettori was its No 1 jockey. Gosden, though, has supplied the majority of the rider’s big-race winners this year and will do so again in 2020.“He likes being very involved in the stable,” Gosden said. “He’s very fulfilled, enjoying everything. I think everything came so fast when he was young that he didn’t stop to appreciate it, but everybody’s like that when they’re young.“Let’s face it, he’s not a man you find on a wet afternoon at Brighton, he very much keeps himself for the bigger meetings. At his age, he doesn’t want to flog up and down the country, wearing himself. He’s a wonderful Italian a and very much still at the zenith of his career.”Horseboxes from Ballydoyle are a very rare sight at Lingfield in any other month than May, when O’Brien generally sends a runner to the Derby Trial and, as often as not, it turns out to be the winner. In the other 11 months of the year, O’Brien has had just three runners since 2003 until Thursday, when he has four horses declared to run at the Surrey track, including a pair of runners in the Listed River Eden Fillies’ Stakes. The apparent reason for his sudden interest in Lingfield is that this card includes two qualifiers for All-Weather Finals day next year. Delphinia (3.35) is odds-on and rightly so after a second-place finish in the Filly \u0026amp Mares Stakes at Ascot on Champions Day, but Coral Beach faces much stronger competition in the Fleur De Lys Stakes and could struggle to cope with Preening (2.30), who posted a good time when second in a Group Three at Doncaster last time out. Lethal Lunch (1.55) put up one of the best performances of his career last time out and is worth supporting at around 4-1 on the same card, while the excellent hurdler Black Op (2.20) has had a wind op since his last start and could show the benefit in a very warm beginners’ chase at Stratford. Good Tidings (6.40) and Zafaranah (5.55) look best later on at Kempton and Chelmsford City, respectively.Tips by Greg Wood"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebe9485ab2e88b575fec1b3fb24a5cfa2d325a7b/0_255_4321_2593/master/4321.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d876d3731839d1b7d9a2cff5f7cc52b","title":"washington nationals world series houston astros","story":"It was a pitching duel worthy of deciding the destiny of the World Series: Zack Greinke v Max Scherzer in a battle of two aging aces. Yet in the end, the key struggle might have been internal, Scherzer’s spirit in defiance of a sore body that threatened to betray him.The 35-year-old woke up on Sunday with neck spasms that left him unable to move his right arm, get out of bed or get dressed by himself. He flew to Texas on Monday wearing a neck brace. A couple of days, a cortisone shot and some chiropractic treatment later, he pronounced himself fit and ready, pitched in the decisive game of the World Series and gave up only two runs in five often-agonizing innings: a home run from Yuli Gurriel and an RBI single from Carlos Correa.That narrow margin proved vital when the contest turned on its head in the seventh inning, as the Washington Nationals scored three times to storm into the lead, spoil Greinke’s stellar performance and deliver the first World Series title either before or since the Nationals franchise emigrated from Montreal in 2005. It is the city’s first since the Senators beat the New York Giants in 1924.While Greinke cantered through the first six innings, showcasing his fielding skills as well as his finesse, Scherzer was doughty but dodgy over his 103-pitch outing, allowing seven hits. Clearly below his best, he was also playing without his catcher of choice, the injured Kurt Suzuki.The Astros, who led the majors with 107 wins during the regular season, were undeniably wasteful, stranding 10 runners on base, especially when they had excellent chances to build a big lead. But Scherzer’s stubborn refusal to yield despite his suspect pitch control, doing just enough to keep the deficit down and burnish hopes of a comeback, was emblematic of a Washington team that has proved inspired by adversity.After all, they saw their superstar slugger, Bryce Harper, leave for Philadelphia in free agency in March had won only 19 games and lost 31 at the end of May were on the brink of elimination against the Milwaukee Brewers in the wild-card round and carved out an improbable 3-2 series win over the fancied Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Division Series before easing past the St Louis Cardinals in the NLCS. Wednesday’s Game 7 marked their record fifth comeback win in a potential elimination game in these playoffs.Though this series generally lacked classic encounters – six of the games were won by wide margins – and was pockmarked by some of the worst umpiring since Leslie Nielsen portrayed Frank Drebin in The Naked Gun – it was abundantly weird.The Astros, who won their first Fall Classic two years ago, were overwhelming favorites entering this series, especially with four games at Minute Maid Park, where they owned the best home record in baseball. This, though, was the series that popularized the concept of home disadvantage. Never before had the visiting team won the first six, let alone seven, games in a World Series – and that goes for the best-of-seven postseason series in the NBA and the NHL, too.Wednesday’s match-up was also the first seventh game in World Series history to pit two former Cy Young winners against each other. Greinke, 36, was acquired from the Arizona Diamondbacks in a trade in July as the Astros revisited their splashy strategy from two years earlier, when they made a last-gasp trade for Justin Verlander, another veteran ace pitcher, and won their first World Series, sparking joyous scenes in a city that had been devastated by Hurricane Harvey only a few weeks earlier.But would they get the Greinke who gave up one run in four and two thirds innings in Game 3 last week, or the Greinke who allowed six runs in three and two thirds innings against Tampa Bay in the American League Division Series? On Wednesday he was brilliant … until he wasn’t.Anthony Rendon, the Nationals’ outstanding third baseman (who was born in the Houston area) punished a rare Greinke mistake with a solo home run in the seventh inning. Greinke, suddenly touchable, then walked Juan Soto, the 21-year-old slugging starlet, and AJ Hinch, the Astros manager, brought down the curtain after 80 pitches. It was a fateful decision.Barely had the crowd sat down after affording Greinke a standing ovation when Will Harris relieved him and 36-year-old Howie Kendrick – who had shocked the Dodgers with a 10th-inning grand slam - pinged a two-run home run off the right-field foul pole. The atmosphere inside Minute Maid Park, so boisterous and confident a few moments earlier, turned queasy. The Astros players looked ashen-faced.“I just had a feeling it was going to get real quiet that inning,” said Nationals pitcher Stephen Strasburg, who became the first No 1 overall draft pick to be named World Series MVP after earning victories in Games 2 and 6, surrendering a combined four runs over 14 and one third innings. “And it did.”Houston’s bullpen misery deepened when a Soto single added a run, scoring Adam Eaton, and continued as Washington plated two more runs in the ninth inning.The Astros’ smooth progress had been snapped with sudden brutality. They were finished, and Scherzer, whose night had seemed likely to be remembered as an exercise in heroic failure, was a World Series champion, dancing with his ecstatic teammates as they sprinted on to the infield after the final out, all the pain forgotten.“It’s impossible to call a season in which you reach Game 7 of the World Series and have the lead going into the seventh inning as not good,” Houston manager AJ Hinch said. “It feels really bad. This is going to sting for a really long time, and it should.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9fae750068331d3fba127a4537114ebcf14a6fb/0_60_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f3571cb295147b7b7b25323850785cb","title":"tennis wta finals ashleigh barty petra kvitova live","story":"The world No 1 prevailed 6-4, 6-2 in Shenzhen to eliminate her opponent and set up a semi-final against Simona Halep or Karolina PliskovaAshleigh Barty bounced back from her surprise defeat to Kiki Bertens, comfortably beating Petra Kvitova 6-4, 6-2 to seal top spot in the Red Group and a semi-final place at the WTA Finals in Shenzhen.After an even start, Barty broke in the fifth game of the first set with a forehand winner, and held in the next as Kvitova missed three break-point opportunities. With humid, slippery conditions affecting both players, Barty defended another break point in the eighth game before serving out the set.At deuce in the opening game of the second set, Barty produced a clinical lob before winning a net battle to break Kvitova. The Czech had shown glimpses of quality in an inconsistent display but began to tire, and Barty claimed a double break after two unforced errors from her opponent.Kvitova regrouped but was unable to make inroads on the Barty serve, and the world No 1 sealed victory on her third match point with an unstoppable first serve. Barty will face Simona Halep or Karolina Pliskova in the semi-finals, while Kvitova heads home after three defeats in China this week.So, that win means Barty tops the Red Group, and will play either Simona Halep or Karolina Pliskova in the semi-finals. Those two will meet on Friday in a straight shootout for second place in the Purple Group. The defending champion, Elena Svitolina, has already won that round-robin, and will face Kiki Bertens or Belinda Bencic in the last four. They will be on court next, both chasing an unexpected semi-final place in a straight shootout.“I feel like I executed really well out there tonight,” says Barty. “I had a few early break points against me, but I played those really well. I was happy with how I played, and how I pushed Petra back.” And with that, she’s off to fire some balls into the crowd. That’s the first time she’s ever beaten Kvitova in straight sets the head-to-head record is now 4-3 in favour of the Czech.I’ll level with you – I don’t fancy Kvitova’s chances of a break here. Barty has been rock-solid on serve in this set, and quickly moves 30-0 up. When a half-chance comes the Czech’s way, she sends a tired forehand wide.Three match points for Barty: the first saved with a cracking return, and the second denied with a drilled winner down the line! Maybe it’s not all over? Barty has other ideas, an unstoppable first serve sealing her semi-final place.Second set: Barty 6-4, 5-2 Kvitova* (*denotes server) Kvitova comes in behind her serve to good effect here – where has that tactic been since the opening game? When Barty tries a chip-and-charge of her own, Kvitova lobs clinically. Barty stays in the game with a terrific bending backhand, but Kvitova holds. Glimpses of what both players can really do in that game.Second set: *Barty 6-4, 5-1 Kvitova (*denotes server) Kvitova looks ready for some welcome down time after a long old season. Barty isn’t giving her even a glimpse of a way back into this match, powering to a comfortable hold. One game away now.Second set: Barty 6-4, 4-1 Kvitova* (*denotes server) Barty leaves her opponent exasperated with a clinical lob – she’s cut loose in the second set and looks much the better player. Kvitova at least gets on the board here, helped by some welcome power and accuracy on her first serve.Second set: *Barty 6-4, 4-0 Kvitova (*denotes server) Kvitova isn’t throwing in the towel, going 0-30 up on Barty’s serve, but two powerful forehand winners get the Aussie back on terms. An ace down the middle, another out wide, and the chance has disappeared for Kvitova.Second set: Barty 6-4, 3-0 Kvitova* (*denotes server) A weary shrug of the shoulders from Kvitova as she misses the chance to hold a scrappy service game. Barty floats her next return down the middle, correctly predicting that her opponent will miss again. Break point, Kvitova nets tamely, and Barty is closing in on the semi-finals.Barty battles to 40-30, but Kvitova zings a cross-court winner to grab deuce. The No 1 gets in behind a net-cord bounce, then powers down a first serve to back up her break.Second set: Barty 6-4, 1-0 Kvitova* (*denotes server) Kvitova, WTA finals champ in 2011 and finalist in 2015, goes 30-0 up but then starts overplaying, surrendering the next two points with awkward shot selections. A double fault gives Barty break point, but an inviting second serve goes unpunished as Barty fires her cross-court return wide. She gets another chance, settling a fluid rally with a well-timed lob – and wins a quickfire battle at the net to break! Barty in total control now.It’s been an even contest, both players serving up sharp winners and sloppy unforced errors. Barty has been more reliable on the big points, with Kvitova letting four break points slip in a frustrating first set.Qualification is now out of her hands even a three-set win will leave her waiting on the outcome of Bertens v Bencic later on. Has she got any fight left? We’ll find out.No sign of nerves from Barty, her first serve firing as she races to 40-0 and three set points. Kvitova saves the first with a brilliant drop-shot, scooped up from under her feet – then sends her next return long. That rather sums up her performance so far.First set: Barty 5-4 Kvitova* (*denotes server) Those missed chances are playing on Kvitova’s mind as she serves to stay in the set. Two unforced errors take her first-set total to 20 (Barty has 12), but a perfect one-handed drop shot keeps her in the game. The Czech finds some first-serve rhythm to hold, a fizzing cross-court winner sealing it and forcing Barty to serve the first set out.First set: *Barty 5-3 Kvitova (*denotes server) At 30-all we’re treated to the standout rally of the match, Kvitova doing well to hook Barty’s cross-court effort back into play, but left stranded as the Australian clips it into the open court. Barty then coughs up a double-fault at deuce, and it’s a fourth Kvitova break point – but she can’t keep her return inside the baseline. Barty digs out the hold with a couple of big serves, Kvitova missing her best chance with a wild volley.First set: Barty 4-3 Kvitova* (*denotes server) Both players having some issues with the on-court conditions Kvitova is struggling with her grip in the humidity, while Barty cast a couple of glances at the surface after low bounces threw her off. Kvitova holds well here, hitting three clean winners to keep the set alive.First set: *Barty 4-2 Kvitova (*denotes server) At 30-15 down, Kvitova is outfoxed by a superb Barty slice that clips the last millimetre of the line. A cross-drop-shot keeps Kvitova in the game, before a low return skips awkwardly off the court. Barty nets, and suddenly it’s deuce, then a first break point for Kvitova via a net cord. Barty saves, but two more chances come and go for Kvitova, both players struggling to time their shots. The Czech goes long with a forehand, and a big serve secures what could be a crucial hold. First set: Barty 3-2 Kvitova* (*denotes server) Barty is finding her groove here, reading a Kvitova slice and lifting her volley plumb onto the line. 0-30 down, Kvitova targets the Barty backhand and forces a couple of errors, but is dominated in the next rally. Another Barty break point, and she gets the break with a snapping forehand that her opponent can’t quite reach.First set: *Barty 2-2 Kvitova (*denotes server) That last game was a real slog after some sharp early points, but this is more like it. Barty starts on the front foot, before Kvitova responds with a fierce, curling backhand winner. The Czech goes for broke on her next return at 30-30 but finds the net, and Barty seals the hold with an overhead smash.First set: Barty 1-2 Kvitova* (*denotes server) Both players make unforced errors on the way to our first deuce, before a break point as Kvitova gets her footwork all wrong. An ace saves it, but a mishit forehand hands Barty another. On second serve, she fires her return wide. Kvitova responds with a nicely constructed point – then double faults! Back on deuce, Barty mishits her return, and Kvitova finds a big second serve to dig out the hold.First set: *Barty 1-1 Kvitova (*denotes server) Barty needs to find some early rhythm, with Kvitova looking sharp from the get-go. She digs in here to hold as the Czech goes for a couple of big shots that drift wide.First set: Barty 0-1 Kvitova* (*denotes server) Kvitova kicks off in style, moving into the net aggressively to take control of the opening game and sealing it with an angled drop-shot.“Petra brings out the best in me, every time we play” says Barty of today’s opponent. Kvitova expects a “challenging game, as always against Ash”. The two players have met four times this season, with Barty getting her first career wins over the Czech in Miami and Beijing.Barty could have sealed her semi-final place in Shenzhen already having beaten Bencic in her first match, she led Kiki Bertens by a set and a break, but slumped to a surprise defeat. Should the world No 1 win today and top the group, she’ll play Karolina Pliskova or Simona Halep in the last four.Ashleigh Barty has already secured the year-end world No 1 ranking after a breakthrough year that brought her the French Open title and a shedload of prize money. Barty is still aiming to finish on a high with the WTA Finals title in China, and can secure top spot in her group with victory over Petra Kvitova.Barty could still sneak through with a three-set defeat, with wildcard Kiki Bertens playing Belinda Bencic later today to complete the Red Group. All four players have a chance of going through: Kvitova will progress with a straight-sets win, and holds a 4-2 overall record against the Australian.Play starts imminently, so make yourselves comfortable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ef652203abc1d895f617209576c67b080ae3c9e/533_487_3889_2334/master/3889.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca9e3faf83141c78a5e716a387cd65c3","title":"google pixel 4 review battery life camera","story":"Brilliant camera, slick features and small size mean nothing when the phone won’t even last a dayGoogle is one of only a handful of smartphone manufacturers still making flagship phones that aren’t ginormous beasts, with the new Pixel 4 the cheapest in a while that significantly undercuts the competition.Priced at £669, the Pixel 4 is £70 cheaper than last year’s Pixel 3 and £60 cheaper than Apple’s iPhone 11. It’s also cheaper than its bigger sibling the £829 Pixel 4 XL. The concern is: which corners have been cut and do they matter?The 5.7in FHD+ OLED display has the same 90Hz refresh rate as the larger 6.3in version on the Pixel 4 XL. It looks very similar too, with good viewing angles, inky blacks and bold colours and smooth experience thanks to that high refresh rate. But it’s not the brightest screen available, which makes it fine for most things but not quite as bright as I would like in direct sunlight.There’s the same large forehead containing the sensors for Google’s new Face Unlock and Motion Sense systems. The sides are aluminium, but with a black textured coating, while the glass back is frosted with a texture similar to super-smooth skin. Buy the white or orange version and the contrasting colours make the Pixel 4 stand out.Combined with its slender proportions of just 68.8mm wide and 162g, the Pixel 4 is one of the smallest, lightest and easiest of top-end smartphones to hold and use. It’s a joy to be able to easily use a smartphone one-handed again. For comparison, Apple’s £1,049 iPhone 11 Pro is currently the best smaller phone available, but it’s 71.4mm wide and 188g, while the £799 Samsung Galaxy S10 is 70.4mm wide and 157g.The Pixel 4 has the same 6GB of RAM, 64GB of storage and one of Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 as the Pixel 4 XL and performs identically – fast and fluid, but not quite as speedy as the OnePlus 7T.Battery life was really poor. The Pixel 4 only lasts just over 14 hours between charges. Remove it from the charger at 7am and it will be dead by 9pm. Turning off the bells and whistles such as the ambient display only added about 40 minutes to the battery life. Anything under 24 hours simply is not good enough, particularly given I didn’t play any games or do anything particularly battery-draining.That was while using it as my primary device, with 200 or so emails, messages and push notifications, two hours of browsing in Chrome, four hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, 40 minutes of Into the Badlands from Amazon Prime Video, and three photos.For comparison, similarly sized iPhone 11 Pro lasts 32 hours and the Pixel 4 XL lasts 26 hours under similar conditions, while the majority of smartphones in 2019 can last at least 24 hours with heavy usage.The Pixel 4 is one of the first smartphones to ship with the latest version of Android 10, complete with system-wide dark mode, full theming support for changing colours, icon shapes, typefaces and more, and vastly improved gesture navigation. At least three years of software updates from the phone’s release are included and it will get Android version updates before most other devices.The Pixel 4 also has the same new on-device natural language processing that was so impressive on the larger Pixel 4 XL. Google Assistant is much faster and works without an internet connection for many tasks. Google’s voice transcription app is equally excellent, as is the Live Caption feature.The new Assistant still doesn’t work with Google’s own commercial G Suite accounts though, which is a bit of a blunder. Google says it’s still working on a fix.Motion Sense uses radar to track motions around the phone. It lights up the ambient screen when you’re within 60cm, will silence calls or snooze alarms when you reach for the phone, and skip music tracks when you swipe in mid-air above it. The technology is more impressive than the functionality currently.Google has dumped the fingerprint scanner for its new Face Unlock using 3D face recognition technology similar to Apple’s Face ID.It’s seriously fast and worked through polarised sunglasses just fine. Look at the phone and it’ll unlock, skipping the lockscreen and taking you straight back into the last thing you were doing. Although technically you don’t need to actually look at it, as it’ll unlock with your eyes closed, which might be a problem for some. Google says it’ll add the option to require attention at a later date.The biggest issue is that most third-party apps do not recognise Face Unlock, meaning without a fingerprint scanner they just assume the Pixel 4 doesn’t have a biometric input forcing you back to entering pins or passwords, which is tedious.To use Face Unlock developers need to update their apps to support the new unified biometric system built into Android, with only a small handful having done so currently. For those that have done, such as LastPass, using Face Unlock is a seamless experience – just as Face ID is on an iPhone.Given Monzo is saying it will take a while to implement, you can probably forget your traditional banking apps working soon.Google has made a name for itself with some of the best smartphone cameras on the market, and the new dual-camera system on the back of the Pixel 4 is no different. It’s the same camera as that fitted to the Pixel 4 XL and performs the same.That is to say it has fantastic still image quality, even in very difficult lighting conditions. Google is still the market leader with its Night Sight ultra-low light mode, but others have caught up considerably. New for this year is the ability to independently adjust the brightness of the background and foreground, which works very well. Portrait mode is improved, as is the up to 8x zoom thanks to the extra camera on the back. The selfie camera is relatively wide angle and pretty good, too.Not so good is video capture, which caps out at 4K at 30 frames per second, not the 60fps rivals manage.The Google Pixel 4 costs £669 ($799) with 64GB or £769 ($899) with 128GB of storage.The Google Pixel 4 is a potentially great phone hampered by really poor battery life. It doesn’t really matter how good you make a phone if it dies before the day is out.And that’s a real shame as there aren’t that many manufacturers making fully-featured flagship smartphones in smaller sizes.The screen is good and big enough. The camera is amazing. Motion Sense is novel and Face Unlock is seriously fast. The on-device natural language understanding is next level and Google’s software magic is thoroughly impressive.But the Pixel 4 suffers from the same issues with G Suite, limited scenarios in which the screen works at 90Hz, lack of third-party app support for Face Unlock and no gaze-requirement for unlocking the phone as the Pixel 4 XL.Even a comparatively lower cost of £669 isn’t enough to save the Pixel 4. If only Google had given it a bigger battery the Pixel 4 could have been one of the best smartphones on the market. Instead this feels like Google’s iPhone 7 moment – a great phone ruined by terrible battery life.Cons: terrible battery life, poor third-party app support for Face unlock, Face unlock needs eyes-open fix, Google Assistant needs G Suite fix This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

I refuse to get Spotify, as it’s such a bad deal for the artists. Are there any alternatives that treat the artist well? RobertYour problem is that you don’t really have a problem. I’m in almost exactly the same position, only slightly worse, because I still use an MP3 player to listen to albums in MP3 format. The main difference is that I’m almost completely happy about not using any music streaming services. They are not obligatory. If you don’t need them, don’t use them. Spend the money on downloads or CDs instead.As always, there is no universal answer because it depends on all sorts of factors. These include the kinds of music you enjoy, how you listen to it, and why you listen to it.Streaming music services are very good for people who like popular music and are singles-oriented. (Yes, I know you can listen to albums. Most people don’t.) They also provide playlists that are much like thematic replacements for live radio or, as we used to call it, background music. Apart from Today’s Top Hits on Spotify, there are playlists of happy songs to wake up to, relaxing music to unwind to, party music to dance to, music to go with various types of exercise, music to fall asleep to plus any number of genre-specific playlists.Streaming music services may have limited appeal for classical music or jazz fans who are album or even box set oriented, and who care deeply about knowing who is playing what, when and how. That’s me.For example, Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic recorded Beethoven’s nine symphonies four times and they are different, even though they sometimes have the same soloists in the ninth. Simon Rattle’s set with the Vienna Philharmonic is even more different. It’s the same for versions of The Messiah, Bach’s St Matthew Passion and any opera you can think of. As far as I can tell, streaming music services just don’t care about this kind of thing, except when someone like Ed Sheeran releases half a dozen different versions of the same song.Having said that, I did like Pandora’s streaming music service, and would still use had it not been withdrawn from the UK market. Pandora lets you create your own radio station by seeding it with something you like. I had a William Orbit station, and Pandora’s algorithms surfaced all sorts of fascinating stuff by musicians I had (mostly) never heard before. It was brilliant. For those fully on-board with Spotify, its algorithmic Discover Weekly playlist can be a source of similar inspiration for both new and old music, but it requires you listen to everything through the service and invest time in liking or disliking songs to teach it what you want.Today’s mainstream radio stations are deliberately bad at music discovery, because they know listeners will switch over if they don’t keep hearing the same familiar stuff. That leaves a hole that streaming services could fill, if only they were as good as Pandora. In theory, specialised playlists can do the job, but finding them can feel like more work than it’s worth.Streaming music services are notorious for paying minuscule amounts for playing songs, and several major artists have not joined or removed their music in protest. Whether the payments are good or bad depends to some extent on how you look at it: they are not good if they are replacing download sales, but not so bad if they’re replacing radio plays. However, all the major services have been losing money, and most probably still are. Even Spotify, the biggest and richest service with 80 million paying subscribers, would struggle to pay significantly more.Digital Music News has tried to establish how much various music services pay for streaming. According to its analysis, Napster pays the highest rate at $0.019 per stream, followed by Jay-Z’s Tidal at $0.0125 and Apple at $0.00735 per stream. YouTube pays the lowest rate of only $0.00069 per stream. Spotify is now, it seems, somewhere in the middle ground, paying about $0.00437 per stream.That isn’t a lot of money for most of the artists with music on Spotify, because 10,000 plays only pays $43.70. However, a song that gets 10m streams will earn $43,700, and big hits can earn a lot. Ed Sheeran’s Shape of You has been streamed more than 2bn times, which would be worth $8.74m at current rates. Three other Sheeran songs have been streamed more than a billion times, according to Wikipedia’s list.Another benefit is that singles can stick around earning money for years after they would have gone out of stock at record shops. A successful artist with a back catalogue of half a dozen albums on Spotify – perhaps 50 or more tracks – could do quite well, especially if their music fits easily on popular playlists. In other words, your grandmother might like it.Spotify’s stated aim “is to harness Spotify’s ability to drive discovery to connect artists with fans on a scale that has never before existed with the goal of enabling 1 million artists to live off of their work”. That would be nice. However – as with sales of records, blockbuster movies, books, YouTube videos and so on – the bulk of the money goes to the people with the biggest hits.So, if your musical tastes favour mainstream pop, you shouldn’t worry too much about Spotify’s pay rates. Every time you stream a song by Ed Sheeran, Drake, Justin Bieber, Adele, Ariana Grande and so on then you are “voting” their songs up the charts. The higher they go, the more people will play them, and the more money these superstars will make.But if your tastes are relatively, or even absolutely, obscure, then you should find other ways to support your favourite artists. Even if you never play any songs by Ed Sheeran et al, Spotify is going to send them your money. The “minor artists” you are playing will get almost none of it.As a result, the vast majority of musicians are not making enough to live on from streaming, but they shouldn’t expect to. As with radio plays, their best hope is to attract an audience. They can do that on a music service like Spotify – Justin Bieber did it on YouTube, Billie Eilish on SoundCloud – without having to go via record labels, DJs and other gatekeepers. After that, they can create their own communities, like Amanda Palmer, the Grateful Dead or Lady Gaga.The best way to support musicians you care about is to buy their albums on CD or digitally from Bandcamp, go to their concerts, buy their merchandise, join their fan clubs, follow them on Instagram, subscribe to their Patreons, and so on. That way, they will get far more of your cash than they would get from Spotify and similar services. Better than that, they will feel their work is appreciated, which is what most artists actually want.Have you got a question?

Can it be salvaged?• The Great British Bake Off final review – even Paul Hollywood couldn’t bear itIf Bake Off was ever supposed to sour, it wasn’t supposed to happen in 2019. It was meant to happen when it controversially moved to Channel 4 three years ago, not when we were all collectively distracted by Henry’s snazzy ties or Helena’s obsession with the undead. But this year has seen the cake contest become decidedly overbaked, and it’s not just one thing that’s gone wrong: it’s everything. Search for #GBBO on Twitter and you’ll be faced with thousands of tweets of irritation rather than admiration. While we haven’t gone off Bake Off entirely, the show seems to have forgotten what made it so compelling in the first place, fuelled by stress, tears and some near-impossible challenges. Bake Off 2019 has, frankly, forgotten how to be Bake Off. So, if you’re reading Channel 4, here’s how to fix it.Number one: get more older bakers in the mix. There was nothing wrong with this year’s contestants, but what usually sets Bake Off apart are the people you never normally see on reality TV: the Vals, the Flos, the Terrys. I didn’t think it mattered at first, but in hindsight it shifted the entire atmosphere in the tent, and left older viewers without a representative, unless you count Henry and his prematurely-aged ways.Next, make the technical challenges vaguely recognisable. Two years ago, contestants were making mini rolls and molten chocolate puddings. This year: Maids of Honour, Sicilian cassatelles and Gâteau Saint Honorés. Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith’s reasoning is that standards have risen, but we have all witnessed the weekly montages of bewildered faces and total confusion. At times, it has felt like we were one week away from Prue demanding they whip up something she thought of in a dream.Third? Turn down the heat. The allure of Bake Off has always been the illusion that it is a quaint little show, when actually it is an anxiety-driven thrill ride watching people lose it while trying to add a marzipan layer to their Battenburg. This series, however, bakers have been reduced to tears four times during a technical, including in the final, where Steph and Alice both buckled under the pressure. Noel’s whispers of reassurance and Sandi’s hugs have gone from rarities to weekly occurrences. In other reality shows this kind of thing would be normal. Here, it is crushing.But Bake Off’s biggest issue, and the one that really takes the biscuit, is the judging. The cruelty hasn’t ramped up over time it came out of nowhere this year. Prue slated everyone’s vertical pie showstoppers in one fell swoop: Sandi called the pies a “visual feast” and Prue replied “unfortunately that’s where it stopped.” Then she attacked beloved goth Helena with the barb: “If you shut your eyes, it’s a nice sponge cake.” And of course there was Paul “jokingly” storming out of the tent because he thought the technicals were awful, and going to town on Priya repeatedly, accusing her of “boiling” her custard and calling her meringue “horrible”. He also reeled off a non-stop list of failures to an already deflated Michael over his cheesecake surprise – “It droops, half of it is missing, it’s cracked down the middle, the icing looks terrible.”All of this harshness, plus Paul’s propensity to stand silently, aggressively beside bakers not answering their questions, no matter how many times they ask for help, makes the atmosphere in the tent all the more uncomfortable. It seems Bake Off is losing the very things that made it so special in the first place – its gentleness, and the sense that nothing could ever go too wrong. Now, not even Henry’s incredible tie collection could make everything OK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b8efd6442663642d09fd51868b06589632e0f5e/0_47_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c93cb9d90ce3e9357900bd9d5e60bf3","title":"amanda knox advice westside seattle","story":"‘Ask Amanda Knox’ will offer insight on ‘life, love, suffering and meaning’, says editor of Seattle publication Years after she was twice convicted and then twice acquitted for murder in Italy, Amanda Knox will be taking her opinions into the public sphere through an advice column in a local Seattle publication.Knox, now 32, will be periodically answering reader-submitted questions in her new column entitled, “Ask Amanda Knox” which will be published in the Seattle-area news outlet, Westside Seattle. The weekly print and online newspaper serves parts of Seattle and a few surrounding cities.The Seattle native recently married Christopher Robinson, whose family publishes the newspaper. Knox was already listed as a contributing writer and photographer for the publication. She produced opinion pieces about her time in Italy, her family and even her religion.The news comes a decade after Knox was initially found guilty of the murder of 21-year-old British student, Meredith Kercher, who she lived with in the Italian town of Perugia. She was sentenced to 26 years in jail, but she and her ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, ended up only serving four years in prison.Last summer, she traveled back to Italy for the first time since her release from prison in 2011 for the Criminal Justice festival in Modena. She discussed the experience of her arrest and prison sentence during a debate called, Trial by Media.Knox, who has repeatedly declared her innocence, has also published a memoir and participated in a 2016 Netflix documentary detailing the case.Westside Seattle published an editor’s note on Monday introducing the new column and explaining that the four years Knox spent in Italian prison “for a murder she didn’t commit” gave her “a unique perspective on life”.“Now fully exonerated, this bestselling author and advocate for criminal justice reform offers her insights, such as they are, to reader questions about life, love, suffering and meaning,” the publication said.After the publication announced the new column on its Facebook page, a commenter wrote, “No. Just no.” Patrick Robinson, Westside Seattle’s director of new media, responded a few hours later with a lengthy reply: “For those that have doubts or still, after all that has transpired, question her innocence all I can say is if you had met her, spoken with her, gotten to know her as I have you would have nothing but admiration for her… It’s as if she was meant to go through all this to become the remarkable, and brilliant, capable and deeply sincere woman she is.”Robinson later explained that Knox is not being paid by the newspaper, she has simply “chosen to use her life experience in a positive way.”The outlet did not respond to requests for comment, and did not provide information about when the column will be published or what questions Knox will answer. It was not immediately known precisely when Knox’s column would begin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecd1aad2f1ddfa7d6d613228f525df6fca335248/0_0_4697_2818/master/4697.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3cc5be666106c604e1c94c1ba2f4508","title":"foie gras new york ban reaction","story":"Chefs and diners lament the loss of a delicacy and warn of impact on jobs, while some acknowledge concerns about animal welfareAs the New York city council moved to to ban the sale of foie gras, members of the hospitality industry and diners expressed surprise and concern over the legislation – including the possibility of significant fines.The measure, passed on Wednesday, will prohibit sales of the fattened liver of a duck or goose at restaurants, groceries, delicatessens, and other venues citywide.The rule will bar the sale of foie gras made through the force-feeding method, called “gavage”. Grocery store owners or restaurateurs caught selling the product will be hit with a maximum fine of $2,000, reported the New York Times.Critics of the delicacy contend its production is cruel, as most foie gras involves force-feeding by putting a tube down animals’ throats. The measure will take effect in 2022.Jeffrey Chouinard, director of food and beverage at Dirty French, an eatery on Manhattan’s Lower East Side, said the establishment had just learned about the ban – and that officials hadn’t reached out.“I was a little shocked,” he said, saying other foodstuffs posed similar ethical questions. “If you want to open up that door, there’s a lot of other claims that can be made.”“How about alcohol? How many people are killed?” he said. “We don’t like to talk about it because we like to have a cocktail now and then.”Foie gras is served at Dirty French, as an accent on a $20 pork paté.But he thought the initiative reflected a “lack of thinking”.“You’re going to see a great increase in the sale of foie gras” before the ban takes effect, he said.A man who works the charcuterie counter at Le District, a sprawling French food hall located in Manhattan’s World Financial Center, disagreed with the city council’s initiative.“When it comes to that, like, damn,” he said. “They shouldn’t have to ban it.”“It’s pretty good,” he reflected. “The taste is buttery.”He didn’t think that a black market for foie gras would crop up.“If people want it, they could go elsewhere.”Ariane Daguin, CEO and founder of the gourmet food supplier D’Artagnan, criticized the initiative in a statement: “The premise of this legislation that the process is inhumane is not supported by fact or research – NOT ONE Council member has made any effort to learn about this process and all have refused to visit the farms to understand the process first-hand.”“A New York City foie gras ban will cost more than 400 immigrant workers their jobs and chance at the American dream. If humane treatment is truly the issue here, we should be looking at factory-farm practices first before we shut down small farms,” the statement added.Daniel Misiti, a Friars Club chef, said in a statement: “I understand the pushback.”“As a chef, you desire to cook what the people want. But I also find it inhumane to force-feed an animal just to fulfill that goal. All in all, I remain neutral on the subject,” he said. “The law is law, and I plan on abiding by it. In this case it’s quite easy.”Madelyn Sundquist, a graduate student in migration studies at the City University of New York, recognized the ethical controversy surrounding foie gras.“From what I know about the actual processing of animals for consumption, there are more and less ethical ways,” Sundquist said. “Foie gras is not ethical, in my opinion.”But Sundquist was skeptical that fines would be effective in keeping foie gras off plates – and chafed at the idea of punishment.“I don’t like the practice of making and eating the product, but I don’t approve of the penalties being suggested.”The New York Times also noted that enforcement of the initiative could prove tricky. Some foie gras does not come from force-fed birds, meaning it could be difficult to establish whether foie gras was illegally made.Stephan De La Faverie, a US citizen originally from France, offered a nuanced opinion outside the swanky French bistro Balthazar, where he was waiting for a table.“Love it – love the foie gras,” he said, adding: “I understand why they’re banning it.”“Being a US citizen raised in France, I respect the law,” he said, “But it’s still amazing to eat, so I’ll have to go back to France to eat it.”A menu posted outside Balthazar listed a chicken liver and foie gras mousse.Would he be ordering it?“Maybe I’ll get a last one today,” he joked."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70653619e5ed658b8afa168edfff1adfaeef2b44/0_320_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a39543ded459e4cebb4352206eeaac96","title":"mount everest lhakpa sherpa climbed nine times world record","story":"Lhakpa Sherpa works for minimum wages and currently washes dishes, as she trains for her 10th Everest summit with no endorsement deals, no nutritionist and no trainerI reach Lhakpa Sherpa’s West Hartford apartment at noon on an overcast Sunday in Connecticut. She bounds out of the front door, embraces me, and welcomes me inside. The small apartment is dimly lit. The living room has a few chairs, and a wall of sports medals from her two daughters’ 5Ks and gymnastic meets.Lhakpa was the first Nepalese woman to summit Everest and descend alive, which she accomplished in the spring of 2000. With nine summits, she holds the world record for women. She plans to summit the world’s highest mountain again in the spring of 2020, but as an unsponsored athlete and single mother of three, it’s difficult to afford training and travel. She currently works at Whole Foods washing dishes, making minimum wage. Unable to afford or drive a car, she walks to work and occasionally takes an Uber to training destinations.Sitting in her living room, I’m struck by her achievements – but also her lack of resources. How is it that a woman with such demonstrated accomplishment and skill is without sponsorship, and must risk nearly everything to continue to climb the Himalayan mountains she loves?Lhakpa makes tea while I chat with her 13-year-old daughter, Shiny, who – more fluent in technology and the English language – acts as her mother’s manager and occasional translator.“What’s it like for you,” I ask, “when your mother is away on an expedition?”She turns her phone over in her hands. “It’s hard,” she says. “I’m proud of her, but I worry.” Each climbing season, six to 10 climbers die on the mountain.Everest expeditions last upwards of two months, usually in May, and there are only occasional opportunities to communicate via satellite phone and Skype. Avalanches, like the one that hit base camp in 2015, have kept them out of contact for weeks at a time.“I’m very good with the mountain,” Lhakpa says, bringing me a hot cup of tea, offering her warm smile. She has a long, lush ponytail and bright eyes. “I go, but I know I will come home. I have to come home.” She looks reassuringly at Shiny.Lhakpa, 45, grew up in Balakharka, a village in the Makalu region of the Nepalese Himalayas, where her father owned tea houses, and her mother still lives. Lhakpa tells me she isn’t sure of her exact age, as there were no birth certificates, and all of her mother’s 11 children were born at home. As a child, Lhakpa had no electricity, and young girls did not attend school.“You see my family on television,” she says. “Sherpas. Climbing Everest.” Her brother Mingma Gelu Sherpa directs an expedition outfitter in Kathmandu. Her oldest brother has summited “10 or 11 times,” she says. Another brother has summited eight times, her youngest brother five, and a sister has summited once.“If there weren’t any Sherpas,” she tells me, “nobody could climb Everest”.She worries when people say that anyone can climb Everest if they have the money – she’s heard people say that it’s just a matter of putting one foot in front of the other, and that Sherpas will do all the work. An average climb with a western outfitter costs upwards of $50,000, while a Nepalese outfitter costs upwards of $30,000.She has seen firsthand all the ways people can die on Everest: avalanches, falls, the thin air of the dead zone. Climbers must occasionally pass bodies, of which there are over a 100 on the mountain. (Bodies are dangerous to take down and doing so requires the effort of at least five sherpas.) Sherpas pass through the Khumbu icefall roughly 40 times just to make sure tourists have the supplies and ropes they need. If you spend enough time in the icefall, she says, you are guaranteed to die.“Why do we do this job?” she asks. “Because the alternative is to make money growing potatoes.”For Lhakpa, to say climbing Everest is easy is an insult. The fact that it is said at all reveals the problematic ways privilege has woven itself into adventure culture.Serena Williams won the Australian Open while 23 weeks pregnant Lhakpa Sherpa summited Everest eight months after the birth of her first child, and again while two months pregnant with Shiny.But unlike Williams, Lhakpa has no endorsement deals, no nutritionist, no trainer. She can’t afford to train full time, or much at all, because she works constantly in order to pay her rent.When she leaves her hourly jobs for climbing expeditions, she risks homelessness. When she returns, she picks up as much work as she can, working as a cashier at 7-Eleven and cleaning houses. “I never tell them about Everest,” she says, recounting a time when an employer realized that the woman mopping his floor was a world-renowned athlete.When I approached her for an interview, I asked her if we could hike together. As we prepare to leave for the walk, I notice that the grommet on Lhakpa’s hiking boots is broken, and she struggles to lace them. I’ve seen athletes with lesser accomplishments – but a higher number of Instagram followers – receive impressive amounts of free gear. Lhakpa mentions that her worn, orange Osprey backpack has summited Everest at least twice.In an era where many organizations profess a desire to ersify outdoors culture, it is difficult to process that such an accomplished athlete – with an authentic connection to the place she climbs - remains unsupported. I presume the root cause is that Lhakpa is not traditionally marketable, and brands want maximum visibility. She doesn’t have a curated Instagram presence. She’s a middle-aged woman of color, an immigrant single mother who speaks in broken English. She doesn’t exude “stoke”. She’s known to climb slowly on the lower slopes, at the advice of the Icefall Doctors, the Sherpas who manage the ropes and ladders over deep crevasses.In person, Lhakpa’s words are laced with intelligence and humor, and her passion for climbing is evident. “This is my gift,” she says of climbing. Though she would have liked to become a doctor or pilot in another life, she knows her talent is getting herself and others on top of some of the world’s largest peaks. Though Black Diamond sponsored an earlier climb, Lhakpa is currently without support.Her dream is to summit Everest in May 2020, followed by K2, a mountain whose summit once eluded her because of inclement weather. She knows this plan is ambitious, if not crazy. “All extreme athletes are crazy,” she says. “But I want to show the world I can do it. I want to show women who look like me that they can do it, too.”We take an easy hike on Talcott Mountain, a place she often goes with friends for a quick walk. She occasionally stops to place her hand on a rock face. We talk about the sounds of Everest, particularly the groaning ice. She shows me how she sleeps in a tent on the coldest nights, with her hands clasped underneath her body in the sleeping bag.Lhakpa began climbing in the same way many of her siblings and cousins did, helping an uncle move equipment for tourists on Makalu at 15, serving as a kitchen hand and porter. She says she was a tomboy, and that her mother worried she would never get married. She met her first husband on the mountain, and they moved to the United States in 2002. They often climbed together, until the relationship turned violent.In 2004, her husband notoriously struck her on Everest, continuing a pattern of abuse that began upon the birth of their first child and continued on expeditions and at home. A difficult few years followed, with the family’s fortunes falling by 2012 they were on food stamps. After further attacks, hospitalizations, and a stay at a shelter, the couple orced, and Lhakpa was awarded full custody of the girls.I first learned about Lhakpa years ago, through the story of the 2004 climb, and have thought several times how damaging to her climbing career it must have been. She was forced to endure physical and emotional hardship in front of her professional community, and did not have the ability to control the public narrative. She left her marriage with no financial resources and two dependents. (Her oldest child, Nima, a son from another relationship, is now an adult.) She undoubtedly lost good climbing years to adversity, and yet her commitment to climbing persists.It has always seemed unfair to me to ask female athletes and artists about their marriage and children. Were the “great” male explorers of the past – or even the present – asked as often about how their children are cared for during an adventure, or if it’s OK to take certain risks – but to leave Lhakpa’s marriage and children out of the picture would perhaps be to hide one of her greatest challenges, and most profound motivations.“Climbing is my way out of washing dishes,” Lhakpa tells me. “It is the way to make a better life for the girls.”As we walk the well-worn paths of Talcott Mountain back to my car, Shiny becomes concerned about mosquitoes. “I don’t want you to get EEE when you’re out hiking,” she tells Lhakpa. I think about how difficult it must be to process the risks her mother takes, all while knowing her lifetime record of resilient comebacks. They look out for each other. Even when Lhakpa is posing for photographs at an outlook, she has one eye on her youngest daughter, and cautions her against stepping too close to the ridge line.Lhakpa and I talk about the difference between climbing Everest as a Sherpa, and as a climber. One you do for someone else, and the other you do for yourself. She expresses a moving amount of devotion to the clients Sherpas guide to the summit.“You make a promise,” she says, “and you keep it.” Lhakpa talks a lot about trust – trusting herself, trusting the climbing partner she’s tethered to, trusting the mountain. “If you don’t trust,” she says, “you die.”“I’m a small mouse climbing a big mountain,” Lhakpa tells me. Her relationship with the mountain is reverent, as if she’s in conversation with it. “Share with the mountain,” she says. “If you’re scared, your fear scares the mountain.” She even delayed 2019’s planned climb because of her beloved father’s death. “I didn’t want to carry the sadness,” she says. “It would not be safe.”When we get back to the apartment, Lhakpa shows me her boots and insulated Red Fox suit. “I look like a bear,” she says, slipping into the gear, which is reminiscent of a wearable sleeping bag. During climbing season, the temperatures on Everest’s summit range from -4F to -31F.She also wears a 50-year-old oxygen mask, because she believes it’s more reliable than the new ones. “I need smart students,” she says, asking me if I can find someone to design a better mask based on the old models. I picture a group of bright minds at MIT listening to this woman – this expert – who has grown up on the mountain and knows what climbers need as they step into the thin air of Everest.These are the other things Lhakpa wants: sponsorship for her historic 10th climb. Time to train and build her guiding business, Cloudscape Climbing. A life spent on the mountains and not cleaning dishes and taking out trash. A book and documentary about her life. Money to help send her bright daughters to college.“These are not quick dreams,” she adds. “They are long dreams.”Lhakpa has always worked hard to survive, and to subvert expectations. In the past, people have discounted the summits of Sherpas, saying that their familiarity with the altitude and location somehow diminishes the accomplishment. Lhakpa, who dared to step outside of a service culture and climb for herself, wants a 10th summit, and is serious about advancing her record.When I ask Shiny what she admires most about her mother, she pauses. “There is so much,” she says, her voice shaking. “But I would have to say her confidence.”Lhakpa is self-conscious of her hands, dried from washing dishes, and the jobs she must work in order to support her family. She is also driven to inspire others, particularly women and single parents. “I would like to hide in the mountain,” Lhakpa confesses on our descent, aware of her humble circumstances. “But I have to show my face here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d73bdf041112d8b1cdedd23801fd004324337ba3/0_286_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=77ea1dec7fd2759fcbd7f184d91bd4dc","title":"the women who broke the harvey weinstein story podcast","story":"When Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey began investigating Harvey Weinstein, they had no idea it would ignite a global reckoning on sexual harassment resulting in #MeToo. And: Rafael Behr on the likelihood of a winter electionIn the summer of 2017, the New York Times journalist Megan Twohey was on maternity leave when she received a call from a colleague, Jodi Kantor. The two had never spoken before, but Kantor was working on a story and needed Twohey’s help. It was an investigation into the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. What they uncovered became one of the biggest stories of our times, launching a global movement.  Rachel Humphreys talks to the journalists about how they convinced prominent actors and former Weinstein employees to speak to them, the lengths Weinstein was willing to go to in an attempt to prevent the story from becoming public, and what more needs to be done about sexual harassment in the workplace.

He told a meeting of Fine Gael Ministers that while an election now may be the best time for his party, it is not the best time for the country. He said he is Taoiseach first and Fine Gael leader second. He also said 80 per cent of people who had contacted him on the issue were in favour of a November election. Speaking to journalists, Mr Varadkar said Brexit uncertainty will continue through the December 12th UK general election. “I don’t think it is the right thing for the country, not with the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit,” he said. “We don’t know what is going to happen on the 12th of December.”Brexit deadlineIt could take weeks or months to form a government in Dublin, and he did not want to “put Ireland in that position” in advance of the Brexit deadline of January 31st. The UK may leave on December 31st, however, if the House of Commons and European Parliament ratify the withdrawal agreement in December. Asked if he and Mr Martin could agree an election date, Mr Varadkar said an accompanying policy programme would also be needed. He said the Fianna Fáil leader had already turned down his offer to agree a date in May. A spokesman for Mr Martin said: “The Taoiseach has said May and Micheál has said springEaster. There’s a difference of a couple of weeks between the two, which I am sure they can sort between them.”On any potential policy agreement, the spokesman added: “There’s a lorry load of Bills that we’ve already agreed to before committee at the moment, 58. Plus obvious ones like mandatory reporting that haven’t even got that far yet.“There is plenty to keep everyone busy. There has been enough messing. Ministers need to get on with it and do their jobs.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4066767.1572459266!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach rules out snap election due to brexit uncertainty","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has ruled out a pre-Christmas election. Now is not the time for a general election as too much uncertainty still surrounds Brexit, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said.Speaking at Government Buildings in Dublin, he said a pre-Christmas poll was not in the interests of the country.Mr Varadkar said the Brexit process was ongoing and the UK general election could see different parties and a new prime minister holding power at Westminster. “I don’t think it is the right thing for the country given the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit,” he said.“We don’t know what is going to happen on December 12th.“Perhaps Mr Johnson is going to win a majority and ratify the deal before Christmas and we get into talks on the future relationship, but it is also possible that the Brexit Party could hold power and we may not get the deal ratified and a hard Brexit could happen.“We could see a new government and we may get a new prime minister who wants to reopen negotiations entirely and negotiate a softer Brexit.”Mr Varadkar previously said he favours an election in May 2020.When asked if he would like to see Boris Johnson remain as prime minister after they had both worked to reach a Brexit deal, he said: “I’m not going to express an opinion on who should win the election in the UK that is absolutely a matter for the people who vote in those elections.“I really do hope that a new House of Commons is in a position to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement.“So far, Boris Johnson is the only one who wants to ratify the agreement... It is what I want but I also respect the will of the British people, no matter who is the prime minister and what government they decide to elect.”Earlier, Mr Varadkar told his Fine Gael Ministers there will not be a pre-Christmas general election.He made the comments at the weekly pre-Cabinet meeting of Fine Gael Ministers. No Fine Gael Minister disagreed with the Taoiseach’s view at the meeting. Although many of his ministers have lobbied for an early election, Mr Varadkar has been consistent, in public at least, in his own position that it should be held in May 2020.Mr Varadkar’s comments follow several days of internal Fine Gael speculation about the possibility of a pre-Christmas election with many in the party believing the party’s fortunes are riding high now. Some Fine Gael TDs were keen on a snap election to capitalise on the new Brexit deal and the discomfort in Fianna Fáil over ‘Votegate’ (where TDs voted for colleagues who were present in the Dáil chamber but who were not in their designated seats)and the uncertain outcome for Government TDs in the four by-elections to be held next month. Many in Fine Gael are also mindful of Enda Kenny’s decision in October 2015 to delay the last election until the following spring. As one senior Fine Gael figure said: “He rued the day of not going early. We will never get as good a chance. By January, the kudos will not last.”Four byelections are set to be held next month. Fianna Fáil and other parties have said they are prepared for an election whenever it happens.Earlier on Wednesday Fianna Fáil’s finance spokesperson Michael McGrath claimed “some Fine Gael ministers” were keen on an election so they could get out of their portfolios “because they are failing”.When asked to which Ministers he was referring, Mr McGrath said “health and housing” when discussing a possible date for the next general election on RTÉ radio’s Today with Sean O’Rourke show.Fine Gael TD Dara Murphy said he believed the public would be quite happy if a general election was held next month. The Cork North Central TD who will not be seeking re-election said that there is a window of opportunity to take advantage of a pause in Brexit negotiations as the UK faces a general election in December and the EU is “changing its political make up.”"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons october 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.General Election latest news: Corbyn uses election launch to confirm plans for second referendum as he pledges to \u0026#39sort\u0026#39 Brexit in six monthsComment: The Tory party is now the Brexit party: Leavers must unite or let a Remainer into No 10Russian submarines have \u0026#39nowhere to hide\u0026#39 says Air Force chief, as UK gets first new maritime patrol plane.Comment: Brexit voters have never felt so betrayed, and Boris Johnson\u0026#39s rivals cannot pin it on himSpeaker candidate Sir Henry Bellingham ordered to apologise over role at African mining firmComment: In a crowded field, what is John Bercow\u0026#39s most shockingly partisan moment?\tHalloween 2019: How Celtic trick-or-treating and Gaelic turnip-carving led to the American celebrationThree British Christian charity bosses killed in car crash in South AfricaPrison officers assaulted 30 times a day as violence, self-harm and suicides hit record highsAs Speaker John Bercow stands down today, here are his best memesBritish police interview Anne Sacoolas over death of Harry DunnBody of British backpacker Amelia Bambridge found at sea in Cambodia, police say Islamabad on alert as thousands of protesters arrive to take on Imran KhanGeneral Election 2019 poll tracker: Lead for Boris Johnson as campaign beginsWhen is the General Election 2019 and when will we know the results? Comment: The Labour Party has become even more rotten and ideologically extreme since the last election\tDiane Abbott calls on Keith Vaz to quit over cocaine scandal Audio Briefings: Sign up to our WhatsApp group for essential twice-daily updatesJohn Bercow’s US fame opens door to lucrative speaking tour after retirementNorth Korea fires suspected missile in latest test as US talks stallWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/05/08/Banksy-0.jpg","title":"banksy art who street art graffiti photos book steve lazarides","story":"Log in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Elusive figure is shown at work in new book from photographer Steve LazaridesMysterious street artist Banksy\u0026nbsphas been\u0026nbspcaught on camera in behind-the-scenes images showing him at work.The new photographs, which show the elusive figure creating several of his famous works, were taken by his former agent and driver, the photographer Steve Lazarides.Over the past few decades, Banksy’s stencils – often bearing searing political statements – have unexpectedly appeared in various cities across the globe.\u0026nbspLazarides\u0026nbspworked with\u0026nbspBanksy\u0026nbsp”for 11 glorious years, during which time we broke every rule in the rule book, along with a fair few laws”.Created with Sketch.Best of Banksy Show all 68Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Banksy piece in California depicting a child wielding a machine gun, in black and white surrounded by colored flowersA rat on the clock of an old bank buildingNear the Oval BridgeThe piece, commissioned by this newspaper, is intended to represent a metaphor for the west\u0027s reluctance to tackle issues such as Aids in AfricaIn 2004, Banksy printed ‘one million pounds’ worth of his \u0027Tenners\u0027668 \u0027Love is in the Bin\u0027During Sotheby\u0027s Contemporary Art Sale on 5th October the Banksy artwork \u0027Girl with Balloon\u0027 shredded through the bottom of the frame as it was sold.

Money editor Jenny Ross said: “This is a positive step that may help to plug the gaps created by the alarming rate of bank branch and cashpoint closures across the UK - so Link must deal with requests swiftly and aim to provide free machines for all those left cut off from cash.“But it\u0027s clear this scheme alone won\u0027t fix the country\u0027s broken cash landscape.“Appalling mismanagement by the industry and regulators has left the cash system on the brink of collapse and communities are being presented with a confusing array of schemes claiming to fix the problem.“That\u0027s why the Government must intervene to protect cash for as long as it is needed.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Money editor Jenny Ross said: “This is a positive step that may help to plug the gaps created by the alarming rate of bank branch and cashpoint closures across the UK - so Link must deal with requests swiftly and aim to provide free machines for all those left cut off from cash.“But it\u0027s clear this scheme alone won\u0027t fix the country\u0027s broken cash landscape.“Appalling mismanagement by the industry and regulators has left the cash system on the brink of collapse and communities are being presented with a confusing array of schemes claiming to fix the problem.“That\u0027s why the Government must intervene to protect cash for as long as it is needed.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The 10-minute trend is for the future and is essential for adoption of electric vehicles because it solves the range anxiety problem.”Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Google celebrates its 21st birthday on September 27.

The goal is to plant trees on every continent not named Antarctica.The goal is to raise $20 million by the end of 2019 and for planting to begin in January 2020. All of the trees funded through the campaign will be planted before December 2022.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I don’t know why. I think it’s because it’s always related to women.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“They never say feisty man, kid maybe, but I find it slightly insulting, I don’t know why. I want to find another word.”\u0026nbspScott and her co-host Matt Baker simply responded with a surprised “Oh”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.The best TV shows of 2019 (so far) Show all 41Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” 241 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” 341 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”“Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 541 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” 641 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”“You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” “West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” 941 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” 1441 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.1741 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.2041 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.2241 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham’s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\u0027Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett’s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.\u00272541 Years and YearsYears and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.As the series develops, it’s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.Timely, bleak, intelligent and compelling, Chernobyl is a triumph of a disaster.Season three\u0027s knuckle-whitening finale is far less disappointing than the last.The writing is sharp and well observed, probing the fault lines between small talk and real problems.A touching tribute to a flawed reality TV star.Despite the strength of its ensemble cast, Succession is a feat of writing above all. Although it is ostensibly a business show, you won’t learn much about the minutiae of media deals by watching it. Its key dynamic, between father and children, means that it is limited in the amount that can actually happen without risking the magic. The writers, led by the creator Jesse Armstrong, who also gave us Peep Show, weave just-about-plausible and sympathetic characters from a web of insults and backstabbing, and tight editing and camerawork ratchets up tension from a slow-moving plot.In Kathy Burke’s All Women on Channel 4, the unapologetic, effing-and-blinding, salt-of-the-earth actor meets lots of different women – from nuns to reality stars – to understand what it means to be a member of the fairer sex, so to speak, in 2019.So here we have an intriguing, but rather flawed sort of Big Brother thriller set in our contemporary world of digital snooping, near constant surveillance and (a topical touch) widespread use of facial recognition technology.Top Boy can be bleak and violent, with dialogue so naturalistic that it verges on the impenetrable, but in telling stories that rarely get heard, it asks us to think differently about the city we live in.Criminal uses its small canvas to ask big questions. The focus on these intricate dances means that after a while we begin to question the idea of objective truth, as well as the facts at hand. I have no idea if it is a realistic depiction of detective work, but it makes for gripping drama.3641 Tories at WarAfter an hour of Tories at War (Channel 4), I felt I had to get out into the fresh air and go for a walk. The foul language the visceral hatred the unbearable tensions the violence being inflicted on ancient institutions and this poor old knackered country by the Tories, as if with chainsaws and zombie knives – it was like watching my first Saw movie.3741 World on FireIn a TV world where too often we are encouraged to see the Nazis as warm and cuddly real people with emotions, it’s refreshing that they are here relegated back to pure baddies, strafing cafes, shooting surrendering fathers and generally being Nazi-ish about things.3841 Catherine the GreatAt last, an answer to the question, what could be more fabulous than Helen Mirren playing The Queen? Helen Mirren playing an empress, altogether madder, badder and more dangerous to shag. Better costumes, too.Sarah Phelps’s adaptation of crime writer Tana French’s novels finds two detectives trying to solve the murder of a young girl, with plenty of twists and turns.Romance is complicated, cathartic and messy, regardless of age or circumstance. But such uncomfortable realities are swept beneath the rug in John Carney’s rigorously whimsical new Amazon series. Modern Love is adapted from a New York Times column (it also spawned a hit podcast) and is as much a valentine to a fantasia vision of Manhattan as it is a dissection of the human heart.Damon Lindelof’s version of the beloved graphic novel is a compelling demonstration of what can happen when source material is treated with sensitivity and imagination.“As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” 241 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” 341 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”“Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 541 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” 641 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”“You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” “West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” 941 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” 1441 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.1741 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.2041 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.2241 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham’s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\u0027Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett’s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.\u00272541 Years and YearsYears and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.As the series develops, it’s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.Timely, bleak, intelligent and compelling, Chernobyl is a triumph of a disaster.Season three\u0027s knuckle-whitening finale is far less disappointing than the last.The writing is sharp and well observed, probing the fault lines between small talk and real problems.A touching tribute to a flawed reality TV star.Despite the strength of its ensemble cast, Succession is a feat of writing above all. Although it is ostensibly a business show, you won’t learn much about the minutiae of media deals by watching it. Its key dynamic, between father and children, means that it is limited in the amount that can actually happen without risking the magic. The writers, led by the creator Jesse Armstrong, who also gave us Peep Show, weave just-about-plausible and sympathetic characters from a web of insults and backstabbing, and tight editing and camerawork ratchets up tension from a slow-moving plot.In Kathy Burke’s All Women on Channel 4, the unapologetic, effing-and-blinding, salt-of-the-earth actor meets lots of different women – from nuns to reality stars – to understand what it means to be a member of the fairer sex, so to speak, in 2019.So here we have an intriguing, but rather flawed sort of Big Brother thriller set in our contemporary world of digital snooping, near constant surveillance and (a topical touch) widespread use of facial recognition technology.Top Boy can be bleak and violent, with dialogue so naturalistic that it verges on the impenetrable, but in telling stories that rarely get heard, it asks us to think differently about the city we live in.Criminal uses its small canvas to ask big questions. The focus on these intricate dances means that after a while we begin to question the idea of objective truth, as well as the facts at hand. I have no idea if it is a realistic depiction of detective work, but it makes for gripping drama.3641 Tories at WarAfter an hour of Tories at War (Channel 4), I felt I had to get out into the fresh air and go for a walk. The foul language the visceral hatred the unbearable tensions the violence being inflicted on ancient institutions and this poor old knackered country by the Tories, as if with chainsaws and zombie knives – it was like watching my first Saw movie.3741 World on FireIn a TV world where too often we are encouraged to see the Nazis as warm and cuddly real people with emotions, it’s refreshing that they are here relegated back to pure baddies, strafing cafes, shooting surrendering fathers and generally being Nazi-ish about things.3841 Catherine the GreatAt last, an answer to the question, what could be more fabulous than Helen Mirren playing The Queen? Helen Mirren playing an empress, altogether madder, badder and more dangerous to shag. Better costumes, too.Sarah Phelps’s adaptation of crime writer Tana French’s novels finds two detectives trying to solve the murder of a young girl, with plenty of twists and turns.Romance is complicated, cathartic and messy, regardless of age or circumstance.

The director\u0027s adaptation is a nonsensical, deeply convoluted disaster that wastes an enjoyably oddball cast. It\u0027s the only one of Lynch\u0027s films the director has publicly disowned. Still, hopes are high that next year’s version from Arrival director Denis Villeneuve, starring Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, will somehow be better.  326 The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990)Fresh off the success of bestselling novel The Bonfire of the Vanities, Warner Bros bought the rights from Tom Wolfe for a staggering $750,000. Tom Hanks and Melanie Griffiths were both (mis)cast in the lead roles after director Brian De Palma\u0027s preferred choices turned him down. The filmmaker himself struggled to spin the 1990 production\u0027s many plates amid reports of rising on-set troubles that were all witnessed and documented in Julie Salmon\u0027s follow-up book, The Devil\u0027s Candy.1991 gangster film Billy Bathgate, which stars Dustin Hoffman and Nicole Kidman, did no justice to EL Doctorow\u0027s beloved 1989 novel. With the efforts of Oscar-winning Kramer vs Kramer director Robert Benton and a script by Tom Stoppard, the film had all the ingredients to become as good as The Godfather, Scarface, and Goodfellas. Instead, it was a hollow adaptation, largely because all the magic was lost with the absence of the central character\u0027s narration – a huge reason behind the novel\u0027s success.The Scarlet Letter (1995) is ranked as one of the worst book adaptations ever made and for good reason. Described by DH Lawrence as “a perfect work of the American imagination, the book was handed a Hollywood makeover that found itself the brunt of ridicule after flopping at the box office. Director Roland Joffé strayed so far from Nathaniel Hawthorne\u0027s pages that what should have been an enticing romance became an extremely throwaway erotic drama.  To be fair, few would be able to turn L Ron Hubbard’s allegedly Scientology-inspired Battlefield Earth (2000) into something decent. This John Travolta-with-dreadlocks epic has since gone down in “Worst Movies Ever” infamy, effectively ending Travolta’s mainstream movie career and destroying Barry Pepper’s before it even started.  Louis de Bernières\u0027s Captain Corelli\u0027s Mandolin was one of the biggest literary successes of the 1990s, but the 2001 film version – from the same British company that made Notting Hill – lost all traces of the novel\u0027s heart and soul. The dialogue is disastrous and lead stars Nicolas Cage (Captain Corelli) and Penélope Cruz (Pelagia) lack any chemistry. It may look pretty, but this adaptation was a complete mistake.  The beauty of HG Wells’s 1895 science fiction novella The Time Machine was lost amid all the CGI in this insipid 2002 adaptation, which was directed by Wells\u0027s great-grandson, Simon. Everything featured, including Guy Pearce\u0027s lead performance, is wooden apart from the copper time travel contraption at the heart of the story.There have been just as many disappointing Stephen King adaptations as there have been successful ones, but Dreamcatcher sits at the bottom of that list. The talent was present (Damian Lewis! Morgan Freeman! Timothy Olyphant!), but the end product never once correlates to anything at all decent. The film\u0027s late-stage swerve into monster movie territory is nothing short of dreadful.Before he took on the role of 007, Daniel Craig starred in this adaptation of Ian McEwan’s novel about people whose lives become entangled after witnessing a deadly accident. While Craig’s performance as college lecturer Joe, along with Rhys Ifans as Jed – the man who becomes obsessed with him – are convincing, the film allows little time for character development and suffers because of it.Nick Hornby adaptations don’t inherently need to be set in the UK (the John Cusack-starring High Fidelity, if you like that sort of thing, is something of a classic, after all), but they do need to translate the fussy, infuriating male neuroses of his novels. The Perfect Catch is the 2005 US adaptation of Hornby’s Fever Pitch, released a decade after Colin Firth starred in his own British adaptation, and transforms the source material into a more throwaway and uninteresting big-city romcom. Drew Barrymore, in a \u0027girlfriend’ role significantly beefed up in comparison to Hornby’s novel, is great, but watching her try and source chemistry with a shrill and unappealing Jimmy Fallon (in one of his rare, pre-talk show acting roles) is harrowing.The Da Vinci Code is a stinker of the highest order. Its sequels, Angels \u0026amp Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016), are also awful films, but the reason the initial Dan Brown adaptation ranks as the worst is because the others wouldn\u0027t have existed had this one not been so successful.20th Century Fox clearly wanted Eragon to be their answer to Harry Potter, but the terrible reviews stopped that plan dead in its tracks. Eragon is the worst kind of fantasy adaptation – one where all of the source materials\u0027 sense of fantastical vibrancy disappears during its translation to the big screen.1426 Running with Scissors (2006)Augusten Burroughs’s Running with Scissors consistently walks a dangerous tightrope between manic farce and adolescent horror tale. Ryan Murphy’s adaptation, released in 2006, collapses beneath such a task. You can see why Murphy, for his feature film debut, would be attracted to a tale of neurotic family dysfunction and sexual awakening as they are themes that crop up in many of his TV shows (Glee, American Horror Story, etc). But this adaptation is a tonal misfire from start to finish, despite the best efforts of an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gwyneth Paltrow, Evan Rachel Wood and Brian Cox. It’s no wonder this sunk without a trace. In another case of Hollywood throwing money at something in the belief that will be enough, Philip Pullman’s superb His Dark Materials trilogy – or rather, the first book Northern Lights – was condensed into an agonising mess of CGI and hammy acting in 2007\u0027s The Golden Compass. Much of the blame went to the fact that Hollywood, where God is thanked above anyone else at the Oscars, would likely be uncomfortable handling material that was so critical of the Catholic church. It also suffered by trying to condense an overwhelming amount of information into the opening few scenes. A forthcoming BBC adaptation starring James McAvoy and Lin-Manuel Miranda looks far more promising.Where to start with this disaster of a film? Audrey Niffenegger’s The Time Traveller\u0027s Wife is beautifully and convincingly written, but there\u0027s nothing convincing about its adaptation. Producers thought casting two major Hollywood stars was a good idea, but Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana had zero chemistry. Cloud Atlas (2012) is by no means a disaster, but it\u0027s meandering plot lines, sketchy pacing and often questionable acting (Hanks has never been dodgier) do David Mitchell\u0027s sprawling, inventive novel a disservice. Still, it\u0027s an enjoyable Wachowskis romp that features Hugh Grant as a cannibal tribesman, so it has that going for it.Fans of The Hobbit did not expect the novel, so short and sweet and set in such a familiar and adored world, to be messed up by The Lord of the Rings maestro Peter Jackson – but that’s exactly what happened. While the trilogy of Hobbit films were a box-office success, they came under fire from critics for stretching the book\u0027s material too thin. Third outing, The Battle of Five Armies, was the worst received of all three.  The film adaptation of the profoundly moving and dark tale The Book Thief, which follows a young girl in Nazi Germany, is tonally off from the first scene. The glossy cinematography and excessively sentimental score jar with its grim subject matter and the performances verge on caricature. It doesn\u0027t help that all of the English dialogue is spoken with a German accent.No adaptation of The Great Gatsby,  F Scott Fitzgerald’s most famous work, has managed to capture the excess, glamour and underlying sleaze of the roaring Twenties. Baz Luhrmann\u0027s 2013 version was fun and arguably the best at revealing the insecurities of (a brilliant) Leonardo DiCaprio’s Gatsby. However, the flashiness of the production stripped away all of Fitzgerald’s delicate story-telling.Disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein’s fingerprints are all over this messy adaptation of Young Adult novel The Giver (2014), which attempts to fuse a sincere, thoughtful allegory with a Twilight-style love story backed up by action fresh from The Hunger Games  and a Taylor Swift cameo. By attempting to appeal to every single teenager all at once, though, The Giver loses sight of its fascinating dystopian premise and gives its eccentric cast (among them Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsgård and Katie Holmes) very little to do.  John Niven\u0027s Kill Your Friends is a blistering, debauched exploration into the life of a cocaine-sniffing record label agent. It passes by in the blink of an eye, which can\u0027t be said for its adaptation. The film, released in 2015, tries so hard to nail what Niven achieves so fluidly and it shows – the result is nothing short of embarrassing with the clean-cut Nicholas Hoult failing to convince as the sociopathic Steven Stelfox.2326 The Girl on the Train (2016)Although it will always exist in the shadow of Gillian Flynn’s ingenious thriller Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train is an undeniably pacy and intelligent novel. But it was completely let down by this US film adaptation. The 2016 release, starring Emily Blunt, is cheesy and lacking in nuance – and criminally takes the story away from its original gritty London setting, plonking the characters down in glossy New York for no apparent reason. The 2016 adaptation of Me Before You, starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, was brutally panned by critics for being emotionally manipulative. Its bad acting and problematic premise didn\u0027t help, either. Clarke\u0027s performance as the paid companion to Claflin’s quadriplegic was in particular criticised for being offensively exaggerated.  While not the same calibre of flop as Dreamcatcher, The Dark Tower is a fine example of a botched attempt at adapting one of Stephen King\u0027s finest works. With Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the lead roles as the heroic and villainous characters caught in a fated tussle, it should have soared – but a rush job such as Nikolaj Arcel\u0027s 2017 film is no way to treat such an expansive piece of work. Despite magnetic performances from Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle, this adaptation of Ian McEwan\u0027s On Chesil Beach was weighed down by a turgid script and clumsy old-age make-up. The finished product is worlds away from the McEwan adaptation that Ronan previously starred in –\u0026nbspthe Oscar-winning drama Atonement (2007).Dune was never going to be an easy book to turn into a two-hour action movie – and David Lynch’s attempt is proof that it should be best left alone. The director\u0027s adaptation is a nonsensical, deeply convoluted disaster that wastes an enjoyably oddball cast. It\u0027s the only one of Lynch\u0027s films the director has publicly disowned. Still, hopes are high that next year’s version from Arrival director Denis Villeneuve, starring Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, will somehow be better.  326 The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990)Fresh off the success of bestselling novel The Bonfire of the Vanities, Warner Bros bought the rights from Tom Wolfe for a staggering $750,000. Tom Hanks and Melanie Griffiths were both (mis)cast in the lead roles after director Brian De Palma\u0027s preferred choices turned him down. The filmmaker himself struggled to spin the 1990 production\u0027s many plates amid reports of rising on-set troubles that were all witnessed and documented in Julie Salmon\u0027s follow-up book, The Devil\u0027s Candy.1991 gangster film Billy Bathgate, which stars Dustin Hoffman and Nicole Kidman, did no justice to EL Doctorow\u0027s beloved 1989 novel. With the efforts of Oscar-winning Kramer vs Kramer director Robert Benton and a script by Tom Stoppard, the film had all the ingredients to become as good as The Godfather, Scarface, and Goodfellas. Instead, it was a hollow adaptation, largely because all the magic was lost with the absence of the central character\u0027s narration – a huge reason behind the novel\u0027s success.The Scarlet Letter (1995) is ranked as one of the worst book adaptations ever made and for good reason. Described by DH Lawrence as “a perfect work of the American imagination, the book was handed a Hollywood makeover that found itself the brunt of ridicule after flopping at the box office. Director Roland Joffé strayed so far from Nathaniel Hawthorne\u0027s pages that what should have been an enticing romance became an extremely throwaway erotic drama.  To be fair, few would be able to turn L Ron Hubbard’s allegedly Scientology-inspired Battlefield Earth (2000) into something decent. This John Travolta-with-dreadlocks epic has since gone down in “Worst Movies Ever” infamy, effectively ending Travolta’s mainstream movie career and destroying Barry Pepper’s before it even started.  Louis de Bernières\u0027s Captain Corelli\u0027s Mandolin was one of the biggest literary successes of the 1990s, but the 2001 film version – from the same British company that made Notting Hill – lost all traces of the novel\u0027s heart and soul. The dialogue is disastrous and lead stars Nicolas Cage (Captain Corelli) and Penélope Cruz (Pelagia) lack any chemistry. It may look pretty, but this adaptation was a complete mistake.  The beauty of HG Wells’s 1895 science fiction novella The Time Machine was lost amid all the CGI in this insipid 2002 adaptation, which was directed by Wells\u0027s great-grandson, Simon. Everything featured, including Guy Pearce\u0027s lead performance, is wooden apart from the copper time travel contraption at the heart of the story.There have been just as many disappointing Stephen King adaptations as there have been successful ones, but Dreamcatcher sits at the bottom of that list. The talent was present (Damian Lewis! Morgan Freeman! Timothy Olyphant!), but the end product never once correlates to anything at all decent. The film\u0027s late-stage swerve into monster movie territory is nothing short of dreadful.Before he took on the role of 007, Daniel Craig starred in this adaptation of Ian McEwan’s novel about people whose lives become entangled after witnessing a deadly accident. While Craig’s performance as college lecturer Joe, along with Rhys Ifans as Jed – the man who becomes obsessed with him – are convincing, the film allows little time for character development and suffers because of it.Nick Hornby adaptations don’t inherently need to be set in the UK (the John Cusack-starring High Fidelity, if you like that sort of thing, is something of a classic, after all), but they do need to translate the fussy, infuriating male neuroses of his novels. The Perfect Catch is the 2005 US adaptation of Hornby’s Fever Pitch, released a decade after Colin Firth starred in his own British adaptation, and transforms the source material into a more throwaway and uninteresting big-city romcom. Drew Barrymore, in a \u0027girlfriend’ role significantly beefed up in comparison to Hornby’s novel, is great, but watching her try and source chemistry with a shrill and unappealing Jimmy Fallon (in one of his rare, pre-talk show acting roles) is harrowing.The Da Vinci Code is a stinker of the highest order. Its sequels, Angels \u0026amp Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016), are also awful films, but the reason the initial Dan Brown adaptation ranks as the worst is because the others wouldn\u0027t have existed had this one not been so successful.20th Century Fox clearly wanted Eragon to be their answer to Harry Potter, but the terrible reviews stopped that plan dead in its tracks. Eragon is the worst kind of fantasy adaptation – one where all of the source materials\u0027 sense of fantastical vibrancy disappears during its translation to the big screen.1426 Running with Scissors (2006)Augusten Burroughs’s Running with Scissors consistently walks a dangerous tightrope between manic farce and adolescent horror tale. Ryan Murphy’s adaptation, released in 2006, collapses beneath such a task. You can see why Murphy, for his feature film debut, would be attracted to a tale of neurotic family dysfunction and sexual awakening as they are themes that crop up in many of his TV shows (Glee, American Horror Story, etc). But this adaptation is a tonal misfire from start to finish, despite the best efforts of an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gwyneth Paltrow, Evan Rachel Wood and Brian Cox. It’s no wonder this sunk without a trace. In another case of Hollywood throwing money at something in the belief that will be enough, Philip Pullman’s superb His Dark Materials trilogy – or rather, the first book Northern Lights – was condensed into an agonising mess of CGI and hammy acting in 2007\u0027s The Golden Compass. Much of the blame went to the fact that Hollywood, where God is thanked above anyone else at the Oscars, would likely be uncomfortable handling material that was so critical of the Catholic church. It also suffered by trying to condense an overwhelming amount of information into the opening few scenes. A forthcoming BBC adaptation starring James McAvoy and Lin-Manuel Miranda looks far more promising.Where to start with this disaster of a film?

She knows he’s up to something and Lucy was great, but Anna ultimately was amazing in the looks. She has one line in the film. There’s something you can’t talk about. She knows it. She knows who he is. He knows she knows.”Scorsese recently drew criticism when he said he “doesn’t have time anymore” to write films led by female characters.The Irishman, a gangster film that follows real-life Mafia hitman Frank Sheeran across several decades of his life, will have a limited theatrical release from 8 November before becoming available to stream on Netflix on 28 November.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At\u0026nbspits Annual General Meeting in April, it held a vote on whether to disaffiliate from Labour\u0026nbspbut members\u0026nbspvowed to “stay and fight”, despite declaring that they believed Mr Corbyn was unfit to be prime minister.Labour is currently being investigated by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission\u0026nbspfollowing complaints\u0026nbspthat it is institutionally antisemitic. While the watchdog is not due to report until January, Mr Corbyn’s handling of the crisis is likely to be brought up frequently by his opponents during the election campaign.\u0026nbspWhile JLM said it would not campaign for candidates standing against Labour, it is expected to\u0026nbspdraw attention to Labour MPs who it believes have a poor record\u0026nbspof\u0026nbsptackling\u0026nbspantisemitism.In a statement, the group said there was “damning evidence of the party’s moral slide” under Mr Corbyn’s leadership and said that “a culture of antisemitism has been allowed to emerge and fester in the party at all levels”.It said: “This crisis of antisemitism in the Labour Party stems from a failure of leadership from Jeremy Corbyn. When the answer has been to take swift, decisive action, the reality has been equivocation and token gestures. Time and time again, the party has not engaged in good faith to try to implement the actions that we believe are necessary to tackle anti-Jewish racism.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Political interference is endemic in the system, which is used to protect the leaderships’ friends and allies, rather than ensure the party is a safe space for Jews.”Describing Mr Corbyn’s leadership as “catastrophic for Jews in the Labour Party”, JLM said it would “not be campaigning\u0026nbspunless in exceptional circumstances and for exceptional candidates”, including its parliamentary chair, Stoke-on-Trent\u0026nbspNorth MP Ruth Smeeth, and MPs who had been “unwavering in their support of us”.It insisted that its position “does not mean we no longer support the Labour Party’s policies and its historic values” but added: “Fighting racism, prejudice and intolerance is at the heart of our Labour values – it is the failure of the leader and his supporters to live these values which has led us to take this stance.”A Labour\u0026nbspspokesperson said: “The Labour Party is fully committed to the support, defence and celebration of the Jewish community and continues to take robust action to root out antisemitism in the party and wider society.\u0026nbsp“We have imposed swift suspensions and the rate at which cases have been dealt with has increased more than four-fold. Jeremy Corbyn has made clear that antisemitism has no place in the party, has brought forward reforms to fast-track expulsions, and launched an education programme to deepen understanding of antisemitism within our movement.“We are gearing up to launch the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change that our country has ever seen.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He has already put himself out for hire for £, in recent days.Bercow whines he is “entitled to make a living”, and after ten shouty years on the globally screened Parliament Channel he has achieved lucrative star status.As cartoon TV hero Homer Simpson has proved, audiences love grotesques.Once free from high office, Bercow can quickly fill his boots with fees worth tens of thousands a time.But could there be another motive for his decision to go now rather than after he has completely screwed Brexit Had he stayed on, it seems he risked being “tried” on incendiary allegations of bullying and bringing Parliament into disrepute — an offence which might have cost him an automatic peerage and a seat in the House of Lords.Once out, he is “beyond the jurisdiction of Parliament”.Bercow has been haunted for years by allegations of volcanic temper tantrums and humiliation of staff, including some of the Commons’ most senior officials. He denies all the claims.Official probes have been shamelessly stymied by Labour because of Bercow’s “Bollocks to Brexit” stance.Labour grandee Dame Margaret Beckett blurted out her party’s motives, insisting Bercow must stay because Brexit “trumps bad behaviour”.The hypocrisy stinks. Labour claims to be the workers’ party. Here it is standing up for the bosses’ class.Parliament has also been criticised for failing victims of bullying. But kicking these charges into touch seems to have worked.Bercow’s decision to go now has persuaded former Black Rod David Leakey and the Speaker’s ex-Private Secretary, Angus Sinclair, to abandon claims of humiliation and abuse.In  Mr Sinclair, hardened by  years before the mast, told BBC Newsnight that Bercow mimicked him and was “prone to over-the-top anger”.Mr Leakey, an ex-Army Lieutenant-General, spoke of “the red mist descending” as Bercow “banged the table, yelled and was highly insulting to me personally”.He warns the Sundaythat a Bercow peerage would bring the House of Lords into disrepute at a time when politicians’ reputations are already at an all-time low.“Whatever Bercow’s merits as Speaker, I believe he should be treated in the same way as any other successful but disreputable citizen of the country,” says Leakey.“He is disreputable because, as a high-profile public figure, he has set an appalling example to the country, not least in publicly demeaning MPs in the chamber and on television.“As a senior figure in any other organisation, his behaviour would likely have resulted in investigation, censure or even dismissal.“He should not be rewarded with ‘baubles’ or a peerage.”Having watched this snarling, purple-faced Mr Punch discredit the constitution, stain the reputation of Parliament and demean the most distinguished post in British politics, it is impossible to disagree.There is now a chance for MPs to clean out this soiled stable and restore Parliament’s reputation.Decent Labour MP and popular Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle is front-runner for the job. But none of the candidates could be worse, even preachy Labour veteran Harriet Harman.To quote the former Black Rod, it should not be rewarded by any party with an unelected place on the overstuffed red benches of the House of Lords.BREXIT-cancelling Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson thinks we are all stupid.Her plot with the SNP to stage a snap election on Monday, December , has flashing red lights all over it.It would be a vehicle for oddball amendments including votes at  – just the impressionable age when fantasy politics appeals most.She pretends she is trying to stop Boris “crashing out” with No Deal.Yet Boris wants a deal.

If you run away or say anything about what happened to you, then they’re going to deport you back to your country, Laura Durán, of the charity Every Child Protected Against TraffickingUK, tells Sun Online.With nail salons now a staple on Britains high streets, offering plenty of low-skilled labour roles, its perhaps unsurprising that many Vietnamese people see them as a ticket to a better le.But this makes them easy prey for vile trafficking networks, who are thought to illegally smuggle around , Vietnamese citizens including children, to Europe each year.They lure their desperate victims with  promises of lucrative jobs in cash-only nail bars and cannabis farms, assuring them they can change their own and their familys fortunes.The sick trade has become so prevalent that over the past decade a holding camp in Northern France has been dubbed Vietnam City, based on the huge number of Vietnamese migrants waiting to reach Britain.My family back paid someone and they got me this far, a Vietnamese man at another refugee camp, located slightly further north, told The Sun on Sunday.“People in England will get me a job when I get there. It’s scary when you think what happened [in Essex] but that’s the chance you take and I am ready to risk my le.Pham Thi Tra My, , texted her mum, Im dying because I cant breatheFor migrants with enough le savings, they can buy a VIP trip to the UK - which costs nearly £, and involves a flight on someone s passport, or a doctored diplomatic one, to Europe.Or the cheaper option - so-called grass packages costing up to £, - involves a less direct route to Europe that can take several months and hundreds of miles on foot and by road.Often, migrants first travel to China or Russia before moving West entered Russia as tourists, with many then travelling to Western Europe.Other popular connecting countries including France, Germany and Poland.They go through jungles, forests and theyre kept in wooden huts, immigration lawyer Harjap Bhangal tells Sun Online, describing a migrants typical, dangerous journey to Britain.The gangs are ruthless. If someone is slowing down the group the smugglers will kill them.While Vietnam as a whole has seen a reduction in poverty, not all regions have been affected equally - so the majority of migrants come from a select few poor provinces.In Nghe An and Ha Tinh - where many lorry victims are feared to be from - the countryside is dotted with billboards for labour export firms advertising jobs or study overseas.Almost everyone round here has a relative overseas, local Bui Thac, whose nephew Bui Phan Thang is suspected to be among those found dead last week, told Reuters.Young people must find ways to work abroad because its dficult to work at home.For those who survive the horror passage to Britain, their nightmares far from over.While plenty of the countrys nail salons and grooming parlours are reputable businesses, police say the industry has become a hotbed of labour exploitation.Labour exploitation in nail bars is one of the most prevalent areas of modern day slavery in the UK, Hardeep Walker, of the National Crime Agency , told our Stamp Out Slavery campaign this year.He added: The salon conditions are usually quite small and cramped and can have a strong smell of chemicals. The exploiter will be present in the salon, often acting as a front of house member of staff who meets and greets customers and takes payment whilst keeping a watchful eye over the workers.Even when their sht is finally over, the workers have no escape - because they tend to sleep in rooms above or attached to salons, and have no money of their own to spend.Slavery takes a iety of forms, but most commonly forced labour, sexual exploitation, domestic work or forced criminal activity. The Home Office estimated that there are , people held in slavery in the UK, with the Global Slavery Index suggesting the figure could be as many as ,.The UK recognised a staggering , victims from  countries in , including adults who had been used for organ harvesting and children that were forced into sexual exploitation.Our Stamp Out Slavery campaign, in conjunction with Co-op, has highlighted the plight of some of Britains slaves working in car washes and nail salons, farms and factories all over the UK.We called on the government to extend support for Britains slaves beyond the current -day limit and backing Lord McColls private members Bill demanding support be extended to a year.In April this year, a high court judge suspended the paltry time limit and said it should be subject to a full judicial review.In , two Bath nail bar owners were locked up for five and four years respectively in a landmark case, after forcing young Vietnamese women to work for no pay in UK salons.Thu Huong Nguyen and Viet Hoany Nguyen trafficked the girls between salons according to demand and exploited them in plain sight, the Crown Prosecution Servicesaid.But while they didnt pay one victim - with a second earning just £ a month - a search of Thu Huong Nguyens home uncovered £, in £ notes hidden inside a teddy bear.The same year,  nail salons were raided by police across London, Cardf and Edinburgh, resulting in  arrests, in a bid to tackle the epidemic.It came six years after the extradition of gangster Do Huan Nguyen, who smuggled more than  Vietnamese people to the UK to work in drug factories and nail salons.Last year, more than  potential victims of trafficking from Vietnam were identied, ECPAT tells Sun Online - although the real number is far higher because most go undocumented.Today, many victims continue to work in exploitative British nail salons, often avoiding eye contact and conversationas they apply coats of glossy polish.But these salons floor-to-ceiling windows and bright lights provide a colourful cover for a dark, sickening secret.What do employees look like What do they sound like How do you feel Souce: UnseenOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Harry and Meghan went to Africa, with ITV, and made that trip all about their own anxieties and issues as well, without being half as engaging or sympathetic as Scarlett Moffatt.If anything, I think The British Tribe Next Door will also live longer in my memory than the royal version, not least because C seems to have got more than it bargained for with the Himba, who clearly aren’t big on marital fidelity.Some of the men are already looking to pick off Scarlett from the back of the Moffatt herd and episode one ended with this tantalising offer, from one of the women to her mum.“Betty, let us swap husbands tonight.” .So my interest in this show is now over.DAVID ATTENBOROUGH’S Seven Worlds, One Planet lived up to the usual visually stunning expectations for nearly an hour on Sunday night on BBC.A couple of cute baby animals won their struggle for le, two gender-fluid gastropods had it off at the bottom of the Antarctic Ocean and a bull elephant seal on South Georgia discovered: “cm of blubber is protection against the cold, but not from a four-ton opponent” – a bit like Tess Holliday did when Piers Morgan went for her on Twitter.The environmental message was also conveyed, in no uncertain terms, as the seas warmed, glaciers melted and an albatross chick almost got blown to buggery.Then,  minutes into the show, we were suddenly back on South Georgia, with Rolf the seasick cameraman, who was in front of the lens this time and so overcome by the fate of the penguins, and the future of the planet, he began sobbing like Rylan Clark-Neal just after Nicole Scherzinger had put him through to live shows.All the most pointless, virtue-signalling extinction rebels in the country were probably joining in with this gesture as well, even though it’s a moot point as to how close we are exactly to environmental Armageddon.What you can say with a little more certainty, though, is that the moment it starts trying to turn a David Attenborough documentary into an X Factor sob story it’s probably the beginning of the end for the BBC.THE Last Leg, Adam Hills: “Out of ­interest, what would we all dothis ­fabulous industry we’re in fell through for us and we had to go and find a job ”Have you ever considered comedy X Factor: Celebrity, Jenny Ryan: “It’s time for me to share what I’ve got with the world.”Jonathan Ross: “He’s the host of the very funny Mash Report.

In post-Brexit Britain, the key swing voter is “Workington Man” — a typically white man over  who didn’t go to university and voted to Leave.Until recently he was dyed-in-the-wool Labour. Corbyn’s neglect of the working class means he might, for the first time, vote Tory.To win him round, the Conservatives must promise more than the economic freedoms and tax giveaways they are known for.They need to offer protection from a modern world in which liberalising economic policies, globalisation and immigration have undermined work, wages and community.Nearly three in four voters think it has become harder for people like them to make a decent living, so any manesto worth its salt will put ending low pay and insecure work at its heart.For the half of school leavers who lag behind without degrees, the Conservatives should ert funding from low quality university degrees towards technical education.The Tories also need to reassess their long-held devotion to tax cuts. While the cost of living is a problem, the level of taxation doesn’t seem to be.Two thirds of people want investment in the NHS, schools and social care rather than income tax cuts. This may be because households are squeezed more by rent, commuting and childcare than taxes.But people simply don’t believe politicians any more when they offer tax cuts. Instead, the Brexit idend should be focused on improving AEs and classrooms.Building local nurseries, bringing empty and foreign-owned homes into use, and boosting family budgets will win votes.Most of all, the Conservatives need to restore a greater sense of belonging.Think of your own town — the high street is probably in disrepair, libraries and buses have gone, pubs and post offices are closing. Crime is everyone’s concern. The social fabric is fraying and people feel it.New funding for high streets and towns is a start, but why not help communities take over post offices, pubs and football clubs when they go out of business, as we do for schools, or introduce a national civic service for school leavers Labour’s abiding strength is the basic sense that their politics is about looking out for others.But Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour cares more about ending control of immigration and re-running the  referendum than protecting working people.This is the only way he can reach into Labour’s heartlands to win seats like Wigan, Dewsbury and Workington, places that seek security and community over freedom and inidualism.Workington has never ed a Conservative MP in a general election.

Let’s hope history doesn’t repeat itself.For the past three years, our useless political class has pulled every trick to try to stop Brexit. PM Boris Johnson, desperate to end the gridlock, has now shamed these democracy-blockers into holding a general election. It’s a risky move.The electoral system is skewed against the Conservatives. Butopinion polls are right — andBoris can inspire ­voters with his optimism and brio — Brexit really might be unblocked by Christmas. At last!Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, after weeks of political constipation, took a dose of prune juice yesterday and, amazingly, reached a decision. Did you see his face afterwards  Pure relief. He hadn’t been that happy for months.Finally he had seen off the shroud-waving, do-nothing, block-everything Blairite Remainers in his parliamentary party — among them his ­deputy, Tom Watson.They had wanted to keep commie Corbyn swinging in the wind for a few more months. They were still ­moaning last night that he had blown this anti-Brexit ­Parliament’s last chance of securing a second referendum.Corbyn’s repeated refusals to go to the country were making him look like a politician who was scared of the people. Reaction on the doorsteps to his indecision was terrible. No wonder he finally caved.Butthe Labour leader ­yesterday seemed liberated, there were plenty on his ­Commons benches who were aghast at the idea of an ­election in December.“It’ll be too dark!” they wailed. “It’ll be too cold! People will be too busy preparing for Christmas! The students won’t be at university any more!”Too dark and too cold  Does that mean we should only ever have general elections in high summer It was even put about that Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill had advised Boris against calling a mid- December election because church halls would have been booked for school nativity plays.Now I’m as soft as any ­doting dad about kiddies dressing up to play Joseph and Mary but sorry, a general ­election to free our country from this Brexit impasse really might be more important.Why were some MPs so ­miserable yesterday  Most obviously, it was because lots of them think they’ll lose their seats. Anyone with a majority of fewer than , will ­probably be feeling twitchy, particularlyhe or she spent the last three years resisting the ­public’s will on Brexit.Money was another factor. Fighting an election is ­expensive for MPs. They not only lose their Westminster income once ­Parliament is dissolvedbut they also have to dig into their pockets for expenses and ­election costs.All those leaflets, all that petrol and shoe leather, all those late-night takeaways with volunteers — the sums soon add up. A Tory MP once told me that an election campaign cost him £,.But Parliament needs rebooting. At the  election, both Labour and the Conservatives promised to respect the Leave vote — and they duly won most of the seats.But Labour broke that ­promise, as the antics of ­Corbyn, Keir Starmer, Hilary Benn and Co showed. Leave voters in Labour seats are less likely to be fooled a second time.The one unknown in the election will be Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party. Could it yet lose the election for Boris by taking votes away from the pro-Brexit Tories  What an own goal that would be.Ben Bradshaw, arch- Remainer Labour MP for Exeter, called yesterday’s ­election moves “outrageous”. We were at a “critical juncture for our country”. He plainly thought that only MPs should have a say.Keep the unwashed voters where they belong, eh, Ben  Barry Sheerman, another Remainer Labour MP, professed himself “puzzled and deeply disappointed” by Corbyn’s support for an election.Sheerman feared “the elderly” would not be able to get to polling stations on a December day. Mr Sheerman himself is . If we all took his patronising attitude, we might ask how the old dearie manages to totter down to Westminster from his Huddersfield constituency every week.At such an advanced age, how does Barry remember to tie his laces, let alone make his terrible speeches in the Commons  But no one does ask that, thank goodness, because we do not treat older people like ­simpletons.On Monday Labour MP Seema Malhotra fretted about students losing their right to vote in a December election because they might have ended their college terms by then and have moved back home.  She called this “voter ­suppression”.Oh come off it. She and her Remainer mates were the only ones trying to “suppress” voters — by trying to prevent a ­clearout of this rotten House of Commons.Former Labour MP John Mann shouted: “It’d solve you — you’d lose your seat.” And not just Soubry. Lots of these anti-democrats are now at the mercy of the real bosses of British politics — the voters.I think we’ll just about ­manage to get to the polling station, don’t you Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their “people’s vote” would be history.Boris will then pump billions into our police, schools and NHS and keep taxes low enough to carry on creating jobs, as the Tories have since .Corbyn is the least popular political leader in UK history. A dangerous fool loathed even by many Labour MPs.Some have repeatedly denounced him as an anti-Jewish racist, yet they will now knock on doors urging voters to put him in Downing Street. Their “principles” were always a pose.As things stand Corbyn is only likely to win power with the connivance of the Lib Dems and SNP.Which means both a second Brexit referendum — unless they simply order him to revoke Article  — and a second Scottish independence referendum. A Corbyn era would guarantee horric ision for years.That’s before you consider the economic meltdown inevitable in installing a Marxist in Downing Street — impacting everyone’s job, home, savings and pension.Or the chilling threat to ­national security of a hard-left anti-nuclear pacist who considers Britain’s terrorist enemies his “friends”.That’s why Labour tried in vain today to secure votes for children and EU citizens. But polls don’t tell the whole story.Each seat will be split on Leave Remain lines as well as Tory Labour Lib Dem. Those the Tories could lose are easier to pinpoint than the dozens of new ones they must win.Nigel Farage has a huge decision. Only a Boris majority will deliver Brexit. The Brexit Party can be a help or a hindrance. If Boris loses, Brexit is lost too.He has no majority to fend them off or to govern. Parliament is beyond repair.

I understand what I voted for and we’re being patronised by Corbyn and the Lib Dems.

It should’ve happened by now and Johnson is the only one with the will to get that done.”Hotelier Grant Payne, , said: “Labour are not as as strong as they used to be.

But something even more important is at stake.Do we want to continue to live with the free-market economy that has given us wealth unimaginable a century ago  Or do we want to be sucked backwards into the failed socialist experiment that impoverished Eastern Europe in the second half of the th century and has laid waste to Venezuela Labour has yet to produce the radical manesto Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell promised yesterday but we already know there is going to be a hike in income tax for those earning over £, a year — and probably a swingeing wealth tax, given McDonnell’s past enthusiasm for the idea.McDonnell, too, has said he would expropriate ten per cent of the shares of every British company and put them in a fund supposedly for the benefit of the workers — although when you read the small print, workers would receive a maximum of £ in idends per year, with the rest going straight into the Government’s coffers.That measly £ would do little to compensate for the collapse in value of pension funds as Labour nationalised water and electricity companies at below the market value of their shares.Many of those shares are owned by funds on which you and I rely for our retirement.The Shadow Chancellor promises that under Labour, we will only have to work a four-day, -hour week, apparently with no cut in pay. We might as well put Alice In Wonderland in charge of the economy. His sums simply don’t add up.McDonnell says he will increase the National Living Wage to £ an hour. Butlow-paid workers were stopped from working  hours a week rather than the current average of , it would mean a substantial cut in pay for millions of people.That Theresa May was unable to win an outright majority against Jeremy Corbyn and his extreme economic policies in  is as astonishing in retrospect as it was at the time. What was meant to be a coronation nearly turned into a wake. Many Conservatives fear the polls could turn sharply again.But there is scant sign Boris Johnson will repeat Mrs May’s abysmal campaign. His three months in office have brought a change in the weather. We have a Prime Minister who exudes optimism rather than a sense of defeat.While May seemed almost embarrassed to be a Conservative and tried to out-do Labour for proposing the most unappealing tax rise — the “dementia tax” — Johnson has made the case for capitalism and conservatism.The first of those, he rightly points out, pays for the public services we all value so much.He has promised to rebuild hospitals and reverse the cuts in police numbers that took place on Mrs May’s watch.He knows the way to improve the lot of people on low incomes is not to boost benefits but to increase earnings through a higher ­National Living Wage.But he also recognises middle-income groups have suffered disproportionately from the tax system in recent years and has proposed raising the threshold for the  per cent tax rate.While Corbyn and McDonnell would undermine livelihoods by cutting working hours, Johnson’s Tories will encourage us to work and to invest — in our homes, in pensions and savings. Rather than threaten businesses with confiscating shares, he promises better infrastructure, especially broadband.Boris doesn’t just want to get Brexit done, as Remainer Mrs May did.He wants to turn it to Britain’s advantage, opening our economy to the world beyond the EU, with new trade deals to bring in investment.While Mrs May created a hostile environment for migrants, Johnson has indicated a more welcoming attitude towards those who want to come to Britain to work.But more than that, it is a battle between enterprise and overbearing State control, between having the freedom to invest for your future and having your assets confiscated, between the opportunity to work and having your working hours laid down by the Government.It is a cliche to say we face the most important election in decades.

I only became part of it because Banksy catapulted the movement into the stratosphere.It was a ride - however, Im glad Im out of it and about to enter the next ride.The technique uses statistical analysis used in police work to locate repeat offenders.The researchers looked for signs of correlation between  artworks in London and Bristol that have been attributed to Bansky, finding stylistic similarities between the two.D – Robert Del NajaDrum and bass star Goldie is thought to have revealed Banksy’s identity as the Massive Attack star known as D in an interview in .The band’s founding member and Goldie have been friends for a long time and were both graffiti artists in the late s.In an interview with spoken word poet Scroobius Pip for a podcast Del Naja said: Give me a bubble letter and put it on a t-shirt and write Banksy on it and were sorted. We can sell it now.No disrespect to Robert, I think he is a brilliant artist. I think he has flipped the world of art over.Journalist Craig Williams had previously carried out an investigation into Banksy and concluded that Banksy was not just one person but a team of street artists with Del Naja, , as the ringleader.Del Naja has occasionally designed the artwork for Massive Attack’s albums, including ’s Heligoland which featured stencil art not dissimilar to Banksy’s style.Del Naja though as denied the rumour saying it was “greatly exaggerated”.Richard PfeferThe New York spraypainter Pfefer was spotted in front of a mural done by Banksy in March  and was accused of being the famous artist by the cops.Thierry GuettaThe French graffiti artist living in Los Angeles, who is also known as Mr Brainwash, is seen in Banksys documentary Exit Through the Gt Shop.The film tells the story of Guetta and his obsession with documenting his le on film.Some though think Guetta and Banksy are the same person.The notion it is Guetta springs from the idea that the hapless artist was only feigning mediocrity in the film and it was really Banksy hiding in plain sight.Graffiti artist in AustraliaYouTube user Mia S claimed she had caught Banksy in the act after believing she had filmed the artist in Melbourne, Australia.The footage shows a bespectacled man in jeans, a dark jacket, hoodie and a cap.She approaches the graffiti artist before he tells her to “f**k off” and flees the scene.Lazarides worked with Banksy during his formative years, and many of his photos have never been seen before.The -page book, Banksy Captured, will reveal images from more than a decade of creativity and subversion, and Lazarides will offer limited-edition prints of his work at affordable prices in a bid to open art to a broader economic audience.Lazarides hails from Banksys reputed home town of Bristol, and was commissioned to create the artists portrait in , starting their partnership.He worked as his agent, photographer, driver, and gallerist.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So in this election they’ll fight harder and dirtier than ever before.”The leftie boss failed to declare whether all of his shadow cabinet would make it into Governmenthe won the election - words which alarm people like Tom Watson and Emily Thornberry who have been critical of the leaderships position.Mr Corbyn was askedhe would stay in posthe lost the election, but he didnt answer.The leftie boss did say: I love doing this job, I love meeting people.I will be so proud to lead a Labour government.Speaker Bercow will leave his role today after ten years in the role.Remainer MPs will miss him dearly for allowing MPs to repeatedly scupper the Governments Brexit plans.But Brexiteers will be all too happy to see the back of him.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mr Corbyn also denied he would make any pacts with other parties to get into power.Hours earlier, Shadow Transport Secretary Andy McDonald said Labour “will not stand in the way” of another vote.Tory Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said: “The election has barely begun and Jeremy Corbyn is already flirting with the SNP — bowing to their attempts to break up Britain in exchange for their support.“Labour only offer the British people more of the arguing, delay and indecision that has plagued the last three years. Two further referendums on Brexit and Scottish independence will do nothing to bring Britain back together.”As she also hit the campaign trail, Ms Sturgeon said: “It’s the most important election Scotland has had for decades, it will determine the future direction of our country for a long time to come.”Meanwhile, Remainers began plotting to convince voters to think tactically in an all-out drive to boot Boris Johnson out of No.Its analysis suggests Mr Johnson will storm to a -seat majority without tactical voting.But,just  per cent of Remain backers switch allegiance, it will swing the election and could hand Remainer parties a majority, it reveals.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Commons Standards Committee said the -year-old showed disregard for the law by expressing willingness to buy cocaine in a rendezvous with two sex workers who he told: We need to get this party started.Yet there are fears todayaposs vote by MPs could see Mr Vaz suspended for just three days - because the punishment will lapse when Parliament is dissolved next week.That means in theory Mr Vaz could try to stand again as a Labour candidate - and then be ed to Parliament again in December.Shadow Home Secretary Ms Abbott told the BBC today: I’ve known Keith for a very long time.    I think he should consider his position and I think he himself should agree not to be a candidate. I think it’s been a very sad issue not just for him but for his family and his children. Askedhe would have the Labour whip suspended she replied: “Not yet - but I think Keith should consider his position.” The pair made history together in  when they were among the first ethnic minority MPs to enter Parliament. But Mr Vaz - who was exposed by the Sunday Mirror - now faces being barred as a candidate for Leicester Easthe is turned down by Labouraposs ruling National Executive Committee. His intentions are unclear - he has not commented in person since the damning report was released and was admitted to hospital this week.    Standards Committee chair Kate Green MP spoke out yesterday urging MPs to re-establish Vazaposs suspension as soon as the Commons s -he is re-elected.She told Tory Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg : The Committee is strongly of  the view that Mr Vaz,he continues to be a Member, should serve the full period of the six month suspension. While it is, of course, a constitutional axiom that one Parliament cannot bind its successor, they hope that whoever is Leader of the House following a General Election will take the earliest  opportunity to bring any  necessary motion  before the House to enable the full period of suspension to be served.They do not believe it would be necessary to await the re-appointment of the Committee on Standards before this can happen. The Committee’s views on both these matters were unanimous. MPs ruled his behaviour was a very serious breach of the Code of Conduct - which says members must not damage the reputation and integrity of the Commons. The Committee savaged him for failing repeatedly to answer questions and trying to obstruct the probe.And MPs dismissed his claim a transcript and recording supplied by the Sunday Mirror were unreliable after asking for a forensic analysis. Mr Vaz told investigators he did not pay for sex and the men were there to discuss “decorating his flat”. And he claimed he lost his memory after drinking a glass of “spiked” water. But the scathing Commons Standards Committee report branded his ­explanations “frankly, ludicrous”. If agreed, the ban would usually trigger a recall petition against the shamed MP - which would allow voters to force a by-election booting him out of office. But the election has interrupted the usual timetable.

After two years of Parliamentary battles and a souring of politics, more than  MPs have decided not to stand again. Some - like longest-serving MP Ken Clarke and Sir Winston Churchillaposs grandson Nicholas Soames - are retiring after decades of service. But others have decided the venom and anger around Brexit are making them want to call it a day. Those include ex-Tory, ex-Change UK Lib Dem Heidi Allen - who says public le has been utterly dehumanising. And key Tory Remainers like Amber Rudd and Nicky Morgan led an exodus of prominent female MPs complaining about abuse. Meanwhile Speaker John Bercow is finally bowing out after nearly a decade and , ORDERs in the grand chair in the House of Commons. Hereaposs the full list of MPs whoaposve announced they are standing down so far.  When people talk about “Tory Big Beasts”, the image they have in their head is -year-old Ken Clarke. The Rushclfe MP holds the title of ‘father of the house’ - which means he’s the longest serving MP, having been sworn in a few minutes earlier than Labour ’s Dennis Skinner. And he’s been a cabinet minister under three successive Tory Prime Ministers - Education Secretary under Margaret Thatcher, Home Secretary and Chancellor under John Major and Justice Secretary under David Cameron. In fact, he was one of only five ministers to serve throughout the whole of the  years of Tory governments led by Thatcher and Major. He’s socially and economically liberal, and has been president of the Tory Reform Group since . And he’s perhaps been the Conservative Party’s proudest and most prominent pro-European voices for several decades. He had the Tory whip removed weeks before finally standing down for voting to block a no-deal Brexit. John Bercow  Commons Speaker John Bercow announced in September that he would stand down. He developed a reputation for standing up for MPsapos rights against the government - granting more emergency debates and urgent questions in the Commons. But he later faced fierce criticism from Brexiteers, who questioned his impartiality on the issue of Europe. The ex-Tory MP succeeded the late Michael Martin as Speaker in . Amber Rudd  Ms Ruddaposs departure means the House of Commons will lose one of its most prominent anti-hard-Brexit MPs. She resigned as DWP Secretary in solidarity with  Tories who lost the whip in September. Yet she also had changed her position in the past, moving from vowing to block a no-deal Brexit to saying it would have to be left open as an option. Born in London in , she was the fourth child of stockbroker Tony Rudd and magistrate Ethne Fitzgerald. She went to Cheltenham Ladiesapos College and Queenaposs College in London before reading History at Edinburgh University. She married the writer A.A. Gill and the couple had two children together in the s but later orced. Gill, who died in , referred to Rudd as aposthe Silver Spoonapos in his reviews and she was an aristocracy advisor to Four Weddings And A Funeral. Ms Rudd was forced to resign as Home Secretary over the Windrush scandal after she misled MPs by denying removal targets existed. An internal inquiry later found she was not given full information herself. Her brother Roland Rudd runs the Peopleaposs Vote campaign - where he is embroiled in a furious row with his own staff over a botched bid to oust senior staff.  Boris Johnsonaposs younger brother suggested the PM was failing the national interest as he announced heaposd quit in September. The Orpington MP said he had been torn between family loyalty and the national interest but that it was time for othersto take on his role. The Universities and Science minister had previously quit the government when Theresa May as PM over her handling of Brexit. Remainer Jo Johnson added that it had been an honour to serve his constituents since . Sir Nicholas Soames  Sir Nicholas Soames is an important talisman in Conservative circles as the grandson of Sir Winston Churchill - but lost the whip last month when he decided to block no-deal Brexit. The -year-old MP for Mid Sussex claimed a no-deal Brexit would be the most serious crisis Britain has faced since the Second World War. The a staunch pro-European who was a minister under John Major, also claimed Margaret Thatcher would not have taken the UK out of the EU. Confirming his decision he said: I will be voting against the government with a very heavy heart. But he was later spotted grinning during his final vote after  years - to trigger an election hours after having the whip restored by Boris Johnson.  The MP rose to prominence when he took on Jeremy Corbyn for the Labour leadership following the EU referendum in . His ill-fated campaign failed to dislodge Corbyn, though he did finish with more than % of membersapos votes. The MP of nine years later worked in Jeremy Corbynaposs Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary while Stormont was collapsed. Heidi Allen  Lib Dem Heidi Allen will quit as an MP at the next General Election , blaming the nastiness of British politics. The former Tory MP and Change UK leader switched parties more than faced elections after she initially became dissatisfied with the Conservatives over welfare cuts. She said she was heartbroken by the decision, but had become exhausted from being shouted at in the street and sworn at on social media. In a letter to her constituents in South Cambridgeshire, she wrote: I am exhausted by the invasion into my privacy and the nastiness and intimidation that has become commonplace. Nobody in any job should have to put up with threats, aggressive emails, being shouted at in the street, sworn at on social media, nor have to install panic alarms at home. Vince Cable  The former Lib Dem leader Vince Cable has been one of the partyaposs most controversial figures. A key figure in the Coalition, where he was Business Secretary, lost his Twickenham seat in  - before ing to Parliament in  and taking on the job of leading his part. A one-time Labour Party member and ex-economics lecturer, Sir Vince appeared on the Christmas edition of BBC Oneaposs Strictly Come Dancing in . Sir Vince, , was replaced by East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson and warned there would be battles about Brexit to come When he became leader in , he was the oldest person to be appointed head of a major party since Winston Churchill. A grandfather, he is married and has three children.  Full list of MPs standing down Speaker John Bercow : “It is with a heavy heart that I step down as MP for this great constituency”. Tories    Nicky Morgan : The abuse for doing the job of a modern MP can only be justied , ultimately, parliament does what it is supposed to do - represent those we serve in all areas of policy, respect votes cast by the electorate and make decisions in the overall national interest. Mark Field : “The current speculation that a General Election may be imminent has forced me to make the very dficult decision not to offer myself as your candidate for the next election”.

Mark Prisk : “This has been a dficult decision, but I have always believed thatyou seek election it must be wholehearted and that you should be committed to serve a whole five-year parliament. I cannot make that commitment”. Michael Fallon : “Sadly I have decided that this parliament will be my last. I have served as an MP, for both Darlington and Sevenoaks, for more than  years - quite long enough.” Caroline Spelman : “Myself, my family and my staff have borne an enormous brunt of abuse and I think quite frankly we’ve had enough”. Seema Kennedy : “I have decided not to stand as a candidate for the next general election.It is now time for me to focus on other priorities in my le”.

Peter Heaton-Jones : “This is a purely personal decision. It is based on several factors, including a signicant change in my family circumstances since my re-election in . In addition, this has been one of the most intense periods in recent political history, and I think it is telling that a relatively high number of MPs are deciding to stand down now.” David Lidington : “Politics imposes a heavy cost on family and private le.” Alan Duncan : Confirmed he’d be standing down after the election was called. Independent former Tories   Amber Rudd : “I’m not finished with politics, I’m just not standing at this election”. Oliver Letwin : His office confirmed his intention to stand down from the Commons at the next election. Guto Bebb : “Iaposm not quite sure why the Conservative Party have decided to become a type of populist English nationalist party and that might work for one election. I donapost feel any affinity to that.” Justine Greening : “It is very clear to me that my concerns about the Conservative Party becoming the Brexit party in effect have come to pass.” Ken Clarke : “Youaposve got to hold yourself out as being able to do five more years and do the job properly.” Nick Boles : “It will be time for somebody … I’ll go and do one other thing - God knows what.” Rory Stewart : “I’m now coming to the very end of my time in Parliament”. Labour    Owen Smith : “The truth is that Brexit is not compatible with my values.

I feel that it’s time, at my age, that I was put out to grass.” Jim Fitzpatrick : “Labour HQ askedI’ll stand again, here is my official response. In the event of a snap election a volunteer parachutist may be neededno time for full selection procedures to represent the great seat of Poplar and Limehouse!!” Kate Hoey : “Now that the national Labour party has started the process for the  election I have decided that after  years as the MP for Vauxhall I will not seek re-election as a Labour candidate.” Roberta Blackman-Woods : “I am afraid it is just time for me to stand down for a whole host of largely personal reasons.” Gloria De Piero : I question whether I can give you the commitment you deserve for what could be a further eight years. Paul Farrelly : I also still have a young family to support, and it would not be fair on them, really, to carry on beyond the next election, with all the stresses and strains that go with the job of being a dutul member of parliament.” John Mann- resigned as an MP before election was called to take up seat in the House of Lords: The power of the Prime Minister, Speaker and the whips will all need to be reconsideredour democracy is to properly . I am not holding my breath at such maturity. Ann Clwyd : It has been a great honour to represent the people of the Cynon Valley for so long. I am very grateful for the support for both me and the Labour Party. I will continue to fight for the Labour Party at the next general election - whenever it comes. Ian Lucas : I am  next year. I have been an MP since I was . I think the time is right for me to choose to follow a dferent path in the years to come.” Kevin Barron : “I am pretty sure that I will be the last Yorkshire miner as an MP, although politics can at times be challenging it is the greatest way of giving a voice to the voiceless.” Geoffrey Robinson : “There is nothing more important or rewarding than helping people, however I need to be fully fit to be able to undertake the job properly.” Stephen PoundEaling Labour tweeted: “Ealing Labour would like to thank him for the tremendous service given to our community, and many within the community will miss him greatly.  Sending you the warmest wishes for the future Steve.” Adrian Bailey : My head said that I would be committing myself to work until I was nearly eighty years old and that, whilst I am very fit both mentally and physically, a younger person, more attuned and comfortable with political campaigning in a social media age would be better placed to promote Labour’s policies and values in the next Parliament. Consequently, I have decided that I no longer wish to be considered for re-election. Albert Owen : Being an MP is an intense full-time job. My decision not to seek re-election is for personal reasons, I simply want to do other things and spend more quality time with my family.

But I will be  in February and I think it’s time to step away. It has been a real privilege to serve my community in these past nine years.” Lib Dem    Heidi Allen : “Nobody in any job should have to put up with threats, aggressive emails, being shouted at in the street, sworn at on social media, nor have to install panic alarms at home. Of course public scrutiny is to be expected, but lines are all too often regularly crossed and the effect is utterly dehumanising. Norman Lamb : “I think we are in a very sad and disturbing place in our politics.” Vince Cable : “I would not be able to commit to a five year term from now until possibly  .” The Independent Group for Change Joan Ryan : “When I stood in  I always intended to serve only one more term in Parliament.” Ann Coffey : After a lot of consideration I have decided not to stand for election again.

And he took on Boris Johnsonaposs claim that it is his fault Brexit did not happen as planned at pm tonight. Mr Corbyn said: He said he’d rather be dead in a ditch than delay beyond today. But he has failed and that failure is his alone. You can’t trust the word - after three long years of Brexit ision and failure from the Tories, we have to get this issue sorted out.  Quizzed by the Mirror, Mr Corbyn did not directly say whether he would stay the full five years in the jobhe wins and is made Prime Minister.

He also would not rule out a Cabinet reshuffle which could move key aides such as Emily Thornberry and Tom Watson from their current roles. Meanwhile he gave an impassioned defence of his Islington constituency saying it did not make him a part of the London elite. He said: “My constituency, like every other constituency in the country, has people who are totally up against it”. He added: I have been proud to represent the constituency all these years and I will carry on doing that. “Whatever position I’ve ever held, I’ve always worked flat out to represent the people who have elected me in the first place.”  Labouraposs leader audaciously claimed he can negotiate a fresh Brexit deal with the EU, including a full customs union, single market alignment and protections for workersapos rights, and put it to a referendum by June . Labour will get Brexit sorted within six months, he said.We’ll let the people decide whether to leave on a sensible deal or remain. That really isn’t that complicated! And we, a Labour government, will carry out whatever the people decide so we can then get on with delivering the real change Britain needs after years of Conservative cuts to vital services and tax handouts to the richest. Labour is determined to bring a ided country together, while the Tories and the Lib Dems only seek to ide us further.

Labour members cheered the party leaderaposs pledge to scrap Universal Credit - though itaposs understood that change wouldnapost be immediate.What would happen immediately, though, is a £ wage for all. Mr Corbyn promised a £ an hour minimum wage “right away” including for young voters from the age of .  He pledged “end to the disgrace and indignity of rough sleeping in every city in this country” and offer “ hours free childcare for all two to four year olds - all children”, asking: Is that too much to ask  Panto-style, Labour members replied: No! He repeated pledges to nationalise rail, mail and water firms, give free personal care to the elderly and take real action on the climate.  And he named and shamed tycoons benefiting from Britainaposs corrupt system, singling out media tycoon Rupert Murdoch and SportsDirect boss Mike Ashley.

There is always a certain amount of churn at every election. What is dferent on this occasion is  the number of women MPs leaving and the number of moderate Tories  who have decided to quit. The departure of MPs such as Amber Rudd, Justine Greening and Nicky Morgan marks the end of the David Cameron modernisation project and  is further evidence of how the  Conservatives are being recast as the party of the libertarian right. Boris Johnson may claim he represents traditional One Nation Toryism but the cast list of candidates tells a dferent story. This is of lesser concern than the large number of women, in all parties, who have decided to stand down. In her letter announcing she was standing down  Nicky Morgan cited the impact on her family of the abuse  she receives. She is not alone. Women MPs are far more likely to be victims of hatred and abuse, including death threats. ITV’s Paul Brand told last night how one female MP received , abusive messages in a single week. This is why there was such fury when  Boris Johnson recently dismissed as humbug  the genuine concerns of Labour’s Paula Sherrf about her safety and that of her colleagues. It is also why MPs take exception when the Conservatives and their cheerleaders in the right-wing press persist in slurring Parliament and its politicians as “rotten” and “anti democratic”. These insults feed the toxic culture of hate and gives licence to the trolls and thugs behind the abuse and intimidation. If the Conservative leadership runs a people versus parliament election campaign they will only exacerbate this nasty environment, potentially putting lives at risk and driving more women away from politics.Jeremy Corbyn kicks off Labour’s campaign with a speech aimed more at rallying the troops than winning over converts.

Tom and Victoria Browne, from St Austell in Cornwall, opted for the feast, saying we just donapost do anything traditionally. Victoria, , called up Dominoaposs to find out what they could get for their budget, and the answer was quite a lot, Cornwall Live reports . The mum-of-three said: “Most people know me and Tom just don’t do anything originally. I didn’t want traditional sandwiches or anything at the wedding, I wanted something that stood out.  “We actually kept joking saying ‘shall we have Dominoaposs ’ but as it got closer and we didn’t have any food plans we started seriously considering it and I emailed Dominoaposs asking the question.” To her delight, the restaurant replied saying that it could cater their wedding, but that catering a wedding would be a first for the local branch. “I was so paranoid about whether they were actually going to be able to do it that I went in the day before and said ‘are you are all aware of my order for tomorrow ’” she said. On the big day itself, Victoria and her -year-old husband said that staff came “strolling in and shocked everybody.” They said the food was delivered piping hot as staff laid out the whopping  large pizza boxes,  garlic breads,  boxes of chicken strips and  boxes of wedges accompanied with copious amounts of the obligatory garlic and herb dip.  She said: “They were pretty good. It all came in piping hot and the staff were quite happy to stand and have a photo with me. People are still gob smacked with it, people think that as a buffet you have to have like sandwiches and stuff and I don’t really like pasties and I’m not picking them because everyone  likes them.” The couple said that when they first told people about their plans, that guests were a little sceptical. Victoria said that friends and family were certain in the run up to the wedding that she was just winding them up. She says that even her hairdresser on the day was still questioning whether they were actually going to be offering pizza in place of a traditional wedding breakfast. But the couple said that all doubt was quickly withdrawn when the smell of fresh pizza and garlic bread filled their wedding venue.

The Radfords first found fame in  when their lives were the focus of a Channel  documentary called  Kids and Counting.Baby  Bonnie was the last addition to the brood in November bringing the number of children to a whopping .She arrived after a swt  minute labour weighing lb oz - and the couple, who have been having children for three decades, vowed she would be their last and had completed their family. They live with the majority of their kids in a -bed, four-storey Victorian property, which was a former care home, which they bought almost  years ago.    Sue and Noel run their own pie business and do not claim extra state benefits. Some of the oldest offspring have since moved out and started families of their own with Sue and Noel being grandparents to four. The Radford children are: Chris, , Sophie, , Chloe, , Jack, , Daniel, , Luke, , Millie, , Katie, , James, , Ellie, , Aimee, , Josh, , Max, , Tillie, eight, Oscar, seven, Casper, six, Hallie, four, Phoebe, three, and Archie, two, and Bonnie,  months. Their son Alfie was stillborn in . Bonnie had the same due date as Alfie. After Archie was born, the couple said it was strange knowing he would be their last.    And when the entire family appeared on ITVaposs This Morning in January , Sue said: Archie is definitely going to be the last Radford baby. But eldest daughter Sophie, who has three kids herself, shook her head and claimed she canapost see her mum stopping - and she wasnapost wrong as months later Sue fell pregnant with Bonnie. Childhood sweethearts Sue and Noelaposs first child, Chris, was born when Sue was aged just . The parents were both given up for adoption after they were born, and they decided to keep Chris and raise him as teenage parents.

I knew I was too old to be afraid of the dark, but I hated climbing the stairs of my childhood home in Harrogate, North Yorks. Why  Because I often felt the presence of a ghost. It was just there, watching, and it made my whole body tingle with fear. But I didn’t just sense it – I could see it too. I remember being seven years old and walking out of my bedroom into the hall. A dark cloud breezed past the doorway and down the stairs, before vanishing. “Hello,” I shouted down the dark stairwell. My voice echoed into the empty space, I was alone on the top-floor landing. However, I wasn’t alone in the Edwardian terraced house. I didn’t mention it to my parents or my three older sisters. In fact, we never talked about the spooky goings-on.    My parents were more concerned about making their BB a success – and a ghost wasn’t good for business. However, our resident ghoul certainly scared a few of our guests. One man came down to breakfast ashen-faced. “I woke up in the middle of the night and felt someone sitting on the bed,” he ­stuttered. “When I turned on the light there was an indent in the covers. Do you have a ghost ” Mum and Dad tried to laugh it off. I was brought up Catholic and went to church every week, so talking about the dead didn’t feel right. But my religious upbringing didn’t stop me from having these eerie experiences. I remember lying in bed one night on the top floor when I felt the ghost a few feet away. I pulled the covers over my head and whispered the Lord’s Prayer.    I sensed the presence leave, but then I heard an almighty crash in the bathroom across the hall. I was too scared to investigate but in the morning I found my father’s heavy glass ashtray on the floor, unbroken. Had the ghost thrown the ashtray  I don’t know, but my young mind thought it had. While I like to think the ghost didn’t wish me harm, one incident suggests otherwise. I was in the shower room with my sister Susan when suddenly she screamed. The shower room was covered in mirrored tiles and a ceiling tile fell down right above me. Just in time, Susan pushed me out of the way and the jagged glass cut her arm. I shudder to think what might have happenedshe hadn’t been there.

Have you seen a ghost or stayed at a haunted hotel  Contact webnews@trinitymirror  Rain battered the old th Century coaching inn aswas given exclusive access to brave the spectres. Scenes from The Shining flashed across our minds as a ghoulish figure seemed to float down a narrow hallway. Indeed, legend has it ghosts of two children thought to have died in a fire here roam the eerie corridors and rooms. We have a lady who wonapost stay in room two. She said she felt someone touch her in the night or felt something happen in the night. She wonapost stay there now. She still stays with us, she stays every week but she wonapost stay in room two. There have been quite a few incidents told to us by ious residents, about two specic rooms room two and room ,landlord Grant Beechey, , exclusively told .  Temperatures suddenly seemed to plummet in room , a tapping unsettled us and a creaking groaned during our stay. Downstairs, the hotel bar and restaurant bustled with regulars, some of whom had ed to brave the ghosts. Mr Beechey, a dad originally from Tooting, south London, added: These guests come back regularly, come back regularly to stay in that room. Whatever it is that is there brings them back time and time again. Room , which is the one most people come back to, is in the oldest part of the building.  We have people who come and stay in room  and the story Iaposve heard from people most often is about a poltergeist, a moving scenario where things appear, donapost appear, get moved and that type of thing. There was some evidence of spirits or other-worldly beings during our stay. A light flickered in room . The cameraaposs exposure skewed. Demons meddled in the system and the camera which had just shot scenes of full detail, fine colour and shadow had maled suddenly. Ghosts, it is said, can cause magnetism and haywire.  As dark clouds continued to gather, regulars told us theyaposd experienced a feeling of being watched, objects moving and other creepy phenomena here. Mr Beecheyaposs staff told him theyaposve been spooked. The manager said: I had a report from one of our chefs who was here on a short-term basis that heaposd felt he wasnapost alone in the kitchen when he was certainly alone.  He wasnapost disturbed by it but he had that feeling he wasnapost alone, and there was something going on. He just said he thought there was someone there with him. Certainly some of the corridors in the older part of the hotel have a look and feel about them. The building, now a Greene King establishment, mixes traditional and modern decor. Corridors, appearing to slant and tilt, guide visitors - welcome and unwelcome - to the  bedrooms.  Itaposs perhaps of little surprise to find the spooky little hotel in such an eerie little town. Coggeshall, on an ancient Roman road, is full of curious buildings associated with quirky tales. Monks held meetings in a secret room and danced in gardens, according to legend. And a coven allegedly used to meet at Marks Hall and take part in bizarre rituals, involving young women tied to trees. The ghost of a th century woodcutter called Robin roams the town, some say. Robin is said to have carved an image called the Angel of the Christmas Mysteries - but the statue was allegedly hidden and has never been found. Yet some believe blows of Robinaposs axe can still be heard near a brook which trickles through Coggeshall.

It is the largest underwater operation launched by a Russian leader since the end of the Cold War. Norway’s intelligence service is trying to track its progress with increased surveillance flights. Norwegian sources believe Russia’s aim is for the fleet to penetrate as far as possible into the North Atlantic without detection by NATO, sailing submerged north of Scotland through the Greenland-Iceland-UK gap.  The flotilla raises challenges for NATO and threatens its maritime re-enforcement and re-supply lines across the Atlantic. It comes as Russia’s most advanced new nuclear-powered submarine test-launched its first Bulava intercontinental ballistic missile, hitting a target thousands of miles away. The launch was conducted in the White Sea off Russia’s north west, with a dummy payload reaching a test site in the far eastern Russian region of Kamchatka.    The Borei-class vessel, part of a dferent fleet, was submerged when it fired but the escalation in aggression comes amid arms-control tensions with the West. It was seen as a bid to show how Russia is able to defend its own bases while threatening the US Eastern Seaboard.

Regardless of whether you love or hate the holiday, itaposs becoming increasingly popular - along with the traditions that go with it. We know that, at its core, All Hallows’ Eve is a festival celebrating the dead, but how much do we really understand about its Celtic origins and its spooky associated rituals  Why exactly do we dress up, ask strangers for sweets and carve scary faces into vegetables With some help from the language learning app Babbel, weaposve looked back through some of the most popular Halloween favourites to find out how they originated.Adorable pictures of celebs dressing their kids in super cute Halloween outfits   Halloween was actually first known as Samhain The tradition of Halloween itself comes from Samhain, which is pronounced ‘Sow-win’, an ancient pagan festival celebrated by Celtic people. It first took place in Britain, Ireland and North-Western France and dates as far back as  BCE.    It was believed that as the days became darker and harvest came to an end, the boundary between our world and that of the dead became thinner and, on the night of October , the departed ed to earth. It’s thought that celebrants of the festivities would join priests to pray, and a large fire was lit using a wheel that represented the sun. Following the ceremony, each pagan would light a torch from the bonfire and bring it back home and to relight their hearth, as to ward off evil spirits. Turnips came before pumpkins To ward off the spirits believed to be haunting the land, peasants in th century Ireland took turnips and carved them into frightening faces, before placing them outside their homes, tricking the dead into thinking that a spirit already dwelled there.  The tradition of carving pumpkins came about later, during the late s, when waves of immigrants from Scotland and Ireland arrived in America. In fruitful supply, pumpkins had a thicker skin, which made them ideal for carving faces into. They soon overtook turnips as the official symbol of Halloween. Trick-or-treat Trick-or-treating began in areas of the UK and Ireland. Poorer people went house-to-house ‘souling’ - so called because they asked for small breads called ‘soul cakes’ in exchange for prayer, or for performing a ‘mummer’s’ play, with participants donning costumes, and going door-to-door singing songs to the dead.  This often coincided with a religious festival Plough Monday in North Yorkshire, All Souls Day in Cheshire, and so on. Eventually, souling moved away from being a necessity to a fun activity to do on Halloween, but the ‘soul cakes’ remain a firm tradition in some parts of the UK. Witches were respected, not feared The word ‘witch’ comes from the Old English wicce, meaning ‘wise woman’, which highlights the fact that these women were once highly respected. Witches held annual meetings known as ‘sabbaths’ on Halloween night, where they honoured their connection with the spirit world. Always in opposition to religion, practising witchcraft was officially outlawed in  with the Witchcraft Act in the UK.

A family of squirrels had seemingly decided to stock them there for safe keeping ahead of winter.  Hollyaposs husband Chris explained: My we called me from Northland Library and said that her car smelt like it was burning, and was making a weird sound. I told her to pop the hood, and this is the picture that she sent me! It took almost an hour for the pair to get the nuts out before they could take it to a garage. They were everywhere, under the battery, near the radiator fan, Chris added to CNN. The walnuts on the engine block were black and smelt like they were definitely roasting.

Thereaposs a fascinating history behind Halloween , as the tradition originates from Pagan religious festivals that celebrated the changing of the seasons and honoured the dead.Over the years, ious new traditions have crept into the Halloween season, and now we associate the day with an all manner of terrying things. From black cats and witches to apple bobbing and apostrick-or-treatapos, here are  fascinating Halloween facts to get you in the spooky mood: . The Witch The word “witch” comes from the Old English “wicce” which means “wise woman.”   They used to celebrate the start of the new spiritual year on All Hallows Eve. These wise women were natural healers and teachers and were highly respected iniduals way before we were led to believe they were taking part in witchcraft and conjuring up evil spells in their cauldrons... . The Black Cat Black cats have become so associated with witchcraft that animal shelters have taken steps to protect these felines by not allowing them to be adopted on or around this time of year. . Pumpkins According to Celtic lore, a miserly old man named Jack O’Lantern used to play tricks on the devil and so was forbidden entrance to either heaven and hell. Instead, Jack was condemned to wander the Earth forever more. He was said to use his lantern to lead people astray from their paths.    The British tradition of carving a scary face into a vegetable was originally done with turnips. Irish Americans started using pumpkins because they were cheaper . Bone FiresDuring Halloween celebrations, bonfires were lit to ensure the sun wouldafter the long winter. Often Druid priests would throw the bones of cattle into the flames, and so bone fire became bonfire.. Bobbing Apples Bobbing apples is a popular Halloween tradition. Apples are thrown into a tub of water, and you endeavour to catch one in your mouth as they bob around. When you have caught one, you peel it carefully, and pass the long strip of peel three times around your head after which you throw it over your shoulder, and it falls to the ground in the shape of the initial letter of your true loveaposs name. . Halloween Fear Samhainophobia is the fear of Halloween. This fear can also present with other types of phobias like Phasmophobia which is the fear of ghosts wiccaphobia, the fear of witchcraft and the fear of darkness, nyctophobia.  . Witchcraft As the fear of witchcraft washed over Europe, stray cats that were tended to by old women were also feared to be witches in disguise. Single, elderly women were accused not only of witchcraft, but also of being able to actually transform themselves into black cats. .  Salem Salem, where the infamous witch trials were held in the s, claims to be the ‘Halloween’ capital of the world . Shades of Halloween Halloween is traditionally associated with the colours orange and black. Orange because of its link to the fall harvest, and black because of its connection to darkness and death - not forgetting that Samhain, where Halloween comes from, was the celebration of the boundary between le and death.

Relics of the giant rodent were found in the caves located in the Land of the Leopard National Park near Vlaostok in east Russia. Experts analysed the ,-year-old remains including the teeth and bones from the squirrelaposs upper jaw and believed the animal could glide around ft . Professor Mikhail Tiunov, of the Russian Far Eastern Institute of Biology and Soil Science, said the extinct animal is a previously unknown species. He said: Despite the signicant amount of paleontological research in neighbouring China, their specialists did not discover bone remains of this giant flying squirrel species.  It means that either it just has not been found there yet, or that it didnapost live there. More remnants of the monster squirrel were located inside the Tetyukhinskaya cave in the north of Primorsky region. Modern day flying squirrels tend to live in isolated and unconnected areas and the same may have been true in prehistoric times, he surmised. Perhaps this is exactly how they lived in the past, and that the habitat of this particular species was limited by the territory of modern Primorsky region. he was quoted as saying in The Siberian Times .Just like modern-day giant flying squirrels, their newly-discovered relatives fed on insects, fruit and leaves, even though their bone structure was quite dferent.

success at Somerset Park came on the back of a devastating late collapse at home to bottom side Partick the week previously.And Kerr says the belief that victory over the Championship’s second-placed team has given Dundee is bigger than just three points.He told the Tele: “It was important to get past the Partick game straight away.“There was pressure on Friday night with where Ayr are in the league.“When you go to places like Ayr, with the conditions there and it being such an important game, to come away with a result is big.“It wasn’t the best of games and a good battle but to come away with three points and a good resilient performance is massive for us.”The Wasps may be at the wrong end of the table but have already shown they are a match for anybody in the ision, including a - win over leaders Dundee United just three weeks ago.They also ran Dundee close at Dens Park, missing a penalty to allow the Dark Blues to run out - victors.“Alloa showed they can play when they were up here and I saw the Friday night game against Dundee United and they played really well that night,” Kerr added.“I don’t knowUnited were off-colour that night but Alloa certainly played well.“Against us they missed a penalty and had chances so we have to be on our game.“We’re under no illusions how tough it is going to be but we need to show the same application we have shown recently, apart from the latter stages of the Partick game.“We need to show resilience, calmness on the ball and patience.“I think we are getting to that.“Being a team coming together at the start of the season we knew it would take a bit of time.“There is still a long way to go to where we want to be but we are taking strides towards that.”A part of that was winning their first three points on the road.Before the trip to Somerset Park, Dundee had just two points to show from their first four away trips.They’ve put that to bed – now they want their first back-to-back victories of the Championship season, according to Kerr.He added: “Getting our first away win in the league is a good wee hurdle to get over.“The longer those things go, the more its talked about which can be a distraction from what is actually important which is going on the park and performing.“Getting two in a row now is the aim.“Whether it’s a home game where everyone expects a win or an away game where you are going to have to dig deep, we go into it with only one thought and that is to come away with the three points. We have to have that mentality.“It’s also good to have a run of games close to one anotherthings are going well, especially after a win it’s good to bounce back with another game.”Set-pieces have been a problem area for the Dark Blues this season. Ayr’s goal from Luke McCowan came after Kerr was beaten in the air from a free-kick.The full-back, though, is honest enough to hold his hands up and says he’s doing all he can to improve that part of his game.“That’s something I need to get better at.

That’s what we looked to do on Saturday because we knew we had a tough week ahead. It was good to go and get the victory to start the week positively.“It’ll definitely be a tough test. Thistle were always a well-drilled side, even before McCall went there, and they’ll be the same again.“They might even be better but it’s a tough fixture because they’re a good side with good players.“It’s another test like Saturday was which we need to take in our stride and, hopefully, go and get a good result. Obviously the home form is a positive because you need to win as many home games as you can but we’re not going to get carried away and feel like we need to beat everybody.“We just need to turn up and do our jobs week-in, week-out and make sure that we’re performing at our best when we’re at home. vw, px\"  “If we do that, we’ll get results.“We had two disappointing results in the last two games away from home and it’s something that happens in this league.“You see teams dropping points all over the place so it is like that.“If we keep our home form good, though, and win most of our games then we can maybe afford to drop a couple away.“Obviously, we’ll look to go up to Inverness on a real grass pitch as well, which helps, and put on a performance there. But we have a big test tonight first.”Nicky Clark got the second goal against Dunfermline on Saturday after teeing up Shankland, leading the hitman to praise his colleague.“It was good to get back on the scoresheet with a tap in and I was delighted to see Clarky get his first goal and get off the mark as well.“Earlier in the season we had glimpses of playing with each other but he got injured.

defeat at home to Partick just  days ago.They dealt with everything thrown at them by the Wasps and chances continued to come at the other end with Hemmings close to grabbing a third early on, bringing a good save from MacDonald. vw, px\"  He turned provider with  minutes left on the clock as he burst past a defender and, instead of shooting, cut the ball across for the waiting Sean Mackie to roll the ball into the empty net with his first touch after coming off the bench.Manager McPake had been full of praise for the efforts of his frontman over the past few weeks eventhe goals hadn’t been flowing with none in his previous seven outings.He wasn’t too complimentary about Hemmings’ miss late on, however, as the -year-old blazed the ball over the bar with the goal gaping to pass up the chance of a treble.Despite that, it was an excellent night’s work from the striker and one that will give the Dens faithful plenty to be excited about for the rest of the campaign.With Dorrans pulling the strings in the middle, a defence looking solid and a real goal- getter in scoring form, the Dark Blues are starting to look like they mean business in the Championship title race."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey -

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction.

Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness.

John Kennedy played the ball between the penalty spot and the D where Allan MacDonald let the ball run across his body before turning and blasting home, giving Cameron Sutherland no chance in the Oban goal.There were harsh words in the Oban Camanachd dressing room at half-time and revamp saw Keith MacMillan replace Gary McKerracher whilst the forward line switched to a three-one formation with Andrew MacCuish on the D.The switches paid idends when the home side drew level just four minutes into the second half when Daniel MacCuish ran forward and Daniel MacVicar volleyed the ball into the net to make it -.Oban Camanachd took the lead on  minutes when Andrew MacCuish’s turn and shot flew past the keeper.Just a couple of minutes later, Andrew MacCuish turned provider as he found Scott MacMillan who finished with a low drive from the left although his effort may have taken a slight deflection.Two of the game’s best young goalkeepers were on show, and Inveraray’s Scott MacLachlan saved his side from a bigger defeat though Oban Camanachd did have to rely on Cameron Sutherland who made good saves near the end from Garry MacPherson and Allan MacDonald.The win for Oban Camanachd means that they and Kyles are the only sides, other than championship favourites Kingussie, in the title race as the season moves into the closing stages."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 11 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowACHA tenantIt has been a while since we carried a story where a tenant has a complaint about a housing association property.

A fantastic solo effort in a - win capped a great team performance. Tom would have run around with the customary shirt over the head celebration, however he found the snug fit just too much to pull over his head.By the time the final game took place the team had both done enough and run out of steam.

This was followed by Debussy#s Premiere Rhapsodie which was written as a test piece for a competition at the Paris Conservatoire this requires of the performer the full range of colour and technique which was deftly delivered. Finally we were given Poulenc#s last Sonata. In this, and many of his works, he was rebelling against the Impressionist style and was particularly reflected in the outer fast movements with often angular and zany writing.The second half of the programme started with the Saints-Saens#s Sonata # also his last work. Unlike Poulenc, here he was harping back to the th century#s more classical style style of composition.Their official programme ended with a highly-virtuosic rendition of Chausson#s Andante and Allegro, but we were also given a short and charming encore # one of Gerald Finzi#s three pieces for clarinet and piano.This was all chamber music of the highest quality Maximiliano#s musicality, technique, emotional expression and tonal range were exemplary as indeed were those of his accompanist, Scott.

further improvements are required across much of the local authorityambitious savings plans and satisfaction ratings are to be met.Audit Scotland carried out a major review into Scottish Borders Council between January and May.As well as interviewing councillors and senior officers, auditors sat in on meetings, reviewed documents and files, and held meetings with trade union representatives.While the resulting -page report card highlights an improving picture since the previous audit in , bosses have been told to communicate better and form better relationships with partners, such as NHS Borders.The report also highlights required improvements in some departments and the need for elected councillors to be better equipped for the tough decisions they face.Graham Sharp, chair of the Accounts Commission, told us: ldquoThe continued progress Scottish Borders Council has made to transform services is encouraging.\"Now it must focus on several critical areas including tackling underperforming services, ensuring councillors have the right training to enable them to fulfil their responsibilities and getting to grips with both staff and community engagement.Across the  performance indicators used in the Best Value Assurance Report, Scottish Borders Council was found to be below average in more than half.While education and social work are doing well, other aspects of the local authority arent quite making the grade.A lack of investment in creating employment and boosting tourism was criticised, as was the low amount of contracts awarded to local companies and the fall in the number of bills settled within  days.The deteriorating condition of local authority buildings was also highlighted.Problems since the outsourcing of IT services to multinational firm CGI - a -year contract worth pound million - were also raised by auditors.While the report identies the delays and issues which plagued customer access of the councils online services, auditors said it was too soon to gauge the impact of iPads taking over more traditional teaching methods in Borders schools from this year.And the methodology of farming out senior staff, such as the Executive Director for Commercial Activity spending four days of his week as managing director of the failed SB Cares, and the Executive Director for Strategic Partnerships seconded to the South of Scotland Enterprise Agency three days each week, was also questioned.The report stated: \"While this is a positive and innovative approach aimed at realising the councils wider ambitions, it must continue to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to deliver local services.\"But, perhaps, coming in for the most criticism was the current culture of secrecy and the need for better communication and engagement with staff, councillors and the public.The report stated: \"The council should be more effective in evaluating, managing and reporting its performance, bringing greater clarity on where and how its services need to improve.\"It also needs to get better at the reporting of performance - both in terms of information considered by members and in reporting to the public.\"Budgeting at the local authority, though, was applauded by auditors.And, during extremely dficult economic times, the managing to maintain its usable reserves in case of emergencies was also identied.Although Audit Scotland identied further development was needed for the ambitious Fit for  mid-term savings plan, which aims to trim pound. million from budgets by , the report is complimentary of cost cutting to date.The report stated: \"The council has a good record of achieving savings and has reflected the impact of demographic change on demands for services and pay increases for staff, in its financial plans.\"However, in common with all other councils, the financial outlook remains a signicant challenge.\"Council chief executive Tracey Logan welcomed the detailed analysis of her local authority.And she admitted many of the problems in the Audit Scotland report are already being tackled.She told us: \"We will take on board Audit Scotlandrsquos feedback and recommendations, many of which we had already identied ourselves and are taking action on, and continue to drive forward transformational change across all our services through our Fit for

committee, Kirsty Wichary, lead petitioner for Kelso, told councillors: ldquoWhat do we want our towns to look like in the future  Financial constraints aside, do we not look to have a beautul Borders, with outdoor spaces for all to enjoy ldquoHow did we get to this point, where there is no money for these parks  Investing in new technology for education is to be applauded, butparents had a choice, which would they choose ldquoTechnology isnrsquot helping our children to lead healthy, well-rounded lives. The stress of being a youngster in the st century is enormous.ldquoWe should be investing in more play areas and green spaces instead of taking them away.ldquoThe thought of removing these playparks seems a very backwards step, a step towards a cultural desert and a future for our youngsters with more weight problems, more mental health issues and future generations unable to communicate effectively, even within their own peer groups.ldquoDo you really want to be remembered as the council who handed out iPads but took away the parks Hawickrsquos lead petitioner, Greg Dalgliesh, owner of the townrsquos Think Fitness  Less gym in Hawick, was unable to attend the meeting due to a family bereavement, soHawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer presented his petition on his behalf.He told the committee: ldquo mainly local residents, parents and family members in Hawick have chosen to exercise their right to object to a proposal that would see  playparks across the Scottish Borders, including  in Hawick, the largest town in the Borders, effectively close as a result of a disinvestment of financial support from this council.ldquoThe vast majority of these people and the many who support this action through other means are stakeholders in Scottish Borders Council. They live here, they are required to pay their council tax and, consequently, they have a right to determine how that money should be spent.ldquoI quote from the petition: lsquowe believe in this instance lsquobigger and better facilitiesrsquo should not be justication to remove the smaller playparks that are situated in the ious housing estates in Hawick and the Borders.ldquolsquoIt is very clear from the comments associated with this petition and via social media these smaller parks are still well used and have been described as a safe place to play and exercise on the doorstep of many homes.ldquo lsquoNot everyone can access the likes of Wilton Lodge Park on a regular basis, and children with additional needs also find these areas too busy and noisyrsquo.Councillors discussed a number of possible actions including sending the playpark proposals back out to the public for further consultation and gauging the opinion of community councils in affected areas.In the end, councillors voted to support sending a motion to the next full council meeting, scheduled for Thursdayasking it to reconsider giving authority to officers to determine which playparks can be closed.That motion was proposed by Tweeddale East councillor Heather Anderson and seconded by Selkirkshire councillor Elaine Thornton-Nicol.A counter motion, proposed by East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton and seconded by Jedburghrsquos Scott Hamilton, was also put forward, but it lost out to Ms Anderson and Ms Thornton-Nicolrsquos suggestionby five votes to three.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Wichary said: ldquoIrsquom very happy that itrsquos going to have to go back to the council to be reconsidered.ldquoIrsquom assuming, hopefully, that our petitions in both Kelso and Hawick have given them a lot of food for thought and that we wonrsquot see the closure of all the parks that were mentioned.ldquoItrsquos very clear that there are cost implications, but Irsquom quite confident that there will be some sort of compromise made.Mr McAteer added: ldquoI am delighted that the majority of the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee have supported the Hawick petition designed to stop the council closing a number of our playparks.ldquoTheir decision will now resulted in this matter being referred to a full meeting of Scottish Borders council where elected members will decidefurther consultation and a reconsideration of this isive policy will take place.ldquoI am hoping that elected councillors will put aside their political dferences and respect the wishes of the Hawick and Borders public to make sure our children and young people have safe and secure play areas near their homes."},{"url":null,"title":"21-year-old-accused-injuring-ex","story":"A STOW man

Henderson joined a sell-out audience in Galashiels earlier this month for some couplets and carry-ons with Dr John Cooper Clarke.Dr John Cooper Clarke has an honorary doctorate from the University of Salford.JCCs entitlement can be well justied on the basis of his longevity and skilled poetry.You do wonderhe was ever told, it just wont last and he should keep a day job!But omnipresent he is, far outliving the time confines of the \"Punk Poet\" label.Arise the Bard of Salford and fast forward to .And here we are in the Borders town of Galashiels, and a sold-out Wednesday gig at the MacArts venue.Putting this gig into some kind of perspective, I first saw JCC supporting the Buzzcocks in  so my sabbatical stands at  years.An ocean has passed under the bridge. And a reminder that Im not getting any younger as I try to grow old gracefully.JCCs, now a septuagenarian, style has remained a constant.His image of the suit, shagpile black hair and sunglasses remain intact. His social realism poetic constructs seem relevant today as they did during his inception, extrapolated initially from the often nihilism and tales of social decay that earmarked punk mark one.Poetry is often a barometer of an epoch or epochs. Combining observation and the written word. JCC has become a master of mind imagery, social commentary, surrealism, and semantics and above all story telling. We get it because it resonates with us.It is us or we know someone who it references. Sometimes dystopian, often hilarious and never dull. Add the heavy Salfordian brogue the chemistry set is complete.The performance was slightly peculiar to what I was expecting.Maybe my expectations were misguided or unrealistic. There were some long periods of stand-up comedy that laboured at times.It was only when \"Johnny\" ed to his natural home of poetry recital that he got back on track. Though his joke about Billy Bragg being in crisis because he hadnt released an album in two weeks, I found amusing.But when he got back to the poetry it was a reminder why most people were here.Most poems were from the back catalogue and instantly recognisable. A greatest hit set list.JCC proceeded with Hire Car and the sharply expletive named Get Back on Drugs You Fat F***.Well it was an adult show after all.Common language for common poetry. And it never did Billy Connelly any harm. The poem insinuating it was easier to lose weight being on drugs.Beasley Street, arguably his most well-known poem received one of the best reactions of the night. Imbued with the description of a rock bottom street, a dreg of society and where everything that could go wrong did in this street. A caricature of a threadbare existentialism. Mainly bought on by social and economic deprivation.And then a natural supersession in the form of an epilogue Beasley Street Bouled recital, as the street had now changed into middle class suburbia.Next up Ive Fallen in Love with My We. A reference to marriage, the vows and marital bliss. Tongue in cheek of course.The \"bloody song\" Evidently Chickentown, was greeted with widespread applause. More nihilistic scorn and deprecation of a town, that is in a state of dys.Funny how we tend to laugh at the misfortune of others. But we do.Twat was another poem that represented consistency in tonights performance. A crowd pleaser for all times. Twat being the ultimate character assassination and castout. Bringing sporadic fits of laughter within the audience.The closing recital I Wanna Be Yours, famously adopted by The Arctic Monkeys for one of their songs, represented a slight U-turn in the writing of JCC. More linked to a character who wishes to show an undying love for someone . The positives of the human condition. Did I detect some optimism!The MacArts performance had poetry that mixes modernity with the historical. Comedic in value.When we laugh, we are laughing at ourselves. With him, not at him. Parody is a work of art, human invention and a release from les stresses.He may be the luckiest guy alive, who can tell Graham J.

There are many people walking around freely drinking during these times.ldquoThis makes it dficult to identy those young people who are underage drinking when there are such crowds.Another wrote: ldquoIntoxication in these areas is unpleasant to witness. In all cases we are entitled not to be subject to the loudness and antisocial behaviour this leads to.On the other hand, some respondents voiced their concerns about bringing in alcohol bylaws: ldquoI think itrsquos a complex situation which deserves time and thought. Irsquom not entirely sure that reacting in a retrospective way is the best approach.ldquoI feel there are many behaviours and traditions entrenched in Scottish and Borders society around drinking habits.ldquoI feel personally that there are alternatives for many people socially that do not centre around drinking or going to the pub, such as the cinema, concerts, sports, dining out, etc., but not everyone has the imagination or willingness to explore these as valid ways to enjoy yourself.Another objector wrote: ldquoDrinking in public places doesnrsquot cause a problem in itself. Issues arise when certain iniduals drink alcohol to excess in any setting.ldquoThe problem, in my view, wonrsquot be solved by a blanket ban on alcohol in public spaces. There are already laws to prevent antisocial behaviour but they need enforced.Police Scotland also provided a detailed response to the consultation. It reads: ldquoAlcohol bylaws are used within the three other local council areas within Lothian and Borders, namely East Lothian, Midlothian and West Lothian.ldquoBy having such bylaws in force it assists Police Scotland in reducing anti-social behaviour and violence both of which are known to have an association with drinking in public.ldquoCurrently the Scottish Borders area is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.NHS Borders, Borders Alcohol and Drug Partnership and Scottish Borders Children and Young Peoplersquos Leadership Group provided a joint response, which reads: ldquoAlcohol consumption can take place in our communitiesrsquo private space as well as within licensed premises.ldquoNot allowing people to drink in a public place will help to reduce the normalisation of alcohol being an ordinary commodity and builds communities and environments that supports a culture change and reduces exposure for our children and young people.ldquoPublic drinking can adversely affect the quality of le for residents and our communities.ldquoAlcohol Focus Scotland report that one in two Scots experience harm from anotherrsquos drinking and often this harm is experienced in public spaces .ldquoIn this study % had experienced harm to others in public places and this was mostlyexperienced by the younger age group .ldquoAlcohol bylaws can be used as an additional tool to reduce the nuisance and disorder normally associated with public drinking.ldquoLicensed premises are well regulated within the Scottish Borders and provide the opportunity to consume alcohol in a safe environment.ldquoThe Scottish Borders is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.Councillors will now be asked whether to conduct further consultation on two options: a blanket ban on public drinking to cover the whole of the Borders, or the introduction of an alcohol ban in certain areas of the Borders. Police Scotland has indicated it would prefer the first option, to ease the enforcement of the ban.Furthermore, councillors are asked to consider undertaking a pilot scheme in specic towns, which could then be used to gather further feedback from the public."},{"url":null,"title":"golden-granny-hilde-aims-fashion-success","story":"AN archery gold medal winning grandmother at the British Transplant Games is setting her sights on fashion.Hilde Paxton from Clovenfords, who had a liver transplant shortly after her th birthday, struck the bulls-eye at Newport earlier this year.And the -year-old is already preparing to defend her title next year by raising vital funds for her Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team.Hilde is hosting a fashion show on Saturday, November  in Galashiels.She told us: \"Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team has around  members from all over the east of Scotland who take part in the Transplant Games.\"An important part of being a member is helping to raise the funds required for sending members to the British Transplant Games.\"The Colours Fashion Team will take to the Focus Centre boardwalk on the Saturday for an evening of glamour and casual wear.Included in the pound ticket price is a complimentary glass of Prosecco on arrival.As well as the fashion show, there will also be a grand raffle and a licensed bar.Tickets for Hildes fashion show, which starts at .pm for pm, are available from the Salmon Inn and Focus Centre, Galashiels, the Bridge Inn and The Gt Shop, Peebles, or The Hub in Innerleithen."},{"url":null,"title":"top-up-tap-plans-galashiels","story":"GALASHIELS is set to become the first town in the Borders to receive an official top-up tap.Scottish Water has already installed the water stations in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Ayr, Oban and Fort William as part of its Your Water, Your Le initiative.As well as providing healthy drinking water, the refill taps will also reduce the number of plastic bottles which are currently in circulation.Scottish Water now want to install the top-up tap in Market Place -

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions. Most notably, George received the MBE from Her Majesty at Buckingham Palace on December , , ‘for services to the community in Campbeltown, Argyll and Bute.’Maureen Keith, daughter of the Provost, handing over a bouquet to the Queen after the presentation ceremony.

doesnrsquot use it, the person who pays for it wishes it wasnrsquot needed. What is it I always do riddles when I tell stories. I think of riddles and stories as close cousins which support each other.A good brain-teasing riddle is usually fun, and children in particular love the challenge of solving a riddle, as well as making their own ones up.Irsquom often greeted with pleas for ldquoTim, tell us one more riddle when I enter a school, and Irsquom often challenged to solve a riddle made up by one of the children.They are an ancient form of learning and entertainment.The first discovered written riddles are close to , years old. They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children. It can promote critical thinking, encourage the observation of the world around us, help language development and can be a powerful bonding process with your child. And itrsquos fun!And so when next time you are with your kids, grandchildren, nieces or nephews and find yourself waiting for food to be delivered in a restaurant or have no time for a proper bedtime story, or you just want to spend some quality time together without a screen, try make riddling part of it. Trust me, it will be fun.Oh, and the answer to the well-known riddle at the beginning  Itrsquos a coffin."},{"url":null,"title":"positives-negatives-plans-haddington-town-centre-says-group","story":"Proposals were revealed by the Courier last month that would see a complete revamp of Haddington town centre.Dozens of spaces could be removed from High Street and Market Street, with the introduction of cycle lanes, wider footpaths and a communal space on High Street.The proposals have been met with concern by businesses in the town centre, who fear that the removal of up to  spaces ndash and the introduction of a car park of more than  spaces on Whittingehame Drive ndash could have a negative impact on their way of le.Haddington and District Community Council heard from both Haddington Business Community Partnershipand residents last Tuesday before asking non-community councillors, including the Courier, to leave to discuss the proposals in private.Now, a sub-group ndash made up of community councillors Jan Wilson , Fiona McEwan , Paul Darling , Pat Lemmon and Jack Worden ndash is to meet to draft a letter to East Lothian Council outlining concerns and any positives regarding the scheme.Mrs Lemmon said: ldquoAll community councillors managed to finally see the draft plan that has already been submitted to Sustrans.ldquoThere are some positives but there are also negatives.ldquoSo the community council has formed a sub-group, which is meeting on Tuesday to draft a letter to East Lothian Council.

So the sum total of Mr Corbynrsquos achievement, three years since the EU referendum, is that hersquos actually made Brexit worse.Labourrsquos equivocation over the election date was the culmination of one of the worst failures of democratic opposition in British political history. Mr Corbyn has been comprehensively outplayed by a ided Tory Government with no majority, incompetent leadership and a ldquoliar in Number . What a record to put before the voters in six weeksrsquo time.But wait a moment, because this doesnrsquot mean that the election is going to be a walkover for Boris Johnson. This is likely to be the most unpredictable election, since, well, the last one ndash and the Tories certainly shouldnrsquot be counting any chickens, chlorinated or otherwise.For a start, there is no great enthusiasm for Mr Johnsonrsquos Brexit deal, and it will undergo rigorous scrutiny over the next six weeks. People are asking: why was Mr Johnson so reluctant to let MPs scrutinise his wonderful Withdrawal Bill  What did he have to hide As for the opinion polls, Mrs May was further ahead in  when she went for a snap election that people thought she couldnrsquot lose.

Most of the Scottish Tory MPs are complete unknowns. Christmas party quiz: name all  Scottish Tory MPs.

Then there are all the dedicated Remainers in London whorsquoll vote tactically.And then there are the -odd ldquounwhipped ex-Tories, like the former Chancellor Philip Hammond. They owe Mr Johnson nothing and could do a lot of damage in the campaign. Nor can the PM rely on Labour Brexit supporters in the North of England turning Tory ndash not with ldquoBullingdon Boris in charge.Mr Johnson may or may not be a serial liar, but he embodies, unlike his predecessor, Britainrsquos privileged upper classes. The Conservative Party he leads is now further to the right than in the days of Margaret Thatcher.Younger voters positively detest Mr Johnson, whom many regard as a fascist. Just take a wander down the lists on Twitter. They are heavily engaged in politics right now, not just because of the Brexit they loathe, but also because of tuition fees, lack of jobs, unaffordable houses and so on. They are likely to vote in unprecedented numbers this time.The Tories are desperately trying to insist that ldquoausterity is over, but it patently isnrsquot ndash not in the NHS, local services, schools. And anyway, who was responsible for austerity in the first place The UK has been through the longest period of wage stagnation in  years, and with crumbling infrastructure, insecure jobs, rising inequality, there is a lot of ammunition to use against the PM.So, despite its recent incompetence, there is paradoxically everything for Labour to play for. Except of course in Scotland, where the SNP remains very much in charge ndash though since Nicola Sturgeon would probably back a minority Corbyn government, on a Brexit referendum at least, that isnrsquot as bad for Labour as it sounds.Indeed, Labour will have to fight a very bad campaign to leave Mr Johnson with anything like the lead he has right now in the polls. OK ndash that is not at all impossible, given the state of the Labour Party.Labour is at war with itself, and many Labour MPs hate the thought of campaigning for Mr Corbyn. Expect further accusations of anti-Semitism to be raised in the course of a dirty campaign, not least by the many Labour MPs who have left the party because of it.Labour has a ided leadership and Mr Corbyn is already looking and sounding like yesterdayrsquos man. The architect of Labourrsquos much-praised  election manesto, Andrew Fisher, says he wants to quit. The Peoplersquos Vote campaign, which should be helping Labour, is also at war with itself.The SNP too will have to conduct a very bad campaign not to win its expected  seats. However, it will have to get its message sorted. About the only thing that could go wrong for Ms Sturgeon isthe election started to look like a ballot on another independence referendum.:Scots Tories keep Ruth Davidson on duplicitous election leafletsScottish voters, even many supporters of the SNP, are referendum-ed out. Yet Ms Sturgeon is requesting another two of them: one on Brexit and another on Scottish independence . She should probably confine herself to promising to apply for a Section  order, and then focusing on the NHS, housing and ldquothe hated Tories as the SNP leader calls them.This is going to be a fractious election, with bad-tempered voters resenting the interruption to their festive shopping. And after the parties suffer the trials of campaigning in the dark, they could find the result is another hung parliament.

With the aid of ten election dorsquos and donrsquots ndash let us call them commandments in keeping with the seasonrsquos biblical theme ndash we can get through this with our sanity clauses intact . Here goes:DO: Set up an official, impartial, fact checking service that can give a ruling on the avalanche of claims and counterclaims coming votersrsquo way. Yesterdayrsquos PMQs, with a row over the involvement of American firms in the NHS, was just a flavour of what is to come. At this moment, somewhere in the UK, claims are being painted on the sides of buses and voters need to know who and what to trust. Let the official fact checker dispense with the traditional ldquoon the one hand on the other fuddy-duddy formalities. In this fast-moving age a simple thumbs up, thumbs down will do. No appeals, no refunds, harsh but fair.: Poll shows support for SNP and independenceDONrsquoT: Let us tolerate streams of political cliches masquerading as answers to specic questions. Any interview in which a politician says, ldquoLet me be clear, ldquoWe have always been clear, or any iety thereof, will be terminated immediately and the culprit fined. Likewise, experts, back in fashion since Westminsterrsquos implosion, starting sentences with the word, ldquoSo.DO: Feel free to be a switcher in this General Election. The current Westminster parliament has been notable for the large number of politicians, some  according to the BBCrsquos PM programme, who have switched sides or found themselves suddenly independent. Voters may like to follow their examples and dispense with old loyalties as they see fit. Outwith Scotland, the Tories entire election strategy depends on leopards changing their spots. In general, and due in part to Brexit creating new allegiances, a lot of soul searching will be going on as pens hover above ballot papers. As a result of switching this could be a fiendishly dficult election to call.DONrsquoT: Take Scotland for granted. Goes for all parties, but particularly the SNP, widely expected to sweep the board in Scotland. No sooner had an election date been named than some in the party were framing the General Election as mainly a way to advance independence. Not only is this a risky strategy that could repel as many voters as it attracts, there is a whf of arrogance about it, too. Voters here want to talk about schools, the NHS, the economy and so on as much as voters in the rest of the UK. They have genuine concerns that must be heard. To assume otherwise is to believe wrongly that all is well here, save for a lack of independence. See the history of Labour in Scotland, or the seats lost in the  General Election, for further information on the perils of assuming support is in the bag.: SNP reliant on voters in EnglandDO: Be nice to canvassers. Yes, it is a pain in the neck to have your evening interrupted, but it is an essential part of the ing of democracy. Information is exchanged between parties and voters, sometimes in fairly spirited terms, and pressure released. After the last three years we could all do with some of that. Remember, too, that it is cold outside and it takes some commitment to a cause to go out there ldquoon the knock. Not for nothing was fleece -lined clothing trending last night.DONrsquoT: On the subject of social media, it might be a good time to remind BBC journalists, and one in particular, hello Laura, to pause before they tweet, such is the number of Twitter ldquospats they have been in lately.The latest erupted this week when the BBCrsquos political editor wrongly said the SNP had called a rally in Glasgow this Saturday as part of gearing up for an election. In fact, the event has been organised by The National, The Heraldrsquos sister paper, and has been in the pipeline for months. Ms Kuenssberg, to her credit, issued a correction. Next time, for there surely will be one, remember it is better to be right than quick.DO: Hope that broadcasters, in the run up to polling day on December , find ways of covering politics that prove more enlightening than the current stale models.Heated debates, with  of mostly men shouting at each other, or audience members shouting at them, does nothing to aid anyonersquos understanding. Broadcasters have the upper hand in what is certain to be a campaign with more key players than usual vying for attention. Use it to insist on extended, one-to-one interviews, or follow the American example and have small  quizzing debate participants rather than large audiences. Panels are easier to vet, thus avoiding the inevitable rows when seemingly impartial questioners turn out to be not quite as advertised.: Rude awakening ahead for Johnson DONrsquoT: Forget there is le after politics. Some of it can even be fun.

Though it may seem hard to believe now, foreign newspapers will eventually stop asking why the UK has taken leave of its senses.DO: Take the time to watch party political broadcasts. They may indeed be analogue communication in a digital age, and look positively ancient compared to whizz-bang social media campaigning, but they are a chance for politicians to show what terrible actors they are, much to the amusement of the rest of us.DONrsquoT: Believe that we will wake up on Friday the th ndash now there is an omen ndash with everything settled.

We all win.Boris Johnson will also take to the campaign trail in southern England ndash on the day that Britain should have left the EU under his ldquodo or die pledge.Ahead of a trio of visits, the Prime Minister promised a new Conservative Government would give the public hope and improve opportunity.Declaring how he wanted  to be a ldquogreat year for our country with billions of pounds more investment in Britainrsquos public services, Mr Johnson warned: ldquoThe alternative is for the people of this country to spend the next year - which should be a glorious year - going through the toxic, tedious torpor of two more referendums on EU membership and Scottish independence thanks to Jeremy Corbynrsquos incessant indecision.\"Earlier at the last PMQs of the parliamentary session, the Tory leader locked horns with his SNP counterpart over Scottish independence, which the PM dismissed as a ldquocrackpot idea.Noting how an economic think-tank had calculated Brexit would deliver a pound billion annual hit to the economy, Mr Blackford claimed Mr Johnson was ldquowilling to throw Scotland under his big red bus to deliver his Brexit no matter what the cost.But the PM argued the greatest damage to Scotland would come from the SNPrsquos ldquoreckless plan to break up the Union, noting how  per cent of Scottish exports went to the rest of the UK.Highlighting the largest ever Treasury block grant to Edinburgh and the benefits of the ldquomost successful political partnership in history, Mr Johnson decried how the SNP would ldquothrow all that away with their crackpot plan for borders at Berwick and creating a new Scottish currency or joining the euro.He went on: ldquoAnd, worse still, going into the EU and handing back control of Scotlandrsquos fisheries Scotlandrsquos spectacular marine wealth. Just at the moment they have been won back by this country, they would hand back control of those fisheries to Brussels. That is their policy I look forward to contesting it at the barricades.As Scottish Conservative MPs cheered their leader, Mr Blackford predicted many of them would not be ing to Westminster after December .He said: ldquoOnly a vote for the SNP can secure the escape route for Scotland away from this Brexit mess, from the chaos of Westminster and from the austerity of the Tories and protect Scotlandrsquos right to choose our own future as an independent country in Europe.Mr Johnson claimed the SNPrsquos persistent focus on independence was a ruse to hide the truth that they were ldquowrecking Scotland.ldquoThey are diabolical for the Scottish economy, declared the PM. ldquoThey have the highest taxes in the UK. They are not running either health or education well. That is why they are so monomaniacal about independence and smashing the Union.Post-PMQs, a senior Tory source turned to the idea of a pact between Mr Corbyn and the First Minister, saying: ldquoHe has done a shady backroom deal with Nicola Sturgeon for a referendum in Scotland, something which I dont think much of his party is particularly happy with but its a position which Jeremy Corbyn has stated very clearly.But the Labour leaderrsquos spokesman insisted: ldquoThe claim being made repeatedly by Boris Johnson and the Conservative Party about two referendumstheres Labour Government next year is invented and completely untrue.He added there would be no facilitation of indyref in the ldquoformative years of a Labour government so, we can put that claim down to fantasy and fake news."},{"url":null,"title":"professor-andrew-atherton-removed-office","story":"Professor Andrew Atherton, Principal  Vice-Chancellor at Dundee University, was removed from his pound, post last month while an \"internal process\" was carried out.The nature of his suspension has not been revealed, and the situation has been clouded in secrecy by University authorities.:St Andrews named UK university of the yearAnemail leaked to the media says that Professor Atherton, a fluent mandarin speaker who has only been in the job since January this year, was suspended on September .The email states: \"It will be reported in the local press tomorrowthat the Principal  Vice-Chancellor, Professor Andrew Atherton, has been suspended from office.\"I can confirm that the Principal has been suspended since  September, pending an internal process which remains to be completed.:Dundee University students launch recruitment drive for new faculty boss#\"In the interests of fairness and natural justice, and as in all cases of this kind, it would not be appropriate for the University to comment on this matter while due process is ongoing.\"It adds: \"The University Executive Group has, throughout this period, been managing the Universityrsquos affairs and will continue to do so.\"Professor Atherton was formerly Deputy Vice-Chancellor at Lancaster University.A spokesman for the Universoty said: \"Professor Atherton, Principal and Vice-Chancellor, was suspended from office on September , pending an investigation which remains to be completed.\"That process includes an investigation carried out by someone external to the University.\"As is our policy in any disciplinary case, it would not be appropriate for the University to comment further while the process is ongoing.\""},{"url":null,"title":"letters-queens-speech-gave-us-foretaste-sophistry-come","story":"The Conservative Party is however unique in having already set out its manesto prior to the election being called. This has been done in what in what is normally referred to as the Queenrsquos Speech. It is in studying the contents we have to realise that the author, the Prime Minister, is someone not normally associated with either in-depth scrutiny or attention to detail. To put it another way the manestorsquos headlines do not represent the contents.Nothing is more evident than the claim to recruit , more police officers. Although this does not relate to Scotland nevertheless it is a prime example of double talk. In stating , more police in three years there is a suggestion being made that in the three-year period England and Wales will have this number of additional officers. However even the slightest amount of scrutiny lies bare the nonsense of this claim.To recruit this number in three years would require a Herculean task of actually interviewing sufficient, capable people to take up these vacancies. The interviewing process is long and arduous and with preference being given to graduates will present the police forces with a huge logistical nightmare. The normal fallout from the interview process can be up to  per cent so maybe , interviews would have to be carried out to arrive at the headline number.However, let us assume, in a spirit of charity, that somehow this task can be accomplished and the interviews completed and in three years , new officers will have been recruited. The average working le of an officer is  years so in three years ten per cent of the present force of , will have retired. Or to put it another way , officers will have left the force. So even recruiting , more officers had been accomplished, this would result in only a net gain of , additional cops. The headline and the detail simply do not add up. If Boris Johnson were looking to improve the service, then the solution would lie in increasing the budget appropriately. This he will not do.This is merely one example. However similar forensic investigation of all the contents of the Queens Speech will show that Mr Johnson is selling nothing other than fairy tales.George Kay, Burntisland.THE Herald poll which shows overwhelming support for the SNP at the upcoming General Electionis a mark of the trust voters have in the party which has been in power in Scotland for  years, and a growing realisation that Scotland will thrive as an independent European nation.While the SNP Government calmly carries on, the UK is into its third Tory Prime Minister in about as many years David Cameron didnt hang around after losing the EU referendum hed instigated, Theresa May soon found that Brexit didnt mean Brexit and we werent going to make a success of it and Boris Johnson eclipsed the pair of them by insisting that do or die, we were leaving the EU on October  and hed rather be dead in a ditch than ask for an extension. Neither Mr Johnson nor anyone  is leaving on October  and while he may not be in a ditch, Mr Johnson is certainly busy digging himself and his party into a hole.While a General Election may have been inevitable, the timing could hardly have been much worse, with the Christmas season getting into full swing and just over a week before the shortest day even holding it a few days earlier would have been helpful, particularly to the student population. And it is a huge blow that the amendment was not taken which, as is the case at Scottish elections, would have given voting rights to EU nationals living in the UK and enfranchised  and -year-olds, who will have to live with the consequences of Brexit without being given any say in the matter.I fear that we can expect Mr Johnsons General Election campaign to emulate the notorious Vote Leave campaign with pledges on the side of a bus et al, so it is encouraging that your poll indicates that Scottish voters wont be duped by this guiser of a Prime Minister and his Halloween tricks and no treats.Ruth Marr, Stirling.AS we gear up to a December election, the first economic assessment of Boris Johnsonrsquos Brexit deal has indicated the incredibly damaging impact it will have on the UK economy.Research by the National Institute of Economic and Social Researchhas revealed that GDP would be . per cent lower in  yearsrsquo time under the deal, leaving the UK a staggering pound billion worse off than we had remained in the EU.This is not quite the ldquosunny uplands the Brexiters have repeatedly promised.NIESR said approval of the Prime Ministerrsquos deal ldquowould reduce the risk of a disorderly outcome but eliminate the possibility of a closer trading relationship with the EU. However, despite the agreement between the EU and the UK removing uncertainty, customs and regulatory barriers would ldquohinder goods and services trade with the continent leaving all regions of the United Kingdom worse off than they would bethe UK stayed in the EU.The report also found the proposed free trade deal with the EU was slightly worse for the economy than Theresa Mayrsquos deal of last year.When voters mark their X in the box, these figures lay bare the economic future that faces the nation and the major impact that their choice will have.Alex Orr, Edinburgh EH.NICOLA Sturgeon has agreed to a General Election to further her own political aims. Has she miscalculated  The SNP is standing on a  to cancel Brexit and allow indyref but the two are mutually exclusive. If Brexit does not take place, the foremost \"material change in circumstances\" that triggered the need for indyref disappears. Many SNP supporters who still want Brexit to happen will be in the position of having to vote for a pro-Brexit party. Those wanting to remain in both the Union and the EU can find security with the Liberal Democrats. The pro-independence position is therefore weakened and even more so as the SNPs warnings on a climate emergency might boost those voting Green.The SNP hype, up until now, is for almost a total victory in all Scottish seats to be in the bag. The expectation is being ramped up, therefore disappointment is almost inevitable. Perhaps Ms Sturgeon ought to have declined Boris Johnsons invitation after all.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow G.AS they say, politicians campaign in poetry but have to govern in prose. Flamboyant promises fill the airwaves, restraint only coming into play when the serious business of taking office hits home.The starting pistol for a Christmas election has been fired.This is no ordinary election where policies are put on display, allowing the electorate to vote for the party most trusted by voters. The waters have been muddied by the inclusion of Brexit on the normal agenda in the hope that the result will finally define the direction demanded by the choice of the winning party.We have two contrasting personalities leading the two main parties.Both are pale imitations of the two giants of their parties, Boris Johnson representing a Churchillian figure, Jeremy Corbyn approximating to Attlee.What cannot be denied is that this election is a battle for the soul of Britain, one side the champion of neo-liberal economics, the other verging on responsible capitalism under the guise of socialism.That is the stark choice facing the voters, who will have to wade through the murky rhetoric to work out which campaign they should choose to ensure viability for their families and personal welfare.That will mean looking beyond narrow self-interest and focusing on the broader perspective of what is better for the national interest.They will have to ignore the caricatures painted for them by the wild words of politicians hoping to depict their opponents in the worst possible light.This is a generation-defining election.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.I REFER to the ongoing furore about the career of Ruth Davidson, former leader of the Scottish Conservatives .I recall from a comment that one writer made that she was resigning to spend more time with her family he also pointed out that she was actually resigning to spend more time with her constituents, which she had not actually done heretofore.As the story developed, she was really to be spending more time with her consultants, Tulchan and her own consultancy company.Ms Davidson has now agreed not to accept the role with Tulchan what she will do with her own company is not known as she omitted to properly register it, and someone  has registered the domain name. Her failure to register her own company shows a distinct lack of business sense, where the Tulchan episode just shows her lack of common sense.On a related matter the Scottish Tories are producing election leaflets with her pictureshe actually stood down because she fundamentally disagreed with the Prime Minister, Boris Johnston ndash she did launch ldquoOperation Arse about his candidacy, did she not  Strange indeed that she and the Tory Party are now punting him as hard as they can.Jim Lynch, Edinburgh EH.FOLLOWING on from your article re Ruth Davidsons pamphlet to the East Renfrewshire electorate: today I received one from our local Conservative MP, well I think it was.

The fact that it is a part of indigenous Maori culture which has been embraced by all races in New Zealand, makes it a special and unique tradition to be celebrated and admired.Recently, when a friendrsquos -year-old son was leaving a New Zealand school after coaching rugby there for a year, I confess to shedding a wee tear as she showed me video of the hundred or so multiracial students performing the haka as a mark of respect for their coach.It is moving and fierce, powerful and evocative, hypnotic and surprising all at the same time. Itrsquos an ancient tradition that has survived the inexorable push towards the homogeneity of Hollywood culture. For that, I think, it deserves a little respect, not smirking, rule-breaking or attempts to drown it out with renditions of ldquoSwing Low, Sweet Chariot.Of course, therersquos an argument to say that the aim was not to disrespect. I mean, we all make mistakes when it comes to othersrsquo culture, rituals and customs, when we simply donrsquot know what is expected of us. lsquoItrsquos no biggiersquo as my kids would say.I have a litany of experience of this. One episode stands out. A few years ago, a Muslim cousin of mine got married to a Sikh. Although the families originated from within  miles of one another on the Indian subcontinent, neither had read the non-existent copy of A Very Handy Guide to Wedding Rituals.The result was a stand-off outside a Scottish country house on the one baking hot day of , that lasted for a painful  minutes, as neither side knew what they should do: a standoff so scary, it put the Soviet American standoff at Checkpoint Charlie in  to shame. We just had no idea what each others rituals were - do we shake hands, exchange gts, we had garlands but who was to put it on whom And it seems Irsquom not alone in my experience of faux pas when it comes to rituals. A Jewish friend recently told me of aat a synagogue where the dferent types of food on the table were carefully chosen to signy certain elements of the past. A soft and gooey food called Charoset signied the cement used by the Jewish slaves in building, and bowls of salted water signied the tears and sweat of those slaves. Just as one man was about to drink the much respected salted water, a non Jewish visitor plunged his hands into the bowl, and started vigorously washing them. Maybe itrsquos the disregard for the rules by the team thatrsquos ripping my knitting. Few, and certainly it seems, not even the All Blacks themselves, argue that a response to the haka is not acceptable, but itrsquos the disregard for authority, the we-know-better than officialdom, which smacks of something more potentially worrying.World Rugby Regulations insist that opponents must stay in their half when the haka is being performed. Some of the England team entered the other half, but yet even with officials shouting at them to get back, they continued to do so. Their fans lapped it up - England won, so perhaps the means justied the glorious end.But is that really a justication for breaking the rules  Most of us teach our kids to obey the rules - at home, in school, on the sports field. Itrsquos part of growing up - being aware of a kind of social contract between us all in gameplay.Elite sportsmen and women are role models for millions of young people and children and to keep sport respected in this way the governing bodies have to formulate rules which canrsquot be seen to be ignored. By flouting the rules, and the subsequent validation of the rule-breaking by fans and pundits alike afterwards, did the English team tap into a zeitgeisty thing wersquore seeing a lot more of at the moment  pound is thought to be the cost to the team - an insignicant loss for making their lsquoVrsquo shaped point.So yes, although stuff happens, the response of the England team was no mistake. It was pre-meditated and for me, showed a lack of respect to the ancient tradition. But hey! What do I know  Irsquom just a woman still traumatised by being in a face-off nine years ago between  Glaswegian Muslims and  Sikhs from Gravesend.Now,one, or both sides had started doing the haka - that would have been interesting."},{"url":null,"title":"line-dutys-martin-compston-among-scottish-bafta-attendees","story":"They will be joined by Still Game creators Ford Kiernan and Greg Hemphill,

The research discovered that almost universally, those asked thought that the ‘deal’ being examined at Westminster represented not just the terms of our withdrawal from the European Union but the entirety our future trading and political relationship with the bloc.When told that this was just the beginning and that Brexit itself would trigger years of detailed, high-stakes negotiations and trade talks– the response was a “horried silence”.It demonstrates the mistaken, yet widely held belief that “getting Brexit done” will conclude with the passage of a withdrawal agreement. Yet in reality, the wrangling, the double-dealing and the persistent threat of crashing out without a deal after the transition period are set to go on and on and on.: Brexit: Boris Johnson is learning same lessons as Theresa May – Ian Swanson: Brexit: England seems to be declaring independence from UK – Angus RobertsonPart of the cause of this confusion is that very few political parties are being straight with the public right now, either about what is going on in the Brexit endgame, or how they feel about it.Take the Prime Minister. In , Theresa May proposed what was, effectively, the same withdrawal agreement as the one on the table right now. She was derided for it by both Boris Johnson and the Brexiteer wing of the Conservative Party. DoublethinkNow he is at the helm, Johnson has discovered the unassailable boundaries of Brexit and has reheated the same solution to the Irish border problem. Northern Ireland will be both simultaneously inside and outside of the EU customs union, depending on your point of view – “Schrödinger’s Ulster” as the commentator Alex Massie recently put it.Scottish Tories have rushed to embrace this policy and with it the doublethink of their new leader. When Theresa May first proposed special treatment for Northern Ireland in its relationship with the EU, Ruth Davidson and David Mundell threatened to resign their positions in response to the threat they believed it represented to the Union.But a poll of Tory members earlier this year suggested that delivering Brexit was more important to them than preventing Scottish independence. The self-proclaimed s of the Union are now pedalling a policy that dramatically heightens the risk of another Scottish border poll and all that comes with it.The mask is beginning to slip for the SNP as well. For three years, Nicola Sturgeon has sought to court Remain voters who voted No in . She’s been desperate to point to independence as a leboat back to the EU . But the First Minister’s ‘stop Brexit’ credentials are starting to ring rather hollow.It emerged last week that her party spent considerably more money chasing , votes in the Shetland by-election than they did campaigning for . million votes in the EU referendum. And people have forgotten that it took them nearly two years to join the campaign for a referendum on the final terms of Brexit. Now that a second referendum might just make it into the Withdrawal Billthey have gone strangely quiet on that front. Instead they appeared to have opted for a swashbuckling push for a snap General Election out of what appears to be a narrow self-interest.No wonder people find politics infuriating right now. They just want political parties to be straight with them about the seismic choices we face as a nation. That starts by reminding them in no uncertain terms that the best deal we could ever hope to strike with the EU is the one we currently enjoy as a full and active member and that the best way to “get Brexit done” is to do away with Brexit completely.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"eu citizens in scotland not applying for settled status due to incredulity mike russell","story":"Mike Russell suggested that could be one of the reasons why the number of EU citizens registering to remain north of the Border is lower than it is for the UK as a whole.In , the year the Brexit referendum took place, there were about , European citizens resident in Scotland.: Scottish Independence: SNPs referendum plans suffer blow in Holyrood reportJoan McAlpine, convener of the Scottish Parliaments European Committee, said Home Office data showed applications for settled status are \"signicantly lower\" north of the Border, with only about  per cent of people having applied, compared to a UK rate of about  per cent.Mr Russell said one reason for this could be their \"incredulity\" at having to apply to remain in the UK post-Brexit, a process he described as \"offensive\" and \"very wounding\".The Brexit secretary told the committee that ongoing uncertainty means \"overall this is a dficult and very worrying time for EU citizens who live in Scotland\".He said: \"There is a very considerable degree of angst and upset ... and the Scottish Government as a whole wants to do everything it can to help.\"But it cannot, of course, grant citizenship, and that is the key thing which people wish.\": General election : SNP set to be snubbed in plans for three TV debatesOn the lower number of applications for settled status from Scotland, he said some of this could be linked to the temporary nature of some types of work such as in the agricultural sector.Mr Russell said: \"It could also be peoples incredulity that this is required of them, and a feeling that as Scotland is dferent then they dont need to do so.\"Ive been very clear, the Government has been very clear and we want to be very clear again here today, the Scottish Governments advice to EU citizens here is to apply for settled status.\"We dont like that, we think it is offensive people are being asked to do so, particularly people who have lived in this country for a very long period of time.\"I have a number of constituents who have been in Scotland for , , one of them almost  years, and being asked to do this is very wounding and offensive to them.\"But we advise people to do that and indeedthey do not do so and they do not observe the law, problems can occur for them.\"There may be other reasons, but those are the reasons were thinking of at the moment.\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"fmqs nicola sturgeon scotland needs to be independent to be at europe s top table","story":"Ms Sturgeon told MSPs she was #looking forward immensely# to the General Election as she faced questions from MSPs at Holyrood for the weekly installment of First Minister#s Questions.

The cost of the interconnector would pay for four Shetland power stations. Now one gas-fired would leave acool £, million for research and education.

Characterising those behind Viking Energy as silly, mad or idiotic is simplistic, inaccurate and unhelpful.Some, but certainly not all, of the backersand approvers were incorrectly motivated by honestly held environmental concerns.Tom Morton’s name springs to mind.Ian Tinkler’s phrase, “Green loonies”, does nothing, however, to capture the aice that motivated some of the others who, vocally or secretly, also backed the scheme.Neither does Ian’s phrase address the  “development-at-all-costs” notion that the council must always be on a mission to find and back the next big thing.Their job should instead be to see things are fairly considered.Ian may be right to argue the inter-connector is unaffordable, that Shetland needs an intermediary gas-fired power station # possibly en-route to a publicly owned eco-grid # but he’s foolish to garble so important a message.An independent commission may be needed to look at how Shetland’s future energy needs can best be met.The council could have a role in calling for one.And Ian Tinkler can retain his self-stimulating role in calling others silly names at random for his own pleasure.As for “snowflake”, well bless his cotton socks.Would he could stick to his point.In all seriousness, I wince when I read the word ‘ loonies’ in these columns.

Sorry for the windup folks, I do not suffer pretentious fools all that well.Side comment : I believe when Sullom Voe, was being planned, an arrangement was negotiated where SV could supply gas, via pipeline, to the power station here in Lerwick, at very little cost, thus the cost of power to the people of Shetland, becoming one,not the only, cheapest source of energy for the consumer. However, the get out clause, the Hydro-Board, asked BP could the guarantee % supply  No surprise, BP said # No. #. That being said, we, Shaetlanders# were denied a cheaper cost of energy and a cost of living. I believe. Could this arrangement still be in the pipeline as an alternative to Viking Energyin providing a cheap source of energy Well Ian, that was almost an apology laced with get # out clauses.!!Making references to the so called PR brigade and Big Girls’ Blouses does nothing to assuage people who deliver their opinions in reasonable, measured tones.To attack with great relish says a great deal more about the attacker than the attacked. One can very readily understand why so much intolerance in the world makes it an unsafe place.Being proud of such a weakness merely serves to compound the problem.With patience and a large slice of contrite thinking, things could repair and meaningful exchanges COULD take place.Roll on.Since May . The  MWe plant has four  MW General Electric Frame  gas turbines . It may be more cost-effective to modernise and expand this plant at Sullom than build a gas pipe to Lerwick. Unless I am mistaken a connecting power line is cheaper and less environmentally damaging than a pipeline. If Shetland ever gets its renewable act together this plant would act as the backup power station until a non-fosil fuel plant was established. A tidal generation would be the obvious solution with hydrogen back up and storage used for transport and energy storage.Thank you Ian, for your comments. directly coming from Sullom Voe Haydn makes a worthwhile point. We shouldn’t be contributing in harmfully in ways that feed stigma around issues of mental health.People should not feel discouraged from seeking help that could be le saving. I have some sympathy with those at the Shetland Times who have to decide which of the comments offered here do not “observe normal standards of decency and tolerance”, but perhaps the style book needs updating. There is a related problem in which when we point out the problem this particular perpetrator gets double his satisfaction and then feels stimulated into issuing further offensive posts.This problem would be lessened were the Shetland Times to simply refuse to carry posts containing terms such as “loonie” and “lunatics”. I suspect the staff periodically consider such issues and wouldn’t be troubled by the prospect of being considered “Big Girls Blouses”or indeed “pretentious fools” were they to cut less slack.It is also possible to become desensitised, even to such annoyances as the distracting sound of a dentist’s excessive drill.The profit motive aside, I can’t see the subsea cable being preferable to Shetland becoming self sufficient through sustainable renewables..."},{"url":null,"title":"electrical engineer electrician at scale aq ","story":"• Experience working within aquaculture is desirable but not essential as training will be given.• Full driving licence is essential.• ScaleAQ offer a competitive salary, private healthcare and training development opportunities.ScaleAQ is the result of  years of experience and consists of Steinsvik, Aqualine and AquaOptima.

The proposal was supported by the two SNP councillors in the Barra and South Uist Ward and the five SNP councillors from Lewis and Harris.”In his statement, Councillor MacMillan also accused Labour Highlands and Islands MSP Rhoda Grant of calling for a government inquiry into the issue as a means of “taking the focus” off of comhairle convenor Councillor Norman A MacDonald # whom he described as a “Labour party colleague” to Rhoda Grant # and who has voted, according to Councillor MacMillan, to back the Uist dental plan.Councillor MacMillan added: “Rhoda Grant#s proposal for an inquiry is a politically motivated ersionary tactic designed to prevent the truth about Labour Party councillors voting to close the medical provision at Uist Hospital.“Rhoda Grant should instead call for the Western Isles NHS to start telling the truth, to publish the voting record of the [Integration Joint Board]meeting and explain the real reason for centralising the dental provision into the Uist Hospital which is to close the Operating Theatre and Resuscitation Room to remove the surgical capacity from the hospital.”Responding to the claims, Norman A MacDonald stated that he wasn#t present at the last IJB meeting, and said that “assurances had been given” that the relocation of the dental service in Uist would have “no detrimental impact on the Uist and Barra hospital whatsoever.The convenor added: “After the original vote at the IJB on this matter resulted in a split vote, from then on it was up to the chief executives to decide what would take place.“I have no idea what kind of influence Councillor MacMillan might think I have, as both Uist and Barra hospital and the Western Isles Hospital hospital are solely the responsibility of the health board and it is not for councillors to make any decisions on their future.“I have never discussed in any shape or form either the dental service in Uist or her call for an inquiry with Rhoda Grant.“As to the colour of my politics, Councillor MacMillan#s claims are equally questionable. I have registered for the last fteen years as an independent councillor.”Mrs Grant said: “Councillor MacMillan#s assertion would be laughable were it not such a serious issue in question.“I have, from the outset in , listened to the concerns being raised by constituents, by the Uist Locality Planning Group, by the Association of Community Councils, by a stakeholder event held in Lochboisdale, and by all local elected members serving when this proposal to centralise dental services was first aired.“I have repeatedly made representation to the IJB, to NHS Western Isles, to the comhairle, to the previous Health Secretary, and to the First Minister.“Health boards and local authorities throughout Scotland are having to make incredibly dficult decisions to fit with the reducing budgets they are being given and perhaps Councillor MacMillan, instead of throwing meaningless insults around, would do better focusing on bringing this to the attention of his colleagues in the Scottish Government, opposing jobs and services being taken out of local communities.“This is an appalling decision, which flies in the face of local democracy, and constituents in Uist deserve to have their concerns heard, and heeded.”Officially, it was something called the Integration Joint Board that made the announcement at the end of last month: all roads will soon lead to Balivanich. But the IJB began le as a creature of the big boys it is staffed by officials from both public agencies. Is its independence nominal  It#s hard to be sure.Whatever the limits of its power, it is a useful fig leaf to hide behind. The barrage of flak directed at this rotten decision to centralise a vital health service can be dodged by the likes of NHS Western Isles chief executive Gordon Jamieson. The plan to close three dental surgeries came from the IJB. At least that#s how it was sold to the public.Before too long, everyone in the Uists will have to go to hospital in Balivanichthey need a filling or a tooth extracted. So much for the “professional concerns” comhairle chief executive Malcolm Burr has supposedly spent that last six months mulling over. At the end of September, he fell into line. Unanimity was required in order to proceed, and he delivered it.One particular paragraph from the IJB decision paper is worth quoting in full: “Given his familiarity with the subject matter, the chief executive of NHS Western Isles was able to come to an early view about the best arrangements for the provision of dental services in Uist but the chief executive of the comhairle, having no previous experience of these services, required more time to familiarise himself with the detail.”This admission is revealing. Completely out of his depth, it took Mr Burr six months to swot up on the intricacies of closing three dental surgeries before wielding the axe. In doing so, he perhaps exposed the limits of integrating health and social care, which is the IJB#s raison d#etre. Put simply, it should not be the responsibility of someone with no background in health care to make a decision like this. The IJB say there will be an “outreach” service aimed primarily at South Uist and Eriskay, the latter  miles away from Balivanich along single-track roads. What this pledge means, in dental terms, is still to be decided. Perhaps teeth can be extracted safely in the back of a van.If the fruits of integration — a much-hyped national paradigm — are vandalism on this scale, then we suggest a rethink is in order. The hybrid organisations driving the agenda don#t seem to be accountable to anyone, least of all the voters.Speaking of which, we are glad to see that Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan has had a quiet word with Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick about referring the matter to the Scottish Government. Ultimately, it is Health Secretary Jeane Freeman who has the power to stop this. Hopefully, she#ll use it before Stornoway wrecks a system that has worked well for decades."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MOD-GLW-19-GOLD-MEDAL-1.jpg","title":"both of this years gold medals are won by glasgow","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAfter  years living in the city, Claire and family were due to move back to her native Ness in Lewis on Monday.The -year-old teacher had previously won the Traditional Gold when the mòd was in Stornoway in .

If Edinburgh and Skye do suffer from overtourism, what can we do about it  In a free country, we cannot stop people from coming here, evenwe wanted to.It should also be recognised that folk visit those two places for dferent reasons. Edinburgh is an architectural jewel which is at its most crowded during the annual festival. People come to Skye for the scenery — most notably in recent years to the Trotternish Ridge and the Fairy Pools, two undeniably beautul spots in an island which is full of other undeniably beautul spots.Edinburgh cannot be expected to cancel its festival, any more than we want to drain the Fairy Pools or blow up the Old Man of Storr.And we do not want to stop them coming. They bring money, which provides jobs and kickstarts enterprises and improves the island#s economic wellbeing even outside the realm of the local tourist industry.Professor John Lennonof Glasgow Caledonian University#s Moffat Centre is presently commissioned by another independent body, SkyeConnect, to carry out a major survey of the impact of tourism on Skye.Professor Lennon and his colleagues are not due to deliver their report until next spring. But he will offer a taste of its findings so far to the autumn conference of SkyeConnect next month.We look forward to both the sample and the full report. We can hazard a guess at some of its content.Skye has been #discovered# by the rest of the world, like a Caledonian Machu Picchu.Unlike the Peruvian Inca site, however, Skye is a very big island. Unlike Machu Picchu, it is not yet collapsing under the weight of its visitors# feet.Skye can — and Mark Crothall congratulated the Skyetime campaign for pointing this out — accommodate half a million visitors, and continue to benefit hugely from their spending, particularlycertain adjustments are made to the tourist itinerary.More people should be encouraged to spend a quiet and infinitely rewarding week in Elgol or Waternish, in all four seasons, than take a whistle-stop, bucket list summer tour of the Storr, the Fairy Pools and back to the bridge.And of course, local and national government should do much more to improve the basic infrastructure of the island, from roads and parking areas to public transport and public toilets.Skye has bucked the trend of the rest of the north-western Highlands and Islands by growing its population and its economy in recent years.That has chiefly been because of the tourist industry. After  years of steady and apparently irreversible decline, the growth quite naturally took everybody by surprise. We should now learn to adapt to it, rather than call it #overtourism# and hope that it goes away."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH2510NCA-web.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 25th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

Today we come together - community, council, funders and key contributors - to celebrate its successful completion. Well done to all involved!”The completion of this second phase of works on council-owned land has created a scenic riverside trail that stretches  metres and connects Bridge Street and Gilford Community Centre to the attractive Woodlands Park, passing the iconic Gilford Mill building along the way.In addition to creating a short section of walkway over the remains of the old millrace and constructing a new footbridge across the millrace, the council undertook associated works to enhance the trail including landscaping, installing street furniture, lighting and interpretative .The second phase has been completed thanks to £, in funds allocated by SOAR’s Local Action Group. This project was part funded under Priority of the Northern Ireland Rural Development Programme - from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the European Union.Chair of SOAR ABC Roisin McAliskey added: “This project has been completed to an exceptionally high standard, and is exemplary ofhow funds from SOAR’s Rural Village Renewal scheme can be used to support the implementation of local village plans.”Open to the public since July, the new trail is already proving to be a popular destination for walkers, runners and cyclists.Welcoming completion of the trail, Jerome Burns, Contracts Manager, Southern Rural Affairs Division at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs  said: “This trail has been completed as part of a suite of village enhancement measures financed through the Village Renewal strand of the Leader Rural Development Programme. It provides a great opportunity for everyone to enjoy the many benefits of outdoor activity, and it is an excellent example of how DAERA is delivering on its vision of a ‘living, working, active landscape valued by everyone.”Given its proximity to Gilford Community Centre, this marvellous amenity set in an attractive riverside setting greatly complements the centre with its excellent indoor and outdoor facilities including a climbing wall, trim trail, picnic tables, pump track, canoe landings and beginners’ canoe slalom course.Alternative Heat are set to expand the firm Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"The council acknowledges with thanks the co-operation of the owners of Gilford Mill, Karl Asset Management, which enabled this project to proceed along with The MWA Partnership Ltd, Landscape Architects and A.G.

The event will also see launch of a groundbreaking new report that outlines a framework for community development.The paper, entitled ‘We Must Dissent’, is the result of a community survey that assessed the human rights of local residents against the major issues facing the area. Amongst the issues identied were concerns around road safety, housing, health, education, and unemployment.Another key issue was the pressures of commercial land speculation in the area, which has presented an obstacle to the community development of the Lanyon Tunnels.Despite planning permission and £.million being granted for the development, plans have been stalled by owners of an adjacent piece of land – which was subject to plans to build a £million office block.In , residents won a legal victory when the High Court ruled that planning approval for office block was unlawful. However, the potential for future plans to develop the land could impede access to the tunnelsgiven the go-ahead.Speaking ahead of next Wednesday’s event, Fionntán Hargey from the Market Development Association said the tunnels development would provide a “massive boost to people’s self esteem”.“It would physically reconnect them to city centre and it would also reconnect them into the economic, social and cultural le of Belfast. “The tunnels got planning permission in , and there is £. million in funding sitting there ready to go, and there are three groups of residents trained up and they’ve got business places developed. We also have updated drawings that have recently been commissioned. “The issue is that there is a private developer who is refusing to grant access to allow the project to go ahead.”He continued: “Next Wednesday will refresh people on the latest concept drawings and give people wider overview of the Redeveloping the Local Economy programme. Our aspiration is that by January we will be launching a report, and we will have several groups of residents with business ideas that are on course for development.” Next Wednesday’s event will take place at pm in the Market Community Centre where guest speaker, Dr Sean Byers, will discuss the economics of community empowerment. There will also be a full project update on the Lanyon Tunnels."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ballotbox_pr8qo2.png","title":"north set for december","story":"POLITICAL parties in the north have put their general election machines in gear after MPs voted for a December  poll.The legislation is expected to be approved by the end of the week when it goes through the House of Lords. MPs votedfor the election by a mammoth margin of  votes to .Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is ready to fight a “tough” election while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the snap poll is a “once-in-a-generation” opportunity to transform the country.DUP Leader Arlene Foster said it is right the people of Northern Ireland have their say through the ballot box.“The DUP will use this opportunity to campaign strongly to send a message that Northern Ireland is better in the Union of the United Kingdom and we cannot be separated economically from Great Britain,” she said.“We have a record of speaking up for Northern Ireland in Westminster and delivering for everyone in Northern Ireland.“At a time of great uncertainty as to who will form the next government how Northern Ireland votes will matter as never before.“Unionists need their strongest team ed to so that Northern Ireland’s interests are protected in the next Parliament.That team is the DUP.“This election will matter and we will be campaigning for every vote as we take our message to the people.”Reacting to news of a pre-Christmas election, Sinn Féin Leader in the North Michelle O’Neill said it is an opportunity to reject the DUP, reject the Tories and reject the destructive role of Westminster on the north. “It is a welcome opportunity for the people of the north to have their say on the looming disaster of Brexit,” she said.#It is a chance to reject the DUP and the Tories, to reject Brexit and the Westminster chaos and its destructive influence on the north of Ireland.#Sinn Féin has strong candidates who work tirelessly on behalf of their constituents, and we stand ready to fight this election. “Sinn Féin has successfully made the case to the Irish government and Europe that the north’s special circumstances needed to be recognised to protect our economy against the Brexit catastrophe, to avoid any hardening of the border and to protect the Good Friday Agreement. “The DUP have ignored the democratic wishes of the people of the north, of business, of farmers, of retailers. The people of the north did not consent to Brexit. “There is no good Brexit for Ireland. “Westminster is in chaos. It has no answers and no solutions.“The Brexit debacle has shown that Westminster cannot, has not and will never act in the interests of the people of the north. “Your interests in this election are best served by voting Sinn Féin for a dferent future by sending a clear message to the British government that we want control of our own future through a referendum on Irish unity.#Alliance Leader Naomi Long said her party is best-placed to unite Remain voices.“This election will be mainly focused around Brexit and Alliance has always been clear there is no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit,” she said.“Therefore it will be an opportunity for people to have their say and elect MPs who want to avoid a hard border, protect the Good Friday Agreement and attend Westminster to represent their interests. “We are uniquely placed to do that, as the Alliance surge seen in May’s local government and European Elections showed the party could reach across all sections of our community and gain support from everywhere.“We have been preparing for an election for some time, as it is clear this Parliament is hopelessly ided and the Government has no legitimacy. Northern Ireland voted to Remain. “If people vote for Alliance candidates, we can increase the representation of progressive, pro-Remain MPs and articulate that voice loudly at Westminster.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dup olive branch to nationalists on irish language","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She said ersity and dference must be met with \"a spirit of respect and understanding for the other point of view\".Despite her olive branch to nationalists, Mrs Foster accused Sinn Fein of shirking its political duties. \"Whether in local council chambers, London or Brussels, it is the DUP that is at the centre of the debate,\" she said.On Brexit, she said her party wanted a deal which didnt leave Northern Ireland behind.

Belfast shoppers have no appetite for Christmas electionBrexit likely to dominate on hustings in Northern IrelandEarlier, MPs voted by  to  to reject a Labour amendment for the proposed polling day to be moved to December  — three days earlier than ministers wanted.The parties here were quick out of the starting blocks following the vote.DUP leader Arlene Foster welcomed the election being held on December  and said it is “right that the people of Northern Ireland have their say through the ballot box”. data-dfpadtargetingColum EastwoodMrs Foster added: “The DUP will use this opportunity to campaign strongly to send a message that Northern Ireland is better in the Union of the United Kingdom and we cannot be separated economically from Great Britain.“We have a record of speaking up for Northern Ireland in Westminster and delivering for everyone in Northern Ireland.At a time of great uncertainty as to who will form the next Government, Northern Ireland votes will matter as never before.Arlene Foster“Unionists need their strongest team ed so that Northern Ireland’s interests are protected in the next Parliament. That team is the DUP.“This election will matter and we will be campaigning for every vote as we take our message to the people.”Incoming Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken, who has attracted criticism by ruling out his party stepping aside in certain constituencies — including North Belfast — to allow DUP candidates a clear run, said Northern Ireland needs to elect UUP MPs who will stand against the Prime Minister’s plans, which will destroy the Union. data-dfpadtargetingLady Sylvia HermonHe said: “This is the most important election the people of the United Kingdom have ever faced.“Boris Johnson’s deal with the EU is an existential threat to the Union. It puts a border in the Irish Sea and places Northern Ireland on the window ledge of the Union.“This election will be an opportunity to send Ulster Unionist MPs to Westminster who will not be patsies to a Tory Government or ever agree to a border down the Irish Sea.“Northern Ireland has been betrayed by Boris Johnson’s Conservative Government and we need to send a clear message to him and his advisers that we will not sit back and let him destroy the Union.”Sinn Fein has already selected a number of candidates to contest the long-expected Westminster election, including Belfast Lord Mayor John Finucane to challenge DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds’ slim majority in North Belfast.The party’s vice-president Michelle O’Neill said the vote was an opportunity for people “to have their say on the looming disaster of Brexit”.It is a chance to reject the DUP and the Tories, to reject Brexit and the Westminster chaos and its destructive influence on the north of Ireland.Michelle O’Neill“Sinn Fein has successfully made the case to the Irish Government and Europe that the north’s special circumstances needed to be recognised to protect our economy against the Brexit catastrophe, to avoid any hardening of the border and to protect the Good Friday Agreement.“The DUP have ignored the democratic wishes of the people of the north, of business, of farmers, of retailers.“The people of the north did not consent to Brexit.“There is no good Brexit for Ireland. Westminster is in chaos. It has no answers and no solutions. The Brexit debacle has shown that Westminster cannot, has not and will never act in the interests of the people of the north.”SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the election will be a defining moment for Brexit and every opportunity to defend the interests of people, businesses and communities must be taken.He said: “For three years the democratic decision taken by people in Northern Ireland to reject a border on this island, to maintain the free and frictionless relationship we enjoy with Europe and to sustain our fragile peace has been wilfully ignored by successive Conservative Governments and by the DUP. The coming election is an opportunity to reject the politics of ision and deadlock.“This island’s destiny is being decided at Westminster. Like it or not, the only way to prevent the kind of outcome that would devastate our communities is to show up and vote it down.“Our MPs have, with the exception of Sylvia Hermon, either facilitated this disaster or stood outside on the lawn shouting in.“They have failed to defend our interests. It’s time to give the electorate a chance to cast their verdict on that failure.”Alliance leader Naomi Long said her party is best placed to unite Remain voices here. “This election will be mainly focused around Brexit and Alliance has always been clear there is no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit,” she said.“Therefore it will be an opportunity for people to have their say and elect MPs who want to avoid a hard border, protect the Good Friday Agreement and attend Westminster to represent their interests.“Northern Ireland voted to Remain. If people vote for Alliance candidates, we can increase the representation of progressive, pro-Remain MPs and articulate that voice loudly at Westminster.”A TUV spokesman said: “It has been clear for sometime that this Parliament was incapable of delivering anything. The election is long overdue. \"The Prime Minister says that he will be fighting on the basis of getting “Brexit done” but in support of an agreement which is not Brexit for the whole UK, but only for GB. It would leave Northern Ireland in the waiting room for a united Ireland, with the Union riven by a border down the Irish Sea.\" "},{"url":null,"title":"general election unionists pen letter urging uups aiken not to split vote in north belfast","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The -member board will be made up of five members from each company plus Mr Taes, who is locked in as CEO for five years.The firms said the new company would be able to meet the challenges of powertrain electrication, connectivity and autonomous driving “with speed and capital efficiency”.The combined company will be able to share in the cost of developing those technologies with their “strong global RD footprint”, they said, adding that will also save on investments in vehicle s and save money with greater purchasing power.Both companies “share the conviction that there is compelling logic for a bold and decisive move that would create an industry leader with the scale, capabilities and resources to capture successfully the opportunities, and manage effectively the challenges in the new era in mobility”, the statement said.The merger decision comes about five months after a similar deal with French rival Renault fell apart, mostly over French government concern about the role of Renault’s Japanese alliance partner Nissan. There were no signs of resistance to this deal, beyond concerns for jobs.The companies said head offices would continue to operate in France, Italy and the US, and shares would be traded in the main exchanges in those three countries. The parent company would be based in the Netherlands, as is currently the case with Fiat Chrysler.PSA Group’s ownership of Vauxhall has led to fears that the brand’s Ellesmere Port site is at risk as a result of the merger.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The Vauxhall plant in Ellesmere Port Speaking before the deal was approved by the boards of Fiat Chrysler and PSA Peugeot, Professor David Bailey of Birmingham Business School said the plant “could be sacriced”.He told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “The Italian government will be very keen to preserve capacity at Fiat in Italy and it’s also very underutilised at the moment.“The French government is a part-shareholder of Peugeot so it will also be keen to maintain jobs and capacity in France.“I have a real fear thatthis merger goes ahead then the likes of Ellesmere Port, which is actually a very efficient plant, could be sacriced to get the sort of savings that the company is looking for especially in the context of all the uncertainty over Brexit.”Car manufacturers around the world have been hit by a reduction in sales, with UK car production for the first nine months of the year at its lowest level since .Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Tradersshow , cars were produced in the UK in the first three quarters of , representing a .% deficit year-on-year.The SMMT said the continued threat of a no-deal Brexit has caused investment in the industry to stall."},{"url":null,"title":"490211","story":"Slaughtneil and Dunloy will do battle on Sunday weekin the Ulster hurling final at Armaghs Athletic Grounds.

Whilst the Brexit process, even after three years and more, remains in limbo, with Parliament still to sign off a final Withdrawal Agreement, No Deal, People’s Vote or General Election before detailed trade negotiations can begin, political Unionism is not well-placed. Characterised by disarranged and expedient strategic thinking, it seems ill equipped for relevant political discourse even with the broader pro-Union constituency, many of whom see a need to re-evaluate long held positions. Unionism has moved beyond an age of careless and stereotypical single labels. Within the pro-Union constituency identities are hyphenated and erse. Some identy as pro-Union, economic-unionist, civic-unionist, liberal-unionist and cultural-unionist or a fluid combination of two or more to ying degrees. A large proportion voted to remain in the EU and, in an increasingly personalised society, have no major issues with the delivery of marriage equality, the de-criminalisation of abortion and the provision of choice within ethical parameters. They also see a need to reach accommodation and exercise perspective without bias on rights, cultural and language issues which currently serve as a forum for mutually exclusive combat between the two major parties. In pursuit of their Brexit strategies, the unionist parties, mainly the DUP, instead of engaging in the modern issue-centred discourse which the debate requires, have been content to wrongly categorise Brexit as mainly a constitutional issue and rely on the de-sensitisation of its constituency to the blurred truth, spin and inaccuracies promoted by the Leave campaign. In an act of collective self-deception, it took a reckless gamble with the future and has served to produce the opposite of what it claimed to prioritise with ergence from the remainder of the United Kingdom, a situation which is not itself unusual for the DUP and other Unionists. It grasped an opportunity to wring money from Westminster and allied itself closely to a questionably optimistic pro-Brexit  but in so doing, failed to address the broader ramications of what Brexit could mean for Northern Ireland, socially, culturally and crucially, in terms of reconciliation and stability. It ignored not just the large and erse Remain vote but Unionists, already disenchanted by lack of movement on social issues and concerned by economic and political uncertainty. Had it explored the possibilities within the Good Friday Agreement structures which it now so vigorously defends and embraced the North-South Bodies more energetically, a process might have produced an internalised all-island solution with EU endorsement which facilitated preferred aspirations. Notably, the Ulster Unionist Party moved belatedly toward this position. Now, presented by proposals it does not like, yet facilitated through its tactics, the main party of unionism seems likely to adopt the default position of retrenchment to a place of fear and resistance. Abandoned by erstwhile friends in Westminster who are the epitome of political insincerity and who, seeing Northern Ireland as a handicap to Brexit, have made their priorities clear, this seems a forlorn hope likely to add to the current sadness of spirit within unionism flowing from the trickle-down dys of the DUP leadership. The DUP engaged in a mutually commodied accommodation more to do with opportunism than leadership and the outcome could be predicted. Communal conflict has remained in the minds of too many of its political leaders and this, allied to narrow defensive and cultural politics has led unionism, already discredited by expense scandals which lay bare the moral and pampered relativism of unionist politicians, into a cul-de-sac. As many voters, no longer prepared to be associated with political mediocrity abandon the toxic terminology and one agenda politics of unionist to opt for a pro-Union identity, political unionism needs a re-boot. Those who wish to lead could begin with a robust analysis of the turmoil and abandon the self-deception that Northern Ireland is a place where the will of a unionist majority can always prevail. Unionism is living in the long shadow of Home Rule where diminishing support at Westminster with demographic and changing generational profiles in Northern Ireland indicate that the maintenance of a pro-Union position is no longer guaranteed on the basis of a communal headcount and rests on persuasion for a preferred future. A post-Brexit world that will present challenges is unpredictable, but unionism must look for opportunities that may also present to re-generate. Too often it has lacked an ear for the wrong notes. The Brexit deal which Boris Johnston has brought back from Brussels with its proposals for Northern Ireland bears all the hallmarks of effective lobbying by a business sector, supported by Remain parties, anxious to protect trade and explore opportunities for growth but the obvious uncertainty and confusion of Ministers indicates cause for concern and that all the boxes are not yet ticked that Northern Ireland could be worse off than at present. The clumsy manner in which the values and spirit of the Good Friday Agreement are appearing to be compromised and thrown over by Westminster only serves to tighten the knots. To meet the challenges, Unionism needs to inject stability and focus on a shared future to address the developing situation and build a consensus to solve potential problems across and within regulatory and alignment areas. Livelihoods and public services depend on this being resolved. Now is the time for problem-solving coalitions to build an Agreed Northern Ireland. It will not be achieved by tokenistic changes of label from traditional to expedient grandstanding on second-hand radical liberalismyou still enable sectarianism, segregation and prejudice. The values and attitudes which inform actions are how unionism will be measured and it is presently found wanting by large swathes of its constituency. Substance will always be more important than style and it is the only ethical basis on which you can create the conditions for the realisation of political ideas. Late in the day, Unionism can benefit by sharing responsibility for creating a transformed Northern Ireland and abandoning any desire to dominate the old. Brexit seems to be consigning the dying embers of that particular flame to the dustbin.

Trees, woods and forests help people feel better, encourage more active lestyles and alleviate the symptoms of some debilitating conditions. So, it makes perfect sense to combine your daily exercise with a trip to the great outdoors. Derry is home to stunning woodland and riverside walks such as the recently restored Ness Woods with its impressive new adventure playpark for children.You also have Burntollet, Brackfield and Prehen Woods - which dates back to the s – amongst others.A spokesperson for the Woodland Trust expounded on the countless benefits of spending time in woodlands saying scientic studies have shown that “green exercise” can improve self-esteem and mood, as well as reducing stress, anxiety disorders and depression. She explained: “On top of that autumn offers the keen nature watcher the opportunity to enjoy the flurry of wildle gearing up for winter. “At this time of year you can spot migrant fieldfares feeding on hawthorn berries or catch a glimpse of jays burying acorns for winter, which in turn makes them excellent tree planters as they usually leave a few behind. “Combine that with the vibrant autumn colour on offer and what’s not to like about being outside.”She continued: “Prehen Wood is one of the Woodland Trust’s rare and irreplaceable ancient woods, dating back as far as . “The woodland is a natural treasure trove, a place of great beauty offering a peaceful walk along a looped pathway – and all on the doorstep of the city. “Venturing  miles south of the city and into the Faughan Valley you can explore  Woodland Trust woodlands offering beautul walks with picturesque views including Burntollet Wood, Brackfield Wood, Kilaloo Wood, Oaks Wood and Bonds Glen. With neighbours Ness Country Park owned by NIEA this area offers bountul choice for visitors to enjoy.” googletag.cmd.push   Prehen Wood Prehen Wood is a remnant of the extensive woodland that once covered most of the River Foyle from the Craigavon Bridge to County Tyrone. When English planters came to Derry in , Sir Henry Docwra, the then governor, wrote in his memoirs that he sent men daily from the city over to these woods to bring back timber and that they had to fight for it daily.The Wood was once part of the Prehen House Estate, which in  totalled  hectares. After the first world war the estate was sold off in pieces, including the remaining woods, which were sold in  for timber production.A local outcry ensued about the imminent destruction of the woodland and the editor of a local paper took up the cause, calling for some timber to be left standing. Prehen Wood was spared and is viewed as a “green lung” for the people of Derry.With a lot of support from the Prehen Historical and Environmental Society, the Woodland Trust acquired the Woods at Prehen to conserve it for future generations.Prehen Wood made up of beech, oak, ash and birch trees is known for its bluebells, but it also boasts over sixty natural plants species including anemones and orchids, wildle such as long-eared owls, the native red squirrel, badgers and sparrowhawks, as well as a sculpture trail. Solace  Romantic poet, John Keats, in an ode to Autumn described it as the season of mists and mellow fruitfulness.George McLaughlin of the Prehen Historical and Environmental Society recalled that line as he spoke of the beauty of Prehen Woods and invited people to explore local woodlands at this time of year.He said: Where better to be than in Prehen Woods in the Autumn, or at any time of the year, although bluebell time is recognised as the best time of year. Autumn is the next best time to experience our wonderful ancient woodlands.Your impression dfers depending on the time of day you visit, he explained: In the morning when we have the first frost of Autumn you can see intricate patterns of the spiders webs stretching from twig to twig mysteriously created during the night.Early morning is a good time for wildle watching at the aptly named foxes corner of the woodland. You may see one or more of the famous foxes of Prehen or be lucky enough to witness theof the Prehen red squirrel.At midday a heavenly beauty is created by the Autumn sunshine filtering through the canopy of the many ieties of tree. In todays busy world, there is something relaxing and healing about the feeling of solace to be found in an ancient woodland.”Over Halloween the woods take on a dferent complexion, George explained: In the evening time or in the glowing as they call it in Ireland, and especially at Halloween mysterious shadowy figures seem to appear from behind every ancient tree. Are these the famous ghosts of Prehens fabled past The screeching of long eared owls and the raucous call of the jays all add to the seasonal spookiness of the special creation that is Prehen ancient woodland.This Autumn season of mists and fruitfulness certainly rings true of a woodland at this time of year where theres an abundance of berries, nuts, acorns and toadstools to be found.

He was jailed for three years in December  for causing death by dangerous driving and spent another three years on license.Marty’s parents, Martin and Elizabeth, have had to live with the consequences of the driver’s actions for the rest of their lives. It has also impacted on the lives of his brothers Richard and Ryan, and sisters Michelle and Anne.This week the Department of Justice launched a public consultation into a Sentencing Review. One of the offences up for debate are those “which may result in death, including causing death by dangerous driving”.It seeks the public’s views on whether the current maximum sentence of  years should be increased to le imprisonment or increased to a higher fixed number of years.The Department confirmed to the Derry News that a decision can be taken on these legislative changes in the absence of a minister.The Gallagher family are supportive of le imprisonment being introduced for such offences.Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, Marty’s father described him as a “great son” who got on with everybody and raised a lot of money for charities through his running.Martin said his son would’ve been a good footballer and got involved in competitive running when he was  or -years-old.On the day Marty was killed, his father was working and didn’t see him before he went into town but said he was joking about with his mother before he left.Martin and his we slept on the third floor of the house with Marty and Ryan on the bottom floor. About am Ryan burst through the door saying, “he’s dead, he’s dead”, and when they asked who they were left in a state of shock. “The man killed Martin at am and then went on to a party,” Mr Gallagher said. googletag.cmd.push  Photo: Marty Gallagher with friend Barry Smith after London marathon No closure Martin and Elizabeth were initially asked to call to the Racecourse Road to identy him but a PSNI sergeant then said it wouldn’t be possible because it was a crime scene. The police sergeant, who still keeps in touch with the family and whom Mr Gallagher described as a “good man”, wanted to spare them the trauma of seeing Marty’s injuries.The following day they were also advised against seeing their son at the morgue but when the coffin was brought home Mr Gallagher said they were in disbelief and it brought “no closure”. “You’re wondering was that Martin and waiting for him to walk through the door,” he added.The man responsible for his death appeared in court for the first time on Martin’s birthday, February . He was sentenced in December  with police saying it was one of the quicker cases of its kind to pass through the courts.“First of all we tried for murder and they wouldn’t give it to us,” Martin recalled. “Then we tried for manslaughter and they wouldn’t give us that either, why, I don’t know.“I think the reason it went through so quick was because the girl testied who was in the back and actually shouted to the driver, ‘Jesus, there’s a fella crossing the road’. Martin was about a foot away from reaching the footpath.“That person who killed Martin was full of drugs and drink but the police couldn’t say when he took the drugs.“We were hoping that he would get at least fourteen years. What they’re trying to do now in England, Scotland and Wales is bring in le for le, but they’re not bringing it in in Northern Ireland.When told the news of proposals that are now on the table in NI to Increase the maximum sentence to le imprisonment for the three serious driving offences resulting in death or grievous bodily injury, Martin was fully supportive, believing it may be the deterrent needed to make drivers take more care.This would mirror the current maximum sentence available for offences such as manslaughter, rape, shooting or wounding with intent to commit grievous bodily harm. Public support Two months ago the same man responsible for their son’s death was convicted of a number of driving offences but was given a suspended sentence.“Ten years later he has never said he was sorry,” Martin stated, “I will never forgive him.” An emotional Martin said, “it’s like part of our le is gone,” as he implored anyone ever considering drink-driving to think about the suffering of families affected by such tragedies.“You live from day-to-day for your other children. You might’ve seen the ad on TV about the man living with depression who pulls the mask off at night, you just put a front on for people.“It gets no easier over ten years, people say it gets easier, it doesn’t, you learn to live with it just that’s it. If you didn’t have a good family and marriage, it would wreck your family.”And every time he crosses paths with his son’s killer it makes it worse, he added.Support from the local community has helped to lt the family’s spirits over the years. Last weekend  members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club ran the Dublin marathon in memory of Marty.One of the founding members of the club, Harry McNulty, ran his st and final marathon on the day – Marty was a prodigy of Harry’s when he joined Foyle Valley.“With Marty’s run every year we’ve raised about pound, for Derry charities. Over , people turned out at the start of the month.“It’s great to see what they thought of Martin and the money going to charity.“Last year we gave Altnagelvin a bed and it has Martin’s name on it but we try to spread it out. “The support gives us a lt and it just shows you what people thought of Martin,” Mr Gallagher concluded. .

He was jailed for three years in December  for causing death by dangerous driving and spent another three years on license.Marty’s parents, Martin and Elizabeth, have had to live with the consequences of the driver’s actions for the rest of their lives. It has also impacted on the lives of his brothers Richard and Ryan, and sisters Michelle and Anne.This week the Department of Justice launched a public consultation into a Sentencing Review. One of the offences up for debate are those “which may result in death, including causing death by dangerous driving”.It seeks the public’s views on whether the current maximum sentence of  years should be increased to le imprisonment or increased to a higher fixed number of years.The Department confirmed to the Derry News that a decision can be taken on these legislative changes in the absence of a minister.The Gallagher family are supportive of le imprisonment being introduced for such offences.Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, Marty’s father described him as a “great son” who got on with everybody and raised a lot of money for charities through his running.Martin said his son would’ve been a good footballer and got involved in competitive running when he was  or -years-old.On the day Marty was killed, his father was working and didn’t see him before he went into town but said he was joking about with his mother before he left.Martin and his we slept on the third floor of the house with Marty and Ryan on the bottom floor. About am Ryan burst through the door saying, “he’s dead, he’s dead”, and when they asked who they were left in a state of shock. “The man killed Martin at am and then went on to a party,” Mr Gallagher said. googletag.cmd.push  Photo: Marty with friend Barry Smith at London Marathon ‘No closure’ They were initially asked to call to the Racecourse Road to identy him but a PSNI sergeant then said it wouldn’t be possible because it was a crime scene. The police sergeant, who still keeps in touch with the family and whom Mr Gallagher described as a “good man”, wanted to spare them the trauma of seeing Marty’s injuries.The following day they were also advised against seeing their son at the morgue but when the coffin was brought home Mr Gallagher said they were in disbelief and it brought “no closure”. “You’re wondering was that Martin and waiting for him to walk through the door,” he added.The man responsible for his death appeared in court for the first time on Martin’s birthday, February . He was sentenced in December  with police saying it was one of the quicker cases of its kind to pass through the courts.“First of all we tried for murder and they wouldn’t give it to us,” Martin recalled. “Then we tried for manslaughter and they wouldn’t give us that either, why, I don’t know.“I think the reason it went through so quick was because the girl testied who was in the back and actually shouted to the driver, ‘Jesus, there’s a fella crossing the road’. Martin was about a foot away from reaching the footpath.“That person who killed Martin was full of drugs and drink but the police couldn’t say when he took the drugs.“We were hoping that he would get at least fourteen years. What they’re trying to do now in England, Scotland and Wales is bring in le for le, but they’re not bringing it in in Northern Ireland.When told the news of proposals that are now on the table in NI to Increase the maximum sentence to le imprisonment for the three serious driving offences resulting in death or grievous bodily injury, Martin was fully supportive, believing it may be the deterrent needed to make drivers take more care.This would mirror the current maximum sentence available for offences such as manslaughter, rape, shooting or wounding with intent to commit grievous bodily harm. Public support Two months ago the same man responsible for their son’s death was convicted of a number of driving offences but was given a suspended sentence.“Ten years later he has never said he was sorry,” Martin stated, “I will never forgive him.” An emotional Martin said, “it’s like part of our le is gone,” as he implored anyone ever considering drink-driving to think about the suffering of families affected by such tragedies.“You live from day-to-day for your other children. You might’ve seen the ad on TV about the man living with depression who pulls the mask off at night, you just put a front on for people.“It gets no easier over ten years, people say it gets easier, it doesn’t, you learn to live with it just that’s it. If you didn’t have a good family and marriage, it would wreck your family.”And every time he crosses paths with his son’s killer it makes it worse, he added.Support from the local community has helped to lt the family’s spirits over the years. Last weekend  members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club ran the Dublin marathon in memory of Marty.One of the founding members of the club, Harry McNulty, ran his st and final marathon on the day – Marty was a prodigy of Harry’s when he joined Foyle Valley.“With Marty’s run every year we’ve raised about pound, for Derry charities. Over , people turned out at the start of the month.“It’s great to see what they thought of Martin and the money going to charity.“Last year we gave Altnagelvin a bed and it has Martin’s name on it but we try to spread it out. “The support gives us a lt and it just shows you what people thought of Martin,” Mr Gallagher concluded. .

For boys, it’s Leos who are assumed to be the most self-assured.The study, which analysed the opinions of , teachers, children and parents in the UK, found that Brits are quick to make assumptions about a child based on their first name, with strong stereotypes associated with each of the names featured in this year’s top  baby names list. googletag.cmd.push The national results found that children named George are considered by both adults and their peers to be the most intelligent in class, with over one in  believing this is the most intellectual name from this year’s top  boys names list.

Two days later, two further sinkholes appeared, and a huge split broke the pitch in half and spread to the clubhouse and car park. The grounds were immediately shut down, and the misery was compounded a few weeks later when the club were relegated from senior football for the first time in  years.This season they have made use of alternate venues as the work continues to re-establish their own home, with a GoFundMe page raising tens of thousands towards the project. The club – who have appeared in six of the last  Monaghan Senior Club Championship finals, with the most recent appearance in  – have secured their position back in the senior ranks for next season, but first they must deal with the business of Ulster.For Foreglen, it’s a familiar position. At the start of the Derry championship they were ranked as dark horses, but were few people’s out and out favourites. Bar a first round replay against Faughanvale they barely faltered on the way to the showpiece, but still there were few in their corner against Claudy. It mattered little as they held the Mitchel’s to one score – a free – in the second half to claim a - to - win. O’Brien’s coach Muldoon believes they can take serious confidence not just from the result, but from the nature of the performance.“I think after the replay with Faughanvale, as the championship went on our confidence just got better and better and we’re going into this game now off the back of a big performance,” the Ballinderry man told the Derry Post. “My team talks are very brief before a game because we do the work in training. The boys know on the day what they have to do, who they’re marking, what the plan is for kick outs – it’s all organised.“We’ll sit down this week and look at Magheracloone. There’s not a lot of information or videos out there but we’ll get our planning done and be ready for the challenge. It will probably be a case of giving it five or ten minutes and then making the switches that we need to.“It’s bonus territory for us, and it’s unknown territory too. We know they’re going to be a very good, strong side and we’re expecting a tough challenge but it’s one that we’re all looking forward to.”From the scenes on the pitch in Celtic Park after their victory two weeks ago to the social media posts from Foreglen clubhouse in the following days, the togetherness of the whole community has come to the fore. Even as a man not from the club, Muldoon said it was something special, and something they’d like to repay. “After the final whistle I stood back and saw my two boys running onto the pitch in their Foreglen tops and I shed a tear. They’re a small parish, and I know a lot of them are the same, but in that clubhouse on the Sunday night, I’d never seen a crowd like it. “We said to the lads last week that when it came to Ulster there was a choice to train a few times or put the heads down and give it a rattle. We want to set an example for the county and to be fair they’ve put the shoulder to the wheel for their community.“It’s a day out for everyone to jump on a bus together and head down. Who knows what’s going to happen, but we’ll all be sticking together as a team and with the supporters and we’ll give it everything for them.” googletag.cmd.push FORGET ODDSDespite all their dficulties last year, Magheracloone still managed to reach the senior championship semi-final, defeated by eventual title winners Scotstown. The enormity of the task at hand isn’t lost on Muldoon, but he insisted that the underdog tag hasn’t been an issue for his men so far – they’re relishing it.“We’ve been happy enough to take the underdogs tag. Before the Claudy game there were a lot of people who thought we had no chance, but we didn’t care,” he insisted. “The boys all got it out of their heads and we focused on ourselves.“To be fair, Claudy were rightly favourites because they were head and shoulders above anyone in the league, but we knew what we were about and we knew what we were doing. The whole favourites thing is all part of the build-up, but we won’t read too much into it this time either.”Both played five championship matches on their way to their provincial titles, with the Monaghan side both scoringand concedingmore than Foreglen, who scored - and conceded -. Even with county level players like Gavin Doogan and Tomas Freeman on the other side, Muldoon reiterated his faith in the O’Brien’s defence, and he feels the forward line can take confidence knowing that they will get opportunities.“In training and in all our games we have the same set up – it’s man to man marking, no sweepers and no hiding places, and we’ve no plans to change that,” explained the coach. “In the build-up to the final nobody was giving our defence any credit, it was all about the Claudy forwards, and vice versa about our attack.“Our defence is tight, the boys talk to one another, you have the likes of Oisin and Shane Duffy in there and they’re all told what to be doing before the game. Them boys don’t have the cover of a sweeper, but they do their job, they back themselves against their man and they have confidence as a unit.”For the seasoned professionals like Oisin Duffy, Mark McCormick and Kevin O’Connor, the pressure of an Ulster quarter-final won’t weigh too heavy on the shoulders, but Muldoon said he is particularly delighted that the younger squad members, like Liam O’Hara, Sean, Cahir and Caolan O’Connor, have all shown that they can handle the mental pressure of the big occasion. It’s a quality he feels will stand them in good stead come Sunday afternoon.“I sat down on the Saturday night before the game with Claudy and rang some of them young lads and said to them that I knew what they were feeling, and they’d got us there through talent and enthusiasm. They worked hard all year in the gym, but they had to go out and treat it as any other game,” he explained. “In fairness to them they did, and I thought every one of them were immense. “Now getting the chance to play in Ulster – it’s a brilliant experience for them young cubs and it’s one that will definitely stand to them.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Joanne and Stephanie welcome a wide range of clients to their studio, from alternative therapy veterans to those who are new to holistic healing techniques.

There is something haunting about the idea of a lost love a relationship that never quite ran its natural course and could be reignited someday. Perhaps it’s not surprising that one in five people long to get back with an old flame, and now a new television show from ITV is searching for pining lovers in the Derry area. The team who make ‘Long Lost Family’ have been reuniting people with missing family members for a decade now they want to bring romantic soulmates together after years apart. googletag.cmd.push They have approached Derry Now for help, believing that the recent history of Northern Ireland may have indirectly resulted in a few star-crossed lovers. The turbulence of The Troubles and waves of migration to and from Northern Island in the latter part of the th century mean many couples may have been separated by circumstances. If this sounds like you, they want to hear your story. The programme idea was inspired by the story of KT Robbins, an American serviceman who fell in love with an eighteen-year-old French girl, Jeannine Ganaye in  and recently reunited with her after  years apart. The Derry area has provided similarly heart-warming stories in the past. Avril Trenklet and Bob Fanuce proved that true love never dies when they wed nearly  years after first meeting. Local factory girl, Avril first met US Marine Bob in  when he was stationed at a Naval base in Derry. After a whirlwind romance the couple got engaged but Bob got cold feet and called it off. As the years passed and they got on with their lives, both marrying other people and having families, but Avril says she always knew in her heart that one day they would be together again. One day out of the blue Avril, who was now widowed, got an email from Bob, sparking their reunion and shortly afterwards a second proposal. This time the wedding went ahead and the pair finally got their happy ending. The Long Lost Family team are looking for more lost loves like Bob and Avril. They only intend to reunite people who are currently single and happy to meet as friends … who knows, the spark might still be there. So,you want to reconnect with someone special from your past call    or email longlostloves@walltowall. .

British Prime Minister Harold Wilsons oft-quoted aphorism proved true once again this week, with the EU granting Britain yet another Brextension.March  came and went, October  the same, then, on Monday past, British Prime Minister Boris Johnston accepted Friday, January , , as the day Britain would, maybe, finally leave the EU. Undeterred by the interminable political machinations, multi- disciplinary artist, Duncan McKellar, on Simdau ast staged his “Giant Artwork Against Hard Borders” fields adjacent to Killeas Church of the Immaculate Conception.Speaking before the event, Mr McKellar said he was “very happy” with the support from the gathering local communities. He had plotted out a -metre-wide circle in two fields taking in both sides of the border with participants standing beside little bamboo markers he had placed in the ground.“It is at the same time, a protest against hard borders and a celebration of the communities around the hard borders. “Hopefully, we will end up with some nice video from the drone and some nice photographs,” he said.Mr McKellar arrived in Killea  days before the “Giant Artwork” took place and said the local “engagement” had been “fantastic.”He said: “People are enthused by the novelty of the idea. There is a palpable warmth. The Irish stereotype holds up very well.“I have been getting lots of help and lots of advice. People have been bending over backwards to help. Just this morning, Ive laid sawdust at the entrance of the field to cover up the mud and Miacuteċeaacutel, who runs the timber merchants, took it round on a truck and said, Anything I can do just let me know.”Introducing himself to the assembled crowd, Mr McKellar explained his work often used mirrors and often took place in border communities. He said: “Last year, I managed to organise a long line which stretched for  kilometre on each side of the US   Mexico border.“We also had a huge group of people on the White Clfs on March , the day Brexit was originally meant to happen. “We sent a giant SOS call to mainland Europe with our mirrors.“With the focus turning to the Northern Ireland border, I thought it was an appropriate time to come here. We are going to form a big circle, to symbolise the strength within the community here and also to show the strength of feeling against hard borders because obviously it used to be right there, the checkpoint.“We will walk to the brow of the hill. The border itself is the Liberty Burn at the bottom of the field. The sun will hit the mirrors and, as well as adding a bit of fairy dust to the images and drone footage, they symbolise the human spirit,” said Duncan.Patrick ODonnell who owns a garage in Killea said he got involved in Duncans Giant Artwork Against Hard Borders to support the artist.Patrick said: “I came along this morning to support Duncan and to protest against Brexit. The artistic aspect of the protest appealed to me.“The idea of hands across the border appealed to me. We dont want a hard border again, we dont want a border at all, basically.“As a business person, I think a hard border would be a disaster, a disaster totally,” said Patrick.The next thing Duncan has in the pipeline is maybe an installation in Palestine. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

New projects this year included social prescribing mdash helping people who present to their local GP to get out and about in their local area.New investment in multi-disciplinary teams in GP practices in Down was now being rolled out to the rest of Newry and Mourne. He said the Network was central to that roll-out and CDRCNrsquos experience of social prescribing made the organisation a great source of referrals to local community activities.Cllr Casey said CDRCN along with Community Advice and other umbrella support organisations were key to the delivery of Council services.

We are being terrorised in our homes and our property is being damaged.Mrs Smyth said it was almost impossible to report incidents to the police.ldquoIf we can get through the police often donrsquot respond, she continued. ldquoThese temporary gates have been being put up for almost two years now. Torn down and put up again. Itrsquos the residents who suffer, not the council people for delays in signing off on the workthat needs to be done.The residents are being supported by local Independent councillor Cadogan Enright, who accused the council of being ldquonot exactly on top of their game.He said: ldquoThe need for fences and gates to make the area into a cul-de-sacs was triggered by an emergency situation where pensioners were and still are under siege by a small number of nersquoer-do-wells, culminating with the actual burning down of a pensionerrsquos cottage.ldquoThe council have not been treating this as an emergency. Were it not for the Housing Executive repeatedly replacing the eight temporary steel and wood barriers week after week when they are torn down, the area would be unviable as an area where pensioners can live.He added: ldquoI have proposed a workshop between the social partners led by the PSNI, Housing Executive, council and other partners to agree in detail a step-by-step process for gating orders in writing so that we never again have such a series of dreadful delays.A spokesman for the council said last night: Newry, Mourne and Down District Council can advise that the Northern Ireland Housing Executive has applied to the council for gating orders in the Model Farm area and that the Council is currently following gating order guidance produced by the Department of the Environment.ldquoThis process requires consultation with the Department for Infrastructure and members of the public in the area.

We will eventually cover all old estates, subject to continuing funds and satisfactory contracts.Movements have already been made with the awarding of a number of pre-paint repair contracts and work on all contracts should begin by March or April next year.More programmes of maintenance work are being prepared and will be starting in the - financial year, subject to the approval of the Executiversquos Board.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Uncertainty has surrounded the recent proposals to establish units for educationally sub-normal pupils at Castlewellan.The South Eastern Education and Library Board give approval in January for two new units to be set up at the local controlled primary school.However, plans were revised when the neighbouring school, St Malachyrsquos Primary, decided it wanted to have special ESN units.Board officers decided thatan ESN unit is established at St Malachyrsquos the demand for ESN facilities at Castlewellan Primary mightand therefore only one unit might be necessary at each school.But confusion arose when the Board placed advertisements in a local newspaper about the plans to establish the units.Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, a Board member, was unsure about whether or not the Board had changed its policy and was intended to establish the units at St Malachyrsquos instead of at the controlled school.Mrs Smyth, who has raised the matter on several occasions, told Board members, this week that she was aggrieved about the whole affair and thought that Board officers had acted in a ldquovery surreptitious manner.ldquoThis sort of thing raises suspicions in the community and itrsquos just not good enough,: said Mrs Smyth.However, she was assured by Board chairman, Mr Cecil Kirkwood, that Board officers had not acted in an underhand manner and that there had only been a misunderstanding.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Killyleagh priest had called this week for people to follow the example of friendship shown by more than  Protestants and Roman Catholics who joined together in a special Halloween dinner and concert organised by his church.He is Fr Hugh OrsquoHagan and he was speaking hours after  senior citizens had enjoyed a dinner and concert in St Maryrsquos Hall, organised by the hall management committee.Speaking afterwards Fr OrsquoHagan said that Killyleagh and Shrigley had a unique community, ldquo everywhere has like here, Northern Ireland would be a more peaceful place.Invitations to Thursdayrsquos dinner and concert went out to both sides of the community and Fr OrsquoHagan stressed that he hoped no senior citizen had been forgotten, either Protestant or Roman Catholic.The idea of the dinner mdash which was such a success last year, when he was held for the first time mdash has been widely praised in the town, especially by the senior citizens and Thursday nightrsquos was no exception, with many voting it a big hit.Before the dinner began, Fr OrsquoHagan mdash who has been priest in Killyleagh for over  years and who is the longest serving priest ever in the town mdash welcomed everyone and thanked them for coming.He welcomed especially, the three ministers in the town, the Rev J C Boggs, Rev J D Mark and Rev R E Conn.

preparing to import the generic drug from South America as part of a CF Buyers Club of families.In a desperate attempt to start their son on the drug as quickly as possible, the couple and their family fundraised around pound, to buy Lorcaacuten three months treatment.ldquoWe were so close to getting the generic drug ourselves and that would have been great as Lorcaacuten would have started on it, but we would have still been campaigning and pushing for it, said Jen.ldquoWe have been told that the Department of Health want to copy what NHS England did and get the drug into peoplersquos

and will feature classic songs such as Any Dream Will Do and Close Every Door To Me.Such success has been long on the cards for the Crossgar man who distinguished himself as one of the upcoming stars in local musicals with the St Patrickrsquos Choral Society in Downpatrick.Mark has been a constant help and support to his older brother, Declan, and parents John and Brenda after Declan suffered a

Declan has lived with locked-in syndrome ever since.A video of Mark singing Take Him Home from the musical Les Miserables to Declan went viral in , landing him a spot on The Nolan Show.The emotional rendition of the song, which touches Declan and his parents every time they hear it, and the simple story of the brothersrsquo love and devotion, led to further performances for Mark on RTE.However, it wasnrsquot until this June that he won hearts as the runner-up in Britainrsquos Got Talent.His performance wowed judge Simon Cowell who told him it was the best performance of the series.Despite losing out to  year-old Cha Pensioner Colin Thackery, Markrsquos showcase on the hit show led to musical producers noticing his talent and superb voice.The McMullan family managed to keep the exciting news quiet until last week.Father John explained: ldquoMark was approached by the producer several months ago but we couldnrsquot really say anything.

The choral society gave me a taste for musical theatre and my mum really pushed me to do it.

Leading a presentation on Agriculture and Agri-food, Craig Humes highlighted how dairy farmers will be one of the main farming groups to be ldquostruck by Brexit.ldquo. billion litres of milk are collected from across Northern Irish farms each year.  per cent of this milk produced is then exported south to be processed.ldquoThis could make le extremely dficult for farmersexport tarfs are to be introduced, Craig shared, adding that Dr. Mike Johnston, Chief Executive of the Dairy Council Northern Ireland believes that milk prices could drop by  pence per litre should a no-deal Brexit proceed with such excessive tarfs announced.ldquoIn my opinion, to put it quite simply, dairy farmers will not survive in Fermanagh unless there is a deal, commented Craig.In her presentation on Tourism and Hospitality Rebekah Starrett noted how Fermanagh had over , visitors last year who spent an average of pound. million.ldquoThis is a massive amount of money being spent in this local economy. The tourism and hospitality industry here supports , jobs ndash one of the biggest employment sectors in the county.ldquoIf Brexit happens it could mean some businesses may need to let some staff go and leave people without a job, said Rebekah.Stating that in her opinion Brexit offers the tourism and hospitality sector many innovative opportunities to potentially grow and expand, Rebekah shared some examples.ldquoThere has been a rise in lsquostaycationrsquo ndash the number of UK residents that have been staying and holidaying at homehas shown a three per cent rise in  and is continuing to grow something which would be good for Fermanagh Tourism, explained Rebekah, who also highlighted how Fermanagh is renowned for its celebrity chefs, award-winning restaurants and local produce which will continue to attract visitors to the County.Presenting facts on Business and Cross Border Trade, Nicole McFarlane and Oran OrsquoLoughlin shared how Enniskillen has the lsquotop performing ASDA store in the UKrsquo which was the th best store in Walmart Worldwide Group in  and that an average shopping trip spend by Republic of Ireland shoppers to Enniskillen is euro to euro.ldquoCross Border trade stands at pound. billion for  and Northern Ireland makes up between  to  per cent of total exports from Ireland to the UK and accounts for seven to eight per cent of imports, stated Nicole and Oran, adding that the flow of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will depend on what kind of agreement replaces the current one which is free market trade within the EU. Sharing a positive outlook on how Brexit could impact business trade, the studentsrsquo stated: ldquoBrexit could actually result in more opportunities in more vibrant markets across the world becoming available. Some argue that Brexit could liberate the UK government to sign fresh trade deals with more dynamic markets outside the EU and therefore bolster trade.Whilst presenting his research on how Brexit could impact Student Le, Jordan McClure shared: ldquoStudent le is a vital part of growing up where we learn many things. Brexit has taught me the importance of ensuring that my opinion and voice is heard, especially, when I wasnrsquot the age to vote in the  referendum.ldquoWhilst much of what happens around Brexit is beyond our control one thing for sure is that the potential impact will affect all of our lives. Whatever that may be, it is important that we as students embrace it and make the most of it, he added.Will Greenaway closed the conference by reiterating the potential benefits that could come from Brexit and potential concerns that leaving the EU could have on us in Northern Ireland and especially in Fermanagh.ldquoOur generation of students represent the future of Northern Ireland we are potentially the next generation of business leaders, health care workers and entrepreneurs.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I was shocked by his deliberate isive rhetoric that is stoking anger.Even his own MPs were shocked at his attempt to claim the memory of Jo Cox in support for his demand to leave by October  regardless of the consequences.Describing death threats to MPs as humbug was a new low.Wersquore roughly a month away from potentially crashing out of the EU with no deal on October  and wersquore none the wiser as to how Boris Johnson plans to answer some of the major issues we face.The Prime Minister and his Brexit extremists donrsquot care the damaging impact that a no deal exit would have on our people, on jobs and public services.I have been very clear and consistent about the damage that a no deal Brexit would do.Letrsquos not forget, the people of Cardf South and Penarth voted overwhelmingly to Remain in the  EU Referendum.I will continue to work within my party and across political parties to ensure we arenrsquot dragged out of the EU without a deal against our will.Each day I meet with doctors, nurses, clinicians and patients who are genuinely concerned about the impact of a no deal Brexit on our NHS.Earlier this week I updated the Senedd on how health and social care across Wales are preparing for a no deal Brexit.I agreed to spend poundm of NHS Wales funds to purchase and stockpile essential medical supplies and equipment.To give some context, that poundm could have paid for seven replacement MRI scanners instead.I cannot overstate how much of my time has been taken up on no deal preparation.There is a huge amount of time energy and effort being spent on preparing for the worst possible outcome for our country.That is time energy and effort that should be going into improving health and care services for our staff and the people that they serve.This is not what the people voted for.We have to be honest with ourselves and the public - there is no easy answer to the Brexit farce.That includes my preferred answer of referendum, remain and reform of the EU.The recently announced plan by the Prime Minister to have customs checks in Ireland is a real threat to peace and security.That is not normal.The customs checks that would slow down goods including food and medicines are not normal.The prospect of a Prime Minister breaking the law ndash again ndash at the end of this month to deliver no deal is far from normal.I know any people are tired of Brexit but this is the biggest issue of our generation.Unless we put it back to the people in a referendum then I do not believe we will ever resolve our future within Europe and the UK. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the past he chaired the all-party Parliamentary group on nuisance calls and secured changes to the law to restrict cold telephone calling.ldquoThere have been a number of complaints about the increase in nuisance callers and the rise of the doorstep economy in the Vale of Glamorgan.

This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done.

His father was West African and his mother was Irish.Billy was overlooked by rugby union. However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their sole motive has been about blocking Brexit.I have long thought the only way out of this is a general election.The British people need to be given the opportunity to have a clear out of those politicians who said one thing to get elected and have done another in office.All Labour and Conservative MPs were elected on manestos explicitly promising to respect and honour the referendum result.The people of Penarth deserve better than this.Earlier this month, I was present on the steps of the Senedd as the petition to save the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital was presented to the Assembly.I joined other local representatives and campaigners from Unison to receive the petition, and send a clear message on the health boardrsquos proposals.Under the plans, the -bed older persons rehabilitation ward will close, with services transferring either to the community or Llandough Hospital.Local opinion in Barry is quite clear that the ward should stay, while in Llandough, further expansion of the hospital will cause further pressures on the village.You wonrsquot often catch me standing alongside Unison, but on this we completely agree.These plans need to be dropped.The Royal British Legion have officially launched the  Poppy Appeal, and as ever, I am delighted to pledge my support.It is crucial we commemorate those who made the ultimate sacrice to defend our freedoms, including those from Penarth.Wearing a poppy is an understated yet clear way of demonstrating that, and it also raises vital funds to support current and former servicemen and women and their families.It is often misunderstood as condoning or celebrating war, and that could not be further from the truth. It is respecting those who have fallen.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Royal British Legion for their work. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There is fierce competition to host the All Ireland Fleadh each year as it attracts thousands of visitors and musiciaans from across the world. Councillor Mark BaxterAt Monday night’s meeting Sinn Fein welcomed the success of their motion, tabled by the party’s group leader Darren McNally, which asked council to investigate the feasibility and economic benefits of hosting the Fleadh Cheoil Na hEireann in Armagh.Cllr McNally said it would be ‘a massive economic boost for the entire borough’ with a potential £m for the economy.“I believe Armagh would be a very fitting venue given the rich ancient heritage and culture the city possesses’”#However DUP Cllr Mark Baxter said: ““We are hugely disappointed that we were the only party to vote against this potential colossal spend by council in these very tough economic times. The other parties were quite happy to task officers to investigate bringing the Fleadh Cheoil to Armagh despite the huge cost involved.” “Ironically it was only three weeks ago that Sinn Fein refused to back another much smaller proposal for a community event citing a lack of council resources. I would question in the strongest possible terms the economic benefits and the motives for bringing such an event and why the UUP and Sinn Fein are so keen to bring the event to Armagh which has in the past had some very controversial artists. Indeed we all can point to similar festivals recently held in Belfast where its very clear that ‘unionists’ were not welcome with Pro-IRA chanting and bands imploring the British to “go back home. “I would call on councillors to reflect on this wanton disregard for the public purse and remind them of their responsibilities in delivering first class services for best value. The DUP make no apology for being the champions of low rates in council.”Sinn Fein Cllr Liam Mackle dismissed claims by the DUP‘s Mark Baxter that the motion committed council to a massive spend as untrue.He said: “The passing of this motion gives council officers the freedom to engage with numerous stakeholders holders including Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann who organise the Fleadh Cheoil to get a better understanding of what’s expected of any host venue, Council officers will bring back a report to committee following engagements with local businesses, hospitality sector, community groups and traditional musicians, where Councillors can have an informed debate on its feasibility.“We have seen the DUP on ABC council spend hundreds of thousands of pounds on a whim - on events with no economic benefit to our borough. Their behaviour is somewhat childish, compared to the mature approach of this motion.”Musician Willie calls for better rehabilitation for stroke survivors Coremetrics  Coremetrics

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in .

Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey. APCOA sees this investment as strengthening their position in Northern Ireland and providing a  for increased growth.Combining the existing APCOA expertise and customer base across both countries, this acquisition now makes APCOA a leading mobile parking operator in cashless parking providing convenient, cashless and cost-effective payment options to nearly , parking customers.Both APCOA and NCPS see this as a real opportunity to broaden the strength of services to clients and to improve capabilities by bringing together the best knowledge, systems and operational practice. Kim Challis, regional managing director for APCOA UK  Ireland, said: “The businesses complement each other well across dferent geographies and business sectors and both have strong management and operational teams.  “There are opportunities to share innovation and technology solutions from both companies across the whole business, and also to benefit from the on-going investment and business experience that comes from APCOA UK  Ireland being part of a larger European group. We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business. Combine those factors with the wide range of services and innovative technology we can offer, the possibilities for further growth in Northern Ireland look very strong indeed.”  Philippe Op de Beeck, chief executive of APCOA Parking Group, says the company “profited from healthy organic growth last year”. “In addition, we are currently strengthening our focus on strategic acquisitions.“The group recently acquired Onepark A S in Denmark, after having bought another smaller Swiss company early last year. With every acquisition, we have pursued a clear strategy: not to become a property owner. Thanks to its consistent ‘asset light’ business model, APCOA has established itself as a reliable partner, maximising the value of both private and public property owners’ assets. “At the same time, APCOA offers consumers a range of products and services that are increasingly digital and that span the entire market.” These acquisitions have enabled APCOA to expand its presence in each market and position itself for further profitable growth.
