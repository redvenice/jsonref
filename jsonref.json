As far as we\u0027re concerned we bought this house thinking the garden was this size. So, to me, for builders to just come in and snatch back some land is disgraceful.\u0027We\u0027re going to lose from about a metre at one side to probably two metres at the other.\u0027We\u0027ve tried speaking to our solicitor. But she has basically ignored us. The majority of us are all represented by the same firm - a firm that Wainhomes recommended.\u0027          Pictured: The gardens on the Paddock estate in Cottam, Lancashire that will be cut short because of a mistake by builders Her next-door neighbour Carley Crook faces having her expensive decking and lawn area torn up and reconstructed when contractors reclaim a triangular piece of her garden.She claimed she has approached Wainhomes about compensation for the work to put her garden back together and was told to get an estimate.Ms Crook said: \u0027They are not saying they will pay for it, just that they\u0027ll have a discussion with us about it. Their attitude stinks.\u0027The letters we have had are just awful - just implying they\u0027re doing it whether we like it or not.\u0027To be honest we wouldn\u0027t have bought the house if we\u0027d known it would end up having a smaller garden.\u0027We have contacted the Land Registry to see what they say and they have just told us there are no exact measurements where the boundary is.\u0027On the plans we saw before we bought our house, the gardens were all oblong. The boundary fence was straight.         Six residents of the Paddocks estate in Cottam, Lancashire, were told they will lose land from their back gardens because a boundary fence  (highlighted) was erected in the wrong place\u0027But the new plan that Wainhomes have sent us shows the boundary is now at an angle, meaning we all lose different amounts of garden.\u0027I lose from a third of a metre to almost a metre, but others further along lose a lot more, up to three metres.\u0027The Paddocks development is part of a house-building scheme that has seen thousands of new homes spring up across the north of Preston.Ms Barnes added: \u0027It\u0027s ironic, but across the road Wainhomes have hung a sign on the fence which says: \u0027Think quality. Get it right first time.\u0027 It\u0027s a shame they didn\u0027t get it right with our fence.\u0027Wainhomes says it has apologised to residents after the fencing at the bottom of their gardens was wrongly situated.A company spokesman said it was merely taking back land the householders did not own and informed them on 13 December last year.They added: \u0027The rear fence line to these properties has been erected in the incorrect position and does not follow the legal boundary of the plots which the owners purchased.\u0027The owners are therefore occupying land which legally belongs to the company.         Gemma Barnes (pictured) branded the company \u0027disgusting\u0027 after she was told she would lose three yards of her garden\u0027We have readily acknowledged that this is the company\u0027s error and we have apologised accordingly.\u0027Further letters were sent earlier this month advising the purchasers that the fence realignment works were due to commence and, as a responsible housing developer, we offered to meet any concerned owners.\u0027Those discussions with the purchasers are ongoing as we appreciate that there is a level of inconvenience which we are endeavouring to keep to an absolute minimum.\u0027Wainhomes is one of the leading house builders in the north west of England and has at least 25 developments currently under construction across the region.The developers completed nearly 1,000 home sales in a record-breaking year, and its parent company - the Wain Group - topped the year with £235million in sales.The Paddocks development is a mix of more than 200 three, four and five bedroom houses.The incident in Paddocks development is not the first time Wainhomes has been embroiled in a land grab dispute in the North West.In 2012 the company was accused of \u0027stealing\u0027 half of a woman\u0027s garden in Blackrod near Bolton while she was at work.Amber Addison claimed she returned home to find contractors had moved her boundary fence, taking off a chunk of her garden.She later said Wainhomes had told her an error in the way the garden had been laid out meant she didn\u0027t own all the land."},{"url":null,"title":"Inflation SOARS 1 8 highest level six months petrol energy flight costs","story":"Share this article The news may be seen as vindication for the Bank of England committee that decided to keep the bank\u0027s rate flat earlier this year.

Cheronis argued that this was in violation of the court order not to consume media related to the trial, and sought to have her replaced on the jury.The allegations against Weinstein and the #MeToo movement they triggered did create a sensation in publishing, from the behind-the-scenes stories of reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey (She Said) and Ronan Farrow (Catch and Kill), to fictional interpretations such as This Is Pleasure by Mary Gaitskill and Kirsten Roupenian’s You Know You Want This.In the case of Juror No 11, the book was My Dark Vanessa, the controversial debut by Kate Elizabeth Russell in which an adult woman reevaluates the sexual relationship she had with her teacher as a teenager. The Observer called it “an inversion of Lolita for the #MeToo generation … a book that asks what we have lost and gained in an era that has revolutionised the way we think about sex and power”. Juror No 11 wrote that she “liked a lot about this novel”, praising Russell’s handling of the difficult subject, but found flaws with characterisation in terms of how it related to the central theme. In response to questioning from Justice James Burke, the juror confirmed she was currently reading Vanessa Springora’s memoir Le Consentement, about being preyed on by the writer Gabriel Matzneff at the age of 13 – but, she said, she had not reviewed it yet.Justice Burke denied the motion to have the juror discharged, saying “she apparently is simply reading the book”. The same juror is an author herself, and had at the selection stage been questioned over a book she had written that Cheronis argued was about “predatory older men”. (It has elsewhere been praised as a striking debut.)This week Weinstein’s lead defence lawyer Donna Rotunno made her own venture into publishing with an opinion piece in Newsweek, in which she railed against hostile media coverage and addressed the jury directly. “Harvey Weinstein is innocent,” she wrote, just before a disclaimer: “The views expressed in this article are the writer’s own.”Who are we to question what might have inspired Rotunno in writing those words, any more than we might any writer on their motivations? Assuming the scrutiny on choice of reading material sets a precedent, however – it might present those inclined with a new way out of jury duty. Crime and Punishment?

However, it will take up to three days to inspect each plane because fuel must be drained and vapours dissipated before the fuel tanks can be opened.Mark Jenks, the general manager of the 737 programme, said in a memo to employees that the debris was “absolutely unacceptable” and that the company was taking steps to address the problem in its production system.The first Boeing 737 Max begins commercial operations with Malindo Air. Norwegian Air is also an early adopter of the new model, operating transatlantic flights. The model promises fuel efficiencies attractive to carriers.Lion Air flight JT610 crashes after making a sudden, sharp e into the Java Sea 13 minutes after departing from Jakarta, Indonesia. All 189 people onboard are killed. That particular plane had been in use for less than three months. The plane\u0027s black box recorder reveals that\u0026nbspthe Lion Air plane had experienced problems with its airspeed indicators\u0026nbspon its last four flights.Boeing issues revised instructions on how pilots should react to erroneous readings from “angle of attack” sensors, believed to be a key factor in the Lion Air crash.Flight ET302 crashes about six minutes after taking off from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people onboard. The captain had reported difficulties, and flight radar data shows the aircraft was climbing erratically with an unstable vertical airspeed.The EU, Canada and the US all ground the Boeing 737 Max. Boeing itself issues a statement saying it “continues to have full confidence in the safety of the 737 Max”, but that “out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public” it w recommending the grounding of the entire global fleet of 371 aircraft.The interim report into the Ethiopian Airlines crash finds that the pilots correctly followed Boeing’s emergency instructions, but were still unable to stop the plane’s nose repeatedly pointing down. The jet hit an airspeed of 500 knots (575mph), well above its operational limits, before cockpit data recordings stopped.Airlines extend their ban on using the Boeing 737 Max after the US aviation regulator said it had identified a new potential risk with the plane.Pictures emerge of a Boeing 737 Max due to be delivered to Ryanair with the name 737 Max replaced by 737-8200 on the nose.During congressional hearings into Boeing’s handling of the crisis, lawmakers were shown internal records revealing that three years before the crashes an employee had expressed concern that an anti-stall flight system could be triggered by a single sensor.The crisis deepens with the release of hundreds of internal messages between employees working on the 737 Max aircraft, which boasted of deceiving safety regulators and said the plane had been “designed by clowns”.Boeing orders inspections of its entire fleet of grounded 737 Max planes after it found foreign object debris in the fuel tanks of some of the mothballed planes.“During these challenging times, our customers and the flying public are counting on us to do our best work each and every day,” Jenks said, adding: “One escape is one too many.”Debris was discovered in the wing fuel tanks of the Max planes during routine inspections at Boeing facilities in Washington state and Texas where the Max jets are being stored. The company has not disclosed how many planes were affected.The company has had recent issues with debris – including tools and rags – found in its 787 Dreamliners and KC-46A military refueling tankers. Those issues have led to two suspensions of deliveries of KC-46As to the US air force.It is less than a year since the second fatal crash of a Boeing 737 Max resulted in the grounding of the model’s entire global fleet and the company is racing to recertify with regulators that the planes can fly safely.The fuel tank problem is unrelated to the flaws to sensors thought to have contributed towards the two crashes.Boeing built about 400 of the planes, which it could not deliver to customers, and its orders have suffered after it was forced to cut back production at its factory near Seattle.Foreign object debris, an industrial term for rags, tools, metal shavings and other materials left behind by workers during the production process, can raise the risk of electrical short-circuiting and fires.Last year a New York Times investigation found debris problems at another Boeing factory in North Carolina including piles of titanium shavings close to electrical equipment and, in one instance, a ladder and a string of lights left inside the tail of a plane.The Boeing spokesman said the Max’s latest issue would not change the company’s belief that the Federal Aviation Administration would certify the plane to fly again this summer.An FAA spokesman said the agency knows that Boeing is conducting a voluntary inspection of undelivered Max planes.

The hedge fund said it would vote against any offer that was not final or that was less than 7p a share.The existing takeover offer would wipe out the investments of many local shareholders, but it still won the support of the Sirius chairman, Russell Scrimshaw. He said last month it was “the only viable proposal” to save the company’s multibillion-pound project to develop the Woodsmith fertiliser mine under the North York moors.Sirius’s shareholder base includes thousands of investors from the Yorkshire area who supported its ambitious plans to become the world’s biggest producer of a potent fertiliser called polyhalite.The company was once valued at £1.5bn and managed to raise $1.2bn (£920m) to develop the Woodsmith mine, but it ran into trouble finding investors to hand over a further $3.8bn to complete the plans.Odey said the project could still prove to be lucrative for an investor willing to fund the development costs of the Woodsmith mine. It claims recent company accounts suggest that the business could be worth £895m if it finds funding – more than double Anglo’s bid.“Odey struggles to see how the board of Sirius, including the chief financial officer, can recommend the offer to shareholders as being ‘fair’ only four months after these accounts were published,” the letter said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e1e8c4596550d4cf666a6006c457109662514d1/18_26_2567_1540/master/2567.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd39e525cd28e3bf82d6c33edb0f36d3","title":"uk inflation at six month high as petrol and energy prices rise","story":"The rise in fuel and energy costs forced up household heating costs and fed into the transport industry, the Office for National Statistics said.Price increases also affected clothing, footwear and restaurants and hotels, while there was downward pressure from heavy discounting in furniture, household equipment, food and non-alcoholic drinks.Gas and electricity price increases in part reflected a comparison with January last year, when the government imposed a cap on energy companies, the ONS said.Petrol prices also compared unfavourably with January 2019, which was a period of falling costs on garage forecourts.

From automated systems that monitor cashflow, to software that sends out emails, there’s a plethora of online tools available to help small firms growSelf-driving cars, surgery carried out by robots, facial recognition software – the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and its implications for the world of work have rarely been out of the headlines in recent years. “Everything we assume about work, jobs, training and education – and being human – is being challenged by exponential scientific and technological progress,” futurist author Gerd Leonhard says. “Humanity will change more in the next 20 years than in the previous 300.”Considering the magnitude and scale of this fourth industrial revolution, it’s understandable that many small business owners feel left behind. Few will have the teams of data scientists, money and know-how to create their own bespoke solutions, unless they’re operating in the AI sector themselves. Yet many will be using platforms and tools that already incorporate AI – anyone doing a Google search, for example, is experiencing it in action. “You can be sure there isn’t a human sitting in a cubicle, sifting by hand through the entire internet to decide which search result to serve you,” says Cassie Kozyrkov, chief decision scientist at Google.This technology is most often used by businesses in three different ways: automating processes (such as timed newsletter sends, or bank account reconciliation), data analysis to gain insights (and then performing tasks such as recommending products to customers), and engaging with the public (via customer service chatbots, for example). Much of this has been made possible by cloud computing (a way of storing data remotely), which has given smart platforms powered by the cloud millions of anonymised users’ data to learn from and adapt accordingly. It’s rapidly accelerated the development of tools that are simple for small business owners to use but highly effective in terms of eliminating repetitive tasks, streamlining operations, and enabling sustainable growth.‘It’s important to have a clear mind’“What beekeepers really like is the 88-million-year-old technology that bees use to do all sorts of smart things, like organise their hives, and produce wax and royal jelly from their bodies,” Dale Gibson, co-founder of Bermondsey Street Bees, says about introducing the art of beekeeping to technology. “The last real technological discovery in beekeeping was in America in 1852.”While respecting that heritage, Gibson has been able to incorporate technological development into his business in a number of ways, since installing his first hives on his London roof in 2007. “I do start off with a proper, gummed up, sticky with honey notebook, where the data is gathered in the field,” he says. “But when I come home, I enter that information into a system on the cloud where my associate beekeeper can look it up.” He’s also working on a pilot programme with the World Bee Project to test remote monitors that track the health of hives, such as their weight. That data is then fed back into a central system, shared by 32,000 beekeepers across more than 150 countries. The project hopes this information will help to create more sustainable ecosystems and improve global food security.Gibson is also exploring the potential of tracking his honey via a blockchain system, first trialled by the technology company Oracle at the 2019 OpenWorld show in Dubai. “Anything that can help us distinguish between real, raw local honey and the manufactured commodity that’s come from halfway around the world and been blended, heated and mashed up, then that’s a good thing,” says Gibson, adding that honey is the third most tampered with product in the world, after milk and olive oil.While technology can sometimes be daunting for SME owners to incorporate, he says it’s given him more time to focus on the bees. “We’re massively assisted by having Xero on our phones too so we can use it for inventory record keeping, invoicing and statements at any time and anywhere,” he says. He finds the automatic reminders to customers that an invoice is due (or late) particularly helpful, as is the functionality that automatically reconciles his bank statements. “Even though you’re running a small business and lots of things can happen, it’s really important to have a clear mind.”‘We’re trying very hard to make online successful’Since starting in 2011, Papersmiths has grown from a two-employee interior design studio in Bridport, to launching an additional chain of five stationary shops. The company now employs 25 staff and has a presence in some of the UK’s most desirable retail locations (including Bristol, Brighton, and Chelsea in London).Smart technology has played a clear role in the business’s growth, co-founder Sidonie Warren says. The majority of their data is tracked using point-of-sale software Vend, which integrates with Xero. “That’s excellent because it allows us to track what we’re selling, right down to a specific product or colour,” says Warren. “When we open a new store we use that data to figure out what it is we need to buy, and also planning the fit out of the store.” Shop managers also use it to identify that week’s top five products, and arrange displays accordingly.Building the e-commerce arm of the business has been a key focus for Warren recently. “Our challenge is translating that thing of testing a pen or feeling the paper of a notebook into the digital realm,” she says. Automating email sends via Mailchimp has enabled her to engage new customers via discount codes, and she can target people known to be top spenders at certain times of the year using sales data from Shopify.She uses Xero weekly to plan cashflow, as well as process payroll and track all of her staff expenses. She still uses the personal touch – if a customer is late paying an invoice for example, she’d rather call than send an automatic reminder – but is open to integrating new technology in the future, including an online customer service chatbot, and some sort of retail mapping system. “With online you can see how many times a product gets viewed but it’s very hard to do that in store,” she adds.‘We’ve grown substantially and it’s all down to being in control of our finances’Richard Fishenden worked as a farrier fitting horseshoes before he started Made by the Forge in 2006. “My wife went into a local shop that sold curtain poles and I was horrified at the prices. I said bollocks to that, I’m going to make them myself,” he says. The range has since extended beyond bespoke curtain poles, to other wrought iron homeware items.Fishenden says he used to be “archaic with technology”, but has managed to automate processes in various areas. “Xero seems to be the central part of the spider’s web that everything else feeds from,” he says. That includes an order system, where delivery notes and worksheets are generated so staff know what products to make a customer relationship management system for customer data that Fishenden uses to send quotes via Xero, and then follow up on leads that were once buried in paperwork and Receipt Bank for invoices and receipts that he says has saved hours of data inputting.Sign up to Xero here with a free trial"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/296c73cfde58312bf9c6259a78a1943c35896baf/0_92_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9211acbbc37371bd0c79929dfdc190a","title":"immigration proposal english language","story":"“Let’s pretend we were inventing the world from scratch today and you decided you were going to have borders,” said Benjamin, a migrants’ rights activist, to me a few years ago in a cafe in London. “On what basis would you make the decision about who gets to move and who doesn’t get to move through borders? Surely you wouldn’t make them in the way the world is constituted today?”We live in a world where your gender, race and class shape whether you can move and how you’re treated if you do. While many of us strive to change that, too many of our politicians are entrenching that system and making things worse. This is precisely what the Conservatives’ immigration proposals would do.While a lot of the plans themselves aren’t new and are lacking in details, how they’re packaged tells us a lot. One of the government’s headline policies is that people coming into the country will “have to speak English”. This dog whistle is depressingly familiar: a decade after New Labour announced a “points system” that included English tests, in 2015 the Labour leader Ed Miliband used it when he said speaking English was “something we should expect from everyone who comes here”. For decades politicians have turned to the English language as a symbol to show they are willing to be tough on immigrants and say “hard things” when they need to.But we all know these proposals are nothing to do with that at all because they don’t even pretend to be. Instead, they’re based on deeply xeno-racist grounds – that is a racism “directed at the displaced, the dispossessed and the uprooted”. Politicians claim English language skills are necessary for “integration”, a highly racialised term that swiftly becomes forgotten when the focus of these plans is on temporary visas. That is, the documents that put a time limit on how long people can be here, thus getting in the way of relationships they’ve built, friends they’ve made and people they’ve fallen in love with. How are immigrants supposed to “integrate” when they never know for sure how long they will be allowed to stay? The logic for one immigration policy is often the opposite of another.Bulgarian welder, holds A-level equivalent, has job offer for £26,000 a year, does not speak English.Now: Able to work in the UK under free movement rules.From January 2021: The worker scores points for a job offer, salary over £25,600, educational qualification, and working in a shortage occupation – meaning a score of 80 points, 10 more than the 70-point threshold. Ticks two of the three mandatory boxes for entry to the country – a job offer and job at appropriate skill level. But falling short on the third compulsory condition for entry of speaking English rules the welder out and they cannot come into the UK.\u0026nbspSri Lankan production manager, has job offer for a salary of £28,000 a year, holds A-level equivalent, holds a PhD in a Stem subject, speaks English.\u0026nbspNow: Eligible courtesy of the requisite educational qualification of degree or over.\u0026nbspFrom January 2021: The worker earns less than the £34,000 “going rate” for their profession, meaning that they must pick up 70 points elsewhere to be eligible. They are not in a shortage occupation and so score zero on that point – but succeed nonetheless with 20 points for a job offer, 20 points for their A-level equivalent, 10 points for English, and 20 points for a PhD in a Stem subject – a total of exactly 70.Italian waiter has job offer in a hotel at £20,000, has languages degree and fluent in English.Now: Able to work in the UK under free movement rules.From January 2021: Is eligible to enter on the three mandatory conditions – job offer, speaks English and has met education threshold. Picks up 50 points. But scores zero for salary, zero for shortage occupation, does not have a PhD and cannot come into the country.Yet, it’s all presented as perfectly sensible. In a fit of supposed egalitarianism, Boris Johnson announced at the start of the year that he wanted to make an immigration system that was “people over passports”. It’s a way of wrapping up anti-immigration policy as reasonable while laying the ground for regressive announcements. It’s fair because there’s not preferential treatment for EU citizens, the defence goes. While fortress Europe’s borders and the UK’s restrictive, violent and highly racialised non-EU policy are certainly not worth defending, these new plans will likely spell poorer rights for a lot of people.The “people” whom Johnson wants to put ahead of passports isn’t everyone it’s the high earners, the “high skilled” or those with PhDs. In other words, in a system where racism and classism are deeply embedded in our borders – immigration for the rich or those from white-majority countries is already easier – the government’s plans will likely deepen these inequalities. If you’re classed as “low skilled”, a visa will be difficult to come by if you don’t earn £25,600, the same will be true. The aim, Priti Patel said, is not only to stop “low skilled” people from moving to the UK but to go after “economically inactive” Britons, by forcing business to retrain uneducated, unskilled locals. The “undercutting migrant” and the “British scrounger” once again side by side.This is a hardening of an immigration system that’s already built on elitism. If you really wanted to make this about people, there are a variety of straightforward things that could be done: reducing the astronomically high fees people must pay to apply to live here rather than increasing them, bringing back legal aid or ensuring there are safe routes of passage for people seeking asylum so they don’t have to climb under lorries to try to get here.The scapegoating of migrants that has been a mainstay of the immigration debate for decades is still very much there. The ground laid for so much of this has been decades in the making. Whatever happens next, you can bet the government will still find a way to blame migrants for this country’s economic and social problems. Forcibly deporting people to countries they barely know or detaining them indefinitely – one of their big plans is to show they are “tough on immigration”.Already too much of this discussion is from the perspective of business interests or based on the idea that people have “legitimate concerns” about immigration. But what’s often forgotten is that it is immigrants – human beings who happened to be born in a different country and have moved to the UK – who are at the centre of this policy.• Maya Goodfellow is a writer and academic, and the author of Hostile Environment: How Immigrants Became Scapegoats"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c14ab0f424c85eec92895b84757813169e7a8612/0_0_4468_3000/master/4468.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=305446a6e299c8238716afab58eb53f7 720w","title":"committees blind hiring and flexible work how to build a diverse workforce","story":"By limiting yourself in the recruitment process you may miss out on someone who’s right for the job. These simple steps will help to cultivate an inclusive organisationBut ersity isn’t limited to a candidate’s race, gender, or age – it includes their education, socioeconomic background, sexuality, religion, mental and physical health and many more facets. When we create environments that encourage different opinions and contain a multitude of backgrounds and experiences, we broaden our communities, which in turn benefits both the work and the culture of the organisation.Here’s how to get started with building an inclusive and erse business:Look outside of the obvious education channelsThis may come as a surprise, but where someone studied - for their qualifications – doesn’t necessarily correlate to their qualities as a candidate. It’s important to be intentional about recruitment, and if you are only accepting candidates who have a certain level of education, or attended a certain type of university, you may be missing out on someone just right for the job. Go further afield when you attend university job fairs and remember to think digitally. With an increasing number of courses being offered online, make sure you connect with those graduates as well. The Open University has been offering qualifications through distance learning for 50 years. It has an excellent resource – the OU’s OpportunityHub, which connects prospective employers with graduates and alumni around the country for work and internships. The OU also regularly runs OU Online TalentConnect, a digital careers fair where employers can chat and interact with its uniquely erse body of graduates and undergraduates all over the UK and internationally.“The OU provides a unique supply of candidates, as a majority study alongside full-time employment – it shows a true commitment and a willingness to go that extra mile,” says the HMRC’s Memunatu Bangura.Create a ersity, equity, and inclusion committeeHave a specific committee to oversee ersity, equity, and inclusion at your organisation, to ensure that not only the roles you are hiring, but the work that you do appeals to a broad group of people. Of course, ersity isn’t just about hiring – but it’s probably a good idea to ensure that the team responsible for hiring are erse themselves.Could the role be remote? Or part-time?For many candidates, especially those with disabilities, knowing that a job can be done remotely, or part-time, is deeply attractive. You can also sign up to be a part of the Disability Confident programme, which signals to jobseekers with disabilities that your organisation supports and encourages a talent pool that is inclusive. When pulling together your job description, think seriously about whether it would be possible to offer remote work, or a job share – many parents benefit from flexible schedules.Consider mature studentsNot everyone attends university. Many candidates from lower-income backgrounds, or BAME candidates, may not have been given the same access to opportunity as others, and many people choose to attend university later in life, if at all. Mature students are defined as being undergraduates over the age of 21, and they account for almost 300,000 people a year. According to Ucas, the majority of mature students are women who live at home, undertaking degrees in vocational subjects. These are candidates who will have learned to juggle work, or parenting, alongside their studies.“We want to work with OU students and graduates because we know they are highly motivated and talented iniduals who have the potential to make an enormous contribution to Mencap as either staff or volunteers. We work across England, Wales and Northern Ireland and we know that OU students are spread across the whole of the UK too,” says Jen Stoneman, volunteer services coordinator at Mencap.Be realistic about your goalsWhile it would be amazing to cultivate a erse work environment, it won’t happen overnight. Be patient, and set metrics of success that ensure that you are appealing to erse groups, and growing your workforce.

There were also doubts about what share of fossil methane was naturally released and what share was from industry.Earlier estimates were based on intermittent, bottom-up monitoring of oil and gas companies and comparisons with geological evidence from the end of the Pleistocene epoch, about 11,600 years ago.For a more accurate comparison, a team at the University of Rochester in the US examined levels of methane in the pre-industrial era about 300 years ago. This was achieved by analysing air from that period trapped in glaciers in Greenland. The sample – made up of about a tonne of ice – was extracted with a Blue Ice Drill, capable of producing the world’s biggest ice cores.This strengthens suspicions that fossil fuel companies are not fully accounting for their impact on the climate, particularly with regard to methane – a colourless, odourless gas that many plants routinely vent into the atmosphere.Accidents are also underreported. A single blowout at a natural gas well in Ohio in 2018 discharged more methane over three weeks than the oil and gas industries of France, Norway and the Netherlands released in an entire year. At the time, the company said it was unsure of the size of the leak. The immense scale was only revealed a year later when scientists analysed satellite data provided by the European Space Agency.Fracking also appears to have worsened the problem. Atmospheric methane had started to flatten off at the turn of the century, but rose again after a surge in fracking activity in the US and elsewhere. The industry, however, continues to claim that the energy source can be used as a “bridge fuel” because it has lower carbon emissions than oil or coal, but this fails to account for leaks and flares of methane and other gases during extraction.For almost three decades, world governments have met every year to forge a global response to the climate emergency. Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, every country on earth is treaty-bound to “avoid dangerous climate change”, and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way. Cop stands for conference of the parties under the UNFCCC.The UK will host Cop26 this November in Glasgow. In the Paris agreement of 2015, all governments agreed for the first time\u0026nbspto limit global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, and set out non-binding national targets on greenhouse gases to achieve that. However, these targets are insufficient, and if allowed to stand would lead to an estimated 3C of heating, which scientists say would spell disaster. For that reason, the Cop26 talks in Glasgow are viewed as the last chance for global cooperation on the emergency, with countries expected to come with tough new targets on emissions.The negotiations will be led by environment ministers and civil servants, aided by UN officials. Nearly every country is expected to send a voting representative at the level of environment secretary or equivalent, and the big economies will have extensive delegations.Each of the 196 nations on earth, bar a few failed states, is a signatory to the UNFCCC foundation treaty. The Cops, for all their flaws, are the only forum on the climate crisis in which the opinions and concerns of the poorest country carry equal weight to that of the biggest economies, such as the US and China. Agreement can only come by consensus, which gives Cop decisions global authority.Growing calls for tighter controls will be strengthened by the new study. The lead author, Benjamin Hmiel, said the paper was cause for optimism because it showed that action on methane – which has a relatively short shelf life, persisting in the atmosphere for about nine years – could give a strong short-term boost to efforts to stabilise the climate.“Placing stricter methane emission regulations on the fossil fuel industry will have the potential to reduce future global warming to a larger extent than previously thought,” Hmiel said. “Methane is important to study because if we make changes to our current methane emissions, it’s going to reflect more quickly.”Other scientists who were not involved in the research concurred there were positive implications in the findings, but only if governments were able to rein in fossil fuel companies, which has not been the case until now.“This indicates that the fossil fuel sector has a much more polluting impact beyond being responsible for the overwhelming majority of carbon dioxide emissions. This is worrying and overall bad news,” said Dr Joeri Rogelj, a climate change lecturer at the Grantham Institute.The good news, Rogelj said, was that measures to prevent leaks, reduce flaring and switch to renewables would be more effective than expected. “What this study shows is that we can have a bigger impact on methane in the atmosphere than earlier thought. This allows us to set climate policy priorities right.”Dave Reay, the executive director of the Edinburgh Centre for Carbon Innovation, said one of the key messages from the study was that the old bottom-up method of measuring methane emissions was “woefully inadequate”.“We knew fossil fuel extraction – including fracking – was a major part of global methane emissions, but this impressive study suggests it is a far bigger culprit in human-induced climate change than we had ever thought,” he said.“If correct, gas, coal and oil extraction and distribution around the world are responsible for almost half of all human-induced methane emissions. Add to that all the carbon dioxide that is then emitted when the fossil fuels are burned, and you need look no further for the seat of the climate emergency fire.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4efeb570ed0db93a115d8f4c8be066f9f54bf4ae/0_0_3663_2198/master/3663.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fa2c6b014cca8e92a527840a3575aef","title":"london fashion week autumnwinter 2020 the key shows in pictures","story":"This season saw a heady mix of schedule regulars as well as up-and-coming stars – with a focus on sustainability "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b4851e38e4f1d586667b3bf6ae3969dc8f37132/0_331_5581_3348/master/5581.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e12e667c5b5a35e53902e2c6807ea43c","title":"incidental characters review benjamin verrall","story":"Four people in an English market town search for meaning in their lives in this quirky but underpowered comedyBenjamin Verrall’s film is a quirky, low-key if underpowered British indie set in Lewes, East Sussex, and although it never quite came alive as a film, there are some nice moments.

Charting 24 hedonistic hours in the life of a gay Greek-Australian teenager, Head On is a fierce and evocative depiction of queer identity and masculinity in crisis. Then she had her first interview. “The journalist told me there was a rumour that I must have been a man because a woman couldn’t possibly make this film.”The Australian film-maker was unsurprised. “There aren’t many female directors and when women get the opportunity to make a film they tend to want to make them about women. But when women make films about men there is still a taboo around that. There’s a cliched view that women can’t explore masculinity or the male experience.”It’s this misconception that the Barbican’s new season, Her Lens, His Story: Female Directors and Masculinities, seeks to upend. Kokkinos is one of seven female directors from around the world whose stories about men will be shown. The series of screenings is a celebration of women who have fought to show multifaceted and vulnerable men on screen.These are stories about men living on the margins, maverick outsiders for reasons other than bravado or bank robbery. In Edith Carlmar’s stylish 1949 Norwegian noir Death Is a Caress, about a mechanic who falls for a rich, older woman, this is due to the rigid class system. In Destiny Ekaragha’s Gone Too Far!, a witty 2013 British comedy about two estranged brothers meeting for the first time, it’s down to the colour of their skin.Sexuality keeps its protagonists marginalised in both Anahí Berneri’s 2005 Argentinian film A Year Without Love, about a lonely poet with HIV who looks for human connection in S\u0026ampM clubs, and Kokkinos’s Head On. Meanwhile, a young Afghan boy in 1980s Kabul is forgotten by society in Shahrbanoo Sadat’s sensitively told 2019 drama The Orphanage.There are antiheroes, too, as depicted in Soviet director Larisa Shepitko’s harrowing 1977 film The Ascent, which shows the different fates of two soldiers captured during the second world war and their struggle to cope with the brutality of conflict. While 1953’s Love Letter, a poignant melodrama from prolific film star Kinuyo Tanaka (the second woman ever to work as a director in Japan), reflects the postwar anxieties of the country in its story about an emotionally repressed man struggling to forgive his ex-girlfriend.Portraying men in a non-traditional way, free from cliche, is a political act, says Kokkinos. Her own film was considered controversial when it was released for its gritty depiction of gay sex and drugs. But it also gives a voice to the immigrant experience. “It didn’t idealise privileged men in positions of power. The minute you don’t depict men as powerful drivers of their own destinies, people find that very difficult.”The number of female directors in the film industry is slowly growing but is still dismally low. Last month, a study by the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative at the University of Southern California found that of the 113 directors behind 2019’s 100 top-grossing films, 12 of these were women – a historic high. In 2018, there were just five. And when women do direct, they are more likely to focus on stories about women. Yet when focused on men, the female gaze can offer radical new perspectives. Gone Too Far! director Ekaragha can still remember watching Point Break for the first time, not realising the adrenaline-fuelled action thriller was directed by a woman, Kathryn Bigelow, until years later. In her 20s, she was captivated by Mary Harron’s gruesome psychological horror American Psycho – in particular, how the camera lingered on Christian Bale’s sculpted body – in much the same way men have been filming women’s bodies for years.“The moment I realised I wanted to be a director, I felt like a lot of the films expected of women were not necessarily the sort of films that I was into,” she says. “To see a woman direct American Psycho with no fear was inspiring.”The south London director, one of only four black British women to have had their feature films released in UK cinemas, actively avoided any stereotypes associated with black teens, such as drugs and stabbings, when making her film. “I was conscious of how black boys and black men are portrayed on screen.”For Afghan film-maker Sadat, the gender of the people on screen is of secondary importance. Kokkinos followed Head On with The Book of Revelation, about a male dancer who is abducted by three women. “It’s liberating for women to explore men because we’re not shackled by the same assumptions about the male experience,” she says.“Women have something to say about men. We can delve into their vulnerabilities or difficulties around their own maleness. We need more women to enter that space because it becomes really exciting. We can illuminate something different about men that we don’t generally see from men themselves.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6522aaa8d60b69df71fac540a5a20638012987d/659_647_3348_2009/master/3348.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7004cc466058597b7bd791b31a2d7d9","title":"david athertons recipe for cyclists malt loaf","story":"The sweet potato provides slow-release carbs that make this the ideal fuel for a long cycle ride – and a tasty snack at homeMalt loaf is well known to cyclists as a perfect high-carb, low-fat snack.

So I’d probably say that about all the young black lads … that, you know, it’s about, when you are struggling for form, you are going through a sticky patch, it’s about going back to basics, working hard, and doing the right things.”Well there you go. Ramage has now been relieved of his duties by the BBC, though it was notably left to a 22-year-old Derby player to publicly challenge the comments. On Sunday, defender Max Lowe spoke out on Instagram “on behalf of black footballers at Derby Country … Racial ignorance, stereotyping and intolerance negatively affects the image of impressionable young footballers and creates an unnecessary ide in society. I am also disappointed that a public service broadcaster did not step in to ask the analyst to explain his reasoning or to distance themselves from these archaic thoughts.” Quite. And we’ll come shortly to the depressing regularity with which pushback against racism ends up having to be player-led.For now, Ramage has issued a statement explaining that this is not who he is, and his views don’t reflect his views. Or something. However, it’s hard not to suspect they reflect the views of many pundits, supporters, and some of the newspapers and media outlets, subconsciously or otherwise.“Certain players”, to use Ramage’s euphemism, will never be able to do right for doing wrong, and almost all players have to live with the reality that entirely normal activities will be parsed as somehow detrimental to their game. The most anodyne aspects of the outside life of footballers are ruthlessly policed. Have they been on social media in a manner entirely in keeping with the fact that their side just lost 2-1? Have they been pictured in an expensive car within 48 hours of their side having lost 2-1? Have they got the wrong sort of home, the wrong sort of tattoo, the wrong sort of gait? Are they – whenever they so much as leave the house – showing either extreme contrition or extreme gratitude, the only two acceptable off-pitch emotions? If not, some genius analyst or other will soon be making a distinctly moral judgment about “focus”.Without wishing to slaughter a sacred cow, then, does any of this really matter? Does it really have any effect on performance, or simply on the feelings of some supporters or commentators? When asked why it matters quite so much as they seem to think it does, pundits given to falling back on this type of critique only ever seem to offer vast woollinesses. It is “indicative of a mindset”, it “sends a message”, it “says his head’s somewhere else”. Does it? It’s certainly convenient to think so. But I often feel the mindset it is all rather more indicative of is that of the pundit in question.In fact, Ramage’s comments are useful insofar as they show how absolutely impossible it sometimes is to be young, acceptable and black. His primary issues with the young black players are ludicrous things – things like their stance, their body language.When Kobe Bryant died, the reflection of the Uefa president was striking. “I did not know Bryant personally,” said Aleksander Ceferin, “but I was always struck by the way he never shied from taking a firm stance against racism. It made him a true role model for other high-profile sports stars.” What about for high-profile sports bodies? It doesn’t take several years of forensic accountants, lawyers, former Belgian prime ministers, hackers and whistleblowers to uncover when some racism is happening in a location Uefa is technically supposed to govern. Quite often, you can do it off your telly.Despite this, calling it out in a way that produces meaningful results seems to have been officially designated a job for the players, who must do it at the same time as having to try to win a football match. I guess if you want something done, ask a busy person. Even so, many find this allocation of duties unsatisfactory, as suggested by Bayern Munich and Austria defender David Alaba in a Sunday Times interview last weekend. Of the triggering of Uefa’s three-step protocol during England’s game against Bulgaria in Sofia last October, Alaba said: “It’s very sad that the players have to say something because everybody sees it and everybody hears it so why should the players do something? Because it’s not always for the player. They have to do their job. They’re playing a game … We have to find a solution that gets through that.”Unfortunately, at this stage in the governing body’s glacial journey towards getting a clue about racism, it still can’t be left to Uefa, who don’t seem to truly want to win on this front at all. Leaving it to the players is – how to put this? – “indicative of a mindset”. In fact, mind-blowing as it might be to Ramage and those who secretly agree with him, perhaps players do occasionally have their heads elsewhere. Which is to say, they’re distracted by the continuous burden of having deal with racism because others are failing to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cf2320dddb04b42e77dcd3b889106c604509f97/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01e22a8150514c1a5011721db6c6339e","title":"jose mourinho v julian nagelsmann yesterdays man v force of the future","story":"At 32, RB Leipzig’s coach is 25 years younger than his Spurs counterpart – their Champions League meeting feels like a battle of two erasOn Wednesday night, as Tottenham take on RB Leipzig, José Mourinho might look across at the opposing bench and recognise something very familiar. In Julian Nagelsmann, the coach of RB Leipzig, he will see a driven man who desperately wanted to be a footballer whose career ended prematurely, somebody who quit a university business course to focus on sport, somebody who from a remarkably early age has been marked out as one of the brightest coaches of their generation.He will see, in other words, a version of his younger self. Tim Wiese, the wrestler and former goalkeeper, even nicknamed Nagelsmann “Mini-Mourinho” during his time as assistant coach at Hoffenheim. And perhaps in that, Mourinho will feel a pang of mortality. At 32, Nagelsmann is 25 years younger: he is the future while Mourinho is repeatedly battling suggestions he may be the past.Football at its highest level is now dominated by the German school of hard pressing and rapid transitions, of which Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool is the supreme example. One of the pioneers of that style was Ralf Rangnick, who – after spells at Stuttgart, Schalke and Hoffenheim and two stints as Leipzig manager – is now the head of sport and development at Red Bull. In an interview with the Blizzard he identified four principles to guide how Red Bull sides should play:“One, add maximum possibility to the team and act, don’t react. So you need to dictate the game with and without the ball, not through iniduals.“Two, use numerical superiority and let the ball run directly whenever possible, with no unnecessary inidual action and with no fouls.“Three, use transitions, switch quickly. Try to win back the ball within five seconds with aggressive pressing. After winning the ball back, play quickly straight away, play direct and vertically towards the opponent’s goal, surprise the disorganised opponent to get into the penalty area and shoot within 10 seconds of winning the ball back.“At Hoffenheim, we did research and showed that the likelihood of scoring is within eight seconds of winning back the ball. In training we have a countdown clock and the target is to score within 10 seconds. Jürgen Klopp has said that the best playmaker is ‘perfect counterpressing’. So four, the more a team sprints faster to win back the ball the greater the likelihood they will score a goal once they have won it back quickly.”Before appointing Nagelsmann, who to an extent was building on the foundations he had left at Hoffenheim, Rangnick described him as “the greatest managerial talent in Germany”. Certainly he is one of the most forward-thinking, benefiting from the work done by the likes of Rangnick, Wolfgang Frank and Volker Finke to normalise pressing. That battle is won and Germany has moved from being a country that believed football was all about inidual battles to be at the forefront of developing pressing.That in itself would distance Nagelsmann from Mourinho who, despite being formed as a coach amid the post-Cruyffian pressing game of late 90s Barcelona, seemed to decide around the time he was overlooked for the Barça job in 2008 that his future would be a low block and reactivity – as though to emphasise his difference from the club that, as he saw it, had rejected him. But it is more than that. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200217-58536-gnl.fw.20200217.jf.jarsofurine.mp3 In his first two European campaigns Nagelsmann’s Hoffenheim looked a little naive, winning just one of 14 games. He has admitted he made too many changes between Bundesliga and Europe, leading to confusion, and also that he had been too offensive. As he looks to balance his thinking, Nagelsmann has acknowledged the importance of Klopp at Liverpool as a model, explaining how he wants his side also to become less reliant on counterattacking and to learn how to control games.But that’s just the broadbrush strategy. There are also precise adjustments for inidual games which, as the winger Ademola Lookman, who joined Leipzig from Everton on a permanent basis last summer, has said, means that a lot of playing for Nagelsmann involves memory. Everything is done with a specific purpose in mind.“He always has a thought about everything,” the winger Emil Forsberg explained. “What you have to do with the ball, if I take the ball here what can I do then, and how you have to move when he has the ball – you just have to do it. It will appear and you’ll kind of get a light bulb in your head like: ‘Ah OK, so if I do that and that, that will open up and I can play that pass or I can play that pass.’ That’s what I like about the drills, that you always have something behind it.”While the holistic approach sounds a lot like Mourinho’s theories of periodisation, the big difference is that Mourinho, believing football to be essentially random, considers programmed moves too unreliable to be worthwhile and prefers to try to generate in his players a mindset that ensures they make the “right” – as he would see it – decision in any given circumstance.And that, as much as his insistence on the low block, is what separates Mourinho from those who have come after. The old tricks performed well can still prevail, and nobody, least of all Nagelsmann, would pretend he is the finished product. But this seems like a battle of two eras, one thrusting and innovative, the other familiar and possibly moribund."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c723fd45f69662f8b889456fb707192fb94d62c/0_310_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=894e76b527b4785e48ebff2e15ac2aad","title":"coal workers are orphans the children and slaves mining pakistans coal","story":"Injuries and fatalities are common among thousands of debt-bonded men and children toiling in one of the world’s harshest work environmentsAll photographs by Mashal Balochby  Shah Meer Baloch and  Hannah Ellis-PetersenThe spectre of death hovers over the coal mines of Balochistan. Under scorching skies, this turbulent south-west region of Pakistan is home to one of the world’s harshest work environments, where tens of thousands of men and children descend below the surface each day to dig up thousands of tonnes of coal.The threats of underground explosions, methane gas poisoning, suffocation, or mine walls collapsing are omnipresent and there is barely a single worker across the state’s five massive commercial coal mines who has not been touched by the fatalities that are common here.“Twenty people that I know of have died underground,” says Luqman Shakir, a 24-year-old from Swat, in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Nine years ago, aged 15, Shakir travelled to Balochistan looking for work he has been a miner ever since. “People often die because of a mine collapse and it takes us 18, sometimes 24, hours to take them out because there is no machinery to remove the collapse we are on our own.”Wiping his dust-blackened face, Shakir sighs. “When we pull them out, often their bodies are so mangled they cannot even be recognised. Every time I go down the mine, in the back of my mind I always know there is a possibility that I might not come back up.”Shakir hasn’t seen a sunset for almost a decade. He goes underground before dawn and emerges after dark six days a week, and sleeps for most of his single day off. “Summers are suffocating,” he says, explaining that his impoverished background and lack of education make the mines his only option for work.“This is my life now.”Coal was first extracted in the mineral-rich Balochistan in the 1850s by the British, who built the railway line still used today to transport the coal through the treacherous mountains of the Bolan Pass.It has grown into a massive modern industry. With five major coalfields – Mach, Shahrag, Dukki, Chamalang and Quetta – Balochistan still has approximately 2.2bn tonnes of coal reserves. As a result, the mining operation across the state is huge at least 15,000 tonnes of coal are produced daily, selling for an of average 14,000 PKR (£70) per tonne. It is big business for the country’s coffers, too. The provincial government takes a cut of 130 PKR (£0.65) per tonne and the federal government 500 PKR (£2.50).An operation on this scale requires a massive workforce at the Mach coal mines alone it is estimated that there are between 10,000 and 20,000 workers. Child labour is rife: at all the coal mines visited by the  in January, child labourers were seen working above ground sorting coal, collecting iron and picking up pieces of coal spilled across the fields.“Coal workers in Balochistan are orphans,” says Asif Qambrani, a research scholar whose work focuses on the mining industry in the region.At the mine in Shahrag, sitting on the floor working to remove impurities from freshly mined coal, are Noor Mohammed Marri, 15, and nine-year-old Gul Zaman Marri, who earn between 300 and 400 PKR (£1.50-£2) a day.“My father had died due to an accident so I am an orphan and I have no one except a few family elders and one of them is working here,” says Noor. “We come here to do some work under his supervision. We can’t survive if we don’t work.”There have been multiple recent reports of child sexual abuse at the mines in Shahrag, and while Noor is adamant he has not been harassed, he says he fears for other young orphans who have no family working in the mines to look out for them.The story of the coal miners of Balochistan is one of debt bondage and human rights abuses, an absence of basic health and safety measures, and brutal working and living conditions. Many of the conditions of modern slavery are evident across these mines, which have not modernised in decades. Adult miners earn around £5 a day. Pakistan’s first Mines Act was passed in 1923 to enshrine workers’ rights. It stipulates that canteens, shelters, medical equipment and first aid rooms should be provided at every mine where more than 100 people are employed. Yet there was no obvious sign of these facilities when the  visited the Mach and Shahrag mines. At Mach, the workers’ quarters were a mud building in which more than 10 people shared each tiny room. There was no electricity, running water or a proper bathroom, and drinking water was not provided.The issues are compounded by the fact that that many of the workers have either migrated from Swat or neighbouring Afghanistan, and are not legally registered, meaning their very existence – and therefore their rights – can be easily dismissed. According to the Mines Act, all workers should be registered with firms and leaseholders. But there is little pressure from the authorities to enforce this.“The problem in Balochistan is that most coal mine owners and leaseholders are either influential people in Karachi and Lahore who took ownership in the 1950s and 1960s and have never even visited the mines themselves to see the conditions, or they are politicians, feudal or tribal chiefs who are in provincial and central government,” says Qambrani. “These owners never enforce registration of mine workers because then they have to provide all basic facilities, which would decrease their profits.”There is also little will or incentive for the state government to enforce the act’s provisions or subsequent iterations of the law intended to regulate the industry. Many key provincial assembly members are either owners of mines or have major stakes in Balochistan’s mining industry, including Jam Kamal Khan, who is both the state’s chief minister and minister for mining and minerals. Khan declined to comment when approached by the .According to the Pakistan Central Mines Labour Federation, between 100 and 200 labourers die on average in coal mine accidents every year, but many incidents go unreported. In January a Mach miner was trapped for over 48 hours and had to be dug out by fellow workers after the government failed to help with the rescue operation. In February, four miners died in a landslide at Duki. According to figures taken from records and news reports, from 2010 to May 2019 at least 414 miners were killed, though the real total is thought to be much higher.The unforgiving conditions take a heavy toll on the body. Many workers spoke of the constant threat of coal workers’ pneumoconiosis, commonly known as black lung disease, an incurable but preventable illness caused by inhaling coal mine dust. Bakth Nazar, a 55-year-old coal manager at a mine in Mach, says he has worked in the coalfields for about 30 years. In that time he has lost three family members in coal mines – including his son – due to the unsafe conditions.“We work with no facilities, no training and no safety measures,” says Nazar. “But the dilemma for us is that we don’t get paid when we don’t work. The company doesn’t care about our health.”“The government did not pay a penny for my brother Azam Khan and cousin who got trapped in coal mines and died last year,” says Nazar.Speaking on condition of anonymity, one mine inspector candidly depicts the horrors he has seen workers endure. Necessary breathing equipment is deemed “too expensive” and therefore not provided, he says. He also describes how a lack of training for workers can have dire consequences.He recounts one incident at a mine in Dagari in August 2019, where a cable caught fire underground and ignited gas within the mine, causing workers to fall unconscious and become trapped. Due to a lack of training for such scenarios, other workers and management turned on the fans, which only served to fuel the fire. In that incident two people died and eight suffered life-changing burns.“There are no emergency ambulances in the majority of coalfields and their surrounding areas. There is a lack of basic health units and hospitals. And even if by luck there is a hospital, you won’t find a doctor or equipment there. There is nothing inspectors can do,” he says.Khaliqdad Bugti, in charge of a mine in Shahrag, describes how during rainy season the roads often become blocked, leaving workers stranded without food for days and with only their mud huts to shelter in.Debt bondage is also a huge issue. Mohammed Ibrahim, a frail 40-year-old with one hand, explains that this is the situation in which he has found himself. Hundreds of miles away from his home and seven children in Afghanistan, Ibrahim works as a haulage driver to pay off the 50,000 PKR (£250) he borrowed from the manager of the coal mine to get this job in the first place.“I chose this work because I couldn’t find any other work,” says Ibrahim, “It is very difficult but I have no other way of paying off the debt. I have to work here until I pay the debt.”As well as being a mine manager, Ali works as a jori-sir, whose task is to find and provide mine workers for the contractor – mainly from poverty-stricken villages. He earns at least 10 PKR for each labourer he provides.“I find labourers and jobless people and provide them advance money if they need it, and in return bring them to work here in coal mines,” says Ali. “They will keep working until they pay the debts. I know who owes money and they are not allowed to leave. This business is being run on debt between labourers to petty managers. Labourers owe me money and I owe money to the contractor. In short, we both can’t leave until we pay our money.”The fatalities keep coming. When the  visited the Shahrag mine in January, an incident had occurred just 10 days earlier. Two workers, Faiz Mohammed and Samiullah, who had travelled from Afghanistan in desperate search of work and ended up in the mines, died after a mining trolley broke, throwing their bodies 1,000ft into the pit. Ghulam Raza, another worker at Mach who is originally from Ghazni in Afghanistan, describes the daily fear that has haunted him since he witnessed a portion of a mine wall collapse, killing a co-worker. The death was never investigated. “I got really scared,” says Raza. “When the incident happened, no one came from the government, not even an ambulance. The Frontier Corps just came to inquire about what happened and then told us to take the body to the bazar.”“Due to my debt, I cannot go back to my wife and son,” says Raza. “But if I had a choice, I wouldn’t stay an hour longer here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fb578bfee28eff817debeddee4ed66bce4a45c0/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e32e1ae9cb0a9ba79a464bc496a9bfc","title":"coming out as dalit how one indian author finally embraced her identity","story":"Raised to hide her low caste, Yashica Dutt’s new book traces her realisation that her history is one of oppression, not shamePretending not to be a Dalit took a heavy toll on the young Yashica Dutt.Her mother, Shashi, was so determined to protect her three children from the discrimination of the Hindu caste system that relegates Dalits to the periphery of society that she pretended the family were Brahmin.Shashi worked hard to find the money throw birthday parties, have curtains on the windows, and to follow traditional rituals correctly. But for the children it meant that one wrong word or gesture while playing with friends or buying sweets from a shopkeeper could expose the lie.It was only after she had grown up, that Dutt, a writer and journalist, began to understand the trauma of her childhood. When she began therapy in New Delhi six years ago, she simply asked her analyst: “Help me to live.”“I was always second-guessing myself, wondering if I had said the right thing, asking myself ‘would upper caste people with happier childhoods have said it better or done it differently?’ I had so much doubt from feeling like an imposter,” she says.Dutt recounts the story in her book, Coming Out as Dalit. It tells of her mother’s ambition to overcome poverty and give her children an education, without support and with an alcoholic husband. Dutt went to boarding school and then studied at St Stephen’s, perhaps the most prestigious university in India. She worked as a journalist in New Delhi and pursued a master’s at Columbia University in New York, where she now lives and works for an advertising agency.In the US Dutt, 34, discovered a parallel with her own experience. She heard some lighter-skinned African Americans talk of how they used to “pass” as white, assuming certain habits, tastes, language and mannerisms, just as her mother had mimicked those of upper caste Hindus.As part of her book tour, Dutt was back in India appearing at the Jaipur Literature Festival last month when the  met her in a New Delhi cafe, she cut a striking figure with her wavy hair, black leather jacket and hands flashing with chunky rings.Guilt entered her soul early and settled into sediment, she says. First it was guilt at her mother educating her when she could not afford it. Then it was guilt at having survived and enjoyed opportunities for education that so many in her community had never had and never would.Her parents, though poor, were educated and lived in a city (Ajmer in Rajasthan) rather than a village and that allowed the family to conceal its caste in a way that is impossible for the majority of India’s approximately 200 million Dalits who live in rural areas.Conversely, Dutt is concerned about the absence of guilt among upper caste Indians. While some white people joined the civil rights moment in the US or the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, the upper castes are nowhere to be seen in the Dalit struggle against discrimination, she says.“On the contrary,” she says, “there isn’t even the same kind of open discourse here of the kind you have in the US about racism, white supremacy, which is all mainstream. Instead of acknowledging discrimination, upper caste Indians, instead of taking responsibility, have deluded themselves into thinking they are already living in a ‘post-caste’ society.”She marks parallels with America in the wilful “innocence” that James Baldwin wrote of in that white Americans failed to understand what they had done to African Americans and that the race “problem” was “their” problem.At Columbia, she was astounded to find black, Hiic and gay classmates openly sharing their stories of discrimination without feeling any need to hide. Their accounts did not lead to the kind of social isolation she used to fear, but rather elicited sympathy from fellow students.Even Dutt’s moments of triumph as a young girl, she says, were accompanied by self-flagellation. After much imploring by Shashi, she was finally accepted by Mussoorie Public School where her mother hoped she would pick up all the remaining social markers of upper caste culture from the other girls that she would need throughout her life to blend in.Dutt came top of her class. “I felt nothing. To my mind, if someone like me could score so well, then this school couldn’t be all that great,” she says.Caste haunted Dutt, who choose to work as a fashion journalist in India, eschewing politics for fear that in writing a story or expressing an opinion she might reveal her caste. The fear of being “outed” was a permanent cloud. “If people knew, would they even sit next to me?”It was not until 2016, in New York, that Dutt felt able to “come out”. That year, suicide of a Dalit student, Rohith Vemula, at Hyderabad University, was a huge story in India. His last letter began: “My birth is my fatal accident.”“Unlike me, Rohith did nothing to bury his Dalitness. Instead, he used it to … stand up for Dalit students at Hyderabad University,” she writes in her book. His pride and courage despite enjoying none of her advantages prompted Dutt to write a Facebook post announcing her real caste. Vemula’s death, she wrote, “made me realise that my history is one of oppression, not shame”.The reaction from colleagues, friends, and acquaintances ranged from shock and dismay to support and praise. “Oh, you don’t look like a Dalit,” was one particularly inane remark.Dutt’s book is part of a wave of Dalit literature, art, music and experiences finally coming to the fore in India. Dalit film directors are making films on caste. Dalit Twitter is a vibrant platform. Social media generally has become a powerful forum for sharing experiences and presenting a counter perspective to social phenomena. Dutt feels she is now a “whole person”, at home in her own skin. “I have nothing to hide,” she says.Whether her mother was right in her decision to conceal her children’s caste is a question that Dutt says she still does not have sufficient objective distance from.“Right now, I believe it was the right choice.

Seats reclined up against your face, legs manspreading into your tiny space and – my personal misanthropy fuel – a stranger’s bare feet poking in between the seats.Thanks to the internet and the ubiquity of air rage videos on social media, you don’t even have to be flying to be drawn into this maddening coupling of deep discomfort and pure intimacy with strangers. In the latest one, a woman sits with her seat reclined on an American Airlines flight, filming over her shoulder. Behind her, a man slouches in his chair, with one hand up, punching the back of her seat incessantly. The video reignited the extremely tedious and never-ending debate about reclining your seat. As with most things, I was on the writer Roxane Gay’s side: “Reclining is impolite but punching someone’s seat over and over and over … That is even more wrong.”Every time one of these videos surfaces, it’s hard not to think we should save plenty of ire for the airlines themselves. I make no excuses for the seat-punching jerk, but there is an absurdity to endlessly debating the etiquette here without asking – maybe it’s also the seats, and the companies who profit from selling them so close together, that are the problem?Air travel is getting more uncomfortable: people are getting bigger but seats are generally getting smaller and closer together. The flight attendants’ union in the US last year warned this cramming was a safety issue, increasing conflict while also running the risk of making emergency evacuations slower. The trade-off for cheaper air travel over the past few decades has been a relentless pursuit of efficiency of space, which literally pits us against each other.But it’s not just air travel. So many spaces where we interact with each other in the era of late capitalism bring out our absolute worst and threaten to make cranks of us all.We jostle and squabble in queues at underfunded public services. We grow irritated stuck on buses behind streams of slow cyclists in cities that have failed to build proper bike lanes. We find ourselves cursing into strangers’ armpits or tussling with their backpacks on overcrowded public transport.I always feel like I’ve entered a scene from The Purge anytime I’ve shopped at Zara at lunchtime. The ratio of customers to change rooms in their stores always seems to be 7,000:1, leading women to try on what they can in the aisles – strewing clothes around the store, clogging the floors and fighting for mirror space. At sale time, you can feel like you need body armour.At the core of all these issues is usually bad design and organisation, with profit, private interests and cost-cutting, not people, in mind. In spaces where human needs seem like an afterthought, it’s little wonder our empathy diminishes. And it’s a burden felt by some more than others. These are largely situations some pay their way out of – there aren’t too many air rage videos coming out of first class, or fights over mirror space in Miu Miu. You’re less likely to think hell is other people when you don’t have to be squeezed up against them constantly as you move through the world.In a rankling epilogue to last week’s viral video, the CEO of Delta airlines dispensed some etiquette advice about reclining: “I think that the proper thing to do is if you’re going to recline into somebody, that you ask if it’s OK first,” he said. Of course he would – the forbearance of passengers even under increasingly undignified circumstances is integral to the business model at this point.But trying to hold on to our humanity in these vexing situations is more than worth it for us. Firstly, obviously, because it makes life more bearable. But secondly, because it’s camaraderie and seeing people around you as real, whole people, not just competitors for space, or objects to be wedged in place, that is the best antidote to the ruthless ideology shaping these experiences in the first place.On one trip home to Australia from the US a few years back I found myself wondering what I had done wrong in a past life to be sat next to bodybuilder – a giant of a man with arms and legs like felled logs that tumbled over the armrests and out from the bounds of his seat. He started chatting to me – loudly – as soon as I sat down, in his thick New Jersey accent, as he wiped beads of sweat from his brow.I quickly realised the poor guy was overcome with nerves. He confessed to me he’d never actually been on a plane before, but he had to, because he’d fallen for an Australian girl. She was from Queensland, a dancer on a cruise ship. He showed me pictures of her on his phone (“bewdiful, right?”). She wanted him to come meet her family. He was crazy about her. So he booked a damn flight.All my irritation melted away and I found myself both getting very invested in this transpacific love story and taking on the role of flight doula. I asked him questions about toning my glutes I would literally never put in to practise to keep him talking, while sharing all the usual soothing platitudes about the relative safety of air travel. I also gave him permission to squeeze my arm if he got scared. For the next 14 hours I had almost no legroom, no armrest and no sleep, with a big stranger’s hand gripping my forearm intermittently. And I wasn’t the least bit mad."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19c4a30889b7d44a204a018f09636afa3e7270db/0_269_4080_2448/master/4080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4389a60f5441b06e464c65482ef82dc","title":"house prices rise in every region of uk for first time in two years","story":"House prices have increased in every region in the UK for the first time in two years, as the Conservative party’s election victory and a more settled economic outlook calmed buyers’ nerves.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the pattern of falling house price growth since the 2016 EU referendum was reversed last summer in some regions in the north and east of England.December was the first month since February 2018 that prices increased in all regions and countries.The average UK house price hit £235,000, £5,000 higher than in December 2018.David Westgate, the chief executive at Andrews Property Group, said: “For all regions to have delivered positive annual growth for the first time in nearly two years highlights just how resilient the UK property market has been against a backdrop of extreme political uncertainty.”Figures last month revealed that prices increased after a surge in the sales of expensive homes in London’s most sought-after districts. In the past year 185 £5m-plus mortgages were taken out by purchasers, according to figures from the Financial Conduct Authority.The value of those mortgages was £9.7m on average and the total was £1.8bn, an increase of £200m on the previous year.The ONS said: “Increased London house price growth may reflect a larger shift in the type of properties being sold than usual, with more sales of very high value properties.”Westgate said: “While the London figure may have been skewed slightly by sales of extremely high value properties, the capital as a whole appears to have rediscovered its mojo.“There’s every chance the rebound in sentiment in the capital will cause a ripple effect across the regions.”Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the latest sales data from the Halifax and the Nationwide pointed to a further firming in house prices in January.“Recent data and surveys suggest that the housing market is changing up a gear after a largely lacklustre 2019,” he said.“There is certainly a fair degree of evidence that the housing market has got an initial leg-up from increased optimism and reduced uncertainties following the decisive general election result as well as greater near-term clarity on Brexit, with the UK leaving the EU on 31 January with a deal.”The latest Bank of England data showed mortgage approvals for house purchases rose markedly in December to 67,241, the highest monthly level since July 2017.Mortgage approvals in December were also most probably lifted by increased confidence and reduced uncertainty among buyers and sellers after the decisive general election result, said Archer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de59ce3ce85880754de01de579900e72b9aa3891/0_59_5109_3066/master/5109.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f6109a90ef6de1b15ec3c184d34fe2d","title":"brits 2020 the best of the red carpet and ceremony in pictures","story":"The highlights from the 40th Brit Awards"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97531905b8d0fb26c40ad8e403eabbde159b07c5/0_74_2873_1723/master/2873.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6a08cf110bdea0eb0bf3efffe699e55","title":"can the fashion industry ever be sustainable","story":"Environmental journalist Lucy Siegle has been writing about the fashion industry for 15 years.

He said that “to think that we might accept EU supervision on so-called level playing field issues simply fails to see the point of what we are doing”.In response, Barnier said the UK could not have the same trade deal with the EU as Canada. He said the EU was ready to offer an “ambitious partnership” with the UK, but he said its “particular proximity” meant it would be different.After 47 years and 30 days it is all over. As the clock strikes 11pm on Friday, the UK is officially orced from the EU and will begin trying to carve out a new global role as a sovereign nation. It was a union that got off to a tricky start and continued to be marked by the UK’s sometimes conflicted relationship with its neighbours. Here’s a run-through the beginning, the middle and the end.The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain’s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a “deep-seated hostility” towards the European project.Sir Edward Heath\u0026nbspsigns the accession treaty giving entry to the EEC in an official ceremony that was accompanied by a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.Lisa O\u0027CarrollMargaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the iron lady marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand “our own money back” claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back” despite being one of the “three poorer” members of the community.It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.\u0026nbspCollapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU.Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was ‘no, no, no’ to what she saw as Delors’ continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch’s Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered “Up yours Delors” front page.A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of “a single market without barriers – visible or invisible – giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world’s wealthiest and most prosperous people.Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union. John Major won the vote the following day in a pyrrhic victory.\u0026nbspTony Blair patches up the relationship. Signs up to social charter and workers\u0027 rights.Nigel Farage elected an MEP and immediately goes on the offensive in Brussels. “Our interests are best served by not being a member of this club,” he said in his maiden speech. “The level playing field is about as level as the decks of the Titanic after it hit an iceberg.”Chancellor Gordon Brown decides the UK will not join the euro.EU enlarges to to include eight countries of the former eastern bloc including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.EU expands again, allowing Romania and Bulgaria into the club.Anti-immigration hysteria seems to take hold with references to “cockroches” by Katie Hopkins in the Sun and tabloid headlines such as “How many more can we take?” and “Calais crisis: send in the dogs”.\u0026nbspDavid Cameron returns with reform package.Speaking at the London School of Economics on Wednesday, De Rynck said: “If you allow some irony, some in the UK now seem to want to become Canadians. But of course Dover is much closer to Calais than Ottawa is. The distance from Dover to Calais, and – thanks to the foresight of Margaret Thatcher and others – the speed of connection to the tunnel, is of course much quicker than what we have with our Canadian friends. So proximity matters.”He said what mattered was the interconnectedness between economies. “Dislocating zero-quota, zero-tariff access, this brings a lot of benefits to the UK economy and with benefits come obligations,” De Rynck said. “And it’s clear that for us it’s a different ball game that we are playing with the UK to the one that we agreed with Canada in terms of the level playing field.”He also said a written statement by Boris Johnson on 3 February, in which the prime minister outlined Downing Street’s proposed approach to negotiations, was a “source of some concern”.On the same day, Johnson gave a speech in Greenwich in which he claimed the UK would not need to accept EU rules in trade. He outlined the government’s red lines but gave none of the detail that would be expected from parties about to embark on trade talks.EU member states are due to confirm the bloc’s negotiating objectives at a meeting next week but the UK’s plans to publish a mirror document next week have reportedly been cancelled.De Rynck said: “We’re certainly also looking forward to the UK document that was promised for next week. We, of course, have read the speeches that were given over the last week, also by the prime minister in Greenwich on the 3rd of February and other statements …“One written document that came out on the 3rd of February was the ministerial statement, which I cannot hide from you is a source of some concern in terms of the level of ambition of the political declaration not perhaps being fully met always by what is said in that ministerial statement.“Notably on issues such as level playing field, the court of justice and internal security cooperation, the overarching governance framework which we have agreed with the United Kingdom.”Canada’s deal with the EU, which took seven years to negotiate, eliminates most import tariffs on goods but not all. It also increases quotas – the amount of a product that can be exported without extra charges – but does not remove them entirely.The UK is in a transition period, after leaving the EU on 31 January, and has until the end of the year to hammer out a trade deal with Brussels. Until then, the country still follows the majority of EU rules.Highlighting the potential difficulty of negotiating in a tight timeframe, De Rynck said: “We have a vast amount of work and we seem to have 10 months to do it, or less than 10 months if you calculate the time for ratification so that everybody can be ready on January 1, 2021 for the new regime.“I would expect some of these negotiations to be rather difficult, perhaps more difficult that during withdrawal because the scope of issues is so much vaster.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50cb7a529c7296a2a5d4bab23c9fa6836e44bfdd/0_0_1249_749/master/1249.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9efc40c9ed57a3386b1ad9e55af042a9","title":"caroline lucas investigated over election fundraisers","story":"Former Ukip candidate complained Lucas breached code of conduct by offering rewards for donationsParliamentary standards authorities are investigating Caroline Lucas for allegedly breaching rules by offering a tour of the House of Commons in an election fundraiser after a complaint from a Conservative MP.Lucas, the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion since 2015, insisted she has done nothing wrong, but said she cannot comment further as investigations by the parliamentary commissioner for standards are confidential.News of the investigation came after a former Ukip candidate made a complaint about a pre-election fundraiser in which Lucas’s team raised nearly £18,500 by offering rewards in exchange for donations, such as a cake baked by the MP if you gave £100.Another item was the chance for one person to received a 3o-minute “personal guided tour of House of Commons” if Lucas was re-elected, in return for a donation of £150.Stuart Bower, formerly a Ukip council candidate in Brighton and Hove, told the Brighton Argus newspaper that he had complained to the commissioner for standards, Kathryn Stone, about “unethical” conduct by Lucas, but that he had received a reply saying another complaint on the same matter was already being investigated.It is understood that the initial complaint was made by a Conservative MP, whose identity remains unknown. It is also understood that Stone asked Bower to keep the matter confidential, but that he opted to go to his local newspaper.In a statement, Lucas, the Greens’ first and so far only MP, said: “I’m aware that a case against me has been brought to the commissioner, and an investigation is currently under way. I do not believe I have done anything wrong.“I have been advised that the commissioner’s investigations are confidential so it would not be appropriate for me to say anything more at this time.”It is not unusual for candidates from smaller parties or independents to seek financial help to fight a general election campaign. At the last election, former Conservative Dominic Grieve, raised more than £35,000 from members of the public.Other incentives offered by Lucas in her fundraiser included £250 for lunch with the MP in Brighton, or £50 for a signed T-shirt with a slogan advocating proportional representation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/486eeccf24e50fb671055e63ad44f19adf4e9cca/0_153_2290_1374/master/2290.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91668ac9192ed5599133392e145f85c8","title":"how to choose the destination of your winter dreams","story":"Picking the right location for your ski holiday can be stressful. Narrow down your search with these tipsThere are more than 5,000 ski resorts in the world, in more than 50 different countries. So how on earth do you begin to find the right one for you? The choice of destination can be overwhelming, let alone picking an inidual resort. And don’t expect Google to have the answer. Unless the question is: “Which ski resorts are best at search engine optimisation?”Here’s everything you need to know about skiing in France, Switzerland and Japan.Family-friendly fun in FranceTypical ski season: December-MayThe appeal is helped by France’s proximity to the UK, which means short flight times and plenty of low-cost airline choice, along with the opportunity to drive or take the environmentally-friendly train option.And French resorts are especially good for family snow trips, thanks to their English-speaking ski schools, tailored beginner areas and fun snow parks for kids. Many resorts also have an impressive array of non-ski activities to keep things enjoyable for children.Nestled in an enchanted pine forest at 1,750 metres, Club Med Les Arcs Panorama is a great choice for families, as it’s right on the slopes and has children’s classes and clubs available from four months up. Kids will love the playful animal sculptures dotted around the property, the ski trails through the woods and the resort’s famed toboggan runs.A luxury treat in SwitzerlandTypical ski season: November-MaySkiing in Switzerland is for those who want to push the boat out – a place of chocolate box beauty, where time appears to have stood still. But its popularity with Britons is also because it boasts some of the best ski resorts in Europe, with great pistes for all levels, excellent snow records, and renowned ski schools.Saint-Moritz was the world’s first winter sports resort and continues to have a reputation for glitz and glamour. By staying at the Club Med Saint-Moritz Roi Soleil you can enjoy all the chicness from a safe distance, knowing the price of your all-inclusive holiday was fixed in advance. The resort is linked to the extensive Engadin valley, and off-piste activities include Nordic skiing, riding in horse-drawn carriages and cosy fondue suppers.Crowd-free adventures in JapanTypical ski season: December-MarchHeading to Japan is the ultimate choice for adventurous skiers and snowboarders who want a fresh and original take on their winter break. Yes, you have to travel farther, but once you’re there Japan will more than deliver on the experience, as more and more British travellers are discovering each year.Hokkaido in the north of the country is the premier spot for skiing and snowboarding. Expect uncrowded slopes, plentiful fresh powder snow, phenomenal food, and unique insights into Japanese culture. Club Med’s Tomamu Hokkaido gives you ski-in ski-out access to Tomamu Mountain, a mix of cultural exploration and a great snow experience. Enjoy the 145 hectares of powder to play in, thaw out in a Japanese onsen and learn how to make sushi from the resort chef.Club Med, founded in 1950, is the pioneer of the all-inclusive concept, offering nearly 70 premium resorts in stunning locations around the world including North and South America, Caribbean, Asia, Africa, Europe and the Mediterranean."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b9c9a5bea3b7e741c77eb03af1c44249e5e8ea7/0_106_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96a1d114ce01d80b40315fd69bd8029e","title":"scientists discover neanderthal skeleton in an iraqi cave","story":"The fossils found in Iraqi cave provide fresh evidence the species buried their death with mortuary ritualsA Neanderthal skeleton unearthed in an Iraqi cave, already famous for fossils of these cousins of our species, is providing fresh evidence that they buried their dead – and intriguing clues that flowers may have been used in such rituals.Scientists said they had discovered the well-preserved upper body skeleton of an adult Neanderthal, who lived about 70,000 years ago, in Shanidar Cave in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region of northern Iraq on Tuesday. The inidual – dubbed Shanidar Z – was perhaps in his or her 40s or 50s with their sex undetermined.The cave was a pivotal site for mid-20th century archaeology. Remains of 10 Neanderthals – seven adults and three infants – were dug up there 60 years ago, offering insight into their physical characteristics, behaviour and diet. Clusters of flower pollen were found in soil samples associated with one of the skeletons, a discovery that prompted scientists involved in that research to propose that Neanderthals buried their dead and conducted funerary rites with flowers.That hypothesis helped change the prevailing view at the time of Neanderthals as dimwitted and brutish, a notion increasingly discredited by new discoveries. Critics cast doubt on the “flower burial,” arguing the pollen could have been modern contamination from people living in the cave or from rodents or insects.But Shanidar Z’s bones, which are believed to be the top half of a partial skeleton unearthed in 1960, were found in sediment containing ancient pollen and other mineralised plant remains, reviving the possibility of flower burials. “So from initially being a sceptic based on many of the other published critiques of the flower-burial evidence, I am coming round to think this scenario is much more plausible and I am excited to see the full results of our new analyses,” said University of Cambridge osteologist and paleoanthropologist Emma Pomeroy, lead author of the research published in the journal Antiquity.Scholars have argued for years about whether Neanderthals buried their dead with mortuary rituals, part of the larger debate over their levels of cognitive sophistication.“What is key here is the intentionality behind the burial. You might bury a body for purely practical reasons, in order to avoid attracting dangerous scavengers andor to reduce the smell. But when this goes beyond practical elements it is important because that indicates more complex, symbolic and abstract thinking, compassion and care for the dead, and perhaps feelings of mourning and loss,” Pomeroy said.“Whether the Neanderthal group of dead, placed around 70,000 years ago in the cave were a few years, a few decades or centuries – or even millennia – apart, it seems clear that Shanidar was a special place, with bodies being placed just in one part of a large cave,” said University of Cambridge archeologist and study co-author Graeme Barker.Neanderthals inhabited Eurasia from the Atlantic coast to the Ural Mountains from about 400,000 years ago until a little after 40,000 years ago, disappearing after our species established itself in the region.The two species interbred, with modern non-African human populations bearing residual Neanderthal DNA."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/003128bc972dfe8ca695b4e65bd1602f55cf665e/0_70_5725_3435/master/5725.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81b52cdb9de8c2bb78adf43aee58cf93","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youPassengers onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan have been able to leave after being quarantined since 3 February.Hundreds of people – who spent quarantine largely confined to their cabins – disembarked the ship to board buses and taxis.According to the South China Morning Post, a second person in Hong Kong has died from the coronavirus.

To the unfamiliar, it can seem like magic.It’s not hard to see why this fast-paced and eminently televisable spectacle of barely controlled chaos has fast become one of the most popular events of the Westminster Kennel Club dog show in the seven years since it was first added to the program – and a welcome alternative for those who believe traditional conformation shows, where dogs are judged almost entirely on their appearance, are archaic and outmoded.The introduction of an agility competition to Westminster marked a step forward for this emerging sport and few trainers have since made a bigger impact on the US scene than Perry DeWitt and Jessica Ajoux, who live together in the Philadelphia suburb of Wyncote alongside two of America’s most famous canine athletes: the border collies Verb and Fame.The six-year-old Verb, owned and handled by DeWitt, captured last year’s Westminster masters agility title with a sensational final run that went viral and enters this year’s competition as the defending champion. Fame, aged nine and in the winter of her career, won it the year before and remains a formidable threat to regain the crown. In a couple days’ time, they will make the two-hour drive north to New York City and attempt to make it three in a row for what’s fast becoming the winningest household in the sport.“I do feel a little bit of pressure of being the reigning champion, because I think everyone’s watching and everyone’s expecting you to do something,” DeWitt says in the days before the trial. “Agility is funny because I’ve had so many good runs with Verb and every time I wonder if I will ever have another, because it always feels like it’s just lucky that it happens. That’s why it’s so addicting, because you can’t guarantee it.”Ajoux, who plans to retire Fame shortly after this year’s Westminster after a decorated career, strikes a more confident pose as the competition looms.“There’s two people that can beat us,” she says. “And it’s us.”The conformation portion of Westminster is one of America’s longest-running sporting events and what most people envision when they think of dog shows (or, indeed, Best in Show), but vocal critics have claimed it enables the breeding of dogs for beauty over health and function to the detriment of the animal.The essential purpose of the more than 20,000 conformation shows held annually in the United States is to assess dogs for breeding stock or, more specifically, in a way that promotes selection of parents in order to produce the “best” puppies. But the judging at these shows almost exclusively places an emphasis on physical appearance, effectively ignoring the genetic factors like health, temperament and function that enable a dog to live a successful life as a working or companion animal.Agility exists on the opposite end of the spectrum from the conformation world, offering a far more dog-positive arena free of controversy. Unlike conformation shows which only allow intact purebreds, it is open to mixed breeds. Handlers don’t care what their border collies look like as they careen through the course and fly toward the finish line: they just want them to win and have fun doing it (and not vitally in that order). As competitions they are similar in the sense they determine a best from a field of dogs and thus exist to celebrate an ideal. But as a spectator sport, agility trials are to conformation shows, more or less, as Miss America is to the Olympics.Any able-bodied dog is eligible to compete in agility under American Kennel Club rules, but border collies like Verb and Fame have won the overall title in all but one of the seven years since Westminster introduced it. That’s no accident. The herding dog is widely regarded as the most intelligent of domestic breeds, underpinned by a sheer athleticism seemingly tailor-made for the sport’s demands. The difference in watching a top border collie churn through a course after watching a dachshund or a mastiff feels something like watching LeBron James take the court on the heels of a mid-major college game.“I would say they’re one of the one of the most, if not the most biddable dog breed out there, which means that they want to do what you want them to do,” says DeWitt, a full-time certified professional dog trainer with an in-depth background in dog behavior. “They were bred to be working in conjunction with humans doing tasks and responding very quickly to cues and commands at a distance. Not to mention, they’re very, very athletic. They can turn on a dime, they can accelerate, they can decelerate, they can sprint, they have endurance. They’re just an overall very athletic breed.”DeWitt had initially been eying a different puppy in the litter of a breeder from outside Las Vegas when she first spotted Verb at five weeks old and knew “within 30 seconds” she needed to have him. She gave him a name that connoted action, auguring the exploits in his future. But innate athleticism is only half of the game. DeWitt’s almost extrasensory communion with Verb as he bounds around the ring in lockstep with her cues, 42lbs of fast-twitch muscle in a blur, is a demonstrable testament to her command of the underlying emotional factors that drive canine behavior.She’s found her other half in Ajoux, a Princeton-educated agility instructor who has less of a formal background in dog training but has competed in the sport since she was a teenager and made it into her full-time profession. She believes athleticism is the most non-negotiable trait in a top dog, but character cannot be overlooked.“These are dogs that live with us all the time, so you have to find a dog that you get along with,” says Ajoux, who wasn’t in the market for a new puppy when an enthusiastic breeder insisted (correctly) that Fame was her type of dog. “Their personality, if it matches well with yours, that’s the winning team. Because you could have the best dog in the world, but if you’re not in sync with that particular dog, it never works. It’s so simple: you have to really like your dog and they have to like you.”DeWitt grew up suburban Pennsylvania obsessed with canines, spending her idle time memorizing an encyclopedia of dog breeds. She was nine when her parents bought the family a border collie and took it on herself to start training him in agility on a makeshift course in her backyard after seeing a competition on television.She put agility on the back burner for a few years when her own lacrosse career took off, but can vividly recall her sudden compulsion to get back into it again while riding the bus home from her final college game. One week after graduation, she was in California buying her first own border collie and the rest is history.“What matters the most in this sport is how a dog and a team responds to pressure,” DeWitt says, a nod to the competitive itch that agility manages to scratch for her. “You can be the best in the world in your backyard or even in class, but you have to be able to take the crowd, you have to be able to take the pressure of being in a final run and manage your emotions and the dog has to be able to manage theirs, too.“That’s one thing that makes Verb such an amazing competitor: he is not fazed by anything. If I took him in the backyard and did agility with him, it would be no different than doing it at Westminster with a huge crowd and the speakers and the people cheering. He does not notice, he does not care. I do, but I think having a history of competing in sports at a pretty high level taught me to be able to deal with that type of emotion.”Ajoux, who was raised in southern California and France, was also a born animal-lover and spent many of her early years horseback riding and show jumping. But from the moment she first saw an agility trial on television, she knew she had to be involved. She researched agility clubs obsessively as a teenager and started training the family’s house dog, Mocha, for competitions that she couldn’t yet drive to. Her parents thought it was a fad, but two decades later it remains her passion and livelihood.They met several years ago through the agility community and describe their early impressions of one another in terms of mutual respect as competitors. Today, DeWitt and Ajoux live together with eight dogs while owning and operating an agility training center in the nearby village of Huntington Valley, about 25 miles outside Philadelphia. One reason behind their success is they devote themselves to it full time, while many of their competitors are hobbyists with day jobs. This is what they do. Even equestrians who live and breathe their animal every day have to put their horse in a stall at the end of the day. Verb and Fame are in the bed with them. It is their work life, it is their romantic life, it is their hobby and it’s their family.The competitive benefits to the partnership are many. They can put their heads together to study the courses, which are designed by judges and kept secret until an hour before a trial, with twice the brainpower and problem-solving experience. If one notices or misses something important during a run, they can pass along the intel to the other before they take the start line. Any training secret that one of them has becomes something both of them have.But there’s only room for one winner in agility – and a relationship between a pair of fiercely competitive handlers is not without emotional pitfalls.“What makes it difficult is that we both really care about it a lot, we both really want to win and I can feel a lot of guilt if I’m not happy enough for her that she did well because I did badly,” DeWitt says. “It’s just a weird mix of emotions that’s hard to navigate.”Ajoux jumps in: “Because you don’t want to take away from their success but we know each other obviously, so we can’t hide it. Then if I’ve not done well and I want to be a little bit sad and I want her to comfort me, why should I be taking away from her excitement? Balancing it is super hard, but at the same time, I think we’ve gotten really good at agility because wherever I go, my biggest competition drove there in the car with me.”The origins of dog agility can be traced to the 1978 Crufts dog show in Birmingham, where a former committee member named John Varley was tasked with coming up with intermission entertainment for the audience between the conformation and obedience competitions. His solution was a variation on show jumping designed to demonstrate a dog’s willingness to work with their handler in a variety of situations.The Kennel Club, Britain’s counterpart to the AKC, established an official set of rules in 1980 and the sport quickly took hold, spreading across Europe and across the pond over the following decade. It was already popular in the United States long before Westminster added it in 2014, but the sport’s inclusion in America’s most publicized and heavily marketed dog show has given it unprecedented mainstream exposure in a few short years.That’s led to increased participation – the AKC claims more than one million entries to the registry’s agility program each year – and higher-caliber opposition than ever before, especially at high-profile competitions like Westminster. The fields on the older United States Dog Agility Association (USDAA) circuit are even stronger.“The competition is getting fiercer and fiercer each year,” says Ajoux, who has been handling agility dogs competitively since 1999. “It used to be more local people because it’s not like it’s easy to get to New York City, but more and more people are coming in from across the country and you’re seeing more competitive teams. The prestige of winning Westminster is definitely taking hold in the agility community, because of the fact that it’s televised and you get so much recognition, more so than any other thing that happens in agility.”She adds: “Dogs are getting so much faster. They’re running faster and the courses are becoming more intricate, more technical. And as a result, it’s also becoming more athletically demanding for the handler to negotiate some of the courses as well, because I can’t outrun Fame, and so the only way I can actually tell her where to go is to have skills trained to a higher level. The level of course is right now, it’s at the edge of our training and it’s only getting harder and faster.”Pier 94, the decommissioned passenger ship terminal on the Hudson River where the agility competition takes place, is already a flurry of activity at 7.30am on a Saturday morning as the Westminster dog show opens for the 144th year. It’s roughly a half hour before the first qualifying runs of this year’s contest and the handlers are walking about the 100-by-40-foot competition space, carefully examining a course they’re only seeing for the first time.“There’s only so many types of obstacles, and there’s usually between 18 and 22 obstacles on the course, but the combinations are infinite and it’s different every time,” DeWitt says. “Sometimes you’ll see some similarities or patterns, but it’s never the same course twice. And so you don’t get to practice the exact sequences before the competition, so you have to have a lot of tools in the toolbox in order to negotiate whatever the judge has put forth that day.”Verb and Fame will be competing in a field of some 325 dogs today. Both will need to complete a pair of clean qualifying runs to reach the evening finals, which have been sold out for weeks and will be broadcast nationally in prime time.Ajoux and Fame compete the first run flawlessly and pace their class entering the second. But Fame takes a bar early in her second run, knocking it to the ground for a five-second deduction, then commits a second fault when she misses a jump near the end. A single fault, which counts against a dog’s overall time, might not have spelled elimination given Fame’s raw speed. But two faults is too deep a hole for the fastest dog to overcome.That leaves it to Verb and the defending champion lives up to advance billing, zipping through a pair of flawless qualifying runs and earning the top seed for the final.After carefully examining the freshly redesigned course before the final run and mentally devising a handling plan, DeWitt retreats beneath the grandstand with Verb, closes her eyes and goes through the creative visualization routine – seeing the perfect run in her mind’s eye. The course is tricky at the finish, but she’s confident in her dog – even if the spiking heart rate on her smart watch betrays her nerves.Then it begins and one by one the dogs in Verb’s class either botch their runs or fail to post extraordinary times. And with Verb running last due to his afternoon performance, DeWitt knows the time they need to beat – and safe in the knowledge that she doesn’t need to push him.A hush falls over the sold-out crowd as Verb takes his position at the start line. Then he’s off like a bullet from a barrel, clearing every jump and obstacle, barreling through tunnels and drawing oohs and aahs from the gallery as he whips through the weaving poles at impossible speed. He’s well ahead of the clubhouse leader and it seems a second straight Westminster title is in the bag when – in a stroke of breathtaking drama – he takes the wrong jump at the final obstacle before turning back and going through the right one. As the crowd deflates like a balloon, DeWitt throws her arms up in a mix of surprise and disappointment. The refusal is a five-second deduction, ensuring their elimination. He didn’t go where she told him to go. Just a moment of an animal being an animal.The overall winner is a border collie named Pink handled by the Ohio trainer Jennifer Crank, the same team who finished second to Fame in 2018 and to Verb in 2019. Behind the winner’s circle are tears and there are smiles as DeWitt embraces Ajoux in the corridor where their photos hang as former champions. Verb’s contagious grin as he looks up from the carpet seems to communicate what they all know: They’ll be back.“We just both care probably too much for what it really is,” DeWitt says. “I mean, it’s a dog sport, dogs jumping over PVC pipes. But we care about it a lot, which makes us better because we’re always working hard. We’re both very, very competitive and always have been in everything we’ve done.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/221286f954924e7811959d0665e239edfff89714/0_49_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8699e7c3df22a868d044b8c8ca8444f9","title":"kim clijsters returns tennis energy","story":"The former world No 1 tasted defeat after her latest comeback but has found returning to training transformativeWhen Kim Clijsters announced her first comeback to professional tennis in the summer of 2009, the news was met with joy. It seemed right and just. In the first stanza of her career she established herself as one of the best players in the world while surrounded by legends, but her career was always defined by what it lacked: she was a freakish athlete who made crowds gasp every time she routinely slid into full splits at full speed on hard courts, but she had lost her first four slam finals. She was a choker, people said. After finally winning her first slam at the US Open in 2005, Clijsters departed two years later at the age of 2007. It felt like she still had more to give.Clijsters’s comebacks took even herself by surprise. She had been invited to the opening of the Wimbledon Centre Court roof in 2009 for an exhibition with Steffi Graf, Andre Agassi and Tim Henman. As she worked herself into shape for the match, the joy of discipline and setting goals returned. She made her way back into the sport just a couple of months later, embarking on one of the most legendary comebacks in the process. In her third tournament back, still without a ranking to her name, she beat Serena Williams in a controversial US Open semi-final and went on win the tournament, beating 19-year-old Caroline Wozniacki in the final.From crumbling under pressure and losing the first four grand slam finals of her career, Clijsters finished her second stanza by winning four in a row. Armed with the perspective of a life outside the rigid confines of an inidual sport, she marched around the tour and snatched the career most fans envisioned for her. After being cast in the shadow of Justine Henin and the Williams sisters for so long, she had stepped into the light as a hall of fame champion in her own right and, back then, she was a rare example of a thriving working mother at the top of the professionalised era of tennis. When she finally departed in 2012, her body was falling apart and her motivation was waning. The timing of her departure seemed as apt as her return.Instead Clijsters’s motivation was a little closer to home. After her second retirement she lived a peaceful, quiet life with her husband and three children. Although athletes often struggle once the intense pressure of elite competition is no longer the base of their lives, Clijsters was happy. But after a lifetime of single-mindedly chasing her goals and thriving, her days were centred around her children and their routines and at some point she lost some of herself. She desperately needed to do something for herself and even just returning to training was transformative for her mental health.“The process I’ve been going through has been tough, but I feel like I have had more energy these last six months or so than I’ve had in the last two years,” she told WTA Insider in September. “Because I’m actually taking care of myself better, I’m not taking everything aside towards the children and it was something I forgot about. I’m actually leaving the house in the morning and I’ve had breakfast.”Clijsters pointed out all the people she knew preparing for marathons and that this was the challenge she set for herself: “I don’t feel like I need to prove anything,” she said. “But I want to challenge myself and I want to be strong again. This is my marathon. This is where I’m saying OK, let’s try this.” There is a lesson within because the scepticism of Clijsters’s latest return goes hand in hand with calls for older athletes like Venus Williams to depart into the night. It is easy to argue when an athlete should hang up their boots or to question their motivation for returning, but this is a reminder that motivation is personal and it concerns nobody but themselves.On Monday afternoon at the Dubai Championships, Clijsters, now aged 36, returned against Garbiñe Muguruza and she was down 6-2 3-0 after 40 minutes. Her technique was as she left it in 2012. Her timing was crisp, but each perfect strike was eventually followed by shanks that rifled into the back fence. After seven and a half years, it seemed to be good enough for the time being. But as the match continued, Clijsters was slowly remembering how to compete in real time. She started to pump her fists between points and began to clean the lines. By the end of the match, it took the two-times slam champion and Australian Open finalist a tight, nervy tie-break to edge out Clijsters in two sets. Clijsters had no reason to expect anything more after so long, but she left the court seething at her own mistakes. Her marathon has begun."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0864b8f170a5fb8570fd81b18098a94edd833829/92_402_5280_3168/master/5280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b9b4afdbe0121c4cb278c274798b4b1","title":"national theatre boss denies being part of left of centre elite","story":"Rufus Norris rebuffs Downton creator Julian Fellowes’ claim that NT is in a cultural bubbleRufus Norris, the director of the National Theatre, has taken aim at a suggestion he is in a “left-of-centre metropolitan” bubble as he announced he is to stay in post for another five yearsThe Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes, a Tory peer, complained over the weekend of the people who “control everything – not just the BBC … but the National Theatre, the National Gallery, the National Trust, the national this, the national that”. He said they all spoke with one voice, “a kind of Hampstead voice”, which expressed opinions as facts.Norris rejected the criticism as he announced details of the theatre’s plans for 2020-21 on Wednesday.“I don’t know Julian and I’ve not seen him here recently,” Norris said. “I totally dispute the idea that we’re speaking in any particular bubble.”Norris said the NT’s work was increasingly nationwide, “more than the theatre has ever done. I expect that fact is not known to him because he hasn’t looked”.Fellowes made his comments in a Sunday Times interview in which he talked about the types of people resisting inevitable social change. Once it was the grand elite walking towards the abyss, now the “quite good” run “of the left-of-centre metropolitan elite” was coming to an end.Norris’s run at the National Theatre is definitely not coming to an end, as he revealed he had recently signed up for a second five-year term in the job.He announced nine productions at its South Bank stages for 2020-21, which include an adaptation of Rachel Cusk’s trilogy of “Faye” novels, Outline, Transit and Kudos, and the first major revival in 35 years of the Welsh classsic The Corn is Green by Emlyn Williams.Standing at the Sky’s Edge, a musical celebration of life on Sheffield’s Park Hill estate with songs by Richard Hawley, which premiered at the city’s Crucible theatre last year, will come to the National’s Olivier stage in January 2021.New plays include Kerry Jackson by April de Angelis, set in a Hackney restaurant at the frontline of gentrification, and After Life by Jack Thorne, adapted from the Japanese film with characters between life and death who have to choose a memory they will live in for eternity.There will also be a “radical” new adaptation of Racine’s Phaedra by Simon Stone and starring Kristin Scott Thomas in her NT debut, and a new production of Pearl Cleage’s Blues for an Alabama Sky, starring Giles Terera, best known as Aaron Burr in Hamilton.He also denied reports of a rift between the theatre and its patron Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, saying there was “ongoing, very productive dialogue with the duchess and her team”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/876096927baa714a75ea5d2c27b0ec1a1bf97dd9/705_651_3358_2015/master/3358.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f4209cedcdc31f7972a745c046539bc","title":"samsung galaxy z flip review back to the folding flip phone future","story":"Revamp of 2000’s flip phone means big screen folds in half into a compact clamshell that fits in small pocketsIt’s not often something comes along to genuinely change the game, but the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip does just that, bringing foldable displays closer to the mainstream and reinventing the flip phone for 2020 in the process.Screens that fold in half finally arrived last year with the Galaxy Fold, which was originally plagued by durability issues causing a delay and a reworking of the device.The £1,300 Galaxy Z Flip is therefore Samsung’s crucial second bite at the cherry. And it’s a very impressive one at that.Instead of a tall smartphone opening out into a square tablet, the Galaxy Z Flip is a tall smartphone that folds in half like mid-2000s flip-phones. I won’t beat about the bush: folding and unfolding the Galaxy Z Flip is a tremendous experience.The hinge opens and will hold the screen at any angle, similar to a laptop. It’s smooth and reassuringly solid. What you can’t easily do is flip it open with one finger, but you probably shouldn’t even if you could because the screen is fairly fragile – more on that later.Closed, the phone is a compact wedge shape with little rubber feet and magnets holding the two ends together. You’ll be able to fit it in most pockets, including the often useless-for-phones tiny pockets women are burdened with.There’s a small 1.1in oblong screen on the lid of the device adjacent to the main camera. It shows the time, the battery charge and a little notification dot if there’s something waiting for you. Double tap to light it up, swipe left for music controls and right for notification icons, which you can tap and see a little bit with scrolling text. It’s useful when you want it, but also easy to ignore, freeing you somewhat from the burden of notifications.Open it out and the 6.7in screen is remarkable. It looks and feels just like one of Samsung’s regular super-sized smartphones, which is a very good thing, apart from one caveat: there’s a crease in the middle. You can feel it, and get a reflection on the screen and you can see it.What feels weird at first under your thumb immediately becomes normal. It’s more visible when the screen is black, which makes the Galaxy Z Flip the first phone that looks worse in dark mode. You can’t see it while browsing a white web page or similar.The crease is one of the compromises of having a massive screen that rivals the very biggest smartphones available today, but that folds down into a small, pocketable package. I think it’s a worthy trade-off for now.The power button doubles as a fast and accurate fingerprint scanner, mounted below the volume buttons on the upper half of the phone.The screen works, looks great and the hinge feels sturdy. It’s rated for more than 200,000 folds, which is 100 openings a day for 5.5 years. It has nylon fibres in the hinge to literally sweep dust and dirt away as you open and close it, while the edges of the folding part have plastic T-shaped caps to try to block dirt from getting in that way.But there’s a massive question mark over the screen’s durability. It comes with care instructions wrapped around it in the box, including advice not to press hard on the screen with hard objects, such as your fingernail don’t fold something else in when closing the phone the phone isn’t dust or water resistant don’t put stickers or screen protectors on it and keep the phone away from credit cards as it has magnets in it. You can’t say you haven’t been warned.I was only given three working days to test the device and in that time it worked perfectly. Others haven’t been so lucky. Realistically you need at least several months of daily use to truly know if it will stand the test of time.Then there’s the scratch resistance of the glass screen: basically there isn’t any. It uses ultra-thin glass that can fold, which is remarkable, but it’s covered in a plastic layer and is so thin it’s easy to poke holes in. The screen is fairly well protected when closed, but it’s possible to get grit in between the two halves, while pushing hard with your fingernail could damage it.All in you have to treat it with the respect deserving of a £1,300 device, and even then you might run into trouble. If you’re at all blasé with the way you treat your smartphone, this isn’t for you.The Galaxy Z Flip has Qualcomm’s top-of-the-range chip from late 2019, the Snapdragon 855+, not this year’s top chip, the Snapdragon 865. It also has 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, which isn’t expandable with microSD.Performance all-round was good. Snappy, fast and smooth, similar to the Galaxy Note 10+, but not as rapid as the best, the OnePlus 7T Pro despite having the same chipset. If you’re into hardcore mobile gaming this isn’t the phone for you.Battery life was solid but not quite up to the standards set by the very best last year. The Galaxy Z Flip lasted about 27 hours between charges of medium to heavy usage.That was while using the phone as my primary device, lots of email, messages and push notifications, a couple of hours browsing, five hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, 45 minutes of Netflix and about 10 photos.The Galaxy Z Flip has relatively slow 15W charging, taking close to two hours for a full charge, but has wireless charging and wireless powersharing to wirelessly charge something else from the phone’s back, such as a set of earbuds or a smartwatch.Samsung’s version of Android 10 is called One UI 2, which itself is an evolution of One UI launched on the Galaxy S10 last year.One UI 2 treats the phone’s screen differently to most other versions of Android. Broadly speaking the top half is for displaying information, while the bottom half is used for bits you have to touch and interact with. It’s a clever use of space helping you reach the bits you have to tap (with the exception of the notification bar), which is useful for a screen as long as the Galaxy Z Flip’s.As too are Android 10’s gestures: swipe up from the bottom for recently used apps, or across the bottom to switch the last used apps. Swipe in from either side for back. It’s simple, fast and easy to use on big-screen phones.Samsung has also made great strides in the speed of Android updates over recent years, bringing One UI 2 based on Android 10 as an update to the Galaxy S10 line in around three months from its release by Google.Overall, One UI 2 is a pleasing form of Android to use, with useful additions and, importantly, the full Google suite of apps and services, from which competitor Huawei is barred from using due to US trade sanctions.The Galaxy Z Flip has two 12-megapixel cameras on the back, one normal and one ultra-wide, and one 10-megapixel selfie camera peeking through a small hole in the top of the screen.The rear cameras are good but not class leading. The main camera shoots excellent pictures in good lighting, deals relatively well with high-contrast scenes with the addition of an HDR mode, but starts to struggle in middling light conditions. Images shot in the foyer of a theatre suffered from a bit of grain and noise.Likewise, the camera doesn’t have the best low-light performance, although the automatic Night Mode helps. The ultrawide works great in good light, but the lack of a telephoto camera is disappointing.The selfie camera is reasonable, shooting detailed images in good lighting, but again struggles in middling light, unexpectedly producing some blurry pictures. I got better results closing the phone, double-pressing the power button to bring up the main camera, which shows a small preview in the cover display.Samsung’s camera app has a load of tricks. One of the most interesting is the “single take” mode. Press the shutter button and let it run until you think you have enough. The camera shoots photos, videos and produces gifs all at once, showing you a portfolio of content at the end from which you can pick and choose the best. If you’re not sure what will work best, this mode is for you.You can also prop the phone up by closing it part way and use either the selfie camera or the main camera, which works as a makeshift tripod producing some interesting results.Overall the Galaxy Z Flip is a fun camera to use, but won’t win any awards. It’s good enough, just not the best – but that’s not what you’re paying for here.The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip is a tantalising, desirable look at one possible future of the smartphone.A big phone that folds into a compact square is surprisingly pleasing to use, much easier to pocket and has the side benefit of adding a bit of distance between you and your phone. Unfolding it and unlocking it is much more of a deliberate act than it is to glance at a traditional flat phone, potentially helping you avoid notification overload.It looks great, makes you stand out and feels solid, like the premium, cutting-edge product that it is. It’s exciting, different and delightfully tactile. But only having had three working days with it, I just can’t tell you whether it’ll go the distance. Months of daily use is the only thing that will really test the Galaxy Z Flip’s durability.Buy the £1,300 Galaxy Z Flip if you want something different, but only if you can stomach the uncertainty surrounding its durability. You might get three years of problem-free use out of it, but then you might not. Only time will tell. But looking at the sea of boring metal and glass slabs, many of which are similar in price to the Galaxy Z Flip, I want one, and maybe you do too.Pros: a screen that folds in half, big screen made pocketable, stands on its own, good camera, day+ battery life, exciting and different, One UI 2, good gestures, wireless charging and powersharing, nano sim and esimCons: durability unknowns, no dust or water resistance, high cost, no headphone socket, no telephoto camera, no expandable storage This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Coroner Sarah Bourke adjourned the hearing until 5 August. Flack was due to stand trial next month after pleading not guilty to assaulting her boyfriend, Lewis Burton, with a lamp at her London flat. At a pre-trial hearing in December, the court was told that 27-year-old Burton sustained a “significant injury to his head” and had dialled 999.It is understood that Burton, who has said he is heartbroken by her death, had told police and prosecutors he wanted to withdraw his complaint against Flack.In the post, handed by Flack’s family to the Eastern Daily Press, which covers Norfolk where the presenter grew up, she wrote of her arrest on 12 December: “Within 24 hours my whole world and future was swept from under my feet and all the walls that I had taken so long to build around me, collapsed. I am suddenly on a different kind of stage and everyone is watching it happen.“I have always taken responsibility for what happened that night. Even on the night. But the truth is ... It was an accident.”Flack said she had been having “some sort of emotional breakdown for a very long time”, adding: “But I am NOT a domestic abuser. We had an argument and an accident happened. An accident.”Images published in the Sun showing Flack’s flat covered in blood after the incident were of her own blood, she said, and were sold to the newspaper although she did not name who was responsible for leaking them.“That was something very sad and very personal,” she wrote. The reason I am talking today is because my family can’t take any more. I’ve lost my job. My home. My ability to speak.“And the truth has been taken out of my hands and used as entertainment. I can’t spend every day hidden away being told not to say or speak to anyone.”She added: “For a lot of people, being arrested for common assault is an extreme way to have some sort of spiritual awakening but for me it’s become the normal. I’ve been pressing the snooze button on many stresses in my life – for my whole life.“I’ve accepted shame and toxic opinions on my life for over 10 years and yet told myself it’s all part of my job. No complaining. The problem with brushing things under the carpet is ... they are still there and one day someone is going to lift that carpet up and all you are going to feel is shame and embarrassment.”Flack also apologised for the impact on those close to her, writing: “I’m so sorry to my family for what I have brought upon them and for what my friends have had to go through.“I’m not thinking about ‘how I’m going to get my career back’. I’m thinking about how I’m going to get mine and my family’s life back.”Flack’s mother, Chris, who revealed she was due to see her daughter on the day she was found dead, told the Eastern Daily Press: “Carrie sent me this message at the end of January but was told not to post it by advisers but she so wanted to have her little voice heard.“So many untruths were out there but this is how she felt and my family and I would like people to read her own words. Carrie was surrounded by love and friends but this was just too much for her.In reference to the post, she explained: “It was describing how she was feeling and what she had gone through – no more than that. It was not blaming anyone or pointing any fingers.”She added: “Jody, her twin sister, was there her whole life for her but this time nothing could take away the hurt of such injustice. As Carrie would say: ‘In a nasty world just be kind.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/620cf0c9f90395b0a6732b3b4c983f5efbebcb45/0_176_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6cec6c809e2c9c5fd1dc9895dd0e08b","title":"china bars wall street journal reporters over derogatory column","story":"Three journalists told to leave within five days after paper declined to apologise for opinion pieceChina has revoked the press credentials of three journalists from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) after the newspaper declined to apologise for a column that called China the “real sick man of Asia”, the foreign ministry has said.Spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily briefing on Wednesday that Beijing made several representations to the paper over the column, which China criticised as racist and denigrating its efforts to combat the coronavirus epidemic, but that it had failed to apologise or investigate those responsible.“The Chinese people do not welcome media that publish racist statements and maliciously attacks China,” Geng said.The deputy bureau chief, Josh Chin, and reporter Chao Deng, both Americans, and reporter Philip Wen, an Australian, have been ordered to leave the country within five days. None of the three journalists had any involvement with the column or its headline, according to the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China (FCCC).“The action taken against the Journal correspondents is an extreme and obvious attempt by the Chinese authorities to intimidate foreign news organisations by taking retribution against their China-based correspondents,” the FCCC said in a statement, adding that a foreign correspondent had not been expelled since 1998.The FCCC said, however, that nine journalists had been effectively expelled through non-renewal of journalist visas from China since 2013.“Simultaneously revoking press credentials of three correspondents is an unprecedented form of retaliation against foreign journalists in China,” it said.“FCCC member correspondents and their colleagues in China are suffering from an increasing frequency of harassment, surveillance and intimidation from authorities. The expulsion of these three WSJ reporters is only the latest, and most alarming, measure authorities have taken.”The action comes after the US said on Tuesday it would begin treating five major Chinese state-run media entities with US operations, including Xinhua news agency, China Global Television Network and China Daily Distribution Corp, the same as foreign embassies, requiring them to register employees and US properties with the state department.Geng said China opposed the new rules and Beijing reserved the right to respond.The three WSJ reporters have reported on human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Deng has been reporting from Wuhan on China’s handling of the coronavirus while Wen previously co-authored a report on a cousin of Chinese president, Xi Jinping, whose activities are being scrutinised by Australian authorities.

We hope the flight will be later this week, subject to permissions from the Japanese authorities.“However there is a chance that people who disembark will not be able to join the evacuation flight. We have the utmost concern for the affected Britons and strongly encourage them to register for the evacuation flight.”A British couple who have been putting pressure on the UK government to organise a repatriation flight will not be on the plane after testing positive for the new coronavirus.David and Sally Abel were diagnosed with the virus just one day before the ship’s quarantine was due to end.The couple, who are in their 70s, have been documenting their ordeal through a video diary and in their latest post said they were pleased their efforts to bring about a British flight had paid off, despite the fact they will not be on it.They said they are being taken to a nearby hostel as there are no available hospital beds nearby.David said: “We are going to a hostel because there isn’t a hospital bed anywhere around. In four or five days we will be removed from the hostel and put into hospital where we will receive treatment.“So I can’t see there’s going to be any way we’re on that flight to the UK.”Another British passenger, Elaine Spencer, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that those wanting to board the evacuation flight later in the week have to sign an agreement that they will go into quarantine for 14 days once back in the UK.“We know we won’t be going today, I reckon it’s going to be the end of the week, if not longer. I’m disappointed, it’s like everyone going to a party and leaving you out,” she said.She also said the FCO sent a note stating it was unlikely they would be allowed out of Japan if they did not board the specific evacuation flight. There is no set date for the flight yet.The US has already evacuated 340 of its citizens from the ship and taken them back to America for further quarantine. Other countries, including Canada and Australia, have plans to fly back their citizens in the coming days.Questions continue to be raised about the effectiveness the cruise ship quarantine after the virus spread rapidly among those onboard.Prof Kentaro Iwata, a specialist in infectious diseases at Kobe University hospital, said the infection control onboard was “chaotic”.“I never had a fear of getting an infection myself with Ebola or Sars because I know how to protect myself and how to protect others, and how the infection control should be,” he said in a video post.“But inside the Princess Diamond I was so scared of getting Covid-19 because there was no way of telling where the virus was.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9c3b2fcf78d087e550b27931f688888b116e99a/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5924d5078c5e49b4a278359031d78409","title":"madrid church ceiling restored to glory after centuries under plaster","story":"Ornate ceiling of Santa María la Blanca church is among finest and oldest in SpainIn a quiet corner of north-east Madrid, past the tattoo parlour, round the corner from the post office and near the Latin American grocery, a masterpiece of medieval craftsmanship is glowing in February sunlight for the first time in centuries.Above the chancel of Santa María la Blanca, a small, bustling parish church in Canillejas, sits an ornate wooden ceiling of stars and leaves that is among the finest, and oldest, in Spain.The coffered ceiling, carved in the mid-16th century in the Mudéjar style, was hidden under a plaster vault for hundreds of years, but has has been returned to its original, magnificent state following a nine-month restoration project.Ignacio de la Vega, the architect who led the project, recalled his excitement as the team sank exploratory holes into the plaster over the altar.“What we saw was a wonderfully carved wooden ceiling with eight-pointed stars and overlapping scales on the rafters,” he told the .“It was also in a really good condition. You see this kind of thing in Andalucía and in Castilla-La Mancha and Castilla y León, but not really in Madrid.”He said the ceiling would probably have been plastered over as protection against the plague.“It would have been covered up during one of the European pandemics. A lot of sick people were brought into churches and people thought that the disease wouldn’t spread if you covered everything and whitewashed everything. That happened in a lot of churches and what was underneath was forgotten for centuries.”His team also uncovered and restored a long-lost window that lets in the sun, and a decorative layer of shields and other motifs that runs beneath the ceiling.They, however, are not the only treasures of the church, the oldest section of which dates back to the late 15th century. Another carved wooden ceiling, albeit rather simpler, remains buried in plaster over the nave.“This church is just a jewel,” said the architect. “This is the only complete, surviving example of a latticework wooden ceiling over both the altar and the nave in Madrid.”The artistry, he added, is testament to Canillejas’ geographical importance. These days, the neighbourhood is best known as the barrio of El Yiyo, the matador fatally gored in 1985, and as a meeting place for thirsty football fans on their way to Atletico Madrid’s Wanda politano stadium.But it was also once a village halfway along the road from the city of Alcalá de Henares to Madrid, making it a place where important people would break the journey – among them St Teresa of Ávila.Marta Rivera de la Cruz, Madrid’s regional culture minister, visited the church on Wednesday, declared it “a 16th century jewel”, and said she hoped the restoration would bring in visitors from other parts of the area and beyond.According to José Crespo, the current parish priest, word has already got out. For the past few months, visitors from across Spain and overseas have been descending on the church, keen to see it famous ceiling. After decades of anonymity, Canillejas is creeping back on to the map.Father José welcomes the visitors – as do his proud parishioners. Few, however, can compare with the nun and mystic who is thought to have stopped into the church on more than one occasion.“St Teresa was here,” said the priest. “What really moves me is that she was here and she would have seen this same ceiling we’re seeing today.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4178345.1582100477!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"passengers leave ship amid chaotic coronavirus controls","story":"Hundreds of passengers have disembarked the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama, Japan after completing a two-week quarantine period and testing negative for the virus.

Photograph: Charly TriballeauAFP via Getty ImagesHundreds of quarantined passengers aboard a cruise ship docked in Yokohama walked on dry land on Wednesday for the first time in two weeks, amid growing controversy about Japan’s efforts to contain the coronavirus.Two Irish citizens who were on board the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship have tested positive for the coronavirus.The couple are being cared for at a military hospital in Tokyo having been transferred from the ship to the hospital on February 16th.They were among six Irish citizens on board the ship.About 500 passengers are expected to leave the Diamond Princess by the end of Wednesday after an ordeal in which over 540 of the 3,711 people on board were infected the potentially fatal disease – the largest cluster outside China.Japan’s government says those released today have fulfilled local quarantine requirements after testing negative for the virus. The passengers walked through a scrum of reporters in Yokohama before boarding taxis and busses and retuning to their lives.The liner was isolated earlier this month after a former passenger tested positive for Covid-19 in Hong Kong. Critics have described it as a floating incubator. Debate about the quarantine strategy has intensified since the release on Wednesday of a video by an infectious disease specialist who got on board.Kentaro Iwata of Kobe University described the quarantine protocol on the liner as “completely chaotic,” with not a single virus specialist on board. Mr Iwata said he had 20 years of experience dealing with Ebola, Sars and other diseases but never feared infection until now.“Inside the Diamond Princess I was so scared of getting Covid-19 because there was no way to tell where the virus is – no green zone, no red zone. There was no single professional control person inside the ship,” he said.‘Dual citizenship’The Department of Health has stressed there have been no confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Ireland.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney confirmed on Tuesday that two Irish citizens who were passengers on Diamond Princess had tested positive for the virus and are receiving treatment in hospital in Japan.“These citizens share dual citizenship with another EU member state and are not normally resident in Ireland,” Mr Coveney said in a statement on Tuesday.To date, with the assistance of the UK and other EU partners, six Irish citizens have been repatriated from Wuhan City in China, where the virus originated. Three were evacuated on January 31st, and three were evacuated on February 9th.Irish citizens who had been on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which is currently docked off Yokahama, included a married couple from Co Meath and a couple with dual Irish-German nationality.“We are also in close contact with those who remain in quarantine on the ship. We are working with our EU partners and other like-minded countries regarding options for their return,” Mr Coveney said.In Dublin, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) met on Tuesday to discuss plans for how health authorities would respond to any confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Ireland.Suspected casesThere have been 78 suspected cases of Covid-19 tested in Ireland to date, but no positive cases, health officials confirmed on Tuesday.In a statement after the NPHET meeting, Dr Tony Holohan, Department of Health chief medical officer, said officials “are continuing to monitor the situation globally”.“While the overwhelming majority of cases to date have been reported in China, we continue to advance preparedness plans here in Ireland,” he said.“Hospitals have designated leads for Covid-19 preparedness, and isolation response requirements have been identified and are in place in order to deal appropriately with any suspected cases,” Dr Holohan said.Two Irish citizens who were passengers on the Westerdam, a cruise ship which has had one confirmed case of Covid-19, which had docked off Cambodia, have returned to Ireland and entered self-imposed isolation for potential coronavirus.Passengers were allowed to disembark from the ship, but an American citizen later tested positive for the virus, sparking concerns about potential exposure to the virus spreading in other countries from passengers returning home.The death toll from the virus in mainland China rose by just under 100 on Tuesday to 1,868 people. There have been nine confirmed cases of the virus in the UK from nearly 5,000 people tested."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4177834.1582096911!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"a russian cruiser with cannibal rats what other ghost ships could be out there","story":"A ghost ship was washed up onto the rocks off east Cork by Storm Dennis on Sunday, after drifting across the Atlantic over the last year. Video: Irish Coast Guard\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Russian liner Lyubov Orlova: ‘Somewhere in the vast expanses of the North Atlantic an empty Russian cruise ship has been lost and if it’s still afloat, its next port of call may be the coast of Ireland.’The running aground of “ghost ship” MV Alta, on rocks near Ballycotton in east Cork on Sunday, was not the first time such a derelict vessel has haunted our shores.In 2014 there were reports that the abandoned former Soviet cruise liner Lyubov Orlova was off the Irish coast bringing with it ominous headlines warning of “cannibal rats” aboard a “ghost ship” heading our way.The Irish Coast Guard on Tuesday said it suspects the liner has probably sunk but is “still vigilant” in relation to it. The 4,200-tonne ship was once the glittering choice of Soviet holidaymakers and later wealthy Russians touring the Artic and Antarctic.It is one of a number of ‘ghost ships’, unmanned but still afloat at last sighting, the whereabouts of which are now unknown.The 100m long Lyubov Orlova was seen adrift off the coast of Newfoundland in February 2013. The ship had been sold for scrap and taken under tow from St John’s, heading for the Dominican Republic. But less than a day into the journey the tow line broke and the ship drifted into international waters.As National Geographic put it in March 2014, “somewhere in the vast expanses of the North Atlantic an empty Russian cruise ship has been lost and if it’s still afloat, its next port of call may be the coast of Ireland”.Finding such a ship in the ocean is\u0026nbspnot easy. The International Maritime Organisation’s International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea requires international ships, with 300 or more gross tonnage and all passenger ships, to carry beacons which function as automatic identification systems (AIS).Historical AIS data is also used for analysing the vessels movements on a global scale. In the case of the Lyubov Orlova, it would probably have its transponders off because power ran out. In addition, satellite recorders are not able to easily find a ship in the vast Atlantic unless they know a precise area in which to look.In its efforts to find the cruise ship the Irish Coast Guard combined AIS tracking with radar allowing it to “see” the ghosts . First, radar satellites scanned vast areas of the sea surface, where vessels showed up as blips as on a radar screen. These were then cross-referenced with AIS satellite maps, which showed the positions of all the active ships. In theory, the ghost ship would be the only radar blip not broadcasting a signal. During efforts to find the Russian cruiser an illegal fishing vessel near Scotland which had its transponder turned off\u0026nbspwas discovered.But all attempts to locate the MV Lyubov Orlova by the Irish Coast Guard proved unsuccessful.In 2016 another unmanned vessel washed up on Irish shores. In November of that year a makeshift solar-powered houseboat landed on a beach in Co Mayo after drifting across the Atlantic from Canada. Authorities said the owner of the 20ft timber and polystyrene boat was intending to sail on the “floating caravan”, but was talked out of it before it broke loose from its mooring in Newfoundland. It turned out to have been built by Rick Small, a Canadian environmentalist who had given the boat away and had no idea how it ended up crossing the ocean unmanned.In December 2000 a Spanish boat, Zorro Zaurre, drifted 140 miles to the southwest Irish coast before foundering on rocks yards from where its sister ship, Nuestra Senora de Gardotza, sank 10 years earlier at Roancarrig lighthouse in Bantry Bay, Co Cork.

File photograph: The  In attempts to explain the causes of the unprecedented result of the general election, some commentators have suggested the outcome was built on the foundations of the referendums on same-sex marriage and the eighth amendment.It has been argued by some that young voters – feeling energised by the social change delivered through those campaigns – have become increasingly politicised and more eager to drive further change through the ballot box.This is an appealing narrative to explain what happened in our most recent election. However, it is fundamentally flawed. Young people are no more politically engaged now than they were previously.The increased turnout for the eighth amendment referendum was a temporary phenomenon. Turnout levels are now back to where they were at the time of the 2016 general election.Using data gathered through the exit polls conducted for the 2016 and 2020 general elections, as well as for the referendum that led to the repeal of the eighth in 2018, it is possible to understand the profile of voters who turned out on each occasion.Analysis of the data shows that 18- to 24-year-olds were more likely to vote in the referendum to repeal the eighth. Voter turnout among women aged 18 to 24 increased by 94 per cent for that referendum compared to the 2016 election.However, the exit poll for this month’s election suggests this may have been a temporary phenomenon and that the age profile of voters reverted back to where it was in 2016.The Oxford Dictionary’sword of the year in 2017 – youthquake – has been widely used over the past 10 days. This is defined as “a significant cultural, political, or social change arising from the actions or influence of young people”. It has been associated with a number of elections in various countries in recent years suggesting that young voters have mobilised in unprecedented numbers to support opposition parties.However, successful political campaigns are built upon appealing to those most likely to turn out and vote. Not only are there are more people in Ireland aged 50 and older than there are aged between 18 and 34, but also older voters are more likely to turn out on election day. For every vote cast by those aged under 35, there are roughly two votes cast by those aged 50 and older.It is only when this older group is convinced by a particular argument that electoral success will follow. This was the case in the eighth amendment referendum, when those aged over 50 voted as a whole in favour of repeal.It was also the case in the recent general election, with over 50s voting for change.Revealing exit poll dataBetween 2016 and this year, Sinn Féin saw an increase in vote share across all age groups, driving the number of first preference votes it received up by more than 240,000 – from 295,319 to 535,573.The exit poll finds that Sinn Féin’s highest vote share was among those aged under 35, with 32 per cent casting their first preference vote for the party (up from 21 per cent in 2016).As this age group represents roughly a third of all voters, extrapolating the exit poll data suggests that those aged under 35 accounted for less than 65,000 of the additional votes Sinn Féin received on February 8th.In contrast, while the party received a lower share of votes (18 per cent) among those aged 50 or older, this is a much larger group of voters and accounted for half of the additional 240,000 votes.It is only through motivating a sizeable proportion of voters aged 50 and older to vote for the party that Sinn Féin achieved the unprecedented success seen in this election.In seeking explanations for the recent political shift it is necessary to take a wider focus than looking solely at young voters and the issues that influenced their vote. The result of this election was less of a “youthquake”, but more the manifestation of a desire for change across the electorate as a whole.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

Another group of Independents, organised by Marian Harkin and Michael Fitzmaurice, is meeting to form a technical group to get greater Dáil speaking time. It is not yet known if this group will then engage in government talks. These two groups are in addition to Independents 4Change Deputies. Another Independent, Roscommon’s Denis Naughten, is understood to be considering standing for ceann comhairle of the Dáil. It is expected that no one will be elected taoiseach by the Dáil on Thursday, with Leo Varadkar, Mary Lou McDonald, Micheál Martin and Eamon Ryan putting their names forward.One member of the Fianna Fáil frontbench suggested that Fine Gael could help a Fianna Fáil-led minority government pass budgets, but retain the right to vote as it pleased on Dáil motions of confidence. Galway East TD Anne Rabbitte said: “It is important that Fianna Fáil would secure the support of the Greens, Labour and the Soc Dems, and then come to the conversation with Fine Gael seeking support on budgetary matters. “Not on confidence matters – budgetary matters. Any Ministers doing their jobs, there’ll be confidence in them.”The Fianna Fáil parliamentary party is scheduled to meet in Leinster House on Wednesday evening although no agenda for the meeting has been circulated in advance. TDs speculated that party leader Micheál Martin may appoint his negotiating team for government formation talks at the meeting, Green Party talks On Tuesday, Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said coalition formation talks should take weeks not months, as his deputy leader Catherine Martin called on other parties to “woman up” and get on with the process.Mr Ryan, a TD for Dublin Bay South, said it would take time to negotiate a programme for government to get the level of detail needed. But he said: “It’s several weeks, it’s not days but it shouldn’t be months because there is a job to do and we should get on with it.”The Green Party is in contact with Sinn Féin about setting up a first meeting to discuss their policy priorities but Mr Ryan acknowledged that it would be difficult to get a stable left-wing government in place. The meeting is expected to happen later in the week. “The reality is when you look at the numbers it’s hard to see how you get a stable government,” Mr Ryan said.Sinn Féin expects to further meetings on potential government formation over the coming days with the Green Party, Labour, People Before Profit, Independents4Change and others. The Sinn Féin negotiating team – TDs Pearse Doherty, Louise O’Reilly, Eoin Ó Broin and Matt Carthy - met with Martin Fraser, the secretary general of the Government in Government Buildings.It is normal for senior civil servants to make themselves available and information available to parties attempting to form a government. “We want to discuss how those proposals can be transformed into a programme for government for change,” Mr Doherty said on his way into the meeting. “This is about making sure that we have the information available to us, to advance those discussions as we now get into the policy detail of compatibility or areas where there may be no compatibility as we begin those discussions. So this is very much Sinn Féin intensifying the talks over the last number of days.”He said the meetings would assess what change is “deliverable and deliverable in the timeframe that we want it delivered”.

Leo Varadkar is expected to fill the vacancy left by Frank Feighan, who was elected as a TD for Sligo-Leitrim in this month’s general election.Some 43 Senators are elected to five vocational panels by the 160 incoming TDs, the outgoing 60 Senators and city and county councillors, a total electorate of about 1,200 people.Having a new Senator in place to vote for the party’s candidates could make a difference to the chances of Fine Gael candidates when the Seanad election takes place next month.Mr Feighan was one of then taoiseach Enda Kenny’s 11 nominees in 2016, and was appointed without having to contest an election. Only these Senators can be replaced without an election being required.Party loyalists have been chosen for such appointments in the past, and the brief stint in the House comes with perks such as access for life to Leinster House, its car park and the Oireachtas members’ bar.Appointees to Seanad vacancies in the run-up to general elections in the past have included former Fianna Fáil general secretary Martin Macken former taoiseach Charlie Haughey’s close associate and government press secretary PJ Mara and Amnesty International’s Colm O’Gorman, who represented the Progressive Democrats.The appointment of a Senator in this way could also assist a candidate seeking election to the Seanad as it would raise their profile and status within the party and possibly make them more likely to pick up votes from Oireachtas colleagues and councillors.There is considerable interest within the party about the appointment, although there has been no information from the Taoiseach’s office about a likely contender. One Fine Gael source suggested that Mr Varadkar and his officials may not have even thought about a specific apointee yet because of the ongoing flux over government formation. However, another Fine Gael source suggested there could be “carnage” as prospective candidates seek nominations. Vocational panelsCandidates can run for election to one of five vocational panels by either getting an “outside” nomination from one of 110 civic society nominating organisations, or an “inside” nomination by getting the support of four Oireachtas members.Based on the number of current Fine Gael TDs and Senators, the party can only nominate 11 inside candidates.Fine Gael candidates are expected to include Pat Deering, who lost his Dáil seat in Carlow-Kilkenny, and Government Chief Whip Sean Kyne, who lost his Galway West seat. Other names being mentioned include former Dublin Bay South TD Kate O’Connell. A number of Senators are retiring, including long-standing Fine Gael representative Paul Coghlan, who is standing down after 23 years in the Upper House. The Killarney-based businessman, one of the founding directors of Radio Kerry and current director and a trustee of Muckross House, is returning to the commercial world.The Seanad postal election takes place between March 16th and 30th with nominations from civic society groups closing on February 24th.

Last November, Ms Cronin replied to an anonymous Twitter account which suggested “loads of judges are paedophiles” by saying: “Wouldn’t surprise me.”She has also criticised the fluoridation of drinking water in Ireland as “poisoning our water”.Earlier this week, the Sunday Times highlighted how Ms Cronin accused the Israeli secret service, Mossad, of “sinister” interference in the UK general election to ensure the defeat of Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, which she subsequently described as “throwaway remarks”.Ms Cronin, who was a Sinn Féin councillor between 2014 and 2019 before losing her seat on Kildare County Council in last year’s local elections, said she took the decision to block access to her account because of abuse directed at her following further publicity about her past tweets.“I received a lot of abusive comments from Israel, the US and UK and some death threats,” Ms Cronin said.In a statement, the TD said she “unreservedly and wholeheartedly” apologised to people she had offended because of “these glib, off-the-cuff tweets that I sent in the past”.“I never intended to cause hurt or distress to anyone. I will assist and work with everybody, without qualification,” Ms Cronin said.She added: “I abhor racism and bigotry of any shade. My character and my politics are Republican and egalitarian.”The TD pointed out that most of the controversial tweets dated from before she joined Sinn Féin in 2013 and entered politics, while some recent ones between losing her council seat and being elected a TD were made as “a private citizen”.On Tuesday night, Sinn Féin sought to distance itself from Ms Cronin’s comments claiming the tweets did not represent the views of the party.A Sinn Féin spokesman said the party understood that Ms Cronin had apologised unreservedly for her remarks. “That is the right thing to do,” he added.On Tuesday night, a spokeswoman for the Israeli embassy in Dublin described the language and ideas expressed by Ms Cronin as “shocking especially when coming from an elected TD”.“They can only remind us of humanity’s darkest hours. It is not only Sinn Féin or the people of Ireland that should be deeply concerned but also any decent human being,” the spokeswoman said.In other tweets seen by the , Ms Cronin described Mr Varadkar in 2017 as “nothing more than a troll”, a “nonchalant shell” and “right-wing Tory boy”.In January 2019 she claimed anyone who did not want a united Ireland was “traitorous”.In her Facebook account which remains active, Ms Cronin was also critical during the recent General Election campaign about media coverage and claimed Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael were plotting with their “media luvvies” to rig the election.In particular, she accused RTÉ of trying to rig the election for Fianna Fáil by the station’s original decision not to include the Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald in the TV debate between Mr Varadkar and Mr Martin. Ms McDonald took part in the debate when it aired. In 2018, Ms Cronin said Michael D Higgins as president had been “a huge disappointment.” Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

Photograph Nick Bradshaw A sense of dissatisfaction about the state of public services and the cost of living drove voters of all age groups to “vote for change” in the general election, political campaigners have said.Voters over the age of 50 led that change and accounted for a large portion of the extra first preference votes received by parties like Sinn Féin, challenging the idea that there was a “youthquake” in this month’s general election.Sinn Féin TD Eoin Ó Broin said that the party increased its vote share in all demographics and age groups but that he particularly noted an increase in support among over 50s.“Our vote increased everywhere but the exit poll data tallies with the experiences that I had on the canvass trail,” he said. “If we take, for example, Palmerstown in Dublin. In 2016, I would have received 14 per cent of the vote there as a general election candidate and the support would have been among younger families.“This time around we had people in their 50s who had adult children living back home with them or were aware that their grandchildren were back living with their mam and dad. There was a growing awareness among over 50s of how the housing crisis was affecting their extended families.”Mr Ó Broin said over 50s were “disproportionately affected by the crises in the health system” and he believes this was a factor in them changing their vote.Labour’s director of elections for the campaign Ivana Bacik said the vote for change was driven “by all groups”.“Among all age groups there was a dissatisfaction that emerged during the campaign that I don’t think any party foresaw, not Fine Gael and not even Sinn Féin. It was evident in terms of the issues raised by different demographics,” she said.‘Harrowing stories’“I canvassed with wide range of our candidates across different environments and we were hearing from all sides about that discontentment with public services. Healthcare emerged as key issues for all ages, and there were harrowing stories even among younger people.”Ms Bacik said other issues that drove a desire for change among those in the older age groups were housing, childcare and a mooted increase in the qualifying age for the State pension. “These two issues came up on every canvass,” she said.Ms Bacik also said that before the election, many commentators predicted climate action would engage and influence younger voters but that “this did not materialise to the extent that we had all anticipated.”“It was raised on doors many times by all ages but it didn’t seem to be driving change,” she said.There was also a narrative that voters who were politicised by the referendums on same-sex marriage and repealing the ban on abortion would play a big role in shaping the outcome of the election.Ms Bacik said that there was “no doubt” that younger voters were politicised during those campaigns and she believes it did have a “direct and indirect impact” on the election result.“I was one of the organisers for Together for Yes and the number of people we were getting out to canvass who had never canvassed before was phenomenal,” she said.Ms Bacik added that there were campaigns to identify anti-abortion candidates and noted the case of Green Party candidate in Dublin Bay North David Healy, who lost out on a seat after being widely tipped for election.During the campaign he was questioned on how he voted in the referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment and stated that he voted no.Mr Healy said the issue did come up on the doorsteps.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

What is important is that if it comes to our attention that there are comments that are inappropriate that they are withdrawn and they are apologised for”.The tweets included numerous remarks that were critical of Israel.

And I think that’s the right thing to do.”He said it was “unacceptable” for anyone to espouse the views outlined.“There are guidelines in relation to how people conduct themselves on social media. I think we can see right across society that people can use social media in a very harmful and negative way and it is really important that does not happen. So the party has guidelines and not just for our elected representatives but also for our members.”Taoiseach Leo Varadkar described Ms Cronin’s comments as both anti-Semitic and anti-science. “This is not the kind of change we need,” he tweeted on Wednesday.Former minister for justice Alan Shatter said Sinn Féin should expel Ms Cronin from the party. Her comments were not “once off” and that “there is a pattern” to her social media statements, he said.“If Sinn Féin have any decency, any sense of commitment to change, they should expel her for it,” Mr Shatter said on Wednesday.Mr Shatter, who is Jewish, called on the Garda to investigate the tweets and whether they constituted an incitement to hatred. “It is important that laws on incitement to hatred are implemented and others do not believe they have impunity to act in this way.”Ahead of the first sitting of the new Dáil on Thursday, Mr Doherty described discussions his party had on Wednesday with the secretary general of the Department of Taoiseach as “productive.”Sinn Féin met with the Green Party on Wednesday morning and will also hold meetings today with rural independents, the Labour Party, Solidarity People Before Profit and other independents.

Photograph: Nick BradshawSenior Sinn Féin figures in Northern Ireland such as Michelle O’Neill, Gerry Kelly and Martina Anderson have been checking under their vehicles for car bombs in recent weeks.The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) warned Sinn Féin of the threat from dissident republicans and, according to the Deputy First Minister, Ms O’Neill, she and other party members were told an attack “could happen anywhere”.“This is literally a threat against thousands of Sinn Féin members and their families in the North,” she said.In the distrustful nature of this island some have wondered was this a republican ploy to deflect attention from the discomfiture the party has been experiencing in relation to the murder of Paul Quinn in 2007, a murder his family has laid at the door of the IRA?But, no, the PSNI is adamant that the threat is serious and genuine, and that the information it has about the dissidents’ plans, particularly those of the New IRA, are well sourced.“This is a very real and valid security assessment,” a senior police source said.Time was when the notion of relatively tiny republican organisations challenging the lives of senior Sinn Féin personnel would seem fanciful – and indeed dangerous, to those who would pose such threats.But the more Sinn Féin became locked into politics and the peace process the more emboldened the dissidents became.The late former deputy first minister Martin McGuinness faced a number of threats because of his description of the Continuity IRA as “traitors to the island of Ireland” after the 2009 murder of PSNI Constable Stephen Carroll, and for other comments he made disparaging what he tended to call “micro” organisations.Even close to his home in Derry City dissidents erected a mural with the legend: “Those who administer British rule are traitors. They haven’t gone away, you know.”In 2018, dissidents threw a crude explosive device into the front parking area of the home of former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams in west Belfast.There have been several other incidents of threats against Sinn Féin members over the years, mostly relating to the party’s continuing involvement in the Stormont political process.This time the ire of the dissidents was stirred by the decision of Ms O’Neill and Mr Kelly to attend the launch of a campaign to recruit 600 new members into the PSNI.How and why Ms O’Neill and Mr Kelly, Sinn Féin’s policing spokesman, ended up at the launch at the PSNI training centre at Garnerville in east Belfast is interesting in itself.The launch was on Tuesday February 4th, four days before the General Election in the Republic. Ms O’Neill and Sinn Féin’s three Policing Board members, Gerry Kelly, Linda Dillon and Philip McGuigan had received prior invitation to attend the launch, but had not responded.On the morning we reporters were gathered at Garnerville waiting to see what would happen, knowing there would be a story either way: that ahead of the election and already under the cosh over the Paul Quinn murder Sinn Féin would snub the launch and thus trigger another almighty election row in the Republic or it would finally make history by for the first time attending the launch?The event started at 10am and there was no sign of Sinn Féin. The DUP, the Ulster Unionists and the SDLP at that stage had representatives in the room. PSNI chief constable Simon Byrne and chairwoman of the Policing Board Anne Connolly were figuring what lines they would use to respond. Would it be “disappointment” or something stronger?Then well into the event we heard that Ms O’Neill and Mr Kelly would make their way from Stormont to the launch. Ms O’Neill and First Minister Arlene Foster had the excuse that they were delayed by a Brexit meeting at Stormont, although that could hardly apply to the three Sinn Féin board members. Ms O’Neill and Mr Kelly arrived after 11 am when the launch was completed. But nonetheless they posed with Ms Foster and the chief constable and other Policing Board members holding posters urging people top join the PSNI and “make it a career”.Having bitten the bullet, so to speak, O’Neill didn’t hold back when speaking to the press in front of a big PSNI recruitment banner. Asked was it a “last minute” decision to attend she said “I want to be here”, while commenting about the need for a representative police force, and calling for a return of 50:50 CatholicProtestant recruitment.While Sinn Féin signed up to policing in 2006, its support for the PSNI has at time been lukewarm and overly cautious. So this was a big shift.It seems reasonable to argue that this would not have happened but for the General Election. Sinn Féin would have been hammered had it been seen as half-hearted or worse in supporting policing in Northern Ireland.The chief constable Simon Byrne was delighted, describing Sinn Féin’s attendance as “seismic and historic”.Not so the dissident elements. Even by the New IRA’s standards some woeful anti-recruitment posters were erected in Derry featuring pictures of Peadar Heffron, the Irish speaking, GAA-playing, Catholic officer who was deliberately targeted and terribly injured by a dissident bomb in 2010.In west Belfast the offices of the Andersonstown News were picketed by a handful of protesters complaining about the paper’s decision to run the PSNI recruitment adverts. They carried a banner describing the paper as “British State Media”.And then there were the threats against the likes of Ms O’Neill and Mr Kelly, and Sinn Féin politicians generally.But while annoyed with the dissidents, Sinn Féin on the ground hasn’t retreated from its decision to attend the recruitment launch.A senior Sinn Féin source said that “by and large” the party has not been getting grief at local level. “I have not had a single relative or friend bring it up with me when I’m out and about, and they are usually the indicator. Because if something is exercising people they are the first one to tell you. None of us has been getting any hassle,” he said.Another well-placed source said that the “feedback Sinn Féin has got has been quite positive within the leadership and from the grassroots”.He said that if the stultifying issue of the PSNI having also to deal with legacy issues “could be taken from the cops there could be a quantum leap in terms of support”.Still, persuading more Catholics to join the PSNI continues to be difficult, particularly when doing so means that, mostly, young Catholics have to abandon their local community, their GAA club, and some of their social circle of friends and change their lifestyle. That is the bald reality.“If we can solve that problem, that people are accepted in their local community and other people are defending them, then we will get over the line, but we are a while away from that yet,” said a senior PSNI source.But the PSNI and others who want Sinn Féin to commit more decidedly to policing are happy with this Sinn Féin response, and how they haven’t resiled from endorsing the recruitment campaign. They see it as a significant step up.They know too that the General Election in the Republic and the new demands on Sinn Féin have assisted that process.“I don’t think this is cynical by Sinn Féin, I think it is timely,” said the PSNI source. “The reality is they can’t go into government in the South without dealing with full endorsement of the PSNI in the North. They just can’t do it. The Special Criminal Court stuff, the Guards, all that will play into the discourse and the media will strip them apart. I actually think this is an issue that they have to grasp.

Photograph: iStockGreece distanced itself on Wednesday from suggestions that it planned to drag a centuries-old dispute over the return of the Parthenon marbles into Brexit negotiations.Government spokesman Stelios Petsas said Athens would keep up its campaign for the return of the 2,500-year-old treasures and would consider which tools could support its cause.“Greece’s request for the return of the Parthenon marbles remains strong and it is not linked to a Brexit deal,” Mr Petsas said, asked if the issue could be a stumbling point in talks with Britain on its future relationship with the European Union. “We’ll continue to call for their return and if this is a tool we can use, we’ll consider it in due course,” he said.Since independence in 1832, Greece has repeatedly called for the return of the sculptures – known in Britain as the Elgin Marbles – that British diplomat Lord Elgin removed from the Parthenon temple in Athens in the early 19th century, when Greece was under Ottoman rule.The British Museum in London has refused to return the sculptures – roughly half of a 160m frieze that adorned the fifth century BC monument – saying they were acquired by Elgin under a legal contract with the Ottoman Empire. It says they “are part of everyone’s shared heritage”.A draft of the 27 EU nations’ position on negotiations with Britain on their future relationship, seen by Reuters on Tuesday, seeks the “return or restitution of unlawfully removed cultural objects to their countries of origin”.The document did not specify any cultural objects, but an EU diplomat said it was added at the request of Greece, with support from Italy. Last month, Greece’s culture minister Lina Mendoni called Elgin a “serial thief” who employed illegal tactics to take the marbles. She said she believed the circumstances were ripe for the marbles’ return. The British government said returning the sculptures would not be discussed during the upcoming trade negotiations with the EU.The Acropolis Museum in Athens, which has the remaining sculptures that were left in Greece, has left space empty for their return as part of its current display. But a British government spokeswoman ruled out the prospect of discussing re-homing the sculptures during next month’s trade talks. “The EU are still finalising their mandate – this is currently in draft,” she said. “The UK’s position on the Parthenon sculptures remains unchanged – they are legal responsibility of the British Museum. That is not up for discussion as part of our trade negotiations.” RetersPADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Peter FoleyBloombergThe jury in former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein’s rape trial resumed deliberations on Wednesday in a case that has become a milestone for the #MeToo movement. The Manhattan jury of seven men and five women began their discussions after the judge hearing the case warned Weinstein’s lead defence lawyer, Donna Rotunno, against talking to the press until jurors have reached a verdict.The warning came two days after the attorney wrote an opinion piece about the case in Newsweek magazine.“I would caution you about the tentacles of your public relations juggernaut,” Justice James Burke told Ms Rotunno.Ms Rotunno told the judge that the opinion piece, published on Saturday and titled “Jurors in my client Harvey Weinstein’s case must look past the headlines” was not intended to address the jury directly.“This is an oped about the jury system as a whole, about the criminal justice system as a whole,” she said.Prosecutor Joan Illuzzi asked the judge to revoke Mr Weinstein’s bail and jail him, saying he must have approved the Newsweek opinion piece, which she said “borders on tampering with the jury”. The judge did not act on the request.Mr Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006 and raping Jessica Mann, a onetime aspiring actor, in 2013. He faces life in prison if convicted on the most serious charge, predatory sexual assault.A unanimous verdict is needed for a conviction.ExhibitsSince 2017, more than 80 women have accused Mr Weinstein of sexual misconduct. The former Hollywood mogul, who was behind films including The English Patient and Shakespeare in Love, has denied the allegations and said any sexual encounters were consensual.The allegations fuelled the #MeToo movement, in which women have accused powerful men in business, entertainment, media and politics of sexual misconduct.After deliberating for less than an hour, the jury sent a note asking for clarification of their legal instructions, which the judge provided.Later in the afternoon, they requested exhibits, including a blueprint of the apartment where Mr Weinstein allegedly assaulted Ms Haleyi and a 2017 email he sent to a private investigator with a list of women highlighted as “red flags”.The list included Annabella Sciorra, who testified that Mr Weinstein entered her apartment one winter night in 1993 or 1994 and raped her. The accusation is too old to be charged as a separate crime, but it could act as an aggravating factor to support a charge of predatory sexual assault.Prosecutors have said the email is evidence that Mr Weinstein tried to prevent Ms Sciorra and other accusers from going public with their accusations.Last week, jurors heard closing arguments from lawyers on both sides. Ms Rotunno argued that the encounters had been consensual, pointing to friendly communications from the women to Mr Weinstein after they were allegedly assaulted. She assailed the credibility of the accusers and urged the jury to put aside their emotions and use common sense in evaluating the evidence.Assistant district attorney Joan Illuzzi urged jurors to convict Mr Weinstein, saying the once-powerful producer used his position in the film industry to prey on women and that those who testified against him had no reason to lie. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4178557.1582127275!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how a democrat might widen the us china feud","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS President Donald Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping following their November 2017 meeting in Beijing. Photograph: Artyom IvanovIf only the United States was more bitterly ided along partisan lines. Oh, for some rancour in Washington.Before you check on this columnist’s health, compare the words of Republicans and Democrats at the Munich Security Conference last week. From defence secretary Mark Esper there was certainty about China’s threat to the West and Europe’s naivety in the face of it. From Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives: certainty about China’s threat to the West, and Europe’s naivety in the face of it.The US has entered an open-ended feud against the world’s largest nation with less debate than it musters for the pettiest domestic affairs. Its two great parties erge on the weapons of choice. They maul each other over the wisdom of tariffs and subsidies. On the basic rightness of the conflict, though, the lack of dissent will strike generations to come as eccentric (and, if things get out of hand, remiss).By now, Europeans and other third parties to the superpower tussle know that the US will not soften its line under a new president. What they tend to underrate is the chance that it will actually harden. For all his militant jingoism, President Donald Trump views China in practical terms. The more power, security and wealth that it accrues, the less he believes there is for the US. It is an impoverished idea of foreign relations but it is at least transactional.Stabilising influenceAs proof, the Chinese can and often do buy off some of his animus with material concessions. Trump’s quarrel is not a principled one with the essential nature of their government. In that sense, his cynicism, so unbecoming in other contexts, is a stabilising influence on this most fraught of relationships.It is idealism that has the far messier potential. Republicans were given to it until the rout of the neo-conservatives. It is now the Democrats whose grievances with China go well beyond economics to its civic and social model. One presidential contender, Bernie Sanders, views Beijing as part of an “authoritarian axis”.The lesson of its awesome rise – fears another, Elizabeth Warren – is that “economic gains legitimise oppression”. As for Huawei’s role in Europe, to let it build 5G networks would be “to choose autocracy over democracy”, says Pelosi, with the Manichean crudeness that nothing – not even the fiasco of Iraq, which it helped to beget – can kill off in Washington. Light and dark, good and bad, free and unfree: this stuff still trips off the tongue.The trouble is that it also widens the scope of the conflict beyond toy imports and intellectual property law. It implies that, in the absence of a round of glasnost, there is not much China can do to answer US concerns. Its very system is the problem.MoralisingThe Democrats will not fret quite as much as Trump about the bilateral trade deficit, and for this nod to Ricardian logic we must be thankful. But they seem more likely to define the US against the Chinese way of life: to moralise what is for now a largely material conflict. No doubt, it will be meant well. But then no one “had better motives for all the trouble he caused” than Pyle, the erring innocent in Graham Greene’s novel The Quiet American.An odd thought, I know, that a bellicose president, the one who began the US-China schism in the first place, might be better at containing it than his higher-minded successors. But the Cold War also metastasised beyond the plans of those (including the diplomat George Kennan) who never envisaged a worldwide clash of “values”.Trump’s indifference to the domestic doings of China, Saudi Arabia and other governments has shown his narrowness of human sympathy. But it has also kept his squabbles with most of them to what is tangible and negotiable. It is not even as though he drives the hardest of bargains, as the North Koreans might testify between Cheshire Cat smiles.Perhaps the Democrats’ more ideological noises will turn out to be so much electioneering. Neatly, their line on China allows them to match Trump for vigilance without forfeiting their distinctiveness. It is just that Washington’s vein of idealism is too persistent and too chequered in its record to be dismissed as easily as that.A new president would need staff and these would come from a diplomatic firmament that hews to much of what the Democrats are saying. The same belief in America as an “idea”. The same wariness of China as the opposite of it. And the same affront that nations from Britain to the Philippines, without a market of $21 trillion to fall back on, do not see things with such piercing clarity. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: British passengers left in limbo over Diamond Princess evacuationIreland launches new €2m campaign to get millennials to eat potatoesComment: Taking back control of our borders must change immigration numbers for goodWednesday evening news briefing: Immigration points system \u0026#39not end of Polish builders\u0026#39Nestle forced to apologise and rip up trees planted as part of eco-drive, after they destroyed wildflower meadowComment: Leaving the EU is a chance to rethink our disastrous flooding policy\tPolitics latest news: Priti Patel defends new immigration points system as she insists it\u0026#39s \u0026#39not the end of the Polish builder\u0026#39Chinese authorities humiliating people for not wearing face masksComment: Boris Johnson may be king of the castle now, but one false move could spark rebellionRoyal Family marks Prince Andrew\u0026#39s 60th birthday with low-key tweetComment: The Left\u0026#39s hysterical reaction to the end of cheap labour shows they still don\u0026#39t get it\tDrones, slides and remote-control cars: how China is avoiding coronavirus Coronavirus: a quick guide to the outbreak sweeping the world Caroline Flack inquest: Love Island presenter hanged herself at home, coroner saysCaroline Flack\u0026#39s torment revealed: \u0026#39Within 24 hours my whole world and future was swept from under my feet\u0026#39 Turkish president threatens \u0026#39imminent\u0026#39 assault on Syrian forces in IdlibMillionaire neighbours in £70,000 court battle over fence \u0026#39six inches out of place\u0026#39Comment: Labour\u0026#39s last leader hopefuls are all too cowardly to confront this one truthQueen tells children she had braces \u0026#39a very long time ago\u0026#39 too, as she heads back to work with hospital visitTrump has finally got his wall - but it\u0026#39s 8,000 miles from the US borderJapan faces mounting criticism as expert blows whistle on coronavirus cruise failures We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lord steel facing liberal democrat expulsion criticism child","story":"Lord Steel is set to be the first politician singled out for censure by the national child sex abuse inquiry and faces expulsion from the Liberal Democrats, The  can reveal.The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) is set to publish the conclusions of its investigation into allegations relating to Westminster next week, and the  has learned that it is set to castigate Lord Steel.Friends of the peer, one of the towering political figures of the 1970s and 1980s, fear he will be made a scapegoat over his admission that he failed to pass on his suspicions about Liberal MP Sir Cyril Smith\u0027s abuse of boys to the authorities.The Liberal Democrats have declined to comment ahead of the report, but The  has been told that a committee of senior MPs and peers is being convened to discuss Lord Steel\u0027s future in the party once the document is made public.Friends of Lord Steel, who led the Liberal Party for 12 years until 1988, have accused IICSA of scraping the barrel and making him a scapegoat in order to justify the huge cost of the inquiry. They also describe Lib Dem moves to expel the peer as double jeopardy because he has already been suspended, cleared and readmitted to the party over the same issue.The Westminster strand of the inquiry has failed to find any evidence of a widespread paedophile ring operating among MPs. It was set up by Theresa May on the back of a series of such allegations, many of which have since proved to be without foundation.The  understands that, behind the scenes, the Liberal Democrats have already put in motion plans to suspend and then expel Lord Steel, who is now 81, when IICSA publishes its report on February 25.Close colleagues including former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Campbell are considering quitting if he is expelled.A friend of Lord Steel, who is currently abroad, said: This is really low-hanging fruit for IICSA. There is no allegation about Lord Steel\u0027s personal behaviour, but the way in which he dealt with some publicity about Smith which he raised with him 40 years ago.There is a real fear IICSA will use this as a small trophy and the Liberal Democrats will seize upon any criticism to expel him. We think IICSA will scapegoat him on the basis he is the only name they have got.The inquiry, which has already cost the taxpayer £150 million, will also criticise Lord Steel for his decision to recommend Smith for a knighthood.Smith, who died in 2010, is accused of sexually abusing scores of boys. He was never charged in his lifetime despite a number of police investigations.IICSA warned Lord Steel that he faces criticism in a so-called Maxwellisation letter – which is required in public inquiries – that was sent last year.The report is understood, according to sources close to the inquiry, to be highly critical of his failure to notify authorities after an admission by Smith that claims about him published in Private Eye magazine were true.Under questioning, Lord Steel told IICSA of a conversation he had with Smith in 1979, in which the then MP for Rochdale admitted his behaviour was investigated a decade earlier.The Private Eye article accused Smith of king boys and conducting intimate medical examinations at a Rochdale hostel, but he had insisted that police took no further action.Lord Steel told IICSA last March that he assumed Smith had actually committed the offences, but had mentioned his confession to no-one.But the peer\u0027s supporters point out that, at the time of the abuse in the 1960s, Smith was a Labour councillor in Rochdale and had already been investigated by police and prosecutors with no further action taken.  They add that the conversation with Smith took place at an informal dinner in the Commons at which Lord Steel raised the Private Eye articles with him. But they insist he did not discuss their content in any detail.Friends of Lord Steel also say it is deeply unfair to criticise him for recommending Smith for a knighthood in 1988, when the honours committee had the power to instigate a full investigation but still approved it.A source close to IICSA told The  that the 200-page Westminster report will include a section on Steel, adding: There\u0027s a bit on him, don\u0027t worry. The source insisted Lord Steel would be one focus in a wide-ranging report.IICSA has failed to find any evidence of a widespread paedophile ring since being set up by Mrs May in 2014. She had faced fierce political pressure to do so, including a claim by Labour\u0027s Tom Watson that such a VIP paedophile ring existed.A series of false allegations by fantasists have since been exposed, including claims made by Carl Beech that he was abused by Sir Edward Heath, Lord Brittan and Field Marshal Lord Bramall among others.Beech, himself a  convicted paedophile, was subsequently jailed for perverting the course of justice. Other claims, including allegations that politicians and celebrities had abused boys at a guest house in south London, were also found to have been without foundation.Following his evidence to IICSA, Lord Steel was briefly suspended from the Liberal Democrats but then reinstated after an internal inquiry. Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, said last year that Lord Steel had been cleared after clarifying that Smith did not confess to any criminality, which is why he took no further action at the time.Lord Steel said at the time of his original suspension that he believed in the highest standards of safeguarding for young and vulnerable people and complained that some of his responses at IICSA have been erroneously reported and taken out of context.He said the allegations against him had caused me great personal distress, adding that his hearing had been impaired at the time and he was confused by some of the questioning.Lord Steel, who was unavailable for comment on Tuesday, is understood to be travelling in Africa. He is not due to return to the UK until February 26, a day after IICSA publishes its Westminster report.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"caroline flack inquest opens","story":"Caroline Flack hanged herself at home, an inquest into her death has heard. Coroner\u0027s officer Sandra Polson said police had been driving through Northwold Road in Stoke Newington, north-east London, when they were flagged down on Saturday February 15. Officers followed informants into Flack\u0027s home and found her lying on her back... she had apparently been found hanging, the hearing at Poplar Coroner\u0027s Court, in east London, was told. Police attempted resuscitation, which was continued by paramedics, but Flack was pronounced dead at the scene.Her body was identified by her sister, Jody Flack.

No, it’s not making sexist statements or proselytising for the Church of Scientology that will result in you being called in to your manager’s office these days: if you work for property developer Igloo, or office space behemoth WeWork, it’s trying to claim a bacon sandwich on expenses.Yes, if you’re on their payroll, you\u0027ll be better off financially being vegetarian on your lunch breaks. And don’t even think about ordering a pepperoni pizza during an away day: all company events are strictly veggie.But what right do these companies have to insist their employees can’t eat meat? Well, now you’re asking. After all, not only is it illegal to insist their employees do eat meat, but a recent court ruling decreed that ‘ethical veganism’ is a legally protected belief on a par with religion or sexuality. That ruling was the first part of a case currently being brought by a man who claims he was sacked from The League Against Cruel Sports (not a group known for its conservative viewpoint) for his veganism. But if veganism is legally protected, shouldn’t meat-eating be? Both are personal ethical choices regarding food that are in no way imposed on others (we are, after all, talking about people out of the office on their lunch break). Indeed, since it’s generally healthier for an inidual to have some meat in the diet, banning it actually runs the risk of imposing poor health on some workers.Say George from accounts fancies losing a few pounds on the Atkins diet, he’s going to find it a damn sight harder if he can’t have chicken for lunch. Or if Laura from acquisitions is a little anaemic during her pregnancy she can eat out with her colleagues during an office away day, but if she has a steak then she has to pay for her food, while everyone else gets it provided. Yes, it’s back to the stretchy trousers for George and counting out the pennies for Laura while the vegetarians head back to the office sated and pecunious.WeWork won\u0026#39t let staff expense meals containing meat or serve it at the events it fundsFor a quick morality-check, let’s try the old ‘shoe-on-the-other-foot’ game: WeWork’s new board of directors decides vegetarians must eat meat when meeting clients. They have to stuff down the sausages and gobble up the goose. And they have to like it. Of course, we can guess the first lawsuit will arrive within 24 hours. Few will blame them.And yet it’s not at all tricky to get these things right and fair. After the court ruling that ethical veganism is a protected belief, the Vegan Society issued a stonkingly reasonable set of guidelines for employers: a separate shelf in the fridge for vegan food, no insistence that vegans attend hog roasts, almond milk in the office kitchen. Apart from the eyebrow-raising claim that jokes made in the vicinity of vegans could constitute harassment and should be stamped out, it’s a list any decent employer could get on board with. That’s because it doesn’t impose on others - it doesn’t insist, on pain of dismissal, that non-vegans give up Cheddar and leather shoes for eight hours per day. No, good employers make workplaces inclusive, not exclusive respectful, not sneering and sanctimonious. So, when a firm says that the majority of the population are not worthy of taking home the same money at the end of the month as vegetarians, that those employees are literally worth less because they like to eat meat, it’s time to throw back in their faces their claims of inclusion and ethical employment. That’s the meat of the matter.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

If we don’t create standards that people feel are legitimate, they won’t trust institutions or technology.“To be clear, this isn’t about passing off responsibility. Facebook is not waiting for regulation we’re continuing to make progress on these issues ourselves.“But I believe clearer rules would be better for everyone. The internet is a powerful force for social and economic empowerment. Regulation that protects people and supports innovation can ensure it stays that way.”The social network said it wanted its recommendations to spark further debate about the issue of online regulation, and confirmed it planned to publish more papers on the subject of elections and privacy later this year.“If designed well, new frameworks for regulating harmful content can contribute to the internet’s continued success by articulating clear ways for government, companies\u0026nbspand civil society to share responsibilities and work together,” Facebook’s vice president of content policy, Monika Bickert, said.“Designed poorly, these efforts risk unintended consequences that might make people less safe online, stifle expression and slow innovation.”Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Capital spending was down 3.7 per cent and exports dipped 0.1 per cent.“Consumer spending, which slumped following the tax hike in the fourth quarter of 2019, will now struggle to do anything except contract further in the first quarter as the impact of Covid-19 weighs on consumer sentiment, weighing in particular on the consumer services sector,” said Dutch bank ING in a report.“Some further government spending may help to curb any further contraction in GDP beyond the first quarter of 2020.\u0026nbsp“But that will not stop what started off as a technical downturn from evolving into a full-blown recession.”A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek. Colour us intrigued. (Jacob Stolworthy) Alberto E. RodriguezGetty Images for DisneyA remake of David Lynch’s Dune would ordinarily cause our eyeballs to rattle around our sockets, but not when Denis Villeneuve’s in the director’s chair. So committed to his vision is Warner Bros that they ignored the fact his breathtaking Blade Runner sequel flopped and handed him the keys to a fresh adaptation of Herbert Ross’ novel. He did direct Prisoners, Enemy and Arrival, after all. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya head up the cast. (Jacob Stolworthy) Long in the works, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story looks set to be a festive smash this time next year. Speculated to be closer in spirit to the original Stephen Sondheim musical than the iconic 1961 film, this new version casts Ansel Elgort as Tony and newcomer Rachel Zegler as Maria – the latter, incredibly, beat out more than 30,000 candidates for the role, after submitting an audition video via Twitter. (Adam White)An intoxicating and romantic drama about lovers on the run, Queen \u0026amp Slim marks the first feature film from Melina Matsoukas, the director responsible for music videos including Beyoncé’s “Formation”. Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series.

May Bulman talks to those kicked out of Britain about the difficulty of\u0026nbspstarting againImagine being ripped from everyone and everything in your life, locked in a cell, then flown across the globe to a country you barely know. You have no friends or family there, no job, and sometimes struggle to even be understood by the locals. This is your new life.That’s the situation facing some of those flown to Jamaica on a controversial charter flight this month, many of whom – though they remain Jamaican nationals – had lived in Britain since they were children. One told The Independent he had only a single\u0026nbspmemory of the Caribbean island:\u0026nbspbrushing his teeth as a small child.The mass deportation, which had intended to return around 50 people before the courts limited the number to 17, has shone a light on human suffering caused by Britain’s returns system, which sees thousands deported each year, often with limited access to legal help to defend their right to stay in the UK.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOne man struggling to build a life after deportation is Tremayne Brown, 26, who was on a charter flight to Jamaica in 2017. He had lived in Britain since the age of six, having moved from Kingston’s Rose Town to south London with his father after his mother, brother and sister were killed by gangs. His father went to prison soon after their arrival – and was later deported – meaning Tremayne was put into care. No attempts were made to regularise his status in the UK.“I was leaving care and I was meant to get my own place and find a job, but then my social worker told me I wasn’t allowed to work, and they weren’t able to give me somewhere to live either, because of my status,” says Tremayne. “I was suddenly classed as an illegal alien.”Created with Sketch.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UK Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

But he was not allowed to work. His girlfriend and their baby son needed financial support, so he was pushed into crime.“I was stuck in a place where I wasn’t allowed to work and I couldn’t get anywhere to live. What am I meant to do? I regret it every day. If I didn’t do that, I would be there with my son right now.”Aged 18, Tremayne was convicted for supplying class A drugs and commercial robbery, serving three years in jail. He did his time, then was transferred to a removal centre and issued deportation orders. He says that on entering detention he was told his removal had been cancelled, so did not contact his solicitor. But a week later, he was put on a flight.“One night they came to my door and said, ‘Pack your bags.’ When I was on the plane I called the solicitor and he said, ‘Why didn’t you ring me, I could have cancelled your ticket,’ but that it was too late. I never got the opportunity to fight my case.”A young man who grew up in the hands of the British state was now being flown to a country he had not set foot in for nearly 20 years.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Though he lives with his father, Tremayne yearns to see his loved ones in Britain, particularly his son who, now aged six, has spent the majority of his life without his dad, having to make do with video calls.“He always asks me, ‘Dad, where are you?’ And if I’m coming back and why I left. It’s hard to explain it to him. He might hear his father’s voice and see him, but in reality you want him there in front of you. Through his childhood I haven’t been there. I haven’t been able to take him to the park. Those little things are important and have a knock-on effect on him as a child, having to grow up and say, ‘My father wasn’t there.’ It will make him bitter.”The Uncertain Kingdom - the groundbreaking anthology of twenty short films is released in cinemas 3\u0026nbspApril.\u0026nbspTremayne struggled to find work, largely because of his reputation as being one of the “deportee boys” who had their chance and lost it. His qualifications were not recognised in Jamaica, but he found a job at a holding company. He says the stigma still weighs on his shoulders. His British accent means he is constantly asked where he comes from and why he was deported.“I have had to start again from scratch. You spend your whole life in one place and then you have to adapt yourself again. Nothing is easy, but you have to try,” he says. “Some days are really hard. I miss my son, I miss my foster mum, I miss the scenery. Having been a young boy and grown up there, I class myself as British. Everything I know is from Britain. I never learned anything from Jamaica.”Another deportee, Chevon Brown, was forcibly removed on a charter flight last February on the basis of a driving offence he committed aged 21 – something he describes as a “stupid mistake”. He had moved to the UK when he was 14 and has no close relatives in Jamaica.As a qualified barber who started working at the age of 16, the 24-year-old had hoped to find a job fairly easily. But he says his name has been tarnished by the insinuation by British politicians that everyone on the charter plane was a murderer, rapist or drug dealer.Chevon rarely leaves the house because he says he can feel animosity from people in the street, and he has sleepless nights worrying about his future.“I’ve asked for jobs, told them I’m qualified, but after they’ve heard my name, they don’t want to employ me. They say how can they trust me when I’ve been deported,” he tells The Independent. “People think we’re going to come here and cause major crimes. Most people think I’m a murderer, rapist or drug trafficker, which I’m not. I went to prison for dangerous driving and I completely regret it because I never knew I’d be serving double punishment for one stupid mistake.”The proof that ministers haven’t learnt the lessons from WindrushChevon, who grew up in Oxford, served seven months after admitting speeding in an uninsured car. It happened after a heated argument with his housemate, when he took the car out and drove away from police.“I knew what I was doing was wrong in the moment,” he says. “I was genuinely scared. I wish I had stopped, given them the key, got arrested and that be that. I had no idea that this would be the aftermath of driving away from the police. If I ever come back to England I don’t want any involvement with police. I just want to live a calm and peaceful life. I want to get a barbershop, get a mortgage on a house, start planning a future, get a car, all those things.“But right now, I’m paying two, three years after the actual thing. I’ve gone to jail, done my time, and years later I still can’t actually move on with my life. I feel like I’m still in prison. It’s worse than prison, because I can’t see my family and friends. I feel like I’m stuck. My whole reputation has been messed up by one silly mistake.”“My dad is getting more and more stressed. He’s got health problems. My 18-year-old brother’s not listening to anyone any more. There’s been a ripple effect from what’s happened to me. My little brother keeps asking me, ‘When are you coming home?’ I can’t give him a definite answer about that. I wanted to set a good example. But right now I feel like I’m actually being a weight on my family, because of all this negative attention that’s been drawn towards me.“I feel more British than Jamaican. My dad brought me to England and said this was where I was going to be living for the rest of my life. So I ed into the new society and this is who I am today. Most people try to tell me to speak Patois, but I feel comfortable speaking English. When I speak the Jamaican language I feel like I have to put it on. I don’t want to put it on.”The level of contact goes down, and that just compounds the sense of lost connectionsWhile charter flights to Jamaica have garnered media attention in the wake of the Windrush scandal, forced deportations from the UK take place throughout the year to countries across the globe, with 9,461 people removed in 2018 and 12,049 the year before – in addition to around 20,000 iniduals removed through the voluntary returns route. An estimated 2,000 of those forcibly removed are put on planes privately chartered by the Home Office, of which a total of 20 charter planes left Britain last year, with the destinations including Albania, Pakistan, Nigeria, France and Ghana.Kweku Abodoli, 39, was deported to Ghana in 2018 after having lived in Britain since the age of 12. In a highly publicised court case, he had been sentenced to seven years behind bars in 2012 after losing £1.4bn while working for Swiss bank UBS. The banker, who had a British partner at the time, was sentenced to five years in jail. Two days after he was convicted, he was informed that he was liable to automatic deportation.“All the way from being arrested through to just after I was convicted immigration didn’t cross my mind. The level of stress goes through the roof,” says Kweku, who now lives with his parents in Accra. “Suddenly, the battle’s not over. I can’t just sit in and do my time and go home.“The pressure in the relationship started to go up, because now she’s thinking, ‘Okay, so I’ve stood by him through this fight, now what? What if I keep fighting if he’s going to get deported anyway?’”Kweku had left Ghana aged four, when his parents moved to the Middle East for work. He is grateful to have his parents and other relatives now in the country, but devastated at how his relationships in Britain – including with his now ex-girlfriend and many friends – have broken down since his return.“It’s the inability of being able to get on a plane and be there for someone,” he explains. “The distance creates massive tension in the relationship. You have to increasingly distance yourself from these really close relationships. The level of contact goes down, and that just compounds the sense of lost connections, which then leads to depression.”‘Cruelty’ as Jamaicans driven to charter flight despite court rulingAfter arriving in Ghana, Kweku spent about nine months sitting in his bedroom, unable to leave the house. He developed a number of physical manifestations of the trauma he had been through. “My body started to swell up a lot,” he says. “We thought it was a heart problem so had a lot of heart tests. My face just blew up like a balloon, my legs were like elephant trunks,”The Ghanaian national acknowledges that he was relatively lucky on his return that, unlike the Jamaican deportees, he was welcomed with open arms by both his family and the country as a whole, who gave him what he describes as a “massive embrace”.“Because of the violence and the cruelty of what happened to me, I think Ghana went, ‘This is a son of Ghana, a son of Africa, why should anyone be treated this way?’ Random people on the street would stop me. Everyone recognised me. They were all saying welcome home,” he says, adding: “My stamina is not back and I’m still dealing with adrenal failure, so I still have to do a lot of work to deal with my stress, but I’m getting back to the point where I’m starting to contribute again.”But Kweku still remembers what he went through on during his deportation: “Of all that I went through, none of it was as bad as sitting at the back of a plane with five G4S guards. I was hyperventilating, sobbing non-stop for four hours.”Branded “foreign national offenders” and “illegal immigrants” by the Home Office\u0026nbspas they wait in cells to be taken away, these deportees are characterised as hardened criminals. But for Tremayne, Chevon and Kweku, these terms – and the trauma – ripple through their lives for years to come as they try to start again, thousands of miles from the place they call home.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

door on 140,000 workers from the European Union and citizens from the continent may have to provide their fingerprints.The Home Office has floated the hardline proposal as part of a “firm and fair” post-Brexit crackdown that will replace free movement with a minimum salary threshold of £25,600 for most workers.However, ministers are unable to estimate the overall level of future migration – after relaxing salary and skills rules for non-EU migrants – despite insisting they “will reduce” it.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnd the proposals laid bare how Boris Johnson has abandoned his pledge to introduce an “Australian-style points system”, other than for a small number of the most highly-skilled arrivals.Australia awards points for age, qualifications and work experience, allowing entry without a job offer – but, in the UK, only arrivals with a PhD, or in a shortage profession, will skirt the salary floor, and all but the most talented must have a job to go to.‘No time to lose’: Johnson told to act on Brexit food price hikes riskThe plans have already been branded “a disaster” by social care leaders, fearing a deepening recruitment crisis, although the social care sector could yet be added to the shortage list.Ministers have also rejected any regional variation in the proposed £25,600 floor, despite business leaders warning of problems for companies in poorer parts of the UK.Priti Patel, the home secretary, hailed the shake-up as “a historic moment for the whole country”, bringing immigration policy back under UK control “for the first time in decades”.“It will mean that we will have a global immigration system that doesn\u0027t discriminate between EU and non-EU, and it’ll basically mean that the brightest and the best will be able to come to the United Kingdom to bring their real talents,” she said.Created with Sketch.Brexit day: UK says goodbye to EU  Show all 66Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A message

(10 points).How do I earn extra points?Those who meet the first three conditions can then earn extra points to reach the threshold of 70 points by having:Salary of £25,600 or above (20 points).Job in an occupation where there are staff shortages, designated by the Migration Advisory Committee, such as the NHS, vets, architects (20 points).PhD in subject relevant to the job (10 points).PhD in a STEM (science, technology, engineering, maths) subject relevant to the job (20 points).The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I wouldn’t be sitting in my studio and you wouldn’t be Home Secretary, in one of the biggest offices in the land, under your system.”Ms Patel responded: “The policies are changing. This is the point. We are changing our immigration policy to one that’s fit for purpose for our economy, based on skills.“This is not about refugees and asylum and people being persecuted around the world. We must differentiate between the two.”Ms Patel later told BBC Radio 5 Live that her parents had faced persecution in Uganda, pointing out that the changes she is introducing do not affect the way in which the UK will deal with people fleeing persecution overseas.This is not about changing rules on asylum and refugees\u0026nbspand people that are being persecuted around the world - the two are fundamentally different so I think it is wrong to conflate the two, said the home secretary. My family were persecuted in East Africa so there is a complete difference between the two.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

More like an actress acting the part of someone who cares. As so many of them do.“I find Portman’s type of activism deeply offensive to those of us who actually do the work. I’m not writing this out of bitterness, I am writing out of disgust,” she wrote.Unfortunately, coming from someone who has been so integral in the protest movement, this sounds like sour grapes.Natalie’s response to Rose’s criticism was as elegant and as understated as her protest.She said: “I agree with Ms McGowan that it is inaccurate to call me ‘brave’ for wearing a garment with women’s names on it.“Brave is a term I more strongly associate with actions like those of the women who have been testying against Harvey Weinstein the last few weeks.”She also responded to Rose’s accusation that Natalie has only been directed twice by women.But in this criticism, Rose is seriously missing the point. Female directors don’t get as far in Hollywood as male ones, which is precisely what Natalie is pointing out with her cloak protest. Therefore, there are fewer available to work with.As Natalie said: “It is true I’ve only made a few films with women. In my long career, I’ve only gotten the chance to work with female directors a few times . . . Unfortunately, the unmade films I have tried to make are a ghost history.“Female films have been incredibly hard to get made at studios, or to get independently financed. If these films do get made, women face enormous challenges during the making of them.”By the way, this is not the first time Natalie has protested from within the system.While presenting the best director category at the Golden Globes in , she introduced the line-up by saying: “And here are the all-male nominees.”Again, it’s not a shouty, noisy street protest. But it served to make her point. Just that she did it in a dferent way than Rose might. And that’s fine.In fact, some people think that Rose’s in-your-face type of protest risks alienating some people.I think women should support each other when it comes to vying for equality.But also, Rose just sounded spiteful when she said Natalie was “an actress acting like someone who cares”.Rose is a hero to many women. But she needs to understand that whether their contribution is big or small, loud or subtle, anyone’s effort to affect change helps.JANE Fonda, who looked fabulous at the Oscars, has said she is done with plastic surgery.Well, I guess  is as good an age as any to stop nipping and tucking.She must have a great doctor, as whatever the actress has had done has been done very well indeed – because, in my experience, it’s not often you look better after a facelt than you did before.PERHAPS Andrea Leadsom had a premonition that she was going to be axed as Business Secretary in this week’s Cabinet reshuffle.She recently wrote a column obliquely warning Boris Johnson not to cut the number of female ministers in his Cabinet.Addressing the issue of female board members among FTSE  companies, Andrea wrote: “Working in the City in the Nineties, I saw myself how a male-dominated environment can limit a career.”Unfortunately for her, the warning did not save her skin and she has been sacked, along with Theresa Villiers as Environment Secretary and housing minister Esther McVey.By the way, eight of the  members of Mr Johnson’s first Cabinet were female –  per cent.Despite these sackings, that figure has actually risen – slightly – to nearly  per cent.Ideally, the split would be an even -.But the reality is that business and politics can both be brutal.Men and women alike must accept they might one day get the sack.It simply goes with the territory.Being selected on the basis of gender is just as wrong as being sacked on that basis.Right person, right job, regardless of their gender.THAT is what true equality means.SAY what you like about the bonkers lestyle advice dispensed by Gwyneth Paltrow on Goop – and some of it is seriously out there.But whatever she is doing clearly works.She is, at the age of , nothing short of radiant.In fact she looks amazing and also happy.Not only that but she became instantly relatable to parents everywhere with a confession that her -year- old daughter finds her embarrassing.That’s a good reminder there is nothing like a teenager to keep you normal and down to earth for fear that you will embarrass them, no matter what you do.Although, to be fair, perhaps Gwyneth’s daughter has had a predisposition to feel embarrassed by her mother ever since she named her  . . . Apple.What are the ethics of seat-reclining on a long-haul flight An American Airlines passenger raised the question after video-shaming a fellow traveller who punched and pushed her seat when she reclined it.Bearing in mind the recline button moves the seat about in, I suspect this chap has anger issues, as reclining a seat that has a recline button is hardly an act of aggression.I’d disable the recline button and then all you have to fight over is the armrest.DAMIAN Hurleys resemblance to his mother, Liz, is uncanny.More so than ever in the latest shots of the two of them together, which he posted online this week.Some people think it is vaguely unsettling that he looks more like Liz Hurley than Liz Hurley.But as a mum myself, I think it’s heartwarming a teenage boy should be so happy to emulate his mother.OH the utter folly of the face tattoo!The latest to succumb to this trend, which a few years ago would be, frankly, unthinkable, is Amber Rose.She has had the words Bash and Slash tattooed across her forehead in old English manuscript style.It’s a reference, apparently, to the model’s three-month-old son Slash, and six-year-old son Sebastian. And, obviously, it’s lovely that she loves her children so much.But tattooing their names on her forehead where they will remain for all her le  All I can say is: Tattoo in haste . . . repent at leisure.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And more people now watch YouTube than all terrestrial broadcasters put together.Even the BBCs highest paid star, Gary Lineker, says its time to make the fee voluntary, while Dame Helen Mirren admits its had its day.Yet the Government’s policy has provoked howls of outrage, especially from the chattering liberals who seem to regard the licence fee as a sacred part of our constitution.Their squeals of protest are badly misplaced. The fact is that, by guaranteeing a huge revenue stream, the licence fee promotes a culture of excess and mismanagement within the BBC, which has a budget of almost £ billion and employs , people.Its reflected in the vast salaries paid to scores of BBC stars, far beyond market rates, like the £. million previously dished out to Lineker, £, to newsreader Huw Edwards, or the £, to sports presenter Jason Mohammad.You can spot it in the host of botched or extravagant schemes, like the notorious reconstruction of the EastEnders set, whose budget soared from £ million to £. million.Worse still, a staggering £ billion was spent on the refurbishment of Broadcasting House in central London.There is also absurd doubling up among staff, particularly in the news.Last week, the BBC had  correspondents covering the American Democrat primaries in Iowa and New Hampshire, while in  no fewer than  on-air journalists were sent to report on one brief Brussels summit attended by David Cameron.But the lack of any commercial pressure is most easily spotted in the vast, sprawling tiers of flabby bureaucracy.Ab Fab comedian Jenner Saunders once said of the corporation, “It’s become top-heavy in such an ugly way,” adding that it is “an executive-run place for idiots”.A glance through the BBC’s Annual Report for  shows just how correct she was.On these pages, I counted no fewer than eight managers who had “Human Resources Director” in their job titles, all of them on at least £,-a-year.Among them were: Dale Haddon, “HR Director, News and Employee Relations”, on up to £, Rachel Currie, “BBC Group HR Director” on up to £, and Gillian Taylor, “HR Director” on £,.It was the same story with BBC News, whose regiment of well-healed officials included: Fran Unsworth, the “Director of News” on £, Gavin Allen, “Head of News Output” on £, and Jonathan Munroe, Head of Newsgathering” on £,.This grasping spirit prevails throughout the bloated organisation, from the £, “Director of Nations and Regions” to the £, “Director of Radio and Education.”Insulated by public funding, the corporation adores both navel-gazing and self-promotion. So it has a “Director of Communications” on £,-a-year, a “Director of Policy” on £, and a “Director of Editorial Policy” on £,.All that puts into perspective the current moans from the BBC about the need for cuts.But apart from the managerial excess, what also aggravates is how the corporation uses its publicly-funded muscle to promote a fashionable, London-centric agenda.As the state’s monopoly broadcaster, the BBC should be utterly impartial.Yet its output is dominated by trendy political messages on immigration, climate change, Tory cuts, ersity and poverty.The BBC might have lavished reporters on the Democrat primaries, but it gave hardly any live coverage to the recent celebrations in Parliament Square at the moment of Brexit.Typically a Newsnight discussion  that evening – held in a studio bedecked with the blue and gold of the EU - featured two Remainers and one Brexiteer.Left-wing propaganda is continually crowbarred into everything from drama to discussion programmes.Just  per cent of the national workforce is employed in the public sector, yet the BBC is filled with the voices of state employees, most of them whining about under-funding.Left-wing opinions have a stranglehold most topical comedy shows, such as Radio Four’s News Quiz, hosted by the achingly unfunny Nish Kumar.It was Kumar who recently caused a storm by sneeringly presenting an edition of the BBC children’s show “Horrible Histories”, in which Britain’s Victorian past was held up for ridicule.The BBC can get away with this because of its lucrative monopoly as the state’s only broadcaster. It has abused that privileged position for too long.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No one is suggesting you won’t have Strictly Come Dancing or Match of the Day or even Question Time and Newsnight.But the media is fundamentally changing. Consumer choice – what you or me choose to consume on the box or on our iPads or phones and at what time – is king.The idea that by  paying £. for a service that we may choose not to watch or listen to AT ALL is insanity.It might be unpleasant for BBC lers but the time has come to accept that the licence fee must evolve into a subscription service, so that the corporation is accountable to viewers and not the current behemoth that puts local newspapers out of business, that competes with national newspaper websites to write about Love Island, and that makes podcasts like Reality Tea all about the MTV reality series Geordie Shore.That is NOT public service broadcasting. It is a blatant and constant attempt to undercut struggling commercial rivals.But a sea change is coming. I truly feel it.Sure, there might be disagreement at Downing Street about exactly what that change will involve.Personally I’m on the side of Dominic Cummings who wants wholescale cuts. Sell Radio  and Radio , shut down the sweeping BBC Online department and focus on true public service programming that won’t be provided where. Then in  allow people the choice about whether they want to pay for what they watch from the BBC or not.But the plan by Boris Johnson - who The Times reports this morning fancies an evolution not a revolution - is also valid. The first step to decriminalise the licence fee is the start of bringing the BBC back in line.The fact we’re even having this discussion is the fault of the BBC, which has proven itself to be untrustworthy and lacking in political impartiality in recent years.It disgraced itself over its coverage of Brexit. It proved it was no longer in touch with vast swathes of the country the folk outside of London who don’t spend their days eating quinoa salads and quaffing champagne with other members of the liberal media elite.It proved itself out of touch for failing to predict the biggest story at the most recent election: Boris Johnson’s historic toppling of Labour’s northern red wall.But what’s most telling is the fact some of the BBC’s biggest proponents are now speaking out to insist the corporation must adapt to change. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Credit: The Mega Agency Dame Helen Mirren is the latest celeb to e into the debate over the licence feeShe said this week: “I think the that the licence fee has had its day.”She joins the BBC’s highest paid presenter Gary Lineker who has said it should be abolished.In all honesty though so should his contract, which costs licence fee payers £. million a year for minimal work.Radio ’s Evan Davis last week said the BBC needs to axe radio stations and either BBC or BBC rather than keep trimming costs around the edges.The need for genuine change at the BBC has reached a tipping point.It has to happen now.

He said critics would be hysterical - but a Labour MP claimed the practice is playing GodBoris Johnson’s top aide said Brexit could free up Britain to pioneer controversial gene research.  nDominic Cummings predicted new methods will “revolutionise” IVF, allowing would-be parents to avoid embryos with “disease risks and cognitive problems”.  nIn a ,-word blog last February about ‘genomic prediction’, he urged Britain to “push the frontiers” of the field - despite what he said would be “hysterical” arguments about “things like IQ and social mobility”.  nHe added: “Post-Brexit Britain will be outside [the EU’s] jurisdiction and able to make faster and better decisions about regulating technology like genomics, AI and robotics.”  nA Labour frontbencher claimed the practice was “eugenics” with one MP from the party accusing him of trying to “play God”. No was approached for comment.  nIt gives a useful insight into Mr Cummingsapos thinking on IQ and genetics after he wrote his blog post about a topic called ‘genomic prediction’.  nThis is where embryos are excluded from IVF based on markers in their DNA. The practice is welcomed by some as a way of avoiding lelong illness, but has provoked an ethical debate about where to draw the line.  nOne US-based firm, Genomic Prediction, offers parents screening to identy “genetically normal” embryos. This includes weeding out those at risk of disease. But in  the firm also developed testing to show an embryo’s risk of a low IQ.  nBrexit news and Brexit explained  nCo-founder Stephen Hsu, who Mr Cummings praised and has appeared with at No, said it would only be used to eliminate embryos with a “mental disability”. But Mr Hsu accepted people may in future select ‘designer’ intelligent babies, telling New Scientist: “I think people are going to demand that. If we don’t do it, some other company will.”  nOn his blog, Mr Cummings quoted research saying genes have a “substantial influence” on people’s IQ, and said genomic tests - cheaper all the time - can now predict people’s heights “within a few cm”.  nHe focused mainly on physical health, saying the “useful predictions” could avoid embryos developing diabetes, breast or prostate cancer in later le. But he added: “We will also be able to make predictions about outliers in cognitive abilities .”  nHe warned against relying on ‘early years’ programmes like Sure Start, which he said was based on flawed evidence, to improve children’s lives. Instead he urged politicians to make policy decisions “on the basis of rational thinking and good science.”  n  nEU could demandof Elgin marbles to Greece as part of Brexit trade deal  nBritish sausage makers warn Brexit could halt their exports to the EU  nHe added: China is pushing very hard on genomics… America has political and regulatory barriers holding it back on genomics that are much weaker here.  n“Britain cannot stop the development of such science. Britain can choose to be a backwater, to ignore such things and listen to MPs telling fairy stories while the Chinese plough ahead, or it can try to lead.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe Tory government has finally set out its plans for a points-based immigration system to come into force on January  . The radical shake-up will block millions of aposlow-skilledapos - well, low-paid - workers from coming to the UK. After Brexit people will have to earn over £,, have a job offer and speak English to a certain level in order to get a work visa. There will be some exceptions for people who earn £, to £, in shortage areas like the NHS. But the plans have prompted an outpouring of fury from businesses and council who warn sectors like social care face disaster. In response the Home Office has told businesses they should simply end their reliance on cheap, low-skilled labour.Yet there are a whole host of unanswered questions. Home Secretary Priti Patel refused to give any overall cap or target on numbers, and wouldnapost say exactly when people will be able to bring their family.Â Thereaposs also scant information about how much applications will cost or how a sufficient level of English language will be measured. A policy statement published on Wednesday said free movement would end, laws surrounding this would be repealed and a new Immigration Bill would be introduced for a firm and fair system which would attract the high-skilled workers to create a high wage, high skill, high productivity economy. The government wants companies to train up British workers to fill vacancies but critics say the lack of investment in further education makes that dficult. Meanwhile Labour predict there will be so many carve-outs and exceptions that the system will be pointless. Ms Patel said there will still be ways for some low-skilled workers, such as Polish builders, to come to Britain. We will continue to review the labour market, she told the BBC. So how will it actually work  Hereaposs a handy guide. Skilled workers  All applicants - both EU and non-EU citizens - who want to live and work in the UK will need to gain  points to be eligible to apply for a visa. Points will be awarded for key requirementsthey can demonstrate they:Have a job offer from an approved sponsor, such as an employer cleared by the Home Office . Have a job offer that is at a required skill level . They can speak English to a certain level .Other points could be awarded for certain qualications andthere is a shortage in a particular occupation. The salary threshold for skilled migrants will be lowered from £, to £, for those coming to the UK with a job offer. Butan applicant earns less than the required minimum salary threshold - but no less than £, - they may still be able to come to the UKthey have a job offer in a specic occupation which appears on the Governmentaposs jobs shortage list, orthey have a PhD relevant to the job. This could mean lower earners such as nurses may still be able to apply for a visa, provided a shortage of staff in this area remain on the approved list. The cap on the number of people who can come through the skilled worker route has been scrapped. There are no plans to introduce regional salary thresholds or dferent arrangements for dferent parts of the UK. This would allow a small number of the most highly-skilled workers, who can gain the required level of points, to enter the UK without a job offerthey are endorsed by a relevant and competent body. This will include science, technology, engineering and mathematics professionals. Points will be awarded for factors such as academic qualications, age and relevant work experience and the route would be capped. Low-skilled workers  There will be no temporary or general visa options for low-skilled migrant workers. The paper said: UK businesses will need to adapt and adjust to the end of free movement, and we will not seek to recreate the outcomes from free movement within the points-based system. As such, it is important that employers move away from a reliance on the UKaposs immigration system as an alternative to investment in staff retention, productivity, and wider investment in technology and automation. It is estimated % of the existing EU workforce would not meet the requirements of the skilled worker route, which will help to bring overall numbers down in future, according the Home Office. It is thought there are around . million EU citizens living in the UK and most are said to be unskilled or low-skilled workers.  Last week it was reported the new system could cut the number of low-skilled migrant workers from European Union countries by up to , a year. The policy document mentioned the immigration system would reduce overall migration numbers. But the Home Office has been unable to provide more detail on how this would be achieved anda target number had been set. A pilot scheme for seasonal workers in agriculture will be quadrupled from , to , places. Youth mobility arrangements with eight countries that result in around , young people coming to the UK each year will continue. Both routes will provide employers with further ongoing flexibility in employing iniduals into lower-skilled roles, the paper said, but added: We expect employers to take other measures to address shortages.

We need to give people more.  n  nLater, she tweeted: Give people more money so that they can prosper and not simply exist.  nJenny was a talented hairdresser before she was raped, having been plied with alcohol by a neighbour and assaulted in her sleep, she explains, and had dreamt of becoming an air hostess - but is now crippled by anxiety and bogged down with trying to survive day to day on low pay.  nTwitter user Kerri Johnson said while watching the show: I quote ‘it’s just the way the system is’  That is the issue though isn’t it  that the current system is driven by a ‘process’ but no thought for the impact on the person!  n  nAnother viewer, referring to Jenny, was baffled by the short-term fix nature of Universal Credit, particularly in the case of the vulnerable but ambitious young woman.  nThey tweeted: The  year old girl goes to the job centre, wants to work FT and gets offered a zero hours contract position with top up support through Universal Credit.  nWhile Abigail, another viewer, tweeted: Feeling saddened...seeing how just one unfortunate event can put people into situations that seem near impossible to live in, with no clear way of getting out. Thinking about just how many people live like this too.  nMum-of-one Paula, , meanwhile, was left with a feeling in her throat like Iaposve been smothered and with anxiety levels through the roof after receiving her first Universal Credit payment - and with it a major shock.   nHaving recently moved in with her partner Aaron, the change of circumstances means Paula has to move onto Universal Credit from Job Seekers Allowance and Housing Benefit.  n  nShe had been receiving £ a fortnight from JSA and Child Credit, but Universal Credit is paid a month in arrears - and she has no savings to see her through the five-week wait for the first payment.  nHoping the wait doesnapost mess us up as it has done with a lot of people sheaposs known, she tells the cameras: A lot of people have killed themselves over it, havenapost they   nNeeding to pay for a school unorm for daughter Lexi, work coach Lorraine offers her an advance - essentially a Universal Credit loan - of £, to get her through.  n  nThis will have to be paid back at £ a month, over  months, she is told.  nBut a major shock is just round the corner for Paula as she gets through the five week wait only to find £. is deducted from her monthly Universal Credit payment.  nThis leaves her with £ for the month - far less than she was expecting - which is roughly £ a day for herself, her partner Aaron, and daughter Lexi, to pay rent, food, bills - everything.  n  nTwitter user Thomas Hemingford said: With Universal Credit and work, the system leaves people constantly chasing their tails, not knowingtheyaposll have money for bills.

The last episode of three-part series Inside the Welfare State aired on Tuesday evening and focused on Bolton Jobcentre claimants Jenny, a sex attack victim, and Paula, a mum who has just £ a day to live on. Both have had to take advances on their claims to make ends meet and are living day-to-day. Twitter user Martyn G said: Just watching the BBC programme on Universal Credit and these Middle Class Morons who have been running the DWP have been hiding their fat heads in the sand with regards to the Delay in payments having a direct effect on hardship and foodbank use! Universal Credit is designed to help people who are out of work, long-term sick or on low-paid, short-term or zero-hour contracts. However critics say there are a string of problems. People must wait five weeks for their first payment. If they want to cover the gap they must borrow an aposadvanceapos against their future benefits. Meanwhile, UC ies for people in insecure work with changing hours - meaning itaposs often impossible to know exactly how much youaposll get until the end of the month. Those people include -year-old Jenny who has recently signed up for the controversial new benefit, having taken a nine-month break from work due to the stress of the assault. In the episode, she is shown to have found herself a job on a zero hour contract at a new restaurant, but her £. an hour wages and meagre benefits mean she is struggling to afford her £-a-week flat rent.  Two weeks in, she is forced to apply for a £ advance on her Universal Credit, essentially a loan which will be deducted from future payments over the next  months . Universal Credit will top up her salary, but the amount she receives in benefits reduces by p for pound she earns in salary. With it always being paid a month behind, this combination of factors means she never knows how much she will receive - and this is proving tough. Later in the episode she suffers a bad fall and cannot work for  days, and with no sick pay or savings she panics and takes out another UC advance.  Three weeks later, she is seen again working at the restaurant but in that time has only been offered one six hour sht in a week, and tells the camera she is desperate to find a proper job. And in a final cruel blow, she does not receive hardly any money from Universal Credit because it is calculated from her wages last month - and does not take into account the dficulties she has faced this month. Twitter user Amber Goodwin, chair of Hull and Hessle Labour Party, said: We need a better system and we need to scrap the ideological  week wait. We need to give people more.  Later, she tweeted: Give people more money so that they can prosper and not simply exist. Jenny was a talented hairdresser before she was raped, having been plied with alcohol by a neighbour and assaulted in her sleep, she explains, and had dreamt of becoming an air hostess - but is now crippled by anxiety and bogged down with trying to survive day to day on low pay. Twitter user Kerri Johnson said while watching the show: I quote ‘it’s just the way the system is’  That is the issue though isn’t it  that the current system is driven by a ‘process’ but no thought for the impact on the person!  Another viewer, referring to Jenny, was baffled by the short-term fix nature of Universal Credit, particularly in the case of the vulnerable but ambitious young woman. They tweeted: The  year old girl goes to the job centre, wants to work FT and gets offered a zero hours contract position with top up support through Universal Credit. While Abigail, another viewer, tweeted: Feeling saddened...seeing how just one unfortunate event can put people into situations that seem near impossible to live in, with no clear way of getting out. Thinking about just how many people live like this too. Mum-of-one Paula, , meanwhile, was left with a feeling in her throat like Iaposve been smothered and with anxiety levels through the roof after receiving her first Universal Credit payment - and with it a major shock.  Having recently moved in with her partner Aaron, the change of circumstances means Paula has to move onto Universal Credit from Job Seekers Allowance and Housing Benefit.  She had been receiving £ a fortnight from JSA and Child Credit, but Universal Credit is paid a month in arrears - and she has no savings to see her through the five-week wait for the first payment. Hoping the wait doesnapost mess us up as it has done with a lot of people sheaposs known, she tells the cameras: A lot of people have killed themselves over it, havenapost they  Needing to pay for a school unorm for daughter Lexi, work coach Lorraine offers her an advance - essentially a Universal Credit loan - of £, to get her through.  This will have to be paid back at £ a month, over  months, she is told. But a major shock is just round the corner for Paula as she gets through the five week wait only to find £. is deducted from her monthly Universal Credit payment. This leaves her with £ for the month - far less than she was expecting - which is roughly £ a day for herself, her partner Aaron, and daughter Lexi, to pay rent, food, bills - everything.  Twitter user Thomas Hemingford said: With Universal Credit and work, the system leaves people constantly chasing their tails, not knowingtheyaposll have money for bills. Itaposs no way to live, you canapost plan, and you canapost build a le like that. And then later: Universal Credit crushes people. It causes severe anxiety and mental health problems. Not just amongst adults, but children, too. It pushes people into a debt spiral. That does not help anyone. One viewer tweeted that they had worked in finance and analysis for  years before they became unable to work and went onto Universal Credit after moving towns. They said they keep meticulous budgeting spreadsheets for myself and even I came unstuck during the -week wait.

Dating website DatingRoo has looked at the stigma attached to dating with cancer. A spokesman said: Doing this research and talking with many young and single cancer survivors, I realized that navigating the online dating world for someone who is single and diagnosed with cancer is extremely challenging. They are dealing with low self-esteem and physical and emotional changes that make it even harder to go out on dates and start a conversation or relationship with someone new. However, those who overcome these fears and put themself in the dating market very quickly realise that it is not as bad as they thought.

But following months of scandal, the Duke of Yorkaposs day will be much more low-key after being signicantly downgraded by his mum the Queen. Andrew has been heavily criticised for his friendship with billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, fuelled by his car-crash Newsnight interview in which he failed to show any regret or empathy with his victims. It resulted in him being effectively apossackedapos from his royal duties while charities cut all ties with him. The Queenaposs son was due to mark the landmark occasion with a big party, similar to the one the Queen hosted for Prince Charlesaposs th in , however plans were scrapped amid the scandal. Instead, they will sit down for a family dinner at Royal Lodge - the York familyaposs Windsor home - this evening. About  people are due to attend. A group of Andrewaposs friends are also said to be planning a celebration. There were reports that several of the invited guests shunned the dinner party, forcing loyal ex-we Sarah Ferguson to desperately try to make up the numbers.According to MailOnline a number of friends have become unavailable, resulting in Fergieaposs assistant looking for replacements. Nothing quite illustrates the Duke of Yorkaposs dizzying fall from grace than the manner in which a number of his friends — or those he thought of as friends — have shunned the chance to join him tomorrow on his th birthday, the Mailaposs Sebastian Shakespeare writes.The official Royal Family Instagram account posted a birthday message to the Duke, including two photos.The first is a black and white snap from when he was a baby and the second a recent picture showing him looking serious in a dark suit. The caption reads: On this day in , Prince Andrew was born at Buckingham Palace, the first child born to a reigning monarch for  years.  Happy Birthday to The Duke of York. Many fans were unimpressed by the message, with some labelling it inappropriate. Sarah Ferguson also shared a black and white picture on her Instagram page. The casual shot shows Andrew sitting on a sofa looking out the window while stroking a dog. She writes: Happy th Birthday to Andrew.

It was the middle of the night back home, and I knew I had to tell my mum, but I wanted to give her a few more minutes of not knowing her child had cancer.”  n“I wandered around the city, which was still quite unfamiliar to me, with no idea where to go,” she continued.  n“Eventually, I called home and Mum just kept saying, ‘No.’  n“She saw me as this strong, healthy girl – it was shocking that cancer could suddenly hit me so aggressively.  n“You sometimes imagine how it may feel to be told you have cancer. nOn TV, people always seem to go numb – their hearing fades and the room around them swirls.

I was working long hours and still managing to get myself to the gym three times a week, so I didn’t think it was anything overly worrying.  n“I blamed city le. I kept telling myself I’d be moving to Hong Kong soon and would feel better in a new place, with a bit of sunshine.”  nAlexandra’s doctor agreed she could be anaemic so  suggested she eat more red meat, or try an iron supplement to get her levels up.  nAssuming that would be the end of it, Alexandra turned her thoughts to her big move in early March .  nWhen her fatigue did not lt, she said: “I kept telling myself I’d just moved around the world and that feeling tired was natural – but I just wasn’t bouncing back from the jetlag.  n“As I became more comfortable with the new friends I was making out there, they remarked that I still looked pale, despite being in the sweltering heat every day.”  nAgreeing she could be anaemic, Alexandra’s doctor suggested she eat more red meat, or try an iron supplement to get her levels up.  n  n]] nSo, assuming that would be the end of it, she turned her thoughts to her big move in early March .  nWhen her fatigue did not lt, she said: “I kept telling myself I’d just moved around the world and that feeling tired was natural – but I just wasn’t bouncing back from the jetlag.  n“As I became more comfortable with the new friends I was making out there, they remarked that I still looked pale, despite being in the sweltering heat every day.”  nIt was at the end of March when Alexandra banged her leg getting out of the bath one day and noticed a dramatic bruise forming within minutes that she thought something sinister was happening.  nShe continued: “It kept developing, getting larger and larger, to the point where I was embarrassed to show it, as I could feel people staring, wondering what I’d done.  n“That seemed to almost trigger something in my body and, before long, clusters of bruises sprang up all over, with no explanation as to where they’d come from.”  nAlexandra looked up her symptoms online – and was shocked when almost all of them pointed towards leukaemia.  nSo, using healthcare benefits she had through work, in April she booked a private appointment to see a doctor, who gave her a blood test with the results back the next morning.  n“I’d just sat down at my desk when my phone started to ring,” recalled Alexandra. n  n“I don’t think the receptionist even said hello. She just asked, ‘Where are you ’ and told me to come in right away.  n“The urgency in her voice was really worrying. When I got there, I was trying to analyse the doctor’s face. I knew that something serious was going on, as he couldn’t quite look at me. Then he told me I had leukaemia.”  nAfter wandering around the city and phoning her mum, feeling shaken and disorientated, Alexandra ed to her office and broke the news to her colleagues.  n“A colleague came over to askI was okay, as I was visibly upset. I think she assumed it’d be a break-up, or homesickness – a more normal problem for a -something who had moved across the world to be facing,” she said.  n“When I told her, I watched the colour drain from her face. She sat with me and we talked it all over then, bizarrely, I actually wanted to do a bit of work while I waited for my midday appointment. My colleagues thought I was bonkers, but I needed a distraction.”  nWhen Alexandra she saw the specialist later that day she realised how gravely ill she was.  nShe recalled: “He told me I wasn’t well enough to fly back to the UK, and I needed to go straight to hospital. n“I said, aposOkay, I’ll just go home to get some thingsapos. But he told me no, thatI somehow fell or knocked myself on the way, that my blood didn’t have enough platelets to form clots, so I could bleed to death.”  nShe continued: He said, aposYou need to go to hospital right now, and just to warn you, you’ll be there for at least a monthapos. He was good at keeping me calm, but also making me realise how much danger I was in.  n  nAdmitted to hospital, Alexandra was given a bone marrow biopsy, which confirmed her official diagnosis.  nAccording to the charity Leukaemia Care, ALL is a rapidly progressing form of the disease, with almost  cases a year diagnosed in UK adults.  nSymptoms can include fatigue, fever, frequent infections, unusual bleeding, unexplained weight loss and small purple spots on the skin known as purpura.  nThree days after her diagnosis, Alexandra began the first of four gruelling cycles of chemotherapy.  n“It all happened so quickly, I didn’t really have time to consider what I was about to put my body through. I was just focused on getting the cancerous cells eliminated,” she said.  nWhen I look back at that part of everything, it doesn’t feel like my le. It’s like I’m looking at another girl thinking, aposPoor her, she’s been through so muchapos.  n“As well as the obvious side-effects, like losing my hair and having to deal with everybody staring at me, knowing I was sick, there were all these other little ways it impacted me.  n“For example, my fitness level plummeted to the point where I’d have to take a rest when walking upstairs.  n“It was like being locked out of my own le. The chemo made me sicker than the cancer, in a way – but I knew it was the cure, and I had to keep going.”  nTop news stories from nBy May, Alexandra had stabilised enough to fly home, where she continued the rest of her chemotherapy at Manchester’s Christie Hospital, finishing in September .  nLater that month, she began immunotherapy, where the body’s own immune system is used to fight off cancerous cells.  nShe said: “The form I had targets a specic antigen in the leukemic cells, and uses my own immune system to kill the cancer. The drug I take is slowly infused over a -day period, so I carry around a pump that delivers a very small dose every minute.”  nNow in remission, Alexandra described how her journey has made her re-evaluate le, and find value in small things she may have once taken for granted.  nShe said: “I know now I wasn’t prioritising the right things, like chasing that deal at work, or buying the latest designer handbag. Those things do have a place in le, and they are important, but they aren’t the be all and end all.  n“Now, things like sitting around the table with my family laughing, or feeling the sun on my neck in the garden – those are the moments that mean the most.  n “For a long time, I put what happened in a box, only to be opened at certain times.  n“Now I’ve gone from being obsessed that nobody would know to look at me what I’ve been through, to being proud of my scars.  n“I’ve worked through that denial to find a place of peace. I’ve found my cause in le and am so proud to be a part of the cancer community.”  nUrging people to be mindful of the bodies, she said: “You know your body better than anybody, soyou feel something has changed – however minor – then ask your doctor for a blood test,” she said.  n“The likelihood is it will be something much more minor than leukaemia, butit is serious, it’s important to catch it early.

Alexandra Simpson has spoken out about her cancer battle to encourage others to be mindful of their bodies and to ask their doctors for a blood testthey are worried about any persistent symptoms. The -year-old from Llandudno, north Wales, is now in remission but, to lessen the risk of relapsing she is also having a stem cell transplant, having started a week of chemotherapy before having the procedure on February . Alexandra was  when she started suffering from fatigue and blamed her tiredness on her massive career move from London to Hong Kong.It was only when mysterious bruises popped up all over her body that Alexandra saw a doctor, reports WalesOnline. Still believing she had the world at her feet, Alexandra relived her horror when she received her blood test results the following day, saying: The doctor told me, ‘It’s not great news, todayapos. Alexandra had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia– cancer of the white blood cells- and her le was under threat so she needed treatment immediately. “The doctor told me he’d booked an appointment with a specialist for me at midday, then wished me luck,” she said. “I left in floods of tears. It was the middle of the night back home, and I knew I had to tell my mum, but I wanted to give her a few more minutes of not knowing her child had cancer.” “I wandered around the city, which was still quite unfamiliar to me, with no idea where to go,” she continued. “Eventually, I called home and Mum just kept saying, ‘No.’ “She saw me as this strong, healthy girl – it was shocking that cancer could suddenly hit me so aggressively. “You sometimes imagine how it may feel to be told you have cancer. On TV, people always seem to go numb – their hearing fades and the room around them swirls. I actually became hyper-aware. I still remember every word the doctor said to me, even now. “And while it’s been incredibly dficult – both for me and the people that have walked alongside me, seeing the horror of it all – I wouldn’t undo any of what I’ve been through.” She added: “Before, I think I was a little lost, almost sleepwalking through my twenties. But now, I’ve learnt to appreciate the little things – all those beautul moments you’d otherwise take for granted – and have a purpose and a passion in raising awareness of leukaemia.”  Doctors now believe that cancerous cells first started to invade Alexandra around January , when she had seen a GP in London because she was feeling rundown and had concernes she was anaemic. Working in a busy law firm, when she had noticed dark circles around her eyes, she assumed it was her fast-paced lestyle taking its toll rather than anything more sinister. She said: “I almost got used to having very little energy. I was working long hours and still managing to get myself to the gym three times a week, so I didn’t think it was anything overly worrying. “I blamed city le. I kept telling myself I’d be moving to Hong Kong soon and would feel better in a new place, with a bit of sunshine.” Alexandra’s doctor agreed she could be anaemic so  suggested she eat more red meat, or try an iron supplement to get her levels up. Assuming that would be the end of it, Alexandra turned her thoughts to her big move in early March . When her fatigue did not lt, she said: “I kept telling myself I’d just moved around the world and that feeling tired was natural – but I just wasn’t bouncing back from the jetlag. “As I became more comfortable with the new friends I was making out there, they remarked that I still looked pale, despite being in the sweltering heat every day.” Agreeing she could be anaemic, Alexandra’s doctor suggested she eat more red meat, or try an iron supplement to get her levels up.  ]] So, assuming that would be the end of it, she turned her thoughts to her big move in early March . When her fatigue did not lt, she said: “I kept telling myself I’d just moved around the world and that feeling tired was natural – but I just wasn’t bouncing back from the jetlag. “As I became more comfortable with the new friends I was making out there, they remarked that I still looked pale, despite being in the sweltering heat every day.” It was at the end of March when Alexandra banged her leg getting out of the bath one day and noticed a dramatic bruise forming within minutes that she thought something sinister was happening. She continued: “It kept developing, getting larger and larger, to the point where I was embarrassed to show it, as I could feel people staring, wondering what I’d done. “That seemed to almost trigger something in my body and, before long, clusters of bruises sprang up all over, with no explanation as to where they’d come from.” Alexandra looked up her symptoms online – and was shocked when almost all of them pointed towards leukaemia. So, using healthcare benefits she had through work, in April she booked a private appointment to see a doctor, who gave her a blood test with the results back the next morning. “I’d just sat down at my desk when my phone started to ring,” recalled Alexandra.  “I don’t think the receptionist even said hello. She just asked, ‘Where are you ’ and told me to come in right away. “The urgency in her voice was really worrying. When I got there, I was trying to analyse the doctor’s face. I knew that something serious was going on, as he couldn’t quite look at me. Then he told me I had leukaemia.” After wandering around the city and phoning her mum, feeling shaken and disorientated, Alexandra ed to her office and broke the news to her colleagues. “A colleague came over to askI was okay, as I was visibly upset. I think she assumed it’d be a break-up, or homesickness – a more normal problem for a -something who had moved across the world to be facing,” she said. “When I told her, I watched the colour drain from her face. She sat with me and we talked it all over then, bizarrely, I actually wanted to do a bit of work while I waited for my midday appointment. My colleagues thought I was bonkers, but I needed a distraction.” When Alexandra she saw the specialist later that day she realised how gravely ill she was. She recalled: “He told me I wasn’t well enough to fly back to the UK, and I needed to go straight to hospital. “I said, aposOkay, I’ll just go home to get some thingsapos. But he told me no, thatI somehow fell or knocked myself on the way, that my blood didn’t have enough platelets to form clots, so I could bleed to death.” She continued: He said, aposYou need to go to hospital right now, and just to warn you, you’ll be there for at least a monthapos. He was good at keeping me calm, but also making me realise how much danger I was in.  Admitted to hospital, Alexandra was given a bone marrow biopsy, which confirmed her official diagnosis. According to the charity Leukaemia Care, ALL is a rapidly progressing form of the disease, with almost  cases a year diagnosed in UK adults. Symptoms can include fatigue, fever, frequent infections, unusual bleeding, unexplained weight loss and small purple spots on the skin known as purpura. Three days after her diagnosis, Alexandra began the first of four gruelling cycles of chemotherapy. “It all happened so quickly, I didn’t really have time to consider what I was about to put my body through. I was just focused on getting the cancerous cells eliminated,” she said. When I look back at that part of everything, it doesn’t feel like my le. It’s like I’m looking at another girl thinking, aposPoor her, she’s been through so muchapos. “As well as the obvious side-effects, like losing my hair and having to deal with everybody staring at me, knowing I was sick, there were all these other little ways it impacted me. “For example, my fitness level plummeted to the point where I’d have to take a rest when walking upstairs. “It was like being locked out of my own le. The chemo made me sicker than the cancer, in a way – but I knew it was the cure, and I had to keep going.” "},{"url":null,"title":"man learn how walk again","story":"w.mantis  Man has to learn how to

But now, two years later, Chris Robinson learned to walk again, and is scaling  of Scotland’s highest peaks. Doctors feared he’d never walk again after his stroke in November , which they say may have been caused by anything from a cough to a violent sneeze. Chris, from Aberdeen, began to feel dizzy but initially attributed it to tiredness. But when he struggled to walk, and felt his right side go numb, he knew something was seriously wrong and contacted his GP. He was sent to hospital and then quickly admitted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary’s stroke unit. Doctors told him he had split a vein in his head, which would have been caused by anything from a cough to a violent sneeze. And they advised the business development manager that it might be a long time before he could walk again. But now Mr Robinson aims to defy the odds as he prepares to scale  of Scotland’s highest peaks. In doing so he hopes to raise £, for the Chest Heart and Stroke Scotland charity. His efforts will culminate in taking on Ben Nevis, two years on from having suffered his stroke. In just  months, Mr Robinson has gone from being unable to walk theof his hospital room to deciding to take on the mammoth challenge. And with his treasured blind dog, Rex, by his side, he plans to conquer his chosen  peaks during the next  months. That effort began on Sunday when he scaled Bennachie. He said: “I was overcome with determination to get back walking. “I never stopped to focus too much on what I couldn’t do.

Liam Grfin abused his helpless victim on “numerous” occasions over a -month period. Hamilton Sherf Court in Scotland heard on Friday how the assaults started when the girl was in Pand happened as often as “every two weeks”. The court was told the primary pupil didn’t realise she was being abused until her class started sex education lessons, reports the Daily Record. When he was arrested, -year-old Grfin told cops: I was studying to be a doctor, but I f***ed up everything. Court heard the young victim had kept quiet for months, but finally blurted out what had happened during an argument with her sister. Medical student Grfin, of Hamilton, admitted abusing the girl between August  and August last year. Prosecuting, Mairi-Clare McMillan told the court: “She said he had subjected her to numerous episodes of sexual abuse, sometimes as often as every two weeks. “This occurred when she visited his home and it was always in his bedroom when they were alone. If another girl was there Grfin would send her downstairs on some pretence. “The girl said she didn’t realise at first that what he did was wrong, but this changed through her getting sex education at school.” After assaulting her on the final occasion Grfin said “bye” to his victim and left the house to visit his girlfriend – she has now distanced herself from him, changing her relationship status online and deleting all pictures of Grfin from her profile.

Chaneen Saliee has been tandem feeding since her second baby Ocean was born  months ago. At the time first-born daughter Jasmine was  months old and she feels that feeding them together has created a magical bond for her children.Chaneen told the : A huge benefit of tandem feeding is that the bond the girls developed – it was almost magical.They would hold hands and cuddle each other.I had heard of all these stories about the older sibling feeling left out, lashing out, being really jealous or extra clingy. We didn’t experience any of this. As well as lowering her own and the girlsapos risks of developing breast cancer, breastfeeding has helped Chaneen in many aspects of her le. She shares her experience with other new mums and has created a business designing and selling clothes that women can easily feed their children in.  Chaneen hopes they encourage women to be confident when breastfeeding and have the support and privacy they need in the early weeks. She added: I do not believe that mothers should have to cover up but in those early days most mothers want to – and the extra support and privacy helps them to feed more confidently wherever they are.

Paula, , from Bolton, Greater Manchester, was left with a feeling in her throat like Iaposve been smothered and with anxiety levels through the roof after receiving her first Universal Credit payment - and with it a major shock. And the situation is one which Jobcentre worker Carmel admits is crazy - and always happening. BBCaposs three-part documentary Universal Credit: Inside the Welfare State tonight focused on Bolton Jobcentre, one of the busiest in the North West, where  people move onto Universal Credit every month. Having recently moved in with her partner Aaron, the change of circumstances means Paula has to move onto Universal Credit from Job Seekers Allowance and Housing Benefit. She had been receiving £ a fortnight from JSA and Child Credit, but Universal Credit is paid a month in arrears - and she has no savings to see her through the five-week wait for the first payment. Hoping the wait doesnapost mess us up as it has done with a lot of people sheaposs known, she tells the cameras: A lot of people have killed themselves over it, havenapost they  Needing to pay for a school unorm for daughter Lexi, work coach Lorraine offers her an advance - essentially a Universal Credit loan - of £, to get her through. This will have to be paid back at £ a month, over  months. Paula is shown to be pleased with this, calling it common sense which puts her mind at rest. But she has no idea - and is not warned - about the reality of this aposadvanceapos, and how it will plunge her into debt from which she will struggle to recover. She tells the camera her family will be able to treat ourselves rather than wondering how we are going to live day to day. And three weeks on, Paula has been allowed a total of £, in advances.  She reveals she has spent it on bills, food, and clothing along with new footwear for herself, a haircut and new phone - decisions she will come to regret - and says itaposs been brilliant. With just seven days to wait until the first Universal Credit payment, sheaposs found itaposs not been too bad. She tells the cameras itaposs right that we treat ourselves as we werenapost born with a silver spoon in our f***ing a***s.  But a major shock is just round the corner for Paula as she gets through the five week wait only to find £. is deducted from her monthly Universal Credit payment. This leaves her with £ for the month - far less than she was expecting - which is roughly £ a day for herself, her partner Aaron, and daughter Lexi, to pay rent, food, bills - everything. She had been under the impression she would only see £ a month deducted to repay the advance - and had no idea about the other deductions.  And itaposs been taking its toll on mumaposs health. Itaposs a lot to take off somebody, she says.  £ for a family. Itaposs ridiculous. My stress levels have been through the roof. Iaposve been really anxious. I have a feeling in my throat like Iaposve been smothered. She says she wishes the Jobcentre in Bolton had not offered her so much money. Iaposve made a mistake, she says. It was a f***ing mistake which I will never do again. If I had my way Iaposd come off this s**t now. Thereaposs too much temptation now. Thataposs what got it with me. I got too tempted and went giddy, went wild. Lesson learnt.  Returning to the Jobcentre, she brings a sick note as her anxiety and stress reach unbearable levels. But sheaposs surprised to find she cannot claim Disability Living Allowance - DSA - as that benefit is part of the old welfare regime from which she has now switched. She has her next deduction deferred - but is warned the debt wonapost go away. Jobcentre worker Carmel admits this situation is happening all the time.If the advances are available, she tells the cameras, and they are taking them, most customers are coming back with problems about paying them back. She adds: Itaposs crazy really that so much can be offered. Would she have got that advance knowing what debt itaposs put her in  Probably not. Would she have had that haircut or shoes  Probably not. Paula visits a debt councillor and admits she is now in debt up to her eyeballs, relying on foodbanks and warding off baillfs.  Four weeks later, she tells the cameras September has been absolute hell and messed us up to be honest. It can hit you like a ton of bricks. She adds: F***ing s*****st thing about Universal Credit is paying back the debt. I wouldnapost know where to start with getting a job.

Lee Solway - who hosts the Realm of the Supernatural with friend aposFinchyapos McFinch - said his co-host, along with an elderly couple, spotted the unsettling beast darting across the A recently. He is now hoping more witnesses come forward as the pair attempt the impossible - proving the existence of a seemingly supernatural creature.Referring to Finchyaposs account of the sighting, Lee, from Grimsby, North East Lincolnshire, said he saw a black mass about ft tall, reports HullLive.He thought it was a ghost at first, he explained. He could see it had a humanoid form but it was darker than night and it just moved across the road. We went back the next day and there was a hole in the bottom of the hedgerow so something could have crossed there. Soon after, Finchy also found and photographed what appear to be two severed aposdeer legsapos lying in the middle of the road nearby. I just think thataposs a little bit strange, Lee said. The picture quality isnapost great as it was taken from inside the car because he was a bit creeped out. You tell people about it and they say itaposs just poachers, and yes that does go on but why would a poacher stop on the A to butcher a deer carcass   Lee and Finchy will be appearing at the Research and Witness Convention  at Princes Quay Shopping Centre in Kingston upon Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, from February  to March , to discuss some of the areaaposs most infamous cases. We want to seethere are other witnesses who could come forward, said Lee. The most famous tale of Hull and East Yorkshire folklore is the aposOld Stinkerapos, a half-man half-dog creature, mostly seen stalking the area around Barmston Drain, near Beverley. It was once reportedly seen eating a dog before being spooked by the onlookers and jumping over an ft fence with the poor dog still in its mouth. But that is far from the only strange sighting reported in the region. South of the river thereaposs been quite a few sightings of a half-deer, half-man creature very similar to the apospucaapos in Celtic folklore, Lee said. You also get Bigfoot sightings that run up and down the A. He said he and his co-host started the podcast after having dferent encounters with a shadow man and a UFO.Weaposd listened to other podcasts by people who hadnapost experienced this stuff and we had, so we just did it, he said. Their podcast is available on streaming sites including iTunes and Spoty and each episode gets thousand of hits, often heard by listeners as far afield as the US and Australia. Lee said his opinions on the supernatural are often met with scepticism, but he still believes there are more people out there yet to share their experiences. One of my mates was talking about this dog-man sighting and this guy suddenly got interested, he said.  He normally poo-poos this sort of thing this guy, who was in his s, but he asked what he was talking about and he told him and he said, aposWell thataposs what I ran over all them years ago.apos He said it had been a foggy morning driving his Mini, and he hit something crossing the road and it spun the Mini  degrees. He saw an animal lying there and it sprung up and turned round, with yellow eyes and the hind legs of a dog, and it just bounded off. And he had carried that with him for  years, so there are people out there. Now he is asking others to come forward to share there experiences, anonymouslyneed be, for them to discuss at the upcoming convention.

The monarch and her palace aides reportedly concluded that the word aposroyalapos must be removed from the Duke and Duchess of Sussexaposs branding. The pair spent thousands on setting up a aposSussex Royalapos website and attempting to register the brand as a trademark across the world. However, their plan is now said to be in tatters after the Queen refused to let them use the aposroyalapos badge as a result of aposMegxitapos. Harry and Meghan tried to register the Sussex Royal brand on a range of items, including stationary books, clothing and more. A Royal source said: As The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are stepping back as senior Members of the Royal Family and will work towards financial independence, use of the word ‘Royal’, in this context, needed to be reviewed.Discussions are still ongoing. As part of the process to transition The Duke and Duchess of Sussex into their new chapter -  planning has been well underway around the launch of their new non profit organisation.Details will be shared in due course.”  The couple now face the daunting prospect of having to come up with a new brand, the Daily Mail reports. The newspaper understands that the aposfine detailapos of the aposre-brandapos is still being worked out. The couple have agreed to avoid using the aposSussex Royalapos name in their new commercial ventures, it is claimed.

He said: aposaposMy we is a bit battered and has two black eyes, a bump on the head and bruising to her chest but apart from that we escaped unscathed. aposaposWe were driving along and out of the corner of my eye I saw the tree coming down. The car was on Autopilot and the emergency braking kicked in.  aposaposIt was chaos with smoke coming from the car and people shouting to get out.

I canapost believe weaposre all still alive. Elon Musk has done us proud.aposapos Autopilot is an advanced driver assistance system that enhances safety behind the wheel.  external cameras, a radar,  ultrasonic sensors and a powerful onboard computer provide an additional layer of safety to guide drivers on their journey.  Autopilot uses these features to see and sense the environment around the car. This robust sensor and camera suite provides drivers with an awareness of their surroundings that a driver alone would not otherwise have. A powerful onboard computer processes these inputs in a matter of milliseconds to help make your driving safer and less stressful. Active safety features made possible by Teslaaposs Autopilot hardware and software system include Automatic Emergency Braking which detects cars or obstacles that the car may impact and applies the brakes accordingly. Speaking about the other car, Laurence, from Brentwood, Essex, said: aposaposIn an amazing one a million chance another Tesla Model X car was also hit on the other side of the tree. The police have told me that all three are fine so eight lives have quite literally saved due to this amazing car.aposapos Construction company director Josh Whitelock, , from Wimborne, was driving the other Tesla with his girlfriend, Kitty McConnell and her mum, Julia as passengers when the tree came down.  aposaposI was on Autopilot driving home when I saw a flash from the power line which lit up the tree as it fell. We stopped suddenly. There was a loud crack and then the sound of metal on metal. aposaposI was expecting to turn around and see my girlfriend and her mother impaled by branches but incredibly that wasnapost the case. They were both ok apart from a bit of whiplash. It was a miracle we all survived. aposaposI helped get them both out of the car and then checked on the other driver on the other side of the tree. When I saw the open Falcon door I couldnapost believe it.  aposaposWe were just in pure shock.

Residents in flood-hit areas - thanks to Storm Dennis - have been urged to leave their homes with worse deluges moving in as a monthaposs rain is set to fall in one day. With Britain still struggling in the aftermath of two back-to-back named storms, more weather warnings for rain remain in place until Saturday, with Met Office forecaster Simon Partridge admitting the outlook does not look good. Speaking to the , he said while there is no intention of officially naming Storm Ellen so quickly after Dennis and Ciara obviously, that may change over the next few days. Asked about reports where of heavy snow set to lash the country before the end of the month, Mr Partridge said the unsettled nature of what is to come, often means it will be slightly milder - meaning a decent covering of snow is unlikely anytime soon. The weather could be fairly unsettled, to be fair, over the next few days or so, he continued. Obviously, there will be more snow over high grounds - itaposs February after all. But there isnapost anything on the horizon relating to heavy snow, that Iaposm aware of, he added.  The Met Office has issued a yellow rain warning in north-west England, as well as part of north and south Wales from pm on Wednesday until pm on Thursday - which could lead to further flooding. On Friday, persistent rain is expected between midday on Saturday and am on Sunday in Yorkshire, particularly around Leeds, York and Sheffield. Referring to the rain warnings in place for the next four days straight, Mr Partridge said the UK is still staying wet and windy, adding Wednesday will be another pretty wet day and: Itaposs not looking good, Iaposm afraid.  The Met Officeaposs long range weather forecast, from Sunday, states: Unsettled and often windy conditions are expected to continue with areas of rain moving east across the UK interspersed with brighter, showery interludes. Rain is likely to be heaviest across western and northwestern areas, especially over the hills, with the best of any more prolonged drier interludes in the south and east. Hail and thunder are also possible in the showery interludes with snow at times over northern hills. Temperatures will generally be around average, but above in the south. Some brief quieter, colder spells are also possible later in the period, especially in southern and eastern areas, these bringing some overnight frost and patchy fog in places.  Elsewhere will continue to see spells of wet and windy weather. Ministers have, meanwhile, unveiled measures to help the flood-hit, including affected households being able to apply for up to £, while homes and firms “signicantly affected” can get  per cent council tax and rates relief for at least three months.  UK  day weather forecast Today: Wintry showers in the far north dying out, then dry and bright for a time, before cloud thickens bringing outbreaks of rain and strong winds. Rain becoming heavy and persistent over hills of Wales and north-west England later. Tonight: South-eastern areas cloudy with some rain or drizzle, but a band of heavier rain across northwestern areas moving slowly south-east into central parts followed by colder, showery conditions.

In the programme he said: I’m sure the captain was trying to ditch the aircraft in as far south, remote location as possible, and leave as little wreckage as possible that would sink. “If I’m wrong then it probably means the aircraft has been taken by aliens or is sitting in a hangar somewhere in Kazakhstan.

We still wanted to implement our style of game but it just wasn’t to be on the night.“We still tried to find an opening but we were just lacking a little bit in the final third.”One way in which playing for United is dferent than being at Hamilton, though, is the weight of expectation.More accustomed to fighting at the bottom end of the table, Bingham believes battling for the Championship title is a dferent challenge but that it requires similar qualities.Recent slump in form is no huge cause for concern for league leaders Dundee United\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp united-need-not-fret-over-worst-form-of-season embed # secretStwoJgp\" data-secret\"StwoJgp\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"“It’s a little bit dferent compared to trying to stay up, it’s a dferent kind of mindset you need.“In terms of winning, you still need a mindset to be consistent and there’s a reason why we’re up there and first by  points because we’ve been consistent throughout the season.“We can’t drop that standard evenwe’re playing teams near the bottom, it doesn’t really matter, you still need to be on top of your game. vw, px\"  “It’s a great bunch of lads so we’re just going to keep digging and driving to get that promotion.”The Terrors’ focus now turns to Friday’s visit of Inverness to Tannadice and Bingham is ready to go.“It’s a big club and I was pleased to see the turnout from the away fans on Friday. This week at home is going to be an even bigger turnout for us for a big game.“It’s game we want to get three points from and definitely do one on Inverness.

win on their way to the Championship title in  thanks to a Ryan Conroy penalty – stretching back over the last decade.However, even from the last meeting in September, there could be considerable changes to the way James McPake sets his side out as he plots a way to double that win rate.The clash on a Friday night on TV saw Jordan McGhee net his first goal for the Dark Blues with a fine header after Queens striker Jack Hamilton had beaten his namesake in the Dundee goal early on.That was a disappointing night for the Dens gaffer as his side struggled to find their feet in the Championship.And he’ll be hoping this version of the Dark Blues can show there’s been some good work done in the time since.After another poor spell at the start of the year, Dundee have put together two positive displays to earn a point at Mortonand win convincingly at home to Partick Thistle last time out.Should boss James decide to stick with the same line-up and -- formation, there will only be four names remaining on the team sheet from the autumn.Of the team that saw off the Jags last time out, only Jordon Forster, Declan McDaid, Graham Dorrans and Kane Hemmings featured in the last trip down to Dumfries.McGhee grabbed the goal that day but he and Cammy Kerr are both recovering from surgery and Saturday may come too soon for them.And with the three-man defence working so well with Christophe Berra added in against Thistle, the Dens gaffer might be tempted to stick rather than twist.That’s likely to see Josh Meekings retain his place also with McDaid filling in at left wing-back and Christie Elliott on the right.Of the midfield three, Dorrans is a stick-on to start, barring any injury problems, while Shaun Byrne has been impressing in training in recent weeks and showed up well against the Jags.The big decision for James is who to put in the place of Ross Callachan.The on-loan midfielder had injected dynamism to the middle of the park and was unlike anything  in the squad.That could see Paul McGowan drop back to a deeper role after stepping in as a makesht striker last week.And Callachan’s energy could be replaced by fit-again Andrew Nelson after he ed from surgery to his hand for the closing stages last time out.Another certainty, barring injury, is Kane Hemmings as he targets moving his goal tally into double figures for the season. vw, px\"  The Doonhamers will have a dferent look about them as well with three key players having left in the winter window.On-loan goalie Robby McCrorie was recalled by Rangers to then send him out to Livingston and that saw the Lions send Ross Stewart Queens way.| https:t.co htWpFhTvHmdash Queen of the SouthJanuary , Centre-back Darren Brownlie made the switch to Partick while creator Faissal El Bakhtaoui headed off to Morocco.Dundee’s recent record on astroturf makes pleasant reading.They are unbeaten in the last five on the surface, winning three times – -

in their own building on Saturday night and collected two crucial points in their play-off push.That key win has put Dundee back within a point of Glasgow Clan and Manchester Storm, who still occupy the seventh and eighth play-off places.Speaking after his side’s big win over Sheffield, Stars head coach Omar Pacha said: “I am really happy for them, the boys were dialled in from the drop of the puck after a great week of practice.“The first five minutes, I think that is the best start we have had all year and I thought we were unlucky not to get something a bit earlier in that period.“But as the game went on we built a bit of confidence in our game and we got the scoring we needed at crucial times with powerplay goals.“The big shorthanded goal was probably the big dference.”Stars put Steelers keeper, Tomas Duba, under pressure after just seconds of play but no early goals were given up by the home side.However, Aaron Fox’s men were handed the first powerplay when Dundee’s Matt Carter was punished for a hooking foul in the sixth minute.That allowed Marc-Olivier Vallerand to fire Sheffield into the lead.The next scoring opportunity fell to the Steelers’ Tanner Eberle, as he created his own breakaway but Stars goalie, Alex Leclerc, stood up to the challenge.Pacha’s men tied the game up on  minutes as captain Matt Marquardt beat Duba low to his right.In the second period, Stars came out with a good tempo and quickly got themselves ahead as Egils Kalns turned Jordan Cownie’s pass in after  minutes.Dundee then had to defend for a period of time as Sheffield came looking for an equaliser but the Scottish side survived the waves of attack before doubling their lead.The Stars were a man down as Jagger Dirk was in the sin bin for slashing but Dufour and Beauregard combined inside the th minute to make it -, as Beauregard deflected the puck past Duba.There had been a physical aspect to the match all night and, after a clean hit by Dundee blueliner Shawn Boutin on Brendan Connolly, the Steelers centerman retaliated with a late one after the whistle on Boutin to earn a two-minute roughing minor.Stars then went on the powerplay in the th minute and just five seconds into their man advantage, Carter tapped in the rebound for the Tayside team’s fourth of the night.The visitors started and ended the middle period on a high but they needed a big third period to fend off a comeback from the league leaders.Fox’s side looked like they would maybe get something but Dundee scrambled the danger clear before going back on the powerplay, as a flurry of fouls meant Sheffield would go down to three skaters.Colton Kroeker finished off Carter’s square pass on  minutes to put Stars - in front.Anthony DeLuca did win a penalty shot in the th minute but his effort went wide of the target.Troncinsky pulled one back for the Yorkshire outfit to reduce the deficit to - inside the final two minutes but that would be the final score.With a win in their only game of the weekend, the Stars now have a week to prepare for their next game against their arch enemies Fe Flyers at the Dundee Ice Arena next Saturday."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/Ella-Phillips-and-great-granddaughter-Megan-423x564.jpg ","title":"four generations","story":"A Dundee care home resident is celebrating after meeting the fourth generation of her family.The young and oldest members of the family met at Pitkerro Care Centre recently when resident Ella Phillips, , first held her first great granddaughter Megan, who was born on October  last year.Ella met the beautul baby girl at the centre after new grandmotherand granddaughter and new mother Susan took her along for a visit.Home manager Prisca Katsande said: “Pitkerro Care Centre was thrilled to host the four generations of women to welcome Megan into the Phillips family.“It was a true delight to witness resident Ella’s first meeting with her new great grandchild on our premises and we are sending our very best wishes to all of the family at this exciting time.“Watching Ella’s face light up with such adoration upon seeing the new born baby is a moment that I will never forget.”Linda said: “We are all overwhelmed with emotion as we welcome my first grandchild and my mother’s first great grandchild into the world.“A huge thank you to Pitkerro Care Centre for their continued support.“It remains clear to us that their delivery of high quality care is not limited to residents, but also extends to ensuring that relatives’ happiness and wellbeing is a high priority.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/5e469273da7011.46985477-scaled.jpg ","title":"head coach at lochee amateurs boxing club says young pair can go down same path as rising star sam hickey","story":"Lochee Amateur Boxing Club’s Jerry Howett believes two of his brightest talents can follow in the footsteps of rising star Sam Hickey.Head coach Howett has high hopes for his son Brendan and Luca Flynn and thinks they have just as much potential as former Lochee ABC boxer Hickey – now training with Team Scotland in Glasgow.Both have enjoyed winning starts to the year with Howettearning gold at the Northern District Open Championships  days ago.  Flynnregistered a silver at the same event, following up from his gold at the Scottish Intermediate Championships.And Howett, who comes from a boxing family entrenched in the Lochee community, is delighted with how the pair are progressing.He said: “Luca did well to win at the intermediate Scottish Championships. He had to fight three times, beating last year’s Scottish champion in the semis.“He lost to him in the final of the Northern District Championships but a silver from that is still very good.“He was a bit disappointed but that’s the way it goes sometimes.“Brendan did really well to win the Northern District.

He could win the Scottish Open Championships at the end of the month.“Luca’s dedication is good and Brendan will get up in the morning to go running and look after his diet.“Brendan’s in for the Senior Open Championships in March, which is a big one because it counts towards being picked for the Commonwealth Games squad in .“He went last year and did well in his first season as a senior so he’s hoping to go one better.“We’ve had Sam, who’s full-time with Boxing Scotland and has went on to earn European medals and win the British Championships, so he’s progressing well.“It’s good to see them taking their chances and there’s more talent to come – Ali Mahmood, Logan Howett and Lennon Mitchell for example. vw, px\"  “Sam is travelling all over now. He’s had assessments with the British squad as well but not quite got in there. Even young Luca is working his way through the Boxing Scotland system.

It’s a good place for the kids to come up and get involved, you try to give everyone a chance.“We had a young boy who came up with really severe autism, he was just  and came up on his own but he’s was here for a couple of years now and it helped him loads.“Sometimes I felt like walking away because it’s tough and a big commitment but I love it too much.“It started up again with my brother Andy and I running it, travelling all over Scotland and the UK to tournaments just to get the boys fights.

For previous Aberdeen managers and future Aberdeen managers that importance to win the Scottish Cup will always be there.“Since day one we’ve wanted to bring cups back here and nothing has changed about that ambition.”Since the - draw between the Dons and Killie at Pittodrie  days ago, the mood of the Red Army has changed.That stalemate was the fth successive game in which Aberdeen had failed to score, but since then they have beaten Hamilton - and lost - to Celtic.McInnes understood the frustration about a lack of creativity and said: “Where we’ve let ourselves down is a failure to break teams down, particularly at Pittodrie when teams have come and sat in.“Dumbarton, Motherwell, St Johnstone, Kilmarnock and St Mirren away from home are games where we’ve had the majority of possession.“Against Hamilton we had more possession, but it was more equal and it was more equal against Celtic.“When that happens and possession is more equal it suggests the opposition are attacking more, which means we’ve got more space to work in.“We were really guilty for a few games of not doing enough with our possession and that’s where the frustration comes in for everybody – myself, players, supporters and the players then feel it more when it goes on and on and becomes the main talking point.“Thankfully we’ve scored four goals in the last two games and could have scored more.“I do feel playing the types of opponents we’ve played has allowed that to happen.”Meanwhile, Mikey Devlin mayafter a groin injury ruled him out of Sunday’s defeat."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road .

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"kidney-research-uk-takes-another-tour-o-borders","story":"BORDERS cycling event company, Hillside Outside, have announced

commitment to upgrade an informal path at new housing in Musselburgh as part of its planning consent discharged.One mother who attended a meeting of the planning committee said her family moved into the new housing after she was told the path would be created, offering a safe route to school for her children.However, lawyer Alasdair Sutherland, who represented Taylor Wimpey at the meeting, said it had come to light the developers did not own the land the path was on.He argued that without ownership of the land, the council could not enforce the condition and make the developers upgrade the path.The path, known locally as The Drt, runs from the new housing at Pinkie Mains down to the railway bridge and links Musselburgh to Wallyford Railway Station and Wallyford Primary School.Kaye Nicoll told the committee that she currently has to cross  roads to get her daughter to school after moving onto the new estate two years ago.She said: ldquoWe were delighted when Taylor Wimpey told us there was going to be a path almost from the back of our house.ldquoI think every child should walk to school and my daughter is now nine and desperate to walk on her own.ldquoI cannot allow her to cross all those roads on her own, some of them are quite dangerous for a nine-year-old.The committee was told that Taylor Wimpey was granted planning permission to build  houses and  flats at Pinkie Mains in March  and one of the conditions attached was that The Drt ldquoshall be constructed to an adoptable standard, including street lighting, along the extent of it between Pinkie Terrace and the East Coast Main Line under bridge.It also called for new connections to be added from two cul-de-sacs in the development.An application to have the condition discharged was made after East Lothian Council planning officers threatened to take enforcement action over the firmrsquos failure to construct the path.Councillor Hampshire said: ldquoI am extremely disappointed a company like Taylor Wimpey have taken a decision not to honour a condition proposed by this planning committee.ldquoThey actually used this as a way to sell properties to people this is not an honourable thing to do.Councillor Colin McGinn said: ldquoSurely the developer would look at the conditions and make sure they could meet them before starting to build because in this case it seems they have just built and built and then looked at the conditions.Keith Dingwall, head of planning, told the committee that upgrading the path would cost pound,.Councillor Kenny McLeod pointed out the cost was equivalent to the price of one of the two or three bedroom houses built on the estate.And ward councillor Andrew Forrest said he had been at the original planning committee meeting which approved the housing plans.He said: ldquoI am disappointed by the attitude of Taylor Wimpey. They waxed lyrical about what this development would do for the area and my understanding was they were going to develop that path.The committee voted unanimously to reject the application to discharge the condition.Taylor Wimpey described the decision as disappointing, saying it would now consider its next move.Pauline Mills, land  planning director for Taylor Wimpey East Scotland, said: ldquoThis condition was added to the consent without any prior engagement with us, which isunusual.ldquoWe have always been aware of the planning condition to provide upgrades to the path known locally as The Drt and, from a very early stage following the issue of the planning consent for ourdevelopment in Musselburgh, we have attempted to engage with East Lothian Council about thevalidity of this condition.ldquoThe path is located on land that we do not own and therefore have no control over, and it is outwith the boundary of the development.ldquoWe have therefore been of the view since it was imposedthat it is not valid as part of the consent and have made the council aware of that view.ldquoWe have met to discuss this matter fully with the council in order to find an alternative solution andremain committed to do so."},{"url":null,"title":"senseless-vandals-hurl-bottles-nursery-window","story":"On the morning of Monday, January , staff at the East Loan campus of Preston Tower Primary School discovered that a beer bottle had been thrown through the window of the nursery classroom.The children, aged two to four, had to be kept in one half of the room while the glass was cleaned up and the area was made safe.

After the session, as the children were heading for lunch, a girl from the class came up and said: ldquoI think the moral in that tale is that we should be kind, but that itrsquos often not easy to do.It was a traditional tale in which the tables are turned on a selfish rich man who had shown no compassion, but then hoped for kindness when he was the one in need. In the brief discussion with this young person, we agreed that itrsquos easier to show kindness to someone who we believe truly deserves it.She told me: ldquoI think the woman in the story did the right thing butIrsquom being honest,it had been me I donrsquot knowIrsquod have been able to be kind like her, because Irsquod have wanted revenge. Thatrsquos the problem, I think, we always think about revenge first. It can make us feel better for a short while but really makes things worse, well at least not better anyway. I try to be kind, sometimes it isnrsquot easy, but I try. Kindness is like a seed we have to plant.I shouldnrsquot have been bowled over by this, for I know a -year-old can have wisdom that many so called grown-ups have forgotten. But I was deeply impressed by her reflection on the storyrsquos message, and her honesty and integrity.This conversation also revealed the power of stories to raise moral dilemmas and human issues without finger pointing or being preachy.And she is right, it can often be very dficult to be kind. The world seems so full of stress, selfishness, anger and intolerance that there seems little space for kindness, except towards those we love and care about. On top of that, it seems increasingly dficult to survive, keep a roof above our heads and pay the bills. Kindness begins at home and often there is little energy, emotion or resources left to think or care about others we arenrsquot responsible for.There can even be a real fear thatwe show lsquotoo muchrsquo kindness we risk becoming a doormat, being used or treated unfairly. We can sometimes watch a child being kind to another and it not being reciprocated, and the temptation then is to suggest kindness isnrsquot shown next time.ldquoWe need to teach people a lesson, is often the mantra which derails our instinct to be kind another way of saying we want revenge. And letrsquos be honest: cruel, uncaring and selfish people can take advantage of someonersquos kindness and revenge does often make us feel better, in the short term anyway.But is the answer to allow unkind behaviour to frame the way we want to live and be treated  Do we respond to unkindness with more unkindness in   So consequently, cruelty with more cruelty, intolerance with more intolerance, selfishness with yet more selfishness  Doesnrsquot this mean that we allow lsquothe lessonrsquo to be that kindness doesnrsquot pay  As Gandhi is famously reported to have said: ldquoAn eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.The truth is, kindness is not weakness but strength. It often isnrsquot easy and takes great courage. It doesnrsquot mean that people should not face consequences for their actions, or that people should be asked to forgive the unforgivable. But it does mean not allowing the unkindness of others to define how we are. We should not allow such acts to clip our butterfly wings.What do I mean by this  There is a theory called the lsquobutterfly effectrsquo. In this theory, it is said that the flapping of a butterflyrsquos wings could cause a chain reaction in which a hurricane could be caused on the other side of the planet. It is not meant to be taken literally, but to show that a very small act, although seemingly insignicant in itself, can have huge, unforeseen repercussions.In this way, kindness is a butterfly. Small acts of kindness may have a huge effect that touches people beyond the knowledge of the person who displayed the kindness. Acts of cruelty and hate also have the same power but all the more reason to flutter the wings of kindness so the wind more likely blows in the right direction.In this way, our behaviour is a butterfly. The way we flap its wings can have huge unforeseeable consequences, either for good or bad, both for ourselves and others. When we are kind, we actually makes ourselves happier too.So to make a real dference, we need only do tiny acts that are easily within our power, and as often as we can. A smile, a moment you truly listen to someone, a helping hand, holding the door open, trying to understand how someone feels, making a cup of tea, not meeting anger with anger, trying not to gain revenge but a change of heart and so on.This is what will truly make up the index of a healthy and happy society. And all of us can be players in this, and beneficiaries of our own kindness.David W Orr, a professor of environmental studies and politics, has said: ldquoThe plain fact is that the planet does not need more successful people. But it does desperately need more peacemakers, healers, restorers, storytellers and lovers of every kind.Great words, but that -year-old school girl already got this.

However, NHS Lothian will work closely with the management going forward to ensure their budget is managed more effectively, and that the issues at hand are adequately addressed.Members of Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council have also told health bosses that the proposed boundary expansion would be ldquoa step in the wrong direction.The group contacted the Primary Care Contractor Organisation, stressing that it was ldquoabsolutely opposed to any change in the boundary area.Members also called for a meeting with health bosses, which took place recently at the practice and involved: Irene Tait, community council chairperson Margaret Stewart, community council secretary Holly Kilday, a community council member Dr Richard Fairclough and Dr Joana Stenke of Riverside Medical Practice ward councillors Stuart Currie and Katie Mackie Iain Gorman, East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnershiprsquos head of operations and Councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell, chairperson of East Lothian Integration Joint Board.The community councillors highlighted complaints they had received from members of the community, including:A statement issued by the community council following the discussion said: ldquoWe wondered why on earth the practice would want to take on more of a workload when clearly they are not coping with what they have to deal with at present.ldquoThe practice acknowledged the fact that they had undergone many changes in the last few years, not least the fact that they are on their third telephone system.ldquoThe practice also stated they will need to step up to the mark with a communication plan, making sure that everyone in our community is aware of how the practice is working and what options are available to them.ldquoThe expectation from the public is,they phone for a doctorsrsquo appointment, they will see a doctor and this is not always going to be the case.ldquoWhen you call you will be given two options, same day or non-urgent, and this will enable the staff to put you on to the right person who can help and this could be NHS , paramedics, physio, mental health or occupational therapistor alternatively, a doctornecessary on the same day.Wrong direction ldquoWe discussed the boundaries and made them aware that we felt that to take on Blindwells would be a step in the wrong direction.ldquoThe meeting was quite positive and hopefully, moving forward, we will keep in touch with the practice and they with us so that everyone is kept informed.Dr Stenke and Dr Fairclough issued a joint statement, saying: ldquoWe were delighted to meet with the Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council representatives and local councillors. We felt it was a really positive opportunity to discuss many of the changes that have happened in Musselburgh over the last few years to stabilise and develop primary care services.ldquoIt is really important for us at Riverside to understand the views of the community we serve, which can be hugely supportive in improving services. For example, feedback on our old phone system helped us to understand the issues that our patients were experiencing and led to us developing a new telephone system that was more suitable for our patientsrsquo needs as well as those of the practice.ldquoRiverside, along with other practices in the county, are collaborating with and supporting East Lothianrsquos Health and Social Care Partnershiprsquos plan to grow health services to meet the needs of a growing population.ldquoWe remain keen to improve our engagement and communication with the local community, and the meeting was a positive step to build links with local groups.ldquoWe are grateful to the community council representatives and local councillors for taking the time to visit us at Riverside Medical Practice and we look forward to developing a closer and collaborative relationship with them.An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: ldquoWe thought the meeting with Riverside and the community council was very positive. We were impressed by Riversidersquos commitment to engaging with the community and communicating developments. We look forward to supporting them in any way that we can.Councillor Mackie added: ldquoIt was a helpful meeting with community stakeholders and local GPs.

When the fire effect is switched on, it gives an impressive imitation of a real one.Our small terraced house once had a real fire place, of course, but like so many it was modernised before I moved in, and it was filled in and central heating installed.Yet I am old enough to have lived all my childhood in the lsquos and lsquos without experiencing central heating! It did exist, of course, just not in the houses I lived in as a child!One memory I have is of arriving home from school on a cold winterrsquos afternoon and seeing the smoke coming from the chimney of the church house we lived in at the east end of the Pans. My father had lit the fire early and I still remember its welcoming warmth, and the way it crackled and danced as it defrosted my face and hands. Me and my brothers sat by it, jostling for the best space.Donrsquot get me wrong, Irsquom not complaining about central heating! I know Irsquom lucky to have a warm house and never take it for granted. We donrsquot use the lsquofirersquo for heat, that would be too expensive. But we switch it on for atmosphere. And the effect on the younger kids has been immediate. They sit by it, lie on blankets by it reading and playing and telling stories. I forget that they have little personal experience of having a hearth, even an articial one. The novelty will wane, perhaps, but I hope the cosy pleasure of it wonrsquot.Itrsquos not just the kids, as my we and I love sitting by it in the evening. Wersquove even moved some of the furniture, so this pretend but convincing fireplace, rather than the telly, has become the main focal point of the living room.You could say Irsquom easily pleased, and I suppose thatrsquos true. But our friends have commented on it too, one saying ldquoit really has given your house a dferent atmosphere as he sat by it with the wind howling outside.The hearth has traditionally been the soul of a house. The family would sit by it, soak in the warmth and watch the flames, while telling stories and talking. It was a draw for social communion. Visitors would be welcomed with a place by it and most of the cooking would have taken place there too. The old saying ldquolang may yer lums reekindicated the importance of a lit hearth as a symbol of wellbeing and good fortune.No wonder so many traditions and ceremonies were centred around the hearth. People used to leave objects buried within or near it. There were ious reasons for this: to capture bad spirits that may come down the chimney, for good luck or to deflect a witchrsquos spell. The hearth was seen as a kind of spiritual portal, to be defended and made safe, not just physically.The hearth was also a focus of many ceremonies that marked the changing seasons. The Celtic calendar is full of such events, Imbolc being the most recent. And of course there were the daily rituals of banking up the fire at night, and reviving it in the morning, and keeping it going. All these simple tasks are now fast fading into folk memory.Today, screens are more likely to be the focal point of our homes. Itrsquos kind of unavoidable, of course, and I claim no moral high ground of this issue. But the truth is they drug our senses and dull our conviviality, and, like many parents, we have tried to limit their use in our house. It has felt like a losing battle with my children who, I understand, live in a very dferent childhood to mine. And I readily concede itrsquos got lots of benefits, even though at times I may sound like an old dinosaur lamenting the passing of the Jurassic age.But the arrival of our fake woodburning stove has transformed our house in a way that shows we have lost something in the lsquomodernisingrsquo of our homes. As a storyteller, I have come to understand the importance of a hearth as a focal point for gathering it has the power to bring people together, to share warmth and light but also each otherrsquos presence and social connection. As the freezing wind rages outside, it is a magical space.That magic has been the true gt from my storyteller friend, and she wisely knew it. While much is missing from an articial fire, including the smell and sound of the real thing, our ancestral instinct still kicks in by the visual sight of a flickering hearth.So now my instructions to switch off the screens is more readily obeyed, because it signals time to get together around the fire and lsquobe together properlyrsquo to tell stories and challenge each other with riddles.Burnrsquos poem The Cotterrsquos Saturday Night now has new meaning in our house:To meet their dad, wi flichterin noise and glee.His wee bit ingle, blinkin bonilie,His clean hearth-stane, his thrty wiersquos smile,The lisping infant, prattling on his knee,Does arsquo his weary kiaugh and care beguile,An makes him quite forget his labor and his toil."},{"url":null,"title":"waterside-bistro-chief-takes-castle-inn-dirleton","story":"Brothers Jack and James Findlay have been at the helm of the Waterside Bistro, next to the River Tyne in Haddington, for more than two-and-a-half years.The eaterie was founded by their dad Jim, who also previously ran The Drovers Inn in East Linton, and The Rocks on Dunbarrsquos Marine Road.Now, Jack is expanding the empire by taking over The Castle Inn.He told the Courier: ldquoWe have had quite a soft opening, we just opened yesterday [last Wednesday].ldquoI think the area is lovely and my dad was born in Dirleton, so there is a little bit of heritage there.ldquoWe will be basing it a lot on the Waterside model and obviously myself and my brother will be working alongside each other but from afar.ldquoWe have had tremendous success at the Waterside and we both felt it was probably the right time to look where.ldquoThe Castle Inn was the perfect fit for us.ldquoIt will be myself here and my brother is still based in Haddington.ldquoMy dad is lsquoretiredrsquo but will just be popping in and making sure we are going in the right direction.Twenty-eight-year-old Jack said they already had a good team in place and there were no plans for any ldquodrastic changes.A focus would be placed on locally sourced food, with a daily list of specials.He added: ldquoI would also like to mention the former owners John Dawson and Bert DrsquoAgostino, and want to pay a bit of a tribute to them for their fine work in the trade.ldquoJohn has been fantastic with me and very helpful."},{"url":null,"title":"bench-put-place-memory-tranent-legend-bobby-marr","story":"Bobby Marr, who ran a greengrocer and florist on Tranentrsquos Winton Place for nearly  years, passed away last July.The -year-old was a familiar face to many in Tranent town centre, with hundreds attending his funeral.Marion Hoggan was heavily involved in the fundraising for the bench for Mr Marr, who had colon cancer.She said: ldquoI did not manage the funeral due to work commitments and I felt that I wanted to do something for him.

Dominic Cummings, the prime ministers senior adviser, sees the chancellors department as a Remain-supporting, fiscally conservative roadblock to reform. He once said he wanted to \"break the power of the Treasury\", the only rival powerbase to No  in Whitehall, and is now setting about it.\"Brexiteers have always been suspicious of the Treasury because its experts have repeatedly warned about the economic consequences of leaving the EU. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, has called for the department to be broken up, describing it as \"the worst thing we have in Britain\". When he was work and pensions secretary he once warned a Treasury official who had challenged his universal credit plans thathe didnt fall into line he would be \"eating his own balls for breakfast\".\"Mr Cummings has also started to see the \"department that likes to say no\" as the biggest impediment to his campaign to \"level up\" the regions by pouring money into the so-called \"red wall\" seats in the north and Midlands that switched from Labour to Conservative at the last election.\"She added: \"This is more about power than policy. Mr Javid was the latest victim of Mr Cumminngss \"long march through the institutions\" on the road to a revolution that he hopes will reshape the state and tackle what he sees as the liberal bias of the British establishment.\"Daniel Trilling also talks about the fall out from Mr Johnsons reshuffle in his column.He said: \"It has become received wisdom among Westminster pundits that the new winning formula in politics is to ldquomove left on economics and right on culture.

To those who thought the argument over equality of the sexes had been won long ago, it may come as a surprise that such events have taken so long.

But devolved domestic issues are rather dull for a party and Government that has aspirations to secession, eventhey are the bread and butter of the majority of citizens.Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh EH.WHY does the Scottish Government have a Minister for Europe John Dunlop, Ayr.THE juxtaposition of letters by Carol Vanzetta and Willie Macleangathers criticism of politicians and letter-writers who simply rail against those they disagree with. Further, Ms Vanzetta encourages politicians to present positive suggestions for what it is possible to deliver. I wholeheartedly agree with that approach. Criticising opponents simply saps energy and wastes time allowing others, mainly Westminster, to fiddle, as they say, while peripheries burn.Like Mr Maclean I agree that independence only relates to the SNP insofar as that being the political party most likely to create a means to deliver it. Independence is a choice in how we govern ourselves. Post-independence, I expect the SNP to alter fundamentally as its core purpose changes, perhaps merge with the LibDems on the centre ground or even cease to exist after a few years. The Greens will likely stay the same but Conservative and Labour will need toto basic principles once they become Scottish parties, without external constraint, when I would expect them consequently to gain support.But letrsquos use our experience and imagination at the moment to consider how Scotland could develop rather than constantly do each other down as seems to be the current fashion.John C Hutchison, Fort William.FOLLOWING the letters from Robert IG Scott and the serial doomsayer, Dr Gerald Edwards , I feel moved to reply. At least Dr Edwardsrsquos letter is brief, so Irsquoll start with that one. I think his reference to the former SNP Finance Secretary was something of a low blow, and certainly not worthy of a serious political commentator. He talks up Jackson Carlaw, and says itrsquos ldquodefinitely time for a change in Scottish politics. Exactly who are we to appoint to transform Scotland: Mr Carlaw, Richard Leonard or Willie Rennie  Canrsquot see it myself.Mr Scottrsquos letter is even more troubling. He writes about the Union being basically the most signicant event in our history , without mentioning the devious, and frankly criminal means by which it was achieved. Parcel of rogues anyone Irsquom unsure why he thinks Nicola Sturgeon is ldquoliving on borrowed time, when the SNP has won every election at all levels since , and still holds a more than healthy lead in all opinion polls. Indeed, Yes is also moving steadily towards a win at the next independence referendum.He writes about the Scottish economy being in dire straits, though by all accounts it continues to outperform England and Wales in virtually every measurable area, despite often having its hands tied behind its back by UK fiscal arrangements. Mr Scott also mistakenly conflates the EU with the UK Union: they are very dferent beasts, plus the UK seems to be the only one of the EU members that wants to leave. Everybody out of step apart from us He speaks of the EU as being ldquoemphatically less than democratic. I give you Dominic Cummings.Ian M Baillie, Alexandria.THE letter from Alasdair Gallowayis headed \"So just what will it take for Indyref to be granted \". In previous correspondence, he and others of a similar mind consider this to be a denial of democracy.Thats as may be, but I wonderone of the reasons why we of the Unionist persuasion are not so keen is because Nicola Sturgeon did not simply request a Section  order for a further independence referendum, she wished that the powers to hold referenda be passed to Holyrood on a permanent basis.This would mean that, in the event that any second independence referendum did not deliver the desired result from the SNPs point of view then within weeks, it would be cranking up preparations for Indyref   , or however many it thought necessary to bludgeon us into a state of abject surrender.Christopher W Ide, Waterfoot.Read more: So just what will it take for Indyref to be granted "},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-centre-new-space-race-uks-first-launch-site","story":"The most northerly outpost of Britain, Unst in the Shetland Isles, is anticipating a tourism boom as plans have been unveiled for a privately funded project to build a satellite launch site which could send tourists into space.More than poundmillion has been poured into the proposals by investors but planning permission has yet to be submitted to the Shetland Islands Council.:Spaceport vision falls back to earthIn Sutherland, Caithness, the UK Space Agency plans to build a vertical launch site, with plans submitted to Highland Council on February  and construction is expected to start this year.However, the pound. million Space Hub Sutherland will not cater to lsquospace touristsrsquo - unlike the Shetland Space Centre.A report commissioned by the UK Space Agency had identied Unst as the best spot in Britain for launching small satellites into space.Crofters on the tiny island have welcomed plans for the Shetland Space Centre and have agreed to lease land in a bid to make it happen.And the local authority welcomed the pound,, investment from private equity firm Leonne International.Chair of the councilrsquos development committee, Alastair Cooper, said: ldquoThis announcement of private equity funding for the Shetland Space Centre is positive news.ldquoThe council is committed to supporting local economic opportunities and we hope to maximise the benefit for Unst and Shetland as this project develops.

However, Steve’s natural talent and drive quickly meant that they were expanding and moved into Inverurie.Not long after the move Steve and Jim amicably parted ways leaving Steve as the sole proprietor of IK.

Our interest in the customer doesn’t end when they purchase a vehicle, we make sure they get good service afterwards.” This commitment to customers extends to the wider community at large, with Steve always making the effort to give back and ensure that Inverurie shares in IK’s success.

It’s always very interesting when we get an unusual request like this, and we’re delighted to be able to help restore a building of such signicant historical interest.”The building slowly fell into a state of decline and in  was declared unsafe by the fire department.Two years later it was bought by a developer and the major refurbishment will see the building reopen its doors as a plush hotel, with retail space and a number of private apartments.The pillars have been produced, polished and finished at Fyfe Glenrock’s base in Oldmeldrum and are now being shipped to the USA where, said Mr Collinson, they will not look out of place.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Respitality support worker Ann Brodie alongside colleagues from Energie Fitness\"  ‘Respitality’ links to support carers viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"February ,  at : pmMissing person Lesley Murdoch has been traced safe and well, say Police Scotland.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

OIC has also said all profit would stay in the islands and be used to aid in preserving and enhancing key services as well as providing a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.OIC claims the wind farm projects would also allow the council to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a Needs Case for a new interconnector for Orkney, thereby supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney.Planning applications for the Hoy and Faray projects are likely to follow in Summer and Autumn respectively, due to additional survey requirements for these sites. Public consultation events will be held shortly in these areas to present the latest plans and gather public views.All three developments are substantial, and the turbines are of a height not used in Orkney before, being .m tall at blade tip. The council says it recognises that the projects present a number of potential impacts and these must be weighed against the project#s potential benefits. Iniduals will have dferent opinions on that balance and through the planning process have the opportunity to express their support or objections to the development.Councillors agreed late last year that a request should be made to the Scottish Government to call-in the application on the grounds that the development is of national signicance. That request has now been made and the council is awaiting a decision as to whether they will call in the application or not.The full application documents are available through the council website, with more information available at the application search and submission page, here.

He also asked for an update on the progress of current candidate mast locations in Burray, Hoy and Stromness.In response, Paul Wheelhouse, minister for connectivity and the islands, stated that no new proposed mast locations have been introduced since April  and — despite regular engagement with mobile operators — no operator has committed to using any of the candidate mast locations.Last July, Mr McArthur wrote to mobile phone operators urging them to engage constructively with the programme in Orkney.The MSP said: “It is disappointing to see that progress in closing gaps in mobile phone coverage across Orkney appears to have stalled.“While the Minister has provided assurances that discussions with mobile phone companies are ongoing, there is no sign they are prepared to engage seriously.  Sites have been identied in Stromness, Hoy and Burray, yet people and businesses in these communities are missing out on the better mobile coverage that should be available.“Meantime, efforts to identy new sites appear to have come to a complete halt. That is not good enough.“Ministers and mobile phone operators clearly agreed that public money was needed to plug existing gaps in the network. Since then, however, neither has been prepared to follow this up with action on the ground.

While provision has been made, it has consistently fallen short of what is required to reflect fair ferry funding.“Ministers may have changed, but the commitment was one made on behalf of the government. Indeed, the First Minister spent much of last summer in Shetland repeatedly the promises of fair funding.“Claiming it is the responsibility of everyone  to deliver the promises they have made lacks credibility. Instead of holding communities in Orkney and Shetland to ransom each year, the government should honour its commitment to fully deliver on fair ferry funding for these lelines services.”Ms Wishart added: “This Government has already accepted that it must provide full and fair ferry funding for the Northern Isles. Continuing to deny Shetland and Orkney the funding needed to run these leline services is completely unacceptable. At worst it is total cynicism.“The Government needs to step up and deliver on the clear evidence that it has been presented with year after year. We will not allow previous commitments to be traded away.“It is no exaggeration to say that the future of some island communities relies on sustainable ferry services. However, the money that has been given to Shetland Islands Council in recent years does not meet the true cost of running our ferries.“When the budget was announced it was described as having “wellbeing and fairness at its very heart”. But this settlement does not reflect that and is not reflective of a Government that is alive to the needs of island communities.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It’s the main portal now for our visitor information, and the place anyone keen to learn more about living, working and studying in the islands should head, so we felt a TV campaign would be a great way to both highlight the site and everything Orkney has to offer.”“We’re really delighted with the quality of the two adverts,” added Maureen Shearer, development manager at HIE in Orkney. “The feedback on the first, focusing on Orkney as a visitor destination, has been fantastic and we’re already seeing an increase in the hits on the Orkney website. We’re very grateful to the STV Growth Fund and to LEADER for their assistance in bringing this campaign to fruition and also hope viewers enjoy seeing this snapshot of le in the islands.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

One by one, they planted the rough wooden memorials in the grass –  in all – each one marking a le lost to drugs. As they did so, they reflected on the good times, and lamented the waste.The last to plant his cross was Steven Currie. Steven’s older brother Peter McGrattan – known to most as Big Ped – was obsessed by music. “He was into punk when he was a boy, then U, Inspiral Carpets, Stone Roses, Oasis,” says Steven, who has the word “Brother” tattooed on his arm. “He was the man for the music, and you would follow suit because you looked up to him.” Steven would sit on the floor while Peter played DJ. “I’d tap tap my feet and think: ‘That’s quite good, that.’ His taste was superb. He could have been one of those guys that spotted bands.”But Big Ped carried a bit of weight and it affected his self-esteem. He trod that well-worn path from alcohol through soft drugs, heroin and crack cocaine, on to the grave. He died of a Valium overdose, after eight years clean, in August , dying in their mother’s house. “The paramedic came in and said: ‘He’s gone,’” Steven says. “I sat with him on the floor and cuddled him until they came and took him away.” Gone, but still loved still remembered.We are in the grip of a drugs deaths emergency here in Scotland, as everybody knows. Our drugs death rate is the worst in Europe. The toll for  was , – the highest it has ever been. It will come as little surprisethis year’s is higher still. The crosses are a reminder that each of the , was an inidual robbed of their future.En masse, they capture the scale of the problem. Spread out in rows like war graves, they say: “Here is a generation being wiped out, while those at the top play politics.” Is this too harsh  Maybe. Yet even as Steven placed his cross, the UK and Scottish governments were squabbling over rival drugs summits to be held in Glasgow a day apart. “My drugs summit is better than your drugs summit,” they blustered like children.Of course, politicians on both sides can justy their position. The UK government will say it announced its conference first. “But without consulting us, and without including those with lived experience,” the Scottish Government will counter. If either party does not understand how pathetic it sounds – how pathetic it is – for two governments who share responsibility for drugs policy to be unwilling to cut the crap and share a table, I suggest they get out of politics for a while and look at this from beyond the bubble. I suggest they spend some time in those communities where people are losing their lives for want of inter-agency collaboration and a coherent policy.This is not to suggest the Scottish Government is doing nothing. Last year – under pressure, and having previously cut frontline services – it set up the Drugs Deaths Task Force. In the recent budget it announced an extra £.m to be spent on “delivering innovative projects, testing new approaches and developing a national pathway for opiate substitute therapy”.The Scottish Government conference will also provide training in the use of Naloxone, which reverses the effect of drugs overdoses, and a demonstration model of a drugs consumption room. It insists what takes place there will “inform” its contribution to the UK summit the next day. And yet the mutual blame game neither side appears able to stop does not augur well.So often we hear about successful policy where, particularly in Portugal where drugs have been decriminalised, users have been de-stigmatised and those who consume can choose between harm reduction and rehab.But the key to Portugal’s success was not merely the approach itself, but the political consensus that formed around it and an unshakeable commitment to that approach through successive governments.Here in the UK, we are still treating drugs policy like a political football a forum for the airing of grievances a battleground for ideological dferences. This was happening long before the general election, but it is worse now the Tories have a thumping majority.The destructive relationship between Westminster and the Scottish Government – and more specically between Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson – is spilling into other areas too, most notably the COP climate conference which will take place in Glasgow in November.This conference is supposed to build the coalition necessary to break the deadlock on international climate action – and therefore requires UK-wide co-operation and a gt for diplomacy.Already, however, it has been reduced to oneupmanship. Despite being advised otherwise, Johnson has refused to give Sturgeon any formal role in proceedings. And there have been disputes over the venue itself. With the conference set to be held in the Scottish Events Campus on the north of the river, the Scottish Government booked out the Science Centre on the south. But now the UK government says it needs both sites and has accused the Scottish Government of trying to undermine its plans. To make matters worse, the Prime Minister is said to have referred to Sturgeon as “that wee Jimmy Krankie woman” to which Sturgeon responded “ Boris Johnson wants to make personal insults against me, I’m a big enough girl to make personal insults back”. All highly constructive.I think most of us accept Johnson would try the patience of a saint. As last week’s reshuffle demonstrated, he – or rather Dominic Cummings – is hell-bent on exercising control. Claire Perry claims he sacked her as the president of the COP and replaced her with former international development secretary Alok Sharma because Whitehall couldn’t cope with an independent conference. Sharma is said to have a questionable record on environment issues.Given all this, it must be tempting to answer criticism by pointing out that “Johnson started this” and that he is a twat of the highest order. But that gets us nowhere. Meanwhile, the planet burns.Aware, presumably, that tit-for-tat fighting is destructive and childish, Sturgeon has called for a reset in relations. But for that to happen, the UK government will not only have to be willing to co-operate on key issues, the Scottish Government will have to stop constantly passing the buck southwards.The constitutional debate is not going to disappear. Both governments will be arguing over the legitimacy of a second independence referendum for some time. But they need to be able to set that argument aside when it comes to shared crises such as drugs deaths and climate change.Only by attempting to find common ground can progress be made. If that requires pride to be swallowed, and teeth to be gritted, then so be it. There are too many crosses already in Springburn too many species already extinct.

We must surely, he added, be witnessing a historical record – a government in crisis after just two months in power.Meanwhile, Labour-supporting commentators lined up to explain the replacement of Javid with, as one columnist described him, the “alarmingly obedient” Rishi Sunak.I’m bound to say that for a man mired in crisis, Johnson appears remarkably relaxed. When he and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, told Javid they wanted his team cleared out and replaced by a new staff of advisers working across both  and  Downing Street, they must have know there was a chance – a good one, at that – that the chancellor wouldn’t wear it. His decision to walk cannot have come as a shock.McDonnell’s description of a government in crisis is, I’m afraid, inaccurate. Rather, what we’re seeing is a Prime Minister fully in control. There is no crisis.In Javid’s eager beaver replacement, Johnson has precisely what he wanted: a compliant chancellor who will do what he desires.Quite why Sunak’s loyalty should be seen as “alarming”, I’m not sure. There is nothing in the rule book of politics that says the sign of a good chancellor is a willingness to defy the prime minister. Was Tony Blair’s Labour government improved by the fact chancellor Gordon Brown spent his every waking moment seething with resentment over his rival’s supremacy  No, it wasn’t, was it  In fact, briefing and counter-briefing by Number  and Treasury sources meant the fractured relationship between prime minister and chancellor frequently got in the way of smooth government. When both men would rather have seen their policy agenda make headlines, their bitter relationship became the focus of media attention.When, finally, Brown realised his ambition of becoming prime minister, he could not change his ways. A man born to plot, Brown soon began undermining his chancellor, Alistair Darling, destroying a professional and personal relationship that had endured for years.David Cameron and George Osborne entered government in  having learned from their predecessors. Relations between Downing Street and the Treasury were good for the first time in a long time.Cameron and Osborne were a team and they always understood the pecking order. Each got what he needed from the relationship.But Johnson has no such partner. The Prime Minister has no political soulmate.This being so, what, exactly is the problem with Johnson wishing to take a firm grip of the Treasury  It is, I think, the sort of thing that might look to voters like strong leadership. Few, I’d wager, now lament the passing of the Javid era.Among Johnson’s immediate priorities is solidying the Conservative vote in areas of England which once ed Labour MPs. The Prime Minister will want to deliver for areas in the Midlands and the North of England which went Tory for the first time in generations. If he does not make good on his promises of regeneration and investment then the PM risks watching those voters drt back to Labour.What Johnson needs, right now, is a chancellor who is completely on board with this agenda. But there is something  beyond the Prime Minister’s desire for a compliant chancellor at play, here. Johnson has just sent a message to every member of his parliamentary party that the rules of the game have changed. His demand is complete loyalty, nothing less.From what McDonnell describes as a crisis will, I think, spring a period of uncommon stability in government. Last year, Johnson won the parliamentary majority he craved. Now, he has stamped his authority on his party in no uncertain terms.This same message came across loudly and clearly in Johnson’s dismissal from his cabinet of former leadership contenders Andrea Leadsom and Esther McVey. Leadsom is a popular figure among members of the Tory Party’s Eurosceptic right wing. Johnson’s calculation is that he need not concern himself with the feelings of those members. Javid comes out of the last few days rather well, I think. No chancellor can complain about a demand for loyalty but the order to dismiss his team of advisers was a step too far, one provocation too many.That Javid said no to this suggests he has something about him, after all.In a statement following his resignation, the former chancellor reiterated his support for Johnson. I wonder how long this will last.It is undoubtedly the case that when political parties lose discipline, they lose elections. Look at the SNP. For decades, they did nothing but tear each other apart over the best way in which independence might be achieved. Bitter recrimination was part and parcel of SNP membership. And then Alex Salmond ed as party leader for a second stint and he laid down the bloody law to his colleagues. There was to be no briefing about colleagues, no criticism of government policy, and no public disagreement over any of the party’s positions.What followed was as period of unity in the SNP ranks that continues – the occasional domestic disturbance, aside – to this day.I’m not sure Johnson is behaving especially dferently to the way Salmond did. Doubtless, opposition parties will taunt Chancellor Rishi Sunak when he next rises to speak in the House of Commons. They will leave him in no doubt that they consider him a poodle.But each and every one of Boris Johnson’s opponents will privately admire the way he strengthened his grip on the Tory Party last week.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"it s nessie mystery skeleton washed up on scots beach leads to speculation it s loch ness monster","story":"The photos of the rotten carcass on Balmedie Beach in Aberdeen were posted on a local community Facebook page - Fubar News - after it was revealed following the powerful storm which battered the country last week.

After a spirited campaign by his opponent Michelle Ballantyne, Carlaw in the end won comfortably with a % to % share of the members’ votes cast. The party should be thankful to Ballantyne for ensuring there was a contest, not least for allowing Carlaw to now say with authority he has an unequivocal mandate to run the party. She also gave voice to concerns that have been building up over recent years about party management. Carlaw will surely want to address these rather than exacerbate them. While the candidates did their best to present themselves as dferent and thus offer a genuine choice, the reality is they had far more in common than what ided them. For the party this is a good thing as members now have to unite behind Carlaw’s leadership and turn their attention to the most important challenge facing them – defeating the SNP in the  elections.Their first goal will be to prevent the SNP having an overall majority like that won by Alex Salmond in , but then lost by Nicola Sturgeon in . Despite the appalling performance of our public services under the management of the SNP government, recent polling suggests it could yet win such a huge mandate. While possible I think it unlikely, for once the electorate begins to consider the SNP’s record in detail its failure must begin to pay idends for the opposition. Also fundamental to the debate is how the dominance of Brexit will recede, allowing more oxygen to be given to the scrutinising the performance of SNP ministers.The second goal must then be to lay the ground for a new administration that locks the SNP out of government evenSturgeon wins the most seats. An alternative minority administration that enjoys a comfort and supply arrangement would be the most likely route – as neither Labour nor the Liberal Democrats will want to even hint at a coalition, never mind formalise one. In an effort to kill-off such a prospect the SNP will seek to demonise any party offering to work with dreaded Tories – or “Tory Scum” as the infamous banner that graces nationalist marches brands over half a million Scottish voters. In response the argument has to be put that it was the Tories who provided a comfort and supply arrangement to Salmond and Sturgeon between -. If the Tories were good enough for the SNP then, why should it not be good enough for Carlaw to do the same with other partiesit’s best for the for the country It is impossible to say what role the Labour Party will play in all of these developments too much depends on how its UK leadership election works out, but there are other encouraging signs that offer hope to unionists. Yesterday Scottish Business UK, the pro-Union business group backed by hundreds of Scottish businesses and including many household names, published a new paper advocating a more positive and assertive approach by the UK government. Included in the paper Strengthening the Union: A Framework for Business Success were proposals for a UK Department of the Union which would have grant-aiding powers to assist directly initiatives that will help the UK’s cohesiveness. These might be community based or infrastructure projects – but they would clearly demonstrate and say on the tin they have been delivered by the UK.Other ideas included an Office for Budget Responsibility for the Union that would bring more transparency to encourage both accountability and value for money in public spending. Interestingly it is argued the new OBR could become a force for helping achieve UK-wide spending commitments in Scotland as well challenging them. The paper also considered issues from taxation to fisheries, cultural exchange within the UKto migration. Some may fly, others probably will not, but the fact that a business group is bringing forward positive ideas that can add value to being in the UK illustrates how the UK’s status quo is never set in stone.Indeedthere is one dference why the UK’s advocates won the independence referendum of  but the Europhiles lost that of  is the UK is evolving and decentralising by devolving power out to nations and cities – whereas the EU is taking more and more power for itself. Other unionist organisations are also stirring Scotland in Union, the largest campaign group defending the Union launched a Valentine video message last week and another offering ten reasons Scotland is stronger in the UK. That might not seem especially unusualbut the adoption of a positive rather than negative tone represents a change in approach away from the project fear of the past and, I believe, will begin to pay idends. Likewise the meetings being organised around the country by the unionist lobbying group Scotland Matters demonstrates the level of activism outside party circles is growing. True, such events are not at the levels of Yes activism, but that’s not the appropriate comparison, the point is no such activities were even being considered by unionists before the last referendum in . This time Unionists of all parties or none are mobilising in advance of the  elections to head off nationalism before any referendum.Later this weekend in Newcastle-upon-Tyne the discussion forum “These Islands” holds a two day conference to explores issues of culture and identity that are rarely given enough thought by unionists.The growth of such activities points to a more confident and less complacent approach from unionists be they large or small “U”. It shows a willingness to do grown-up politics, to have adult and reasoned debate away from the obscenities and hatred spouted at marches, worn on T-shirts and sprayed across social media that too many nationalists have descended into.All of Scotland’s pro-British parties can tap into this new wave of unionist optimism – and then maybe learn to work together.Brian Monteith is editor of ThinkScotland.org©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch dramatic footage shows ferry caught in storm dennis","story":"A ferry swaying heavily at sea as storm Dennis batters parts of the country has been caught on camera.Stuart Bell was visiting the Isle of Arran when he filmed the ferry approaching the Calmac Ferry Terminal.

In early , they decided to have insulation work carried out in their home following a cold call by Mark Crilly. that Mr Crilly, a former footballer who played for the likes of Ayr United, St Mirren, and Raith Rovers, came to their bungalow in July  and offered to carry out ious jobs as part of a grant scheme. Underfloor and internal wall insulation and a staircase to allow insulation to their loft room – then only accessible by a loft ladder – was part of the package.The work began in February  after confirmation that Julie and Rachel were eligible for the insulation scheme grant as they were in receipt of working tax credits. Mrs Child claims that after initially stating that he was working under one of the warm home schemes, prior to the work being carried Mr Crilly said he now had his own company – the Central Heating Team. February  to begin the work and fitted the staircase. February that the remaining materials would be delivered on st February and that the fitters would then finish the staircase. February in which she outlined work outstanding and issues related to the work carried out along with photographic evidence of it. She also told him that she would leave a key for the workmen to access her house as she had to go to Inverness for surgery.: “They were very happy with their job, but I went in to have a look and the staircase was dangerously on a forward tilt. There was no headroom # you actually had to duck to get in the attic space. So I brought this all to Mark’s attentionand he said #yes, I’ll get them to do something about it# – but what they did was wedge in an extra bit of wood underneath the staircase to try and put the tilt backward. It’s not fixed to the floor, there’s no banister, there’s no handrail at the top. I started looking at building regulations and there isn’t two metres clearance.”She added: “The underfloor heating was fine, no problems –but I think that is really all they are capable of doing because they weren’tjoiners.”After multiple messages asking Mr Crilly what would be doneto recty the damage Julie conducted a search through Companies House to finddetails of the Central Heating Team. She discovered that it was a limitedcompany but that it did not mention Mark Crilly at all.She spoke to one of the company’s directors, David Mastertonwho told her that Mr Crilly was merely one of their lead generators and that itwas through them the underfloor insulation had been carried out. She added thatshe was told Mr Crilly did not have the correct certication in place to undertakethe internal wall insulation. Mrs Child said that Mark Crilly emailed her in April  to say that Mr Masterton would arrange for a joiner to sort the staircase as soon as possible. In June , Julie managed to track down the joiner in question.He told her that Mr Crilly had casually mentioned that there might be work for him but nothing more. Mrs Child claims that the joiner inspected the work at her home and said he was shocked at the poor workmanship and was not interested in trying to put it right.In September , Julie employed the services of theStornoway-based firm Alex Murray Construction.She said: “I went to Alex Murray Construction and they said ‘they have cut through ceiling joists, which they haven’t reinforced, it’s dangerous – you shouldn’t be using the stairs # that all needs to come out or be strengthened.’“They sent us a quote for about £, to put it back to what it was before. They suggested that we speak to the building inspectors.”In November  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar conducted a building inspection of her home.Mrs Child said: “They said ‘your home insurance is invalid. There are major structural ceiling joists that have been chopped through without any reinforcements –you have a problem and have an assessor come in, the first thing they are going to do is come up to the attic and your insurance will be void#.”Following the building inspection, Mrs Child contacted Mr Crilly to determine who was liable, to which she claims he said he was.After sending him the quote and building report, and withher house no longer insured and vulnerable to the winter weather, she sent aletter at the start of December. This explained that the couple would give MrCrilly fourteen days to pay the quote in full otherwise they would take legalaction.She said: “He did email us and offer the deposit and money on completion but as we had already told him, the construction company would not accept that. They needed the money paid up front. He never got a valid quote for the work with them nor took it any further. All he has done is stall at every opportunity.“He has made us feel very foolish and like complete idiots.We came over here for the quiet le and we’ve no mortgage – so that we can makea few changes with our little business. There is no money in the bank to repairwhat he has done.” contacted Mr Crilly for comment, but we have not received a response."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/001WH1402NCA.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 14th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

When the family approached us, they didn’t have a grave number but informed us the grave was in City Cemetery. When we checked our records, three people had been buried in the grave at City Cemetery.“It later transpired that the correct grave which belonged to the family of the deceased was actually in Glenalina Cemetery, which is adjoining. We appreciate the immense pressure on families when arranging the burial of a loved one and apologise for any upset that was caused by Council during this dficult process.”Responding to the council’s apology, a family member insisted that council officials had earlier admitted entering the wrong coordinates for the plot, incorrectly entering the letter ‘j’ instead of ‘i’.“We totally expected Belfast City Council to turn the blame back on us,” she said.“My brother told the council that the correct grave was in the top part of the City Cemetery, officially called Glenalina, but they obviously didn’t listen.“The council should just admit that whoever keyed in the plot number got it wrong.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"familys fitting tribute to danielle","story":"THE family of a Glengormley woman who died just weeks before she was due to begin a new le-extending cystic fibrosis drug have raised over £, in her memory.Danielle McFalldied at Antrim Area Hospital in October after a week in intensive care.She was diagnosed with the disease aged just six weeks and after being diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of  she developed cirrhosis of the liver.Danielle was due to start the new drug, Orkambi, which can improve lung , after a deal was struck with US drug manufacturer Vertex.However, Danielle became ill on October , soon after the announcement was made, and died on October .In her memory, her family decided they wanted to do something and recently held a fundraiser for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust in Cltonville Golf Club.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Danielle’s mother Angela explained: “She fought long and hard all her le and we all really miss her.“We wanted to do something in her memory but had never done anything like this before.“It was a daunting task to organise something from nothing but we sat down and got sponsors who donated vouchers and prizes for a ballot.“As we got closer to the event, we worried more and more about whether it would be a success.“It was a freezing night in January and we were worried that people wouldn’t come out but thanks to a combination of hard work and incredible generosity, we raised far more money than we ever expected to.“We put on a buffet, had great music from DJ Gerry and a ballot draw.“We had vouchers for make-up salons and barbers, loads of drinks hampers, tickets to the Belfast Giants and the Game of Thrones Giant’s Causeway tour and the main prize, which was a gigantic perfume and make-up hamper from Medicare in Northcott.”Danielle’s family managed to raise an amazing £. for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and Belfast International Airport have pledged an additional £ to the total raised.“It was a really fun-filled night and as a family, we would like to thank all who helped make it possible.“We’re overwhelmed by the result and are glad that out efforts paid off as fantastically as they did.

It is the jewel in the crown of Belfast.“The Council say it is closed due to health and safety issues. Nature has caused damage with trees growing and it has really been left abandoned by the Council.“Enough is enough. We need to start now and start fixing it up.”The call has been backed by historian Joe Baker from Belfast History Project.“Clton Street is one of three ancient cemeteries in Belfast,” he explained.“It is the most unique because it didn’t belong to a church. It belonged to the old Belfast Poor House at Clton House.“It opened in , two years before United Irishmen rebellion.“For me, the most remarkable thing is the ersity of graves.

He has got bigger things to worry about than his flag being flown. Maybe someone conveniently forgot to put it up this morning.Shireen Symington said: I would not be flying it because I think he has let the Royal family down.In Belfast, where the flag was flying at City Hall, Alan Lennon said: “I think it goes more deep than that, it is not flying it for Andrew, it is for the Royal Family which I support very much. I would fly it for Andrew as well.There is allegations going about but nothing has been proven in anyway. I am happy enough for it to be flying today.”Brian Robinson said the flag should be flown as Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom.We are British, we live in the United Kingdom, it is our flag, we should be flying it, he said. Irrespective of anything, it is our country. He has not been charged with anything as far as I am aware. We have politicians who are in government who have done a lot of things and they are still in government.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe Union flag flies over Belfast city Hall to celebrate the th birthday of Prince Andrew.Photo by Peter Morrison FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe Union flag flies over Belfast city Hall to celebrate the th birthday of Prince Andrew.Photo by Peter MorrisonAdvice put out by the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport told councils they can choose whether to fly the flag on so-called designated days. There are  councils in Northern Ireland, four of which never fly the flag and only Ards and North Down had previously chosen not to fly the flag today. Five councils are flying the Union Flag, some because they fly it everyday and others, like Belfast City Council, because it is still officially a designated day. Causeway Coast and Glens, in a bid to try and reflect the four council areas it was formed from, is flying the flag from some buildings but not others.The Union Flag is also being flown at Stormont.

The warning comes after the Public Health Agency published figures showing there were  confirmed cases of the illness last year, compared to just  cases in .The majorityof the cases were in young adults, aged  to . Mumps is a viral infection that used to be common in children before the introduction of the MMR vaccine. Before the MMR vaccine mumps was the most common cause of viral meningitis.Although people can recover from mumps without treatment, in some cases it can cause complications such as viral meningitis, deafness and inflammation of the testicles.Rob Dawson, director of support and advocacy at Meningitis Research Foundationsaid: “Mumps meningitis can be a frightening, although infrequent complication of mumps. MRF encourages everyone to get the vaccinations they are eligible for as immunisation is best way to protect yourself from mumps. Vaccination prevents most cases of mumps and evena vaccinated person does get mumps, they are likely to experience a less severe illness.”The Public Health Agency#s Dr Jillian Johnson told the BBC that two doses of the MMR vaccine would maximise protection against mumps. Whilst the majority of all cases, including young adults, have received two doses of MMR vaccine , the proportion of people with less than two dosesis enough to continue to drive the spread of mumps every three to four years and this is what we are seeing during , she said.The warning comes after it was revealed cases of mumps in England had reached their highest level in a decade. The increase, which was attributed to outbreaks in universities and colleges, raised the number of cases of the viral illness to , last year- four times the number in . Many of the cases were seen in young adults born in the late s and early s who are likely to have missed out on the MMR vaccine after the vaccine was ly linked to autism. The children are now young adults going to college and university. Symptoms of mumps include painful swelling of the glands at the side of the face, a fever, joint pain, feeling tired and loss of appetite.

He then entered the pub trade, joining his uncle Brendan at the Market Inn in Draperstown. His affable, fun and friendly personality made him a natural barman.In the late s, Niall was at a dance in Dungiven Castle where he met a beautul young teacher called Geraldine Agnew who was holidaying in Maghera from her native Belfast. They married in  and set up home in Hall Street.Around this time, Niall was keen to venture into the pub business on his own. He and his father had been leasing a drinking house on the very top of Glenshane called Bradley’s since the early s. Niall bought it in the early s and put his own stamp on it with a notable new name - the Ponderosa.The name was a nod to Niall’s father who bore a remarkable resemblance to Ben Cartwight, the lead character in the s television show Bonanza featuring a ranch called the Ponderosa. Niall and his three brothers also looked like the Cartwright brothers. What started as a joke stuck.Running a pub on the top of a mountain throughout the s wasn’t always easy.The Troubles raged and Niall’s remote location made him a sitting duck for raiders. He had no electricity supply, no telephone and was also at the whim of Glenshane’s notoriously cruel winters. googletag.cmd.push  The Watty Grahams championship-winning team. Niall Regan is in the back row, fth from the left, with his arms folded. Despite the challenges, he was in heaven with wonderful staff, a loyal dog, a blazing turf fire, an endless pot of homemade soup and a stream of fascinating characters through the doors bringing plenty of stories and news.It was a popular stopping point for tourists and well-known customers, including Manchester United footballer Paddy Crerand.The early s saw Niall branch out into the snooker club trade and he operated, with others, a handful of halls across Mid Ulster. By the mid s, he and Geraldine had three young children. After nearly  years of pulling pints at the top of the Sperrins, Niall took the tough decision to sell his beloved Ponderosa.Away from work,Niall was a talented Gaelic footballer, and was proud to play for many years for Watty Graham’s GAC, Glen. He was part of the Watty’s team which lted the Derry Junior Championship title of . He last lined up for Glen at the age of  as part of an over s match to mark the opening of Watty Graham Park in .Niall’s father Matt had been an exceptional footballer, playing soccer professionally for Belfast Celtic and Shamrock Rovers in the s, as well as Gaelic for his native Ballinascreen and Derry.Matt was the first Derry player ever selected to play for Ulster in the Railway Cup, and was also the man who brought future England manager Ron Greenwood to play for Belfast Celtic.Niall was pleased to follow something of his father’s path by pulling on a Derry jersey as a junior player.  Niall gets to hold the Sam Maguire after Derrys success in . He remained an avid Derry GAA fan throughout his le and was present at Croke Park for both of the county’s only two All-Ireland finals, in  and . He was, of course, a happy man in .When Geraldine became principal of St Columba’s Primary School, Straw, in , Niall volunteered to coach the boys’ football, nurturing a squad of young Ballinascreen players as they made their way up through the school.Niall loved traditional Irish music. He played the tin whistle and sang in a band called Roguery in his younger days. He was the le and soul of any party he attended and never had to take much convincing to sing his favourite, The Mountainy Farmer.He was an accomplished golfer, playing off a handicap of six at his best. One of the founding members of Moyola Park Golf Club, Castledawson, in , he spent many happy hours on its fairways and clubhouse over the decades. The same can be said for Dunfanaghy Golf Club in Co Donegal where Niall was granted honorary letime membership in recognition of his dedication there.Niall’s love of Maghera and Derry was matched only by his love of Dunfanaghy where he had holidayed since childhood.Niall’s later years were marked by ill health after he suffered a le-changing stroke in . He gave up golf but still patrolled the Dunfanaghy links in his Harley Davison golf buggy, acting as course ranger on busy days.A devoted grandfather and great grandfather, Niall suffered another series of strokes almost five years ago, leaving him with signicant disabilities and the on-set of dementia.He was cared for unfailingly by his devoted we in these final years. Niall passed away peacefully on Friday st January in his Hall Street home. Following Requiem Mass at St Patrick’s Chapel, he was buried in its graveyard, at the foot of Glenshane.Niall will be sadly missed by his we Geraldine, their children Siobhan, Niall Og and Claire , their granddaughters Cliodhna, Katie and Rosa, great granddaughter Saoirse, son-in-law Chris, sister Maeve , brothers Matt and Terence and the wider family circle.Niall was sadly pre-deceased by his brother Barney.The Regan family were deeply touched by the large congregation who turned out for his funeral, representing all eras and interests in his full and fulfilled le.

Maybe you’ve had some information sent home from your child’s school or nursery  I had a great discussion with these children, most of whom did understand when to ask for help, what ‘not to do’ online but scarily some still thought they didn’t need parental controls, thought they ‘knew it all’ when, during our discussion it quickly became apparent that they didn’t. However, this discussion linked to how they used their tablet, when I asked did they have a phone or did they use their parents, I was shocked that most of them didn’t think the dangers on their tablet were also on the phone - nearly the whole class said they would use the phone to watch videos on YouTube or games that ‘popped up.’Gulp!At the end of the day, I was in another class and the teaching assistant explained to me that at the end of every day the children were allowed to watch Netflix for  minutes.I thought this was a treat but, no, it happens every day. Yes, they were watching Horrid Henry which is age appropriate, but I thought why couldn’t it be read to them  Gulp! Walking back to my car at the end of the day with these ‘incidents’ in my head, I saw a child from the class I had just taught getting into his car and being passed a tablet... why, I wondered, what happened to talking  Gulp! Then, now I’ve heard about these things but I really didn’t think any parent would actually do this, I saw a mum pushing a pram with a gorgeous little baby about one-year-old in it, with a screen attached to the handle bars. I thought, no, the baby can’t seriously be watching that, it can’t be on, it must be a fancy phone thing or something. So, I crossed over and deliberately walked slowly passed mumand was absolutely shocked to see what was obviously a child’s video playing, gulp! I drove home in a bit of a daze, reflecting on all I’d seen and heard, I even had a glass of wine instead of coffee when I got in! I really did wonder, and I do know there are lots of very conscientious parents out there, do most not take any notice of all the information about internet safety, about the dangers of strangers online, of cartoons and films with ‘dodgy characters and images popping up,’ about the danger of too much screen time etc  Do they think ‘my child knows it all, knows how to be safe’, ‘my child only watches a couple of hours and that’s okay,’ ‘my baby loves watching the nursery rhymes,’ googletag.cmd.push ‘I trust my child not to be friends with someone he hasn’t met,’ ‘my child needs the tablet to relax’   A few years back, the Greater Shantallow Area Partnership developed an amazing campaign called Screen Wise, which gave parents information about internet safety, the impact of too much screen time, about parental controls, cyber bullying and much more. I’ve listed a few sites below, and I’m sure there are many more, for you to find some of this information for yourselves - I know as a campaign it had a huge impact on everyone in that community, from babies to teenagers and adults too, so maybe you could start a wave of internet safety messages yourself - find a tip, share it on line and together let’s help all our babies, toddlers, children and teenagers enjoy their tablet, phones and internet and all they can offer. But always remembering ‘too much screen time is not good for me,’ for our lives are about living, about being social, about talking and playing together, not about sitting, zoned out for hours at a time on a machine. We have one le to share with our children, one le to love, so screens away it’s time to talk and play, oh and that means your phone is to go away too. Screen Time RecommendationsWhen I’m under two no screen time for me, and half an hour will do as I go from two to three.And an hour is plenty when I reach four and as I get older you can give me a little bit more.

People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

Reporter: Liam Tunney::  Feb   addthis, Louth-based band Kern are itching to add a Derry venue to their CV as they prepare to play the Twilight Music Sessions at Roe Valley Arts  Cultural Centre this weekend.“The list of counties we haven’t played in is getting smaller,” says Brendan McCreanor, who plays uilleann pipes. “We’ve heard great things about the venue and we’re really looking forward to it.” The band take their name from the Irish word ‘caithearn’ - a medieval Irish soldier, but Brendan says they were attracted to the word’s ‘malleability’. He says: “It means lots of things in lots of languages. The nicest one we came across was in German, where it means a core or a seed. “That’s one of the nicer ones, as there’s a core group here of only three of us and the seed grows and keeps changing.” googletag.cmd.push The band has toured extensively over the past year and list winning the  TradFest Temple Bar showcase and performing at America’s largest Irish festival – the Milwaukee Irish Fest – among their achievements, but lead singer and guitarist Stephen McArdle insists their focus has been on the music rather than the accolades. He says: “They do a showcase in conjunction with Milauwakee Irish Fest and we showcased at it last year. It went out on RTEacute radio. We didn’t really think about winning it, we took it because it was a good gig.  The band’s sound is a fusion of the traditional and the original, with their repertoire intrinsically linked to their native County Louth, something Stephen says is vital to the group’s sound: googletag.cmd.push “When we do traditional music, it tends to have a strong ceangalwith the land we’re coming from. That’s what we bring and then we write our own songs along with that.” The mixture of traditional and contemporary is a big hit in modern Irish music, and fiddle player, Barry Kiernan, credits the resurgence of the Fleadh and, in particular, Fleadh TV, for the upsurge: “So many people go to the Fleadh for dferent reasons.

Reporter: Liam Tunney::  Feb   addthis, Louth-based band Kern are itching to add a Derry venue to their CV as they prepare to play the Twilight Music Sessions at Roe Valley Arts  Cultural Centre this weekend.“The list of counties we haven’t played in is getting smaller,” says Brendan McCreanor, who plays uilleann pipes. “We’ve heard great things about the venue and we’re really looking forward to it.” The band take their name from the Irish word ‘caithearn’ - a medieval Irish soldier, but Brendan says they were attracted to the word’s ‘malleability’. He says: “It means lots of things in lots of languages. The nicest one we came across was in German, where it means a core or a seed. “That’s one of the nicer ones, as there’s a core group here of only three of us and the seed grows and keeps changing.” googletag.cmd.push The band has toured extensively over the past year and list winning the  TradFest Temple Bar showcase and performing at America’s largest Irish festival – the Milwaukee Irish Fest – among their achievements, but lead singer and guitarist Stephen McArdle insists their focus has been on the music rather than the accolades. He says: “They do a showcase in conjunction with Milauwakee Irish Fest and we showcased at it last year. It went out on RTEacute radio. We didn’t really think about winning it, we took it because it was a good gig.  The band’s sound is a fusion of the traditional and the original, with their repertoire intrinsically linked to their native County Louth, something Stephen says is vital to the group’s sound: googletag.cmd.push “When we do traditional music, it tends to have a strong ceangalwith the land we’re coming from. That’s what we bring and then we write our own songs along with that.” The mixture of traditional and contemporary is a big hit in modern Irish music, and fiddle player, Barry Kiernan, credits the resurgence of the Fleadh and, in particular, Fleadh TV, for the upsurge: “So many people go to the Fleadh for dferent reasons.

I’ve gained so many friends through the sport as well as getting the chance to travel throughout the country doing something I love.‘I’ve been to Killarney, Greece and Austria as well as all over Ireland and the UK.’The modest student says she is very proud to have won the Six Nations belt in Glasgow and described the  x . minute rounds against Mirren Bisland as tough but enjoyable. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED: Caitlin Toland pictured with her classmates and teacher Mr. Sean McBride during last week’s school assembly to celebrate her WRSA Six Nations title success.  ‘The fight was stopped in the fourth round by the referee and I feel this was my best victory to date.

But just one win in five league games since then and the league table is now taking a dferent picture, and it is not particularly palatable for Paul OKane, Richard McCarter and their players.McCarter said in the build up to Saturdays game against Bangor that the league table was to be avoided because of the psychological implications of seeing his team second from bottom, despite playing well in recent games. Four points on Saturday would change everything however – Derry would rise three, four or maybe five places, above Bangor, away from second bottom, away from relegation fears. They just had to win.They didnt.As Storm Denis raged across the skies, all Division  games were called off, bar two, with the Judges Road surface holding up. Unfortunately, that durability only suited Bangor, who used the conditions as part fo their game plan, and did damage in the first half that the hosts could not recover from. The absence of prop Sam Duffy was ultimately pivotal for the home side as Bangor used their physical superiority to dominant up front and get just enough points needed to get a hugely valuable win. That victory would have been much more emphatic o not for some heroic defending by the hosts, who also suffered from questionable decision making in their own attack which cost them crucial points at crucial moments.Derry could also look at some harsh refereeing decisions, but at the end of a day in which most things went against them, the celebrations of the Bangor players told its own story. They left the pitch drenched and muddied, but victorious, whilst not even a losing bonus point could console Derry, who will feel building pressure going into this weeks home game against Tullamore. Bad startEvery one of the  points scored on Saturday came in the first half and they came early on. Derry, despite knowing the huge importance of a victory, started poorly and were on the back foot from the start. Bangor had a strong wind pushing them on and they held Derry in their own  from the off, evengtually getting their reward for their strong start after five minutes. The visitors pressure told as front row Phil Whyte forced his way over through a crowd of bodies. Rhys Larmour converted and Bangor had the perfect start at Judges Road.To their credit, Derry responded in the best possible manner as they levelled almost immediately.The score owed everything to the hard work and tenacity of David Ferguson who took his team forward with a driving run. He was eventually stopped but offloaded to the lightning quick Simon Logue, who eluded a number of challenges before scoring right under the posts, giving Alex McDonell an easy conversion to make it -.That did not prove to be a precursor to a high-scoring game however, the deteriorating conditions making it dficult for both teams to showcase their attacking ability. It was Bangor who took control through sheer will and they put Derry onto the back foot again as they sought to restore their lead. Mounting pressure from the visitors saw Derry penalised and referee Keane Davison awarded a penalty try and the hosts had it all to do again at -.The half time break gave Derry a chance to re-evaluate their position and come again, but the worsening conditions only added to the challenge facing them. It was Bangor who had something to hold onto and they emerged after the break to take the game to the hosts again.Derry were better overall in that second period, but impatience and bad decision making cost them progression and momentum, while at times they had to dig deep to stay in the game as Bangor pushed them right back into their own  again. The defence at times was superb, but this was a game that they needed to win, and it just was not happening in attack, each small opening quickly shut down as much by their own play as by Bangor defending. It was an ultimately frustrating second half, and a result which has serious repercussions for Derrys season. There are now six games remaining and unless results improve Derry will have a very uncomfortable few weeks ahead of them. Tullamore visit Judges Road this week for a game which has now taken on extreme importance for the home side, who have to dig deep, not for the first time in recent seasons, to ensure that the club remain in Division C for next season, at the very minimum. At the moment, the weather is the least of their concerns. googletag.cmd.push TeamsCity of Derry: James Hamilton, David Ferguson, Quermy Wamerdam, Gerard Doherty, Criag Huey, Stephen Corr, Tiernan Thornton, Richard Baird, Ricardo Schneider, Alex McDonnell, Thomas Cole, Dennis Posternak, David Graham, Callum OHagan, Simon Logue. : Ross Harkin, Barry Laverty, Stephen Kelly, Neil Burns, David Lapsely.Bangor RFC: Phil Whyte, Andrew Shaw, JP Leary, Craig Burton, Michael Ferguson, David Bradford, Jamie Clegg, Mike Weir, Alistair Lockhart, Rhys Larmour, Connor Scallon, Zack Kerr, Mark Widdowson, Nathan Graham, Logan Norman. : Even Welland, Andrew Jackson, Andrew Smyth, Max Preston, Ryan Young.Referee: Keane Davison googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Local council officials say that they are committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site.They hope that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what residents and traders would like to see and what would work at this particular site.The development brief for the town centre location is expected to outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the Irish Street location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Downpatrick councillor Oonagh Hanlon has welcomed confirmation that a so-called soft market testing exercise is to proceed shortly.ldquoThis will allow potential developers and interested parties an opportunity to visit the Irish Street site during a planned open day. This will allow them to give their views on the potential of the site and point out any likely constraints within any proposed project, she explained.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoThe feedback provided will be used to assist the Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council to prepare a development brief for the site.ldquoThe regeneration project for the former police base site provides an opportunity to regenerate Downpatrick town centre. We are looking at the opportunity of a generation to restore a vibrant town centre location and build on the ongoing regeneration of the Irish Street area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12th February 2020 Down Cathedral.jpg","title":"Down Cathedral receives recognition for tourism  ","story":"DOWN Cathedral in Downpatrick has been officially recognised for giving visitors a warm welcome.The Welcome Ministry of Down Cathedral received special recognition from CIE Tours International at a recent awards ceremony in Dublin.The awards were based on feedback from over , CIE customers surveyed throughout the year.Dean Henry Hull and cathedral administrator Sharon McVeigh collected the award at a ceremony at Dublinrsquos Christ Church Cathedral last month.Down Cathedral was one of only seven locations in Ulster to receive a merit award, along with Hillsborough Castle and the Giantrsquos Causeway.Dean Hull explained that welcome is at the heart of our ministry in Down Cathedral.ldquoOver , people visit the cathedral each year.

He hopes, however, that he has allayed their immediate fears by stressing that he would not tolerate bad behaviour on his premises. He was willing to give a lead to stop it.He made the point to objectors that the ldquosinister element was already in the town and he did not want trouble any more than other shopkeepers or residents who had suffered at the hands of vandals.DOWNPATRICK mdash A young Downpatrick pop group has made a spectacular comeback on the local music trail after a two-year layoff.The former Sunbeams, now calling themselves Memphis, have been travelling up and down the country fulfilling engagements in halls, clubs and hotels.Ironically it was transport problems which forced them off the road in  but they have since been organising their comeback and are now better equipped and more experienced.Their repertoire is packed with the latest sounds and such is their wide selection of numbers that they played non-stop at alast month for five and a half hours.The group is fronted by the delectable and talented Janet Wilcox who is joined by her brother Stewart , Patrick McAuley , Danny Skeffingtonand Philip Hynds .Up to now most of their engagements have ben south of the border but they are now ready to make their mark up north, particularly around Co Down.BALLYKINLAR mdash Portaferry Dramatic Society will present the play lsquoIs the Priest at Homersquo  in the Parochial Hall, Ballykinlar, tomorrow night at pm.Written by the internationally famed Joseph Tomelty, himself a former resident of the town, the play is set in a priestrsquos home in a small in Northern Ireland during the early s.It is currently enjoying a very successful run in parochial and community halls throughout the Ards and Lecale peninsula, and indeed, in response to public demandperformances are being planned at some venues.Two of the playwrightrsquos brothers are members of the society, with Jim Tomelty playing the leading role of the curate.

But I am committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives across Northern Ireland.ldquoI will be assessing the pressures across my department reflecting on my priorities, the commitments in the lsquoNew Decade: New Approachrsquo document and the budget made available for the period ahead.Ms Mallon said that as a result, it is therefore ldquotoo early to comment on specic schemes such as the Ballynahinch bypass.Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.During last weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, there was across-the-board political support for a motion seeking a meeting with Ms Mallon and seniors roads engineers to discuss the Ballynahinch scheme.It was tabled by Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who is keen to see work starting on the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads.He said the scheme has been shovel ready for some time and is hoping the Department for Infrastructure will allocate funding to allow construction work, which is expected to take in excess of  months to complete, to begin.Cllr Walker argued that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has missed out on signicant roads funding for decades, with many major schemes constructed in other parts of the Province.He added: ldquoThe time has come for this council to demand its fair share of infrastructure funding. I have been a councillor for over  years and the bypass issue has been raised during every one of them.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason described Ballynahinch as the ldquogateway to the wider South Down area through which all traffic must pass, including HGVs. She said this not only frustrates drivers who are part of the through traffic, but increases tension and danger for those living, shopping and working in the town.Cllr Mason said that housing is also being permitted up to the line of the planned new road and includes the potential for a park and ride site.She added: ldquoThe bypass has been proposed since the s and for decades local community and political representatives from all parties have demanded this new road. The new infrastructure minister must signal the start of work on the multi-million pound road scheme.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess is also keen to see work on the bypass get underway and hopes that Ms Mallon will also formally sign off the scheme to upgrade the final section of the A between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden in Saintfield.He said: ldquoThe bypass is critically important to the social and economic regeneration of not only Ballynahinch, but the wider South Down area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12th February 2020 New Queens.jpg","title":"New queens of Ulster  ","story":"ST Maryrsquos High School, Downpatrick, lted the prestigious Erne Cup for the first time at the Mid Ulster Sports Arena, Cookstown, last Wednesday afternoon with a blistering display of attacking football.Victory was no more than the local girls deserved when they gained revenge for last seasonrsquos heartbreaking cup final defeat to the same opposition.St Maryrsquos started the game strongly and turned their possession into scores with an early goal from Saulrsquos Cara Doran settling the nerves.The Enniskillen girls were simply not allowed to play their vaunted expansive game and Katie Convie raced in almost immediately to make it - to - when she capitalised on a poor kick-out.St Fanchearsquos had no intention of giving up their title without a fight and replied with three consecutive points. However, a buoyant St Maryrsquos outfit replied with points from Cora Convery, Alishia Lundy and Shannon Sloan to maintain their six-point lead.Six points quickly became  by the half-time break as St Maryrsquos continued to terrorise St Fanchearsquos and scores from Doran , Abi Murphyand the lethal Shannon Sloangave the locals a commanding - to - lead.St Franchearsquos came out fighting in the second half, scoring a goal and two points without reply to reduce the arrears to  point, but that was as good as it got as St Maryrsquos quickly regained the initiative and went for broke.They certainly put the foot on the gas and points from Erin Sands, Katie Convie and Cara Doran had St Maryrsquos well clear St Fanchearsquos kept on to the bitter end and forced a great save form St Marys goalkeeper Fia McFaul as they tried to get back into contention.However, McFaul and her defensive wall of Keely OrsquoNeill, player of the match Nora Maguire, team captain Neva Loudon, Katie Black, Louise Lundy and Lucy Morgan kept St Fanchearsquos at bay.At midfield, Eimear Teggart and Erin Sands dominated throughout the game and kept their dazzling forward busy with a constant supply of good ball.Abi Murphy, Cara Doran, Alishia Lundy, Cora Convery, Shannon Sloan and Katie Convie were literally unplayable and gave the St Fanchearsquos defence a torrid time all afternoon.St Maryrsquos: Fia McFaul, Keely OrsquoNeill, Nora Maguire, Neva Loudon, Katie Black, Louise Lundy, Lucy Morgan, Eimear Teggart, Erin Sands, Abie Murphy, Cara Doran, Alishia Lundy, Cora Convie, Shannon Sloan, Katie Convie.

Local authority officials hope that work on the much-needed project can start within four years.News of the new leisure centre plan, exclusively revealed in the Recorder last October, is being discussed by senior council officials and local politicians and recently topped the agenda during a special workshop examining the way forward.Among the proposals being examined are building a new complex at the rear of the current Newcastle Centre, which enjoys protected status. This would also result in the current outdoor Tropicana swimming pool being bulldozed.Local politicians were recently presented with an update on progress on a new leisure proposal, with council officials confirming this week that a review of ious feasibility studies and their findings is being considered by the organisation.While the local authority said that it is not yet in a position to confirm any plans or timelines in relation to the Newcastle Centre or indeed the Tropicana, it insists any new-build will not encroach on the promenade at the rear.Most signicantly, the council has confirmed that any commissioning of a full economic appraisal and business case would involve consultations, including public meetings, as part of the process.Council officials say that they are ldquoacutely aware of the need for improved leisure provision in Newcastle and are keen to address criticism that on wet days in the resort, there is little provision for both residents and tourists.While redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre, which forms part of the Annesley Buildings, is one option moving forward, there are suggestions that given the age of the building, the scale of the work involved an the constraints of the site, a new-build at the rear would be more most cost-effective.One of the key issues the council will have to address is how it intends to replace the Tropicana , as widely expected, it will be bulldozed. There are those pushing for an indoor water facility which would be available all year round.Council officials are also keen to ensure that the redevelopment of the Main Street site is in keeping with a part of the resort where millions of pounds have been invested over recent years. Serious consideration will also have to be given to on-site car parking, included adequate disabled provision.In addition, council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive. Despite a number of attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed with local church officials, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl to develop a new store and dedicated base for the Mourne Mountain Rescue Team.Councillors are keen for the local authority to take the lead and ensure that Newcastle boasts an ultra-modern community and leisure facility.They say that the provision of a new centre for residents and visitors is long overdue and that a resort the size of Newcastle should and must have adequate leisure provision. Some councillors are keen to see a family fun pool in the proposed new-build.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed that several feasibility studies and strategic reports have been compiled in relation to the Newcastle Centre.She also confirmed that a recent review of the feasibility studies and their findings has been completed and is being considered by the local authority.ldquoUntil further scoping works are carried out, the council cannot confirm any plans or timelines in relation to the Newcastle Centre or the Tropicana, said the spokeswoman.She added: ldquoHowever, encroaching on to the promenade is not anticipated.

Ryan explained how a friendship forged in football gave birth to what is believed to be the only dedicated retro football shop in Northern Ireland.He said: “Pete and I are both Bangor fans – that’s a real labour of love – but we didn’t know each other until we met through work. We worked together for years in Yell where we pretty much talked about football non-stop.A Linfield shirt from  “The idea to start selling shirts online came after I’d been over to watch the Frampton fightand I went to the Classic Football Shirts Shop in Manchester. It’s  times bigger than the shop we have here.“I was with my fiancee at the time, now my we, and I said to her I’m going to try and do something like this online. I know how to do marketing, I love football, social media is easy enough when you know what you’re doing so I thought, I’ll give it a go. She didn’t object so that was a good start.“I started doing the shirts online last December. I got a bit of traction so I applied for a stall at St George’s in December and again in August.“I was getting married in July so I probably should have only been concentrating on that and nothing , but then I found out this unit in Smithfield was available. The Northern Ireland Subbeteo print is the top seller“Just before I was getting married – I think it was only a couple of days – I signed for the unit. Just before we got married I had to break the news to my we that I now owned a shop.“Around that time I spoke to Pete about coming on board. He said, ‘you don’t know what you’re doing, I don’t know what I’m doing, let’s see what we can do together’.”Askedthe dynamic changes when something you love becomes your job, Pete said: “I could never see us getting bored of it, I think I’ll forever be in that bubble, it’s something I love. “People work in office jobs and talk about football all day, that’s what we were like. Now we’ve got a set up where we can talk about football to whoever comes in and it’s part of the job.”Some of retro kit coasters for saleRyan commented: “On the business side of things we’re talking to clubs, striking up partnerships with other companies. Everything revolves around a love of football.”Pete said: “It’s good getting into the business side of it. There’s a buzz that comes from speaking to commercial managers of football clubs, trying to strike up partnerships.“It’s really easy to speak to people over here, quite a few clubs have heard of us.”He continued: “We’ve four clubs from the Irish League we’re in partnership with – Portadown, Linfield, Glentoran and Cltonville – and we’re branching across into England too.”At the moment the NI Classic Shirt Co is a part time venture, with the shop open on Thursday afternoonsand Fridays and Saturdays from . to .pm.Pete said: “We’re hoping to get full time. We’re going after clubs in England, Scotland and the League of Ireland as well as more local clubs. If they put in orders of a lot of units that can allow us to get a regular income and go full time.The interior of the shop in Smithfield market“We want to do as much Irish League stuff as we can with every club, that’s including the Championship. It would be great to get everyone on board. We’ve got a concept that can work with any club in the world.”Some of the shop’s best selling items are art prints of Subbuteo players from the Irish League or national team in kits from the eras in which they played. Another popular line sees a selection of classic kits displayed on coasters, mugs, T-shirts and art prints.And for those who like memorabilia they can wear the shop has a great range of old shirts, some match-worn.The strike partners leading the retro football revolution in Northern Ireland talked about some of their key team mates in their bid to climb the commercial ladder.Ryan said: “Tom Woodsdoes the Subbuteo prints. I approached him way back in the summer. I saw what he was doing with teams all over the UK. I commissioned him to do the Northern Ireland one which is a fantastic seller for us. “It’s kits from ious eras worn by  of the best ever players – there’s nothing like this available anywhere .“For the Subbuteo designs the club sends us photos of the players, we send them onto Tom and he works his magic. “We’ve also got him to do some Irish Leagues teams that we’ve teamed up with.” Pete continued: “With Hally Designs, they produce artwork featuring classic kits and you can turn them into prints or coasters or mugs or T-shirts. “They also do art prints of classic moments like when we beat England -. “We persuaded them to branch into the Irish League.”Ryan said: “There’s always new ideas out there, new brands to team up with.”In one of the framed prints by Hally Designs I spot the dubious yellow Broomhill kit which Glenavon wore in . It’s a kit I still own, but can’t recall wearing this side of the millennium.“Some of the worst kits are the best loved,” commented Ryan. “Some of them are an acquired taste. The fans love the Cltonville Kit Kat kit, we keep selling out of that on the coasters.”As well as the bespoke printed items, the shop is home to an array of old football programmes and some rare football shirts.Pete, an Arsenal fan, is particularly proud the shop has recently acquired the club’s yellow and blue ‘bruised banana’ away kit from - as well as a ‘Bergkamp ’ Holland shirt from .He said: “Bergkamp was the top man for me. It’ll pain me to sell those shirts but that’s how a business works.”Ryan said: “When I say we get shirts from all over the world I’m not trying to be vague, they genuinely come from all over the world. “There’s a Linfield top in there I got from Hong Kong. We’ve worked with collectors in Thailand, we’ve got stuff from America. “We get stuff locally as well, for example we sold a ‘ Red Star Belgrade top that had belonged to a guy who lived just outside Belfast. It was bought by someone in Miami, Florida. That shirt has done some miles.“There’s a Rangers match-worn Alex Cleland in there with number two on the back. It came from a collector in Asia.“We do get requests from people looking for specic shirts. There’s a network of collectors you can put a message out to and see what people have.”Of the resurgence in the Irish League that has helped boost the sales of memorabilia, Pete said: “We’re finding a lot of people are coming back to Glentoran and there’s been a big cash injection at Larne. “Some matches are on BBC, some on Sky Sports. You are getting good crowds again, it’s coming back.“Just last week we sold a the Glentoran home kit from - by auction for £. I reckon it would have cost about £ to £ at the time.“The Irish League is our bread and butter, but we want to branch out into the lower leagues in England and Scotland. “We’d especially love to get our own club Bangor on board. There’s a big fanbase still there.”Ryan said: “We’ve spoken to a few Irish League players on Twitter – we’ve got feedback from Joe Gormley and Liam Boyce, they both like their versions on the Cltonville Subbuteo print.”Ryan continued: “We don’t come from a retail background, we’re just football fans.“Initially I was just emailing every address I could find, pitching to them and explaining what I was trying to do. Now we’re speaking to clubs on the phone.“Obviously George Best put Northern Ireland on the map but recently with us doing well in the Euros people are paying attention outside of here.”While the online shop is rising in prominence the lads are trying to spread the word that they have a physical shop in Smithfield as well. “So many people come in to the shop and say they didn’t know we were here,” said Ryan. “Now they’re coming once a month to see what new things we’ve got in. Word of mouth for us is massive, customers telling their friends.“In most sports shops in Northern Ireland you can only get the most recent kits from the main Premier League, European and Scottish teams. We’re trying to offer something a bit dferent.”\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Cecilia is on the wireless issuing a weather warning and my son is in the back seat asking mewe’re going to be late for school.By Jonny McCambridgeWednesday, th February , : am\"\"Parallel parking, easier to spell than executeWe may well be late. If we are it will have been caused by his insistence on wearing his Incredible Hulk pants today, a demand which led to a panicked last minute inventory of damp garments hung on steamy radiators. However, it seems uncharitable to mention that now so instead I just grit my teeth and tighten my grip on the steering wheel.I’ve almost driven past before I notice the gap between two stationary cars. On a dark, snowy morning a parking space near the school is as rare as a newborn with whiskers, so I hurriedly apply the brakes and put on the left indicator.However, as soon as I begin to reverse I feel something is not right, it’s an instinct which tells me that the positioning of the car is not quite as it should be. Perhaps I’m a little bit too far forward, or too far back. Or maybe I don’t turn the steering wheel far enough, or too much. I know from habit it’s wrong but I keep going.I attempt to straighten the vehicle and, to be fair, some of it is in the parking space. Unfortunately more of it is encroaching onto the road and blocking the flow of traffic. I look out the side window, I can see the footpath which I want to park beside. It’s definitely within walking distance. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...So I start trying to get my car closer to that path. I turn the steering wheel one way and reverse a little, then I turn the wheel the other way and go forward. I seem to be further from the pavement now.I try switching the direction that I’m turning the wheel. Now the front of my car mounts the footpath while the rear hangs out towards the middle of the carriageway, asI’m attempting some sort of audacious road-block.My son, in the back seat, is watching me. He is impassive.‘What are you doing daddy ’‘I’m trying to park the car son.’‘But why are you driving on the footpath daddy ’‘It’s all because of your flipping Incredible Hulk pants!’ I answer unconvincingly.Several minutes pass tortuously like this before I concede what has become clear, that I’m going to have to start again. I put on my right indicator and pull again into the busy school run traffic. The other cars stop and wait, growling impatiently while I steady myself, select reverse gear and try once again to execute the parallel park.But there’s an inevitability to my ultimate failure now. I’m flustered and a little embarrassed and my hands seem to have lost their dexterity. Conscious that I was too far out last time I over-compensate with the steering wheel and soon feel the bump as one rear tyre lts onto the footpath.I try to straighten up but, such is my panic, that I’ve lost the ability to distinguish left from right. I jerk wildly at the steering wheel and feel the bump as my second rear tyre mounts the pavement. Now the front of my car is hanging out in the middle of the road, forcing traffic to go round it.And then I just give up. Or to put it another way, my brain decides to close down. I’ve noticed this state of vacillation come over me before in moments of great stress. While my body is still in the car my mind has taken itself off to a sunnier place, a golden meadow where I’m playing with a labrador pup and picking daisies. It’s very enjoyable for a few moments, until a blast of a horn brings me back to reality. I look at my son in the back seat, his angelic features fixed on me.‘Why has your face gone so red daddy ’It’s not the fact that I’m not very good at parallel parking which bothers me, I’ve long ago reconciled myself to that failing. It’s the fact that I’m embarrassing myself in public. Again. I’ve convinced myself that everyone will be talking about me. Again.Back in my days of therapy I used to chat to a lot of counsellors who attempted to help change the way I think. If a brain tends to dwell on the negative then there are techniques which can be used to separate thought from emotion, fact from prejudice, to teach the mind to be less self-critical. Part of this is reminding myself that other people obviously have better things to talk about than my deficiencies.But on this morning, with my car jutting out onto a road at an unnatural angle and causing a traffic jam, it’s a struggle to believe that. Not only have I convinced myself that my pathetic parking will be all of the talk of the village for days, but I also fear that Netflix have already commissioned a  part series on the debacle, with Daniel Day-Lewis talked out of retirement to bring my tortured soul to le on the small screen.There is nothing  to be done but to abandon the parking attempt altogether, to find another space far away where there are fewer cars. Swaziland would be good.And so I drive away. In my rear-view mirror I’m sure I can see a granny parking a giant x in the same space on the first attempt. I drive around the corner and up the hill further away from the school. I park in a quieter spot, away from the constipation of congestion.I turn off the engine and watch some of the other parents rushing with their children towards the school gates. Their faces are strained against the weather and it’s obvious that they don’t notice me in . I relax because I can see things more clearly now. These people are not bothered with my deficiencies at parking or anything . They have their own lives. I doubt nowany of them are even aware of me, let alone discussing my parallel parking.Reassured, I step out of the car. My shoe slips on the snow and I slide painfully onto my backside in the middle of the pavement.A young mother has to stop suddenly to avoid treading on my head.I begin to vacillate again. I think I’ll just lie here in the snow for a bit.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

More than two years on, a play he wrote based on the Good Friday Agreement has premiered in London, raising money for CALM – the Campaign Against Living Miserably – and getting rave reviews.The play ‘On McQuillian’s Hill’ features Helena Bereen, known for her roles in films ‘Hunger’ and ‘The Devil’s Doorway’, and as a stalwart of Belfast’s theatre scene. In spite of a long and busy career, the opportunity to work in London never presented itself ... until now.Set in the aftermath of the Good Friday Agreement, the play written in  centres around IRA man Fra Maline. With peace on a kne-edge, bitter memories, family secrets and lies long buried in the bog threaten to resurface as an accidental family reunion descends into pitch black farce.

Those were dferent times, and that was a very dferent experience.”Playwright Crilly was an acclaimed writer and actor, who had long since given up penning plays and treading the boards. Exchanging full houses for social housing, at the time of his death he was working at Peabody Housing Trust, where few of his colleagues knew he had been involved in the theatre at all, let alone that he was an award-winning playwright, and had worked as an actor at the highest level, including time with the Royal Shakespeare Company and a litany of television appearances.Doreen Productions formed for the sole purpose of introducing Crilly’s work to a new audience. ‘On McQuillan’s Hill’ opened at the Finborough Theatre, directed by Belfast’s Jonathan Harden. Mr Harden said: “There’s a real possibility that the play could have been lost. The sad reality is that had Joe survived, this production would never have happened. We are here, in so many ways, because like  others in the UK every day, a man took his own le. Organisations like CALM are the best defence we have against stories that end like Joe’s.”CALM runs a free and confidential helpline and webchat for anyone who needs to talk about le’s problems, available in NI and across the UK.‘On McQuillan’s Hill’ runs until February .\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world. Getting drunk and off your head with your mates ndash thatrsquos like winning the lottery when yoursquore that age.ldquoI loved it. But then it took its toll on my mental health. Especially the drugs part of it.ldquoI needed to do something about it and thatrsquos when I started my fitness journey.ldquoWith my addictive personality, when I do something, Irsquove got to do it ndash not just dip my toes in.ldquoI started looking into veganism because a lot of endurance athletes were vegan. The more I researched it the more it started making sense to me.ldquoI love animals. Irsquove got a dog and I wouldnrsquot eat him. Whatrsquos the dference between a dog and a pig  All these things started making sense to me.ldquoAs soon as I became vegan, I felt healthier. So many people were trying to put me off it.ldquoBut on a vegan diet, I did The Decker, which is  full Iron Men in  days.ldquoNow Irsquom looking at doing the Double Decker which is  in  days. On my th birthday Irsquoll be doing  of something for  years.ldquoItrsquos another way of proving to people that veganism helps me, and that age is but a number.Pritchard became vegan in  and began to film his own cooking show on YouTube. In , the BBC aired the first series of Dirty Vegan.ldquoIf yoursquod told me  years ago that Irsquod be sitting here with you now and talking about vegan cooking books, I would I have laughed in your face, he said.Pritchard said that he was forced to leave Twitter last year because of abuse from online trolls and members of the Welsh farming community.Why were people so hostile ldquoBecause of guilt. Anger does it. Cognitive dissonance. Theyrsquore too lazy to change or they donrsquot want to believe it.ldquoBut the evidence is there. What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit. Therersquos   arguing about meat and veganism.ldquoWersquore all arguing amongst ourselves like lunatics. This show is just there for people to enjoy. ldquoTherersquos a bit of fun in it. Therersquos a lot of education.ldquoWhen it goes out on TV, I get a lot of positive messages from people saying theyrsquove cut down on meat.

I stressed my view that companies responsible for defects in construction must take full responsibility and urgently recty them at their own cost.Some of these housing issues are devolved, and I paid tribute to work the Welsh Government has done around fire safety, with the ground-breaking law on sprinklers in , and the ban this week on using combustible cladding on high-rise buildings.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here. Manufacturing Month NI, led by Manufacturing NI, will run for the entire month of March. It will include a series of events, business breakfasts, seminars, workplace tours, and the flagship annual Anchor High leadership summit will be held across Northern Ireland to highlight local manufacturing success stories, address major challenges as we enter the new decade, and inspire the next generation of manufacturers and engineers. The event, sponsored by KPMG, Siemens, Willis Towers Watson, Barclays, and Invest NI, Manufacturing Month NI will bring together industry leaders, politicians and policy experts, young people and schools, and other business leaders to celebrate manufacturers and engineers, and explore and discuss the challenges which face the industry in Northern Ireland. “We are very pleased to be launching the inaugural Manufacturing Month NI, taking place this March,” Stephen Kelly, chief executive, Manufacturing NI, said. “The manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland is the foundation of our regional economy. Manufacturing Month is a celebration of the great people, in great local companies, making great products used at home and around the world. From food processing and pharmaceuticals to aeronautical technology and new, emerging tech like AI and machine learning, Northern Ireland punches well above its weight when it comes to producing world-class products and services.” “This new initiative not only celebrates the people who make our manufacturing sector the world leader that it is but will create a legacy and a pathway for the next generation of sector leaders. A key feature of Manufacturing Month NI will be a major outreach and engagement programme with schools and regional colleges, focused on promoting the sector to young people, developing the crucial skills they need as they enter the industry.” “We hope to see as many companies as possible across theand breadth of Northern Ireland get involved with Manufacturing Month NI. We are keen to highlight new products, new initiatives, workplace tours, business expansion, and everything  in between to showcase the strength and quality of our local manufacturing sector.” And Economy Minister, Diane Dodds, said: “I commend Manufacturing NI for this new initiative which celebrates one of Northern Ireland’s most vital sectors. Northern Ireland has a long and proud history of manufacturing and engineering brilliance. Manufacturing Month NI will highlight the immense talent of the local sector.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says.
