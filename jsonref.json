Crime rates soared sky high with drug dealers and prostitutes openly working the streets of Gotham nonstop and the city was just about in financial ruin. Award-winning photographer Helen M. Stummer took thousands of images showcasing impoverished neighborhoods over her 40-year career. The photo above was captured in 1979 of a young child with his hands over his head staring on East 6th Street in the Lower East Side          Similar scenes of danger and destruction could also be found just across the Hudson River in impoverished neighborhoods like Newark, New Jersey – which at one point was named the worst city of all during the time period. Stummer spent more than a decade in the city capturing run-down areas like the one pictured above on Clinton Avenue and Peshine Avenue in 1982           Stummer, who is a visual sociologist, explained to DailyMail.com that she spent countless hours building relationships with many of the people she focused her lens on. One of those people include the woman pictured above named Shirley, who Stummer often photographed. The image above was taken in 1979 on East 6th Street in the Lower East Side           ‘I stay year in and year out and I become friends with people,’ the 82-year-old said. Stummer\u0027s relationship with Shirley developed with the mother allowing her inside of her home. The photographer captured the above image of Shirley with her twin daughter playing in 1978          Stummer also took her camera along with her to a Ku Klux Klan rally in 1979 in New Jersey (pictured above). At the time, she explained that she worked at a local newspaper as a reporter          Of the experience, she said: ‘I mean it is a scary sight and I had never seen anything like that in reality. But I kept photographing everyone who was just hanging around out there. I don’t really remember much of what really went on because I was so scared.’ Pictured above is another photograph from that same KKK rally One of the striking images Stummer captured in 1979 shows children playing in water from a broken fire hydrant while a mother holds her adorable baby girl up to dip her feet in the street water.‘You don’t realize how cold that hydrant water really is. I don’t know how that baby is in the water or any of the children,’ Stummer said of the photo.‘I put my feet in there and it is beyond freezing, honestly it is so cold. But I loved that photo and capturing that moment with the mother, named Shirley, holding the baby who was named Michelle.’She added that she spent a lot of time with Shirley and others in the then-impoverished neighborhood, especially at the Children’s Aide Society, which was located on East 6th Street at the time.‘What I saw at East 6th street, I knew at that moment, it was an intuitive thing a gut thing, that I knew this was the place I wanted to photograph,’ she revealed. ‘And my whole foundation seemed to shift when I experienced that.‘I would go on the street and I became involved with the families. And that’s how you get intimate photographs, you can’t just go in and do it. It doesn’t happen like that you have to spend time and that’s what I did.’But Stummer said she was forced to stop photographing the area around the Children’s Aide Society when she was surrounded by drug dealers who were taking over the community.‘I would go to the Children’s Aide Society and go on the street once or twice a week until the drug dealers told me I had to leave,’ she stated.          Stummer seemingly first kicked off her photography career when she captured hundreds of images showing the Lower East Side thanks to her assignment while she was a student at the International Center of Photography. Pictured above are two young girls holding dolls in front of a building on East 6th Street in 1977          Stummer shared that when she first went out to take photos, she was so scared and her hands shook when she held the camera for the first six months. But eventually she settled into the community and was a regular on the scene. Pictured above is a scene on East 6th Street taken by Stummer in 1980          She also started to venture into Newark, New Jersey in the beginning of the 80s when crime was rampant in the then-impoverished neighborhood. Pictured above is a boy walking in the fog in Newark in 1982 that Stummer captured           She explained that her experiences early on gave her the confidence to go to neighborhoods where most people were scared to step foot in. Pictured above is a young girl named Danielle in 1990 holding a Rainbow Brite doll on the rooftop of her building in Newark           One of the most striking images Stummer captured is above showing three young children playing with dirt near illegally dumped tires outside of their residential building in 1992. ‘I photographed there for 15 years. Trucks would come in the middle of the night and illegally dump tires and other things there,’ she said. ‘It made me so angry and I would take these photographs to the health department and the housing department, but nothing would happen‘1980 the heavy drugs came in and everyone was scared. I mean everyone. One day I was going to the Children’s Aide Society like I usually did and before I knew it there were a bunch of men surrounding me.‘They had the chains and big hats on and seemed like they were nine feet tall because I was so scared. They told me they didn’t want me taking pictures anymore and said if they see me with my camera out one more time, it’s done, it’s over.’Luckily, Stummer escaped from being harmed during the incident and didn’t return back to the area for years.Another image that Stummer captured shows members of the Ku Klux Klan at a 1979 rally in  New Jersey. At the time, Stummer explained that she was working as a reporter at a local newspaper and that she decided to go and take her camera.‘When I saw them, my first reaction was to laugh. I was going to tell them “please this is not Halloween”, but it took only a few short seconds after that thought that my blood went really cold,’ she said of the experience.‘I mean it is a scary sight and I had never seen anything like that in reality. But I kept photographing everyone who was just hanging around out there. I don’t really remember much of what really went on because I was so scared.’The 82-year-old New Jersey native also documented Newark’s Central Ward for many years where she became friends with many of her subjects.          Another captivating photo she took shows the boy above named Ali who jumped into her frame at the last second. Stummer said she was focusing her camera on the men behind the boy outside of a building in Newark in 1999          The striking photos Stummer captured are currently on display at the ICP Gallery at Mana Contemporary Arts in Jersey City, New Jersey. The exhibit , titled ‘Risk Life and Lens’, is on limited viewing at the gallery and coincides with the publication of her new book Risking Life and Lens: A Photographic Memoir.One of the captivating images she captured in 1992 shows three young children playing in the dirt near tires that were dumped just outside of a their home at 322 Irving Boulevard in Newark.‘I photographed there for 15 years. Trucks would come in the middle of the night and illegally dump tires and other things there,’ she said. ‘It made me so angry and I would take these photographs to the health department and the housing department, but nothing would happen.‘The landlord wouldn’t fix those violations no matter what. What angered me so much is that it was such an injustice that kids had to play in these horrid places.‘They would get rashes and the parents were just so tired. They complained so much but never got anywhere with anything and so many of them were sick and it was just a total injustice to me.’The striking photos Stummer captured are currently on display at the ICP Gallery at Mana Contemporary Arts in Jersey City, New Jersey. The exhibit, titled ‘Risk Life and Lens’, is on limited viewing at the gallery and coincides with the publication of her new book Risking Life and Lens: A Photographic Memoir.Horrific moment Chinese boy is mauled by pit bull outside pet shopHorrific moment three friends film themselves drowning in a pondMoment driver caught on dashcam recklessly undercutting trafficIncredible footage captures fascinating Karst cave in ChinaHuge herd of cows run riot on the street after escaping from farmBaby rabbit escapes jaws of cat only to be swooped up by owlPolice rescue kids dragged onto roof by hallucinating momMorgan Freeman accused of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviourJudge orders 30-year-old to move out of his parents houseShocking moment man livestreams when driving and causes crash"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/24/16/4C96947D00000578-5767855-image-m-28_1527177315530.jpg","title":"Apprentice electrician gets property ladder aged just 18","story":"    Aaron with his girlfriend Jessica King, 21, who he met through his job as a racing driverBarrister specialising in property law who built extension...Couple who were refused a mortgage because of their bad...Share this article"},{"url":null,"title":"When Red Nose Day 2018 USA it","story":"According to the Red Nose Day website, the fundraiser has helped eight million children, with nearly a million of those receiving educational services and 6.79 million getting essential medical services.Red Nose Day also tackles child homelessness and says part of the money has helped nearly 60,000 homeless teens in the US.Who was Jack Johnson?

Europe and Moscow are making diplomatic overtures to save the Iran deal, now under threat after the recent US withdrawal.In a joint appearance before the start of the talks, Macron said: \u0027I believe we must work together on joint initiatives. Putin meanwhile said he was ready to talk \u0027about key international issues, the resolution of which are important to both France and Russia\u0027.Mother\u0027s fury after her altar boy son, 14, is sent home from...Convicted killer, 50, who beat street drinker to death is on...Share this articlePutin handed Macron\u0027s wife Brigitte flowers as he greeted the couple late in the afternoon at the Konstantin Palace, a former residence of Peter the Great set some 12 miles outside Saint Petersburg.The meeting comes almost exactly a year since the freshly elected Macron hosted Putin in Versailles, when the French leader accused Russian media of producing \u0027lying propaganda\u0027 during a joint press conference.The trip will also see Macron address the Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum.The talks take place after US President Donald Trump in early May controversially pulled the United States out of the 2015 landmark pact with Iran that placed limits on its nuclear programme in return for easing economic sanctions.    Putin and Macron are expected to discus the crisis in Iran as well as the ongoing war in Syria           Putin held talks last week with Angela Merkel and Japan\u0027s Shinzo Abe will arrive later this weekSaving the deal provides a rare point of agreement between Moscow and European countries, which have seen relations tank in recent years over crises in Ukraine and Syria, as well as accusations of meddling in foreign elections and the poisoning of an ex-Russian spy in Britain.Alexander Baunov of the Carnegie Moscow Centre said talks over Iran will be positive. He said: \u0027Russia shares the position of the majority of the international community including Western leaders.\u0027The West has realised that a dialogue with Putin is \u0027inevitable\u0027 in order to preserve the accord, he said.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will also visit Russia at the end of the week.Baunov added: \u0027Merkel and Abe have already begun a thaw with Moscow and Macron is scared of losing the advantage that France has always had with Russia.\u0027  But there are a number of sticking points that will prevent a full rapprochement between Paris and Moscow.Chief among them is Syria, where at least 350,000 people have been killed since war broke out in 2011.Moscow intervened in 2015 to prop up its ally President Bashar al-Assad - in a move generally seen as decisive in turning around the multi-front conflict - while France has participated in strikes on regime targets.Another issue is the conflict in eastern Ukraine, which broke out after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and has so far claimed at least 10,000 lives.Paris and Moscow, along with Berlin, signed peace agreements in Minsk in 2015 that aimed to bring the fighting to a close but there is currently no end in sight.International investigators on Thursday said a missile that downed a Malaysia Airlines flight over eastern Ukraine in 2014 belonged to a Russian brigade. Moscow rejected the accusation.Before Macron\u0027s trip, Human Rights Watch also implored him to raise the issue of rights abuses with his Russian counterpart, following a crackdown on dissent and pressure on minority groups in the country.But the talks between the two presidents will not be the only bilateral activity of the day, as a raft of commercial agreements are also set to be signed during the economic forum.The presence of the French president at the forum \u0027legitimises visits by business people. Those who are worried about the risks, sanctions or criticism are covered to a certain extent by the president,\u0027 analyst Baunov said.\u0027If anything, the political leadership will get criticised for this rapprochement and not the business community.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/24/17/4C9771C900000578-0-image-m-16_1527177774764.jpg","title":"Is Roman Abramovich moving Tel Aviv","story":"Disgraced soldier kicked out of the army for offensive...Self-driving Uber \u0027saw mother-of-two pedestrian but did not...Share this articleThe Kremlin said Vladimir Putin was unaware of any attempt by Abramovich to seek Israeli citizenship.Presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: \u0027No, the Kremlin is not aware of it.

My parents ignited my property bug. When I was in my early 20s they gave me a plot of land next to their home and said I could do what I wanted with it. Battling for planning permission and studying plans allowed me to see the potential for investment. I sold it a few years later at a good profit.We bought a property in Cheshire three years ago for £850,000. I razed the ugly house and started again.We spent £500,000 building our perfect family home — four bedrooms, each with an en suite. It is now worth double what we paid and we love it. We bought the villa in Portugal in 2008 after falling in love with the area while visiting friends and built it from the ground up. It is a two-acre estate. It has four bedrooms, all en suite, with a pool and an outside kitchen and bar. It is worth around €3 million.We rent out the villa when we are not there.

Alex loves to crash there, too.We keep clothes and towels at each property. It allows us to head off to Portugal at short notice, taking just hand luggage.I do have moments at night when I wake up not knowing which home I am in, and wander off to the loo in the wrong direction!Some people who don’t know us can make jealous comments. Those in our social circle know how hard my husband and I have worked for what we have.  Sarah Cross is an interior designer and married mother of five to Oliver, 12 Jonny, ten Eloise, eight and Harry and Lottie, five. The family lives in Cambridge and also have properties in Anglesey and St Lucia. Sarah, 45, says:After a trying day juggling the demands of five children, I like to let my mind wander. It doesn’t have to go too far: just to the beaches of Anglesey or the azure sea of St Lucia. And I can do that — and still be at home!I got on the property ladder after I was awarded financial compensation. I’d been badly injured in a hit-and-run accident in London in 1995.The sum I received just about allowed us to put a deposit on our first property in West London. It was while I was renovating the flat, enjoying experimenting with fabrics and colours, that I realised I could earn a living from design and interiors.          The home is \u0027modern and practical\u0027 with an open-plan kitchen, dining room and living roomI spent my 20s and 30s getting married and having children. Yet during that time I was renovating our next home — another London flat. We sold up and moved to Cambridge in 2013, before our youngest child was born. Our detached home there is modern and practical with six bedrooms, an open-plan kitchen, dining room and living room, all painted in bright colours. It’s cosy, family chaos, but also big enough for us to all come together and have our own space, too.I’ve been going to Anglesey on holiday since I was a child. It’s a really special area for me.We bought our place there in the village of Rhoscolyn, in 2015. I think a family home is different from a holiday home. It took me a year to get it how I like it: now it’s a stunning New England beach- style house which can sleep 12. It even has a hot tub. I rent it out when we’re not there.          Sarah can let her mind wander with guaranteed sunshine at a property in St Lucia (pictured)          The home in Rhoscolyn which they bought in 2015. Sarah had often visited Anglesey as a childThe St Lucia property was an obvious choice because it is somewhere we have loved going and meeting friends for years.With guaranteed sunshine, it’s also a place where my husband can truly switch off.There was land for sale in 2016, so we went for it. It took a year to build our four-bedroom, four-bathroom home.The children all have their favourite place. As for me, wherever my family is is where I want to be at that moment.  Jane Sayce, 59, is a marketing agent, and lives with her partner, Paul, 52, an electrician. She has two children Cassie, 32, and Joshua, 33, and a grandson Zae, one. She has homes in Cyprus, Shropshire and Cleethorpes. Jane says:Ever since I was a little girl growing up in a council house in the Midlands I always knew I’d have a property overseas one day.And I was right. Today, I still get a rush of pleasure waking up to azure blue skies and a twinkling, inviting swimming pool — and ending the day with something chilled and gorgeous, as I watch the sun go down.This is the life I adore in Cyprus for five months of the year.

When I returned to the UK, I married and raised my family. I’m one of life’s grafters and so when the children finally flew the nest, I set about making my dream a reality. I sold my UK property in Staffordshire and used the proceeds to buy a place off plan in Cyprus.It took three years to build my three-bedroom dream home in the sun. I’d fly out to see the progress and gradually fell in love with the Cypriot way of life. I’m not someone who ulges the costs involved, as I regard that as personal.When it was ready three years later, I sold my house in Staffordshire and moved here full-time. Not everyone was here in Paphos permanently and before long people began to ask me to manage their property. I found it was something I not only enjoyed, but was good at.I went from managing eight to then launching my own company and marketing approximately 100 holiday homes, although today I have scaled the business back to 80 properties.

I find the summers too hot in Cyprus, and also it’s closer to Birmingham, where my grown-up children live.The wildlife is stunning I sit on the terrace and wind down while watching geese waddle by or listening to the woodpeckers in the forests.I am already thinking about my future though, which is why I have just snapped up a town property in Cleethorpes. It’s a rather chi-chi seafront flat, which I regard as a great investment. I can see it is somewhere we could both retire to when I eventually sell up.My family are rather proud of me. They know how have worked hard to achieve this. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/06/00/4BE50C2E00000578-0-image-m-22_1525561470263.jpg","title":"Look Aidan Turner dastardly MP taken shine Demelza","story":"    Heartthrob Ross Poldark carrying his wife Demelza from the sea in the popular BBC1 dramaRoss and his wife have already cheated on each other, with Demelza kissing naval officer Hugh Armitage, played by Burberry model Josh Whitehouse, in the final episode of series three.It came after she was told that Ross had kissed Elizabeth Warleggan, his first love and former fiancee.BBC made me a mincing camp joke but what\u0027s so funny about...If only he\u0027d been selling ice cream too!

up to 2041The chances of success for the unprecedented face-to-face between Trump and Kim had recently been thrown into doubt, with the U.S. President pointing a finger a China for the change in tone.On Thursday, Pyongyang hardened its rhetoric by attacking US Vice President Mike Pence as \u0027ignorant and stupid\u0027.That broadside appeared to hit a nerve with Trump, leading to him abruptly pulling out of the talks.\u0027Sadly, based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting,\u0027 read Trump\u0027s letter to Kim, which was dictated word-for-word by the US leader, according to a senior White House official. Earlier this week Trump appeared to blame Beijing for what he perceived as a \u0027change in attitude\u0027 from Kim, who visited China three weeks ago and met President Xi Jinping.\u0027There was a difference when Kim Jong Un left China the second time,\u0027 Trump said. \u0027There was a different attitude after that meeting and I was a little surprised. China has today urged the United States and North Korea to be patient and \u0027show goodwill\u0027.\u0027The recent easing situation on the peninsula is hard won, the political settlement process is faced with a rare historic opportunity,\u0027 foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a regular press conference.\u0027Under the current circumstances we hope both the DPRK and the US can cherish the recent positive progress, stay patient, show goodwill, move in the same direction and continue to stay committed to promoting the denuclearisation of the peninsula,\u0027 Lu said, using North Korea\u0027s official initials. Just before Trump announced the cancellation of the talks, North Korea declared it had \u0027completely\u0027 dismantled its nuclear test site, in a carefully choreographed move portrayed as a goodwill gesture ahead of the summit.Horrific moment

No way it can happen otherwise.\u0027\u0027If and when Kim Jong-un chooses to engage in constructive dialogue and actions, I am waiting,\u0027 he continued, punctuating the last three words.              Pentagon Chief Spokesperson Dana White (left) and Marine Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie (right) told reporters Thursday that America\u0027s armed forces are locked and loaded, and ready to strike North Korea if called upon\u0027In the meantime, our very strong sanctions, by far the strongest sanctions ever imposed, and maximum pressure campaign, will continue as it has been continuing.\u0027Trump\u0027s letter to Kim on Thursday boasted of America\u0027s gargantuan nuclear arsenal, and he drove the point home at the White House.\u0027I\u0027ve spoke to General Mattis and the Joint Chiefs of Staff,\u0027 he said. \u0027And our military, which is by far the most powerful anywhere the world – that has been greatly enhanced recently, as you all know – is ready if necessary.\u0027\u0027Likewise I have spoken to South Korea and Japan, and they are not only ready should foolish or reckless acts be taken by North Korea, but they are willing to shoulder much of the cost of any financial burden, any of the costs associated by the the United States, in operations if such an unfortunate situation is forced upon us.\u0027\u0027Hopefully, positive things will be taking place with respect to the future of North Korea,\u0027 Trump told an audience of one watching in Pyongyang. \u0027But if they don\u0027t, we are more ready than we have ever been before.\u0027 Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White told reporters that the Defense Department represents one prong of Trump\u0027s \u0027maximum pressure\u0027 strategy, which combines economic sanctions, diplomatic tension and the weight of a constant military presence.\u0027We are ready to fight tonight. That\u0027s always been the case,\u0027 said White. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/00/0351C5F5000007D0-0-image-m-10_1527202875064.jpg","title":"Ive known undertakers fizzy SNPs McEeyore QUENTIN LETTS yesterday Parliament","story":"    Just to look at John McNally (SNP, Falkirk) opening Transport Questions in the Commons yesterday was enough to plunge you into a Thursday morning pessimismFranz Kafka, setting out from his lodgings on a misty Prague morning, or the young Keats, dipping his quill into his breakfast fried egg, could not have been more melancholy.

The lava has been pouring down the flank of the volcano and into the ocean miles away.  The volcano has opened more than 20 vents in the ground that have released lava, sulfur dioxide and steam   Only one person has been seriously hurt as a result of the eruption when they were hit by a flying piece of lava The eruption has destroyed 50 buildings, including about two dozen homes.One person was seriously injured after being hit by a flying piece of lava.Activists have also warned that a geothermal power plant in Hawaii at risk of being overrun with molten lava from the erupting Kilauea Volcano is a \u0027ticking time bomb\u0027, claim local activists.Locals in the badly effected Puna district fear the fiery river of molten rock could overcome the plant which they have warned for decades was a disaster waiting to happen.And as aerial photos showed the lava flow looming closer to the perimeter of the Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV) plant, engineers worked into the night on Tuesday to cap the 11th and final well, which provides about 25 percent of the Big Island\u0027s power.As of Wednesday, lava had poured over warehouses just outside the plant and was about 100 yards from the facility as officials feared it could trigger the release of deadly hydrogen sulfate gas.On Thursday, Stovall said lava spatter from one vent was forming a wall that was helping protect the plant. Lava from that vent was shooting further into the air and producing the highest lava wall of all the vents, which was blocking molten rock from flowing north toward the plant.Plant workers have already removed 60,000 gallons of highly flammable pentane gas from the site and installed barriers and protective coverings over the area.          A satellite photo provided by DigitalGlobe shows lava coming out of fissures caused by Kilauea volcano, near Puna Geothermal Venture, a geothermal energy plant, which could explode if hit by lava           The wells at the Puna Geothermal Venture plant were plugged overnight as lava from Hawaii\u0027s Kilauea volcano inched closer to the site. The plant is pictured above on Tuesday But local activists, who for decades have argued the power plant should never have been built in a residential area, and have filed multiple lawsuits challenging its placement on Kilauea volcano, claim the danger is clear and present.Activist Kalikolehua Kanaele of the protector group Aloha Aina (Love the Living God), told DailyMail.com: \u0027This has been the greatest concern of this community for 50 years.\u0027If the wells break the gas could ignite and there could be a huge explosion. It\u0027s a ticking time bomb and we always knew this situation could arise. We just hope that a disaster can be averted and nobody gets hurt.\u0027Kanaele, 68, and others say the wells, which run as deep as 8,000ft, pose a serious risk from the lava if they overheat or are breached by underground seismic activity.If the wells break, they could release tons of flammable and toxic hydrogen sulfide into the air around the current evacuation zone, which is already choked with volcanic smog. The gas has the potential to cause huge explosions and winds could spark an emergency evacuation covering a 10-mile radius.This past two weeks the Puna district has been hit with as many as 140 smaller earthquakes every day.The PGV plant is 15 miles from the heart of the volcano, but while Ormat Technologies Inc – which runs the facility - last week insisted there was little risk of the lava reaching it, everyone\u0027s worst nightmare is coming true.Lava erupts several feet into the air in Leilani Estates area near Pahoa, Hawaii on Wednesday   A satellite photo shows lava coming out of fissures caused by Kilauea volcano, running towards the Puna coast, lower right, along Malama Ki Forest Reserve recreation area in Pahoa, Hawaii   This Wednesday photo provided by the U.S. Geological Survey shows the active fissure complex near Pahoa, Hawaii Tourism officials cheered news that a Norwegian Cruise Lines ship that tours the Hawaiian Islands would resume stopping in Kailua-Kona next week. Businesses catering to tourists on the cruise have been hurt since the company suspended Big Island port visits after the eruption began.The company said it would resume calling on Hilo, a town on the eastern side of the island closer to the lava, when conditions allow."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/24/17/4C97675400000578-5766373-image-a-1_1527179161973.jpg","title":"Security troops US nuclear missile base took LSD","story":"Nuclear guardians: Inside an Air Force unit at F.E.

Six of them were convicted in courts martial of LSD use or distribution or both.None of the airmen was accused of using drugs on duty. Yet it\u0027s another blow to the reputation of the Air Force\u0027s nuclear missile corps, which is capable of unleashing hell in the form of Minuteman 3 intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs. Although seen by some as a backwater of the US military, the missile force has returned to the spotlight as President Donald Trump has called for strengthening US nuclear firepower and exchanged threats last year with North Korea. The administration\u0027s nuclear strategy calls for hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending in coming decades.The service members accused of involvement in the LSD ring were from the 90th Missile Wing, which operates one-third of the 400 Minuteman 3 missiles that stand \u0027on alert\u0027 247 in underground silos scattered across the northern Great Plains.\u0027Ready to fight TONIGHT\u0027: Trump\u0027s Pentagon ramps up the...Kim GHOSTED us, says Trump\u0027s secretary of state after...North Korea \u0027blows up its nuclear test site\u0027 in series of...Pentagon withdraws China\u0027s invitation to major US military...Share this articleDocuments obtained by the AP over the past two years through the Freedom of Information Act tell a sordid tale of off-duty use of LSD, cocaine and other drugs in 2015 and 2016 by airmen who were supposed to be held to strict behavioral standards because of their role in securing the weapons.In response to AP inquiries, an Air Force spokesman, Lt. Col. Uriah L. Orland, said the drug activity took place during off-duty hours. \u0027There are multiple checks to ensure airmen who report for duty are not under the influence of alcohol or drugs and are able to execute the mission safely, securely and effectively,\u0027 he said.Airman 1st Class Tommy N. Ashworth was among those who used LSD supplied by colleagues with connections to civilian drug dealers.\u0027I felt paranoia, panic\u0027 for hours after taking a hit of acid, Ashworth said under oath at his court martial. He confessed to using LSD three times while off duty. The first time, in the summer of 2015, shook him up. \u0027I didn\u0027t know if I was going to die that night or not,\u0027 he said as a witness at another airman\u0027s drug trial. Recalling another episode with LSD, he said it felt \u0027almost as if I was going to have like a heart attack or a heat stroke.\u0027Airman Basic Kyle S. Morrison acknowledged at his court martial that under the influence of LSD he could not have responded if recalled to duty in a nuclear security emergency.In prosecuting the cases at F.E. Warren, the Air Force asserted that LSD users can experience \u0027profound effects\u0027 from even small amounts. It said common psychological effects include \u0027paranoia, fear and panic, unwanted and overwhelming feelings, unwanted life-changing spiritual experiences, and flashbacks.\u0027It\u0027s unclear how long before being on duty any of the airmen had taken LSD, which stands for lysergic acid diethylamide. The drug became popularized as \u0027acid\u0027 in the 1960s, and views since then have been widely split on its mental health risks. Although illegal in the US, it had been showing up so infrequently in drug tests across the military that in December 2006 the Pentagon eliminated LSD screening from standard drug-testing procedures.   At least six airmen from the 790th Missile Security Forces Squadron were buying, distributing or using the illegal hallucinogen, LSD. In this February 2016 photo, members of the unit demonstrate their training for recapturing a Minuteman missile siloAn internal Pentagon memo at the time said that over the previous three years only four positive specimens had been identified in 2.1million specimens screened for LSD.Yet Air Force investigators found those implicated in the F.E. Warren drug ring used LSD on base and off, at least twice at outdoor gatherings. Some also snorted cocaine and used ecstasy. Civilians joined them in the LSD use, including some who had recently left Air Force service, according to two officials with knowledge of the investigation. The Air Force declined to discuss this.Airman 1st Class Nickolos A. Harris, said to be the leader of the drug ring, testified that he had no trouble getting LSD and other drugs from civilian sources. He pleaded guilty to using and distributing LSD and using ecstasy, cocaine and marijuana.He acknowledged using LSD eight times and distributing LSD multiple times to fellow airmen at parties in Denver and other locations from spring 2015 to early 2016.\u0027I absolutely just loved altering my mind,\u0027 he told the military judge, blaming his decisions to use hallucinogens and other drugs on his addictive personality.Other airmen testified that it was easy to obtain LSD in a liquid form spread on small tabs of perforated white paper. Airmen ingested at least one tab by placing it on their tongue. In one episode summarized by a military judge at Harris\u0027 court martial, he and other airmen watched YouTube videos and \u0027then went longboarding on the streets of Denver while high on LSD.\u0027Harris was sentenced to 12 months in jail and other penalties, but under a pretrial agreement he avoided a punitive discharge. The lead prosecutor in that case, Air Force Capt. C. Rhodes Berry, had argued Harris should be locked up for 42 months, including nine months for the \u0027aggravating circumstance\u0027 of undercutting public trust by using hallucinogens and other drugs on a nuclear weapons base.\u0027I cannot think of anything more aggravating than being the ringleader of a drug ring on F.E. Warren Air Force Base,\u0027 Berry said at the courts martial.In all, the AP obtained transcripts of seven courts martial proceedings, plus related documents. They provide vivid descriptions of LSD trips.\u0027I\u0027m dying!\u0027 one airman is quoted as exclaiming, followed by \u0027When is this going to end?\u0027 during a \u0027bad trip\u0027 on LSD in February 2016 at Curt Gowdy State Park, about 20 miles west of Cheyenne, where F.E. Warren is located. A portion of that episode was video-recorded by one member of the group a transcript of the audio was included in court records.Others said they enjoyed the drug.\u0027Minutes felt like hours, colors seemed more vibrant and clear,\u0027 Morrison testified. \u0027In general, I felt more alive.\u0027 He said he had used LSD in high school, which could have disqualified him from Air Force service he said that his recruiter told him he should lie about it and that lying about prior drug use was \u0027normal\u0027 in the Air Force.At his court martial, Morrison acknowledged distributing LSD on the missile base in February 2016. A month later, when summoned for questioning by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, Morrison confessed and became an informant for the agency, an arrangement the Air Force said yielded legally admissible evidence against 10 other airmen. Under a pretrial agreement, he agreed to testify against other airmen and avoided a punitive discharge. He was sentenced to five months\u0027 confinement, 15 days of hard labor and loss of $5,200 in pay.Most of the airmen involved were members of two related security units at F.E. Warren - the 790th Missile Security Forces Squadron and the 90th Security Forces Squadron. Together, they are responsible for the security and defense of the nuclear weapons there as well as the missile complex.By coincidence, the No. 2 Pentagon official at the time, Robert Work, visited F.E. Warren one month before the drug investigation became public. Accompanied by an AP reporter, he watched as airmen of the 790th Missile Security Forces Squadron - whose members at the time included Harris, the accused leader of the drug ring - demonstrated how they would force their way into and regain control of a captured missile silo.Work, the deputy defense secretary, was there to assess progress in fixing problems in the ICBM force identified by then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who ordered an investigation after the AP reported on personnel, resource, training and leadership problems in 2013-14. Those problems included the firing of the general in charge of the entire ICBM force for inappropriate behavior the Air Force said was linked to alcohol abuse. A month later the AP revealed that an unpublished study prepared for the Air Force found \u0027burnout\u0027 among nuclear missile launch officers and evidence of broader behavioral problems, including sexual assaults and domestic violence. Air Force officials say the force has since rebounded.In an interview, Work said he was not aware during his visit that anything was amiss. Nor was he briefed later on the investigation. He said he wouldn\u0027t have expected to be briefed unless the Air Force found that LSD or other illegal drugs were a \u0027systemic problem\u0027 for the nuclear force, beyond the security forces group at F.E. Warren.Work said he had never heard of LSD use anywhere in the nuclear workforce.For the inexperienced members of the drug ring, Harris, the ringleader, had set out several \u0027rules\u0027 for LSD use at a gathering of several airmen in a Cheyenne apartment in late 2015 that was recorded on video. Rule No. 1: \u0027No social media at all.\u0027 He added: \u0027No bad trips. Everybody\u0027s happy right now. Let\u0027s keep it that way.\u0027But social media proved their undoing. In March 2016, one member posted a Snapchat video of himself smoking marijuana, setting Air Force investigators on their trail.As the investigators closed in, one of the accused, Airman 1st Class Devin R. Hagarty, grabbed a backpack and cash, text-messaged his mother that he loved her, turned off his cellphone and fled to Mexico. \u0027I started panicking,\u0027 he told a military judge after giving himself up and being charged with desertion.The Air Force said Hagarty was the first convicted deserter from an ICBM base since January 2013. In court, he admitted using LSD four times in 2015-16 and distributing it once, and he said he had deserted with the intention of never returning. He also admitted to using cocaine, ecstasy and marijuana multiple times. He was sentenced to 13 months in a military jail.In all, disciplinary action was taken against 14 airmen. In addition, two accused airmen were acquitted at courts martial, and three other suspects were not charged."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/24/15/4C96D5BE00000578-5767501-image-a-66_1527172603653.jpg","title":"Camel uses leathery lips munch dozens desert cacti six inch spikes","story":"    Ouch!

My parents ignited my property bug. When I was in my early 20s they gave me a plot of land next to their home and said I could do what I wanted with it. Battling for planning permission and studying plans allowed me to see the potential for investment. I sold it a few years later at a good profit.We bought a property in Cheshire three years ago for £850,000. I razed the ugly house and started again.We spent £500,000 building our perfect family home — four bedrooms, each with an en suite. It is now worth double what we paid and we love it. We bought the villa in Portugal in 2008 after falling in love with the area while visiting friends and built it from the ground up. It is a two-acre estate. It has four bedrooms, all en suite, with a pool and an outside kitchen and bar. It is worth around €3 million.We rent out the villa when we are not there.

The family lives in Cambridge and also have properties in Anglesey and St Lucia. Sarah, 45, says:After a trying day juggling the demands of five children, I like to let my mind wander. It doesn’t have to go too far: just to the beaches of Anglesey or the azure sea of St Lucia. And I can do that — and still be at home!I got on the property ladder after I was awarded financial compensation. I’d been badly injured in a hit-and-run accident in London in 1995.The sum I received just about allowed us to put a deposit on our first property in West London. It was while I was renovating the flat, enjoying experimenting with fabrics and colours, that I realised I could earn a living from design and interiors.          The home is \u0027modern and practical\u0027 with an open-plan kitchen, dining room and living roomI spent my 20s and 30s getting married and having children. Yet during that time I was renovating our next home — another London flat. We sold up and moved to Cambridge in 2013, before our youngest child was born. Our detached home there is modern and practical with six bedrooms, an open-plan kitchen, dining room and living room, all painted in bright colours. It’s cosy, family chaos, but also big enough for us to all come together and have our own space, too.I’ve been going to Anglesey on holiday since I was a child. It’s a really special area for me.We bought our place there in the village of Rhoscolyn, in 2015. I think a family home is different from a holiday home. It took me a year to get it how I like it: now it’s a stunning New England beach- style house which can sleep 12. It even has a hot tub. I rent it out when we’re not there.

It took a year to build our four-bedroom, four-bathroom home.The children all have their favourite place.

She has two children Cassie, 32, and Joshua, 33, and a grandson Zae, one. She has homes in Cyprus, Shropshire and Cleethorpes. Jane says:Ever since I was a little girl growing up in a council house in the Midlands I always knew I’d have a property overseas one day.And I was right. Today, I still get a rush of pleasure waking up to azure blue skies and a twinkling, inviting swimming pool — and ending the day with something chilled and gorgeous, as I watch the sun go down.This is the life I adore in Cyprus for five months of the year.

When I returned to the UK, I married and raised my family. I’m one of life’s grafters and so when the children finally flew the nest, I set about making my dream a reality. I sold my UK property in Staffordshire and used the proceeds to buy a place off plan in Cyprus.It took three years to build my three-bedroom dream home in the sun. I’d fly out to see the progress and gradually fell in love with the Cypriot way of life. I’m not someone who ulges the costs involved, as I regard that as personal.When it was ready three years later, I sold my house in Staffordshire and moved here full-time. Not everyone was here in Paphos permanently and before long people began to ask me to manage their property. I found it was something I not only enjoyed, but was good at.I went from managing eight to then launching my own company and marketing approximately 100 holiday homes, although today I have scaled the business back to 80 properties.

It’s a rather chi-chi seafront flat, which I regard as a great investment. I can see it is somewhere we could both retire to when I eventually sell up.My family are rather proud of me.

The style is exact, sharp and deliberate, the sense of place perfectly delineated, the characters carefully made, and the plot surprising and fully worked out.The book that changed my mindStanislaus Joyce, brother of James Joyce, wrote two books about his early life in which he goes after his father big time. When you read these books, you change your mind about the nature of James Joyce’s genius and see how smart he was not to bother accusing his father of neglect and other crimes, except in passing, and how much of Joyce’s work is act of forgiveness towards his father.The last book that made me cryThe death of the boy Hanno in Thomas Mann’s Buddenbrooks and the death of the child Echo in Mann’s Doctor Faustus.The last book that made me laughIn Don Quixote, there is a letter from Sancho Panza to his wife about how good things are going to get and how important they are going to be.The book I couldn’t finishThe Old Testament: too long too boring too many characters no real plot not fully credible a bad influence on the young.The book I’m most ashamed not to have readI keep meaning to read Thomas Mann’s tetralogy Joseph and his Brothers, which runs to fifteen hundred pages.

The latest figures will further stoke concerns over the strength of the UK economy, amid increasing signals for deteriorating growth as Britain prepares to leave the EU next year. Some economists, including officials at the Bank of England, thought the growth rate would be revised higher as more data became available.Threadneedle Street delayed raising interest rates earlier this month following the weak first GDP estimate, despite arguing that the negative hit to the economy from heavy snowfall in late February and early March had probably been overblown. Instead the ONS said it had seen a longer-term pattern of slowing growth in the first three months of the year.Rob Kent-Smith of the ONS said: “Overall, the economy performed poorly in the first quarter with manufacturing growth slowing and weak consumer-facing services.”While admitting bad weather will have had some impact, particularly for firms in the construction industry and some areas of the retail business, statisticians said the overall effect was limited, with increased online sales and heightened energy production during the cold snap. Much will now hinge on how consumers fare over the coming months, with some early indications there could be a rebound in stronger retail sales data for April.

Each vehicle that was observing Dijksestraat’s 30kmh (19mph) speed limit as it passed added €0.10 (£0.09) to the monetary figure displayed, to a maximum of half a euro per vehicle each day.Catelijne Thomassen, spokeswoman for North Brabant province, said the speedometer achieved its set fundraising target of €500 to upgrade a local playing field well before the end of its three-week trial.The speedometer is entirely mobile and the speed limit, amount collected per vehicle, and savings goal can be customised.It will be displayed throughout North Brabant throughout 2018 and 2019, with inidual cities left to decide the fundraising target and the community project to benefit from it.Thomassen said the speedometer – which was devised and owned by the province’s traffic safety team – aimed to remind motorists to watch their speed and, in doing so, benefit their community.“The strength of the mobile version is that it’s only there for a few weeks, so people don’t get used to it. Every time they pass by, we hope that they are aware of the risk they take by speeding. “Most of these people are local drivers, they know they are contributing to the district, in this case the playing field. It feels really local.”Sander Hermsen, a researcher of behaviour change and design at the Utrecht University of Applied Sciences, told  Cities that the idea had potential to snap drivers out of bad habits.“Most people don’t consciously speed, they don’t want to endanger other people – it’s just the road sort of invites you to go fast. Others do it too, so you go with the flow and before you know it you’re going 45kmh.“What you need is some kind of trigger that breaks you out of your routine.”According to the Dutch Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek, North Brabant has one of the highest rates of motor vehicle fatalities in the Netherlands, with 150 deaths in the five years to 2016. This year the province’s focus is on tackling speeding to bring down the toll with its “nul verkeersdoden Brabant” (zero fatalities Brabant) campaign.Cities around the world have struggled to get drivers to slow down, with lower limits suggested to be less effective than “traffic-calming features” integrated into the environment.“The fun thing about these traffic interventions is they don’t even need to work for everybody, they just have to work for a couple of people, and then the flow is going slower,” said Hermsen.Other initiatives have offered incentives to attempt to manage drivers’ speeds, including Sweden’s “speed camera lottery”, where law-abiding drivers were automatically entered for a chance to win cash prizes.North Brabant’s speedometer will next appear in Eerde, a small town near Eindhoven. “We are fully booked for the next two years,” said Thomassen.Though Hermsen said a test of only weeks would be unlikely to affect drivers’ behaviour longer-term, Thomassen said that was not the speedometer’s intention.“It’s really to remind people to be aware of your own role in safety in traffic. In the long run we hope that people may change their behaviour, but it’s more like a reminder for now.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2356904ba46e4949be52fa26f5ff19d95241c918/0_34_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=683bf06d643496c87785322c47a1b51d","title":"brexit corbyn irish soft border unite ireland","story":"The briefings ahead of Jeremy Corbyn’s speech in Northern Ireland yesterday suggested he would emphasise the popularity of the political unification of Ireland on both sides of the border. In the event, his remarks were far more measured and focused on the challenges of Brexit. Perhaps that’s no bad thing.Corbyn has long since framed the problem of Northern Ireland with a classic Irish republican viewpoint. As a consequence he is probably the first major UK political leader to receive unambiguous public support from Sinn Féin’s elected representatives on both sides of the border. But what makes you popular with one side doesn’t always go down well with the other. On Thursday, he took care not to transgress the consent principle enshrined in the Good Friday agreement: that is the guarantee to the people of Northern Ireland that they will have the final say in whether they remain within the United Kingdom or leave it.The confusion surrounding Brexit has also changed things somewhat. Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU – but Corbyn was clear with his Belfast audience that he would not reverse the referendum decision, choosing instead to commend the virtues of a soft border – a wise move sure to appeal to his audience. Another survey published this week showed that only one in every three Protestants want a hard Brexit. The Protestants of Ulster are nothing if not pragmatic. To the DUP leader, Arlene Foster – who grew up in an Anglican parish whose boundaries stop at the border, but whose parishioners are drawn from the rural populations on both sides – this pragmatism is no surprise. Protestant farmers in Fermanagh in the north send milk yields to Monaghan in the south.While the DUP emphasises the fact that trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain far outweighs the total of north-south trade, Foster also knows that in the sensitive areas of farming and agrifoods, the 25-year-old single market has reintegrated many of those cross-border communities. Brexit, however it is engineered – via ‘max fac’, or some form of looser integration – must maintain local access to the single market to keep the border open. The threat is not violence or insecurity (beyond the present deadlock), but economic disruption of the sort that will lead to a further economic slippage.Could this all lead to a united Ireland? Despite the popular mood music, Brexit is unlikely to have much effect in the short term. Partly because the outcome of a soft Brexit (however that is achieved) will not be felt immediately. More relevant is the century-long failure of republicans, north and south, to reach out to their unionist neighbours to make them an offer they cannot refuse. The Good Friday agreement provides them a means of developing such an offer and, as Corbyn has said, with sufficient will it will survive Brexit.The southern unionist Edward Carson, speaking in the Commons in the summer of 1913, offered them this advice: “If ever you are going to bring the Ulster portion of the community into line with the rest of Ireland, you will never do it by any means except those of persuasion.”The Brexit-inspired political vacuum in Westminster, as well as Stormont, has given rise to all manner of fantasy outcomes.

MGM will still release in the US, in partnership with Annapurna Pictures, the highly-respected outfit owned by Megan Ellison, which has bankrolled films by the likes of Paul Thomas Anderson, Spike Jonze and David O Russell.In March, Boyle – who is currently shooting a Richard Curtis comedy in the UK – said he was working on a Bond script, with a view to filming at the end of the year. The writer of Bond 25, John Hodge, is a long-time collaborator of Boyle’s, having worked with him on Trainspotting and its sequel, as well as The Beach, A Life Less Ordinary and Boyle’s debut, Shallow Grave.Also rumoured to return to the franchise are Ben Whishaw, who plays gadgets expert Q, Naomie Harris as Moneypenny and Rory Kinnear as Tanner.Whishaw recently greeted rumours of Boyle’s involvement enthusiastically. “I just think it’s really exciting to have Danny Boyle on board for Bond,” he said.“I’m just really excited to work with him, I’ve been such a big fan. It seems weird to talk about it because I’ve not had a conversation with him but it’s exciting.”Craig’s involvement was cast into doubt after he expressed a preference for slashing his own wrists rather than returning to the role while promoting Spectre in 2015. Candidates mooted to replace him included Idris Elba, Tom Hiddleston and Aidan Turner.In 2016, Sam Mendes ruled himself out of future movies having directed both Spectre and Skyfall (2012). Later that year, Craig was reportedly offered $150m for two more Bond movies by Broccoli. The collaboration of Broccoli and Donna Langley, the British chairman of Universal Pictures, brings together two of the most powerful women in cinema. Speaking to the  in February, Rosamund Pike, who played a Bond girl in 2002’s Die Another Day opposite Pierce Brosnan, credited Broccoli with creating a strikingly protective on-set environmentShe said: “At 22, when I was on the Bond set – one of the potentially most chauvinist productions you could imagine – it could have been a very vulnerable place for a young actress to step into her first major role and it wasn’t.”Said said MGM’s chairman of the board of directors Kevin Ulrich: “Under the leadership of Michael and Barbara, we couldn’t be more thrilled than to bring the next 007 adventure to the big screen uniting the incomparable Daniel Craig with the extraordinary vision of Danny Boyle.”Added MGM films president Jonathan Glickman: “It has been 16 years since Die Another Day was distributed by MGM and it’s incredibly gratifying to be releasing this film alongside the powerhouse team at Universal.”Said Langley: “Universal is extremely proud to collaborate with Michael, Barbara and MGM on the international marketing and distribution of Bond 25. The unparalleled combination of Danny’s innovative filmmaking and Daniel’s embodiment of 007 ensured we simply had to be partners in the next chapter of this iconic series.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91e75edaf77629dabaa38e69996eec6298cace2b/90_81_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c229143e8fab482f2d6f05b92df99d69","title":"liverpool step up pursuit lyon 70m rated nabil fekir","story":"• Forward has been named in France’s World Cup squad• Reds keen to replace departed Philippe CoutinhoLiverpool will step up their pursuit of Nabil Fekir after the Champions League final as they look to secure the €70m-rated (£61m) Lyon captain before the World Cup.Fekir, who has played as an attacking midfielder and forward for his hometown club, is a major summer target for Jürgen Klopp with the Liverpool manager yet to replace Philippe Coutinho.Liverpool’s finances will also be swelled by around £70m for reaching Saturday’sChampions League final against Real Madrid.Klopp has already signed Naby Keita from Red Bull Leipzig for this summer, with the Guinea midfielder costing £52.75m, but is keen to strengthen his midfield options in order to challenge Manchester City for next season’s Premier League title.The 24-year-old Fekir has enjoyed another excellent season in France and earned a call-up to Didier Deschamps’ World Cup squad.

I can’t change. I am this and my past speaks very clearly, as a player and as a manager.” Napoli appointed Carlo Ancelotti as Sarri’s successor on Wednesday after the latter guided the team to a second-place Serie A finish in his third and final season at the club.The 59-year-old Sarri – who has never managed outside of his homeland – is mulling over an offer from Zenit St Petersburg, understood to be worth around £5.2m a year. However, it is believed that Sarri’s preference would be to join Chelsea but it is not clear whether he is the club’s primary target.Following Napoli’s 2-1 win over Crotone, which saw Napoli end the season with 91 points before his exit was confirmed, Sarri told La Gazzetta dello Sport: “What I do think is that I could not go directly to another Italian team, and that if I had to make a change I would prefer to go abroad. Everything in life ends and it is better to finish things after writing a beautiful story.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1c576bbb02451d3a3e965df1e05db38db467e9c/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb3f8ae5654028a193454bda77504184","title":"iverpool fans transport misery final kiev champions league","story":"Businesses capitalising on Liverpool’s Champions League match with Real Madrid in Ukrainian capital KievWhen Anna and Ronnie Ellis each parted with £450 for a seat on an “executive” coach from Liverpool to Kiev, they were expecting a few little luxuries for the 30-hour journey to the Champions League football final. Plug sockets, a toilet, maybe even a TV. Somewhere to store their bags that wasn’t their own laps would have been nice. But the minibus that pulled up outside the Arkle pub in Anfield on Thursday was a little more … rustic. Let’s just say the jerry can a fellow passenger had brought with him from work “for emergencies” was likely to be in high demand on the 2,750km-journey to the Ukrainian capital. Given the number of pints sunk in the pub beforehand, it may well have been full by the time the bus trundled on to the M62. Yet the cheerful couple were determined to make the best of things. “There was no way we were going to miss the match,” said Anna, white wine in hand.At least their transport showed up. A thousand other Liverpool fans found themselves stuck at John Lennon airport on Thursday when the air traffic controllers in Kiev decided they weren’t going to be able to cope with all the extra flights and denied three Scouse planes a landing slot. Onboard the minibus from the Arkle, not everyone had managed to wangle one of Liveprool’s 16,000 tickets for the match against 12-times Champion League winners Real Madrid — including organiser Martin Cleary and his 17-year-old son, Lewis Francis Cleary (“His initials are LFC — my missus is an Evertonian so I had to register him when she was still under sedation”). Jess Handley, 23, who was travelling alone, was unfazed by the journey ahead. “It’s the chance of a lifetime. You’ve got to grab it,” she said. Her mum, along to wave her off with her nana and grandad, was less sure. “How will she ring me to say she’s OK if she can’t charge her phone?” A few doors down at John’s Supper bar, a popular post-match chippy, the owner John Paraskeva was preparing for Saturday night, when 30,000 fans are expected to watch the game on screens at the stadium five minutes walk away. He had sourced a lifesize cutout of Mo Salah, the Egyptian king of Anfield, and was making a big vat of curry sauce to pour over chips for £1.50 a cone. “I tried to get tickets in the ballot to go to Kiev but I didn’t get any, so I’ll make the best of things here,” he said, still excited about Sadio Mané, Liverpool’s star winger, pulling up in his Porsche outside after the penultimate game of the season. “I offered him free chips but he said he had to look after his diet.” Outside the stadium, merchandise stalls were doing a brisk trade, with anything Salah-related most in demand. Buying flags for her car, Elizabeth Wright, 66, was another fan of the Egyptian striker. “People are now going to mosques because of him. He’s bringing harmony – that’s nice, isn’t it? I might go to mosque on Sunday. Are mosques open on Sundays?” In Liverpool city centre, many businesses are capitalising on the match by upping their prices on Saturday night. The German-themed Bierkeller is selling tickets for £20 a pop and most hotels have tripled their usual prices.Gareth Roberts, the editor of the Anfield Wrap, a Liverpool FC podcast and fanzine, said it was “a bit grim” how much profiteering was going on in his home city. Those charging silly prices may regret it in the long-term, he suggested: “It leaves a bad taste in the mouth. I think a lot of fans will be choosing their bars more carefully in future.”He said he had been contacted by fans from all over the world who couldn’t get tickets to Kiev so were descending on Liverpool instead. “When they’re being fleeced like this it doesn’t give the best impression of Liverpool,” he said. “It’s a tax on the passion of football.”Back at the Arkle, manager Carl Baines said they were treating it as an ordinary match day. “We’re not going to charge fans to come and watch the biggest game of the season.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b9063d461fd898c5f1992c92730f6e6e2908adb/0_67_2240_1344/master/2240.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0bda76bd7461201a5019be6040d5d64","title":"ryan sessegnon fulham washday feat john terry","story":"This is where we all are at the moment, gushing at news that Fulham’s teenage wing-back can use a household applianceTo south-west London, where startling news emerged when Fulham’s Supporters Trust held its AGM on Tuesday. An awed hush fell over the room as Alistair Mackintosh, the club’s CEO, told an anecdote that left everyone wiping away the tears. On one occasion this season, Mackintosh revealed, Ryan Sessegnon had a doping test after a night game and by the time he was done everyone had gone, the kit man included. So Sessegnon took his kit home, washed it and ironed it before bringing it in the next day.The story ended there, leaving us to speculate whether Fulham saw fit to frame the hallowed kit in the boardroom at Craven Cottage or offered to donate it to the British Museum, but it wasn’t long before people on social media were talking about “a real nice touch from one of the nicest kids you’ll ever meet”. Some called for Sessegnon to be handed the Nobel Prize for Real Classy Touches. Greg Clarke, head of the Football Association, announced plans to sell Wembley to Sessegnon. Word filtered through to Steven Spielberg, who immediately bought the film rights. “Never has there been a greater act of selflessness,” the director of Schindler’s List said. “I’m thinking of calling it Washing Ryan’s Privates.”The hero in question could not be reached for comment after a whirlwind 24 hours. Partly because much of the previous paragraph is made up. And also because this column has come to the conclusion that asking Sessegnon about his laundry would represent a career low, especially when every other football writer is either penning a feature about Mohamed Salah’s childhood in Egypt or trying to find a room for the night in Kiev.But this is where we are at the moment, gushing at the revelation that Sessegnon is capable of using a household appliance (just wait till you hear about the time he used a microwave without any assistance), and in reality this says more about us than him. There is, of course, plenty of excitement about an 18-year-old who has been brilliant and fearless during Fulham’s carefree charge to Saturday’s Championship play-off final against Aston Villa. Yet headlines about a man washing his clothes feel like a stretch.Admittedly, speaking as a former teenage boy, I can appreciate why there will be parents dumbstruck at the fact that Sessegnon didn’t just burn his clothes after realising that the kit man had left the building. Even then, though, we seem to be reaching a point where so much information is there to be devoured that ordinary things take on a peculiar significance, such that news of Harry Kane’s appointment as England’s World Cup captain featured references to his brave struggle to develop a taste for fish, as though the 24-year-old father of one is actually a nine-year-old boy whose parents are trying to wean him off fish fingers.Fair play to Kane for learning to appreciate the nutritional benefits of grilled salmon. But with Sessegnon’s washing machine adventure also the subject of much deeper analysis than it deserved, it was becoming clear that people cannot help but patronise footballers, even unintentionally. This felt misguided, not to mention a bit hypocritical given that I boiled a kettle that contained no water a couple of nights ago. Continue down this path and we’d be asking Gareth Southgate whether his players have sent out a message to the rest of the world by remembering to pack their shinpads for the school trip to Russia.But righteous indignation at the growing trend of infantilisation does have its limits. There is another side to the argument and that became clear when the tale of Sessegnon’s hardship was followed by claims that Villa are willing to let John Terry, who is a 37-year-old adult, miss both games against Chelsea next season if Steve Bruce’s side win promotion to the Premier League, news of which brought to mind the defender’s ludicrous Stamford Bridge farewell last year.Terry, remember, helped to arrange it so that he could be substituted in the 26th minute against Sunderland, which is reminiscent of the bit in the Dynasty reboot where one of the characters throws herself a lavish fake wedding, complete with peacocks luxuriating in indoor fountains. Nothing but the best! Even though, as one underling points out, peacocks can’t swim. Even though, as none of Terry’s Chelsea team-mates dared say out loud, walking off in the minute that matched his shirt number marked him out as football’s Mariah Carey.Now our captain, leader and legendary party planner is rumoured to be thinking about a follow-up. Some players refuse to celebrate when they score against their old clubs, even holding their arms in the air to apologise for the grievous sin of scoring a goal for their current employer. Terry, however, could be about to take it up a notch. Having rejected offers from Premier League clubs last summer in order to avoid having to play against Chelsea, for whom he made 717 appearances across 22 years, he would be in quite the pickle if Villa went up.Worryingly for all concerned, the final against Fulham takes place on 26 May. It is a sign. But fret not: Villa have recognised the gravity of the situation.Forget about what would happen if they needed to beat Chelsea to stay up or what Terry would do if he ends up managing a team in the same league as his old club. Some things are too precious – like the captain’s armbands that Terry dug out of storage and shaped into the number 26. Let’s just hope he put them in the wash first."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63c3c6e2638359132fb7c1b2ec3cc31916ee5f9e/0_94_1417_850/master/1417.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c029b5a16298615d59cd48741e22e01","title":"safe haven nile south sudan old fangak in pictures","story":"Before civil war erupted, Old Fangak was home to about 5,000 people.

This woman suddenly wasn’t Mum any more. Then I felt deceived and angryI was 24 and had just finished my undergraduate degree when, out of the blue, my elderly Greek mother announced that she had something to tell me. “But you look busy, so I’ll tell you later…” I said, “Mum, if you’ve got something to say, tell me now.”She was nervous and asked me to sit down, but I refused. I thought she was going to tell me somebody was dying. Instead, she revealed that she was not my biological mother. Her brother, one of my many uncles, a man I’d never met, who lived in northern Greece, was my real father. I slumped against the wall in shock. By the end, I was splayed on the floor.I’d always known my parents, who had settled in Canberra, Australia, struggled to have children. They’d tried for 17 years and had three miscarriages. When Mum had to go back to Greece in 1973 to visit her sick father, Dad said, “Why don’t you see if you can get a baby from an orphanage in Thessaloniki?” But it didn’t work out. My uncle must have seen how sad she was. He proposed that he and his wife have a baby for her. They already had two sons, George and Billy, who were 10 and 11, and said their child-rearing years were behind them.It was to be a pure gift, but Mum was scared her brother and his wife might want to keep the child: there was nothing in writing. Still, she agreed, went back to Australia and waited. One day, she got a letter. It said: “We’re pregnant. The baby will be born in June 1974.” She flew back early, but missed the birth by a day or two.Mum spent five months in Greece, looking after me and doing the paperwork. My birth certificate was issued with my adoptive name and listed my adoptive parents as my parents. We left for Australia when I was six months old. It must have been difficult for my biological parents to give me up. George later told me that when I was taken away, it was like a period of mourning – nobody talked for three days.After that, we just got on with life. I had a happy childhood, but always felt conspicuous – as the only Greek child at school, and with no siblings. But I was everything to my parents and I looked enough like them not to question it.Mum said they’d been waiting until I finished my degree to tell me they didn’t want to derail my studies. When I said I was going to do a PhD, they didn’t want four more years with the burden of that secret. It was causing them sleepless nights. They were scared they’d die and I’d never know the truth. Dad left it to Mum to tell me as it was her side of the family he wasn’t one for talking much.Mum became teary as she told me, but by the end she seemed lighter. She was glad I’d found out from her. I felt shock at first. This woman suddenly wasn’t Mum any more. Then I felt deceived and angry. But after that came excitement that I had brothers. I wanted to call up all my old friends and tell them: “Remember that kid you went to school with who had no siblings? I’ve suddenly got two!”My biological mother had died in 1993. My mum felt guilty that she’d denied me the chance to meet her. I wondered at the time why her sister-in-law’s death affected her so much, but now it made sense. My biological father was still alive when I discovered the truth, but he died two years later, before I had a chance to meet him. I question why I didn’t travel to see him straight away, but I wasn’t in a hurry to do it. In truth, I didn’t want to get to know another set of parents.When I finally went to Greece in 2003 to meet my brothers, I told Mum she had to come with me. She’d been the architect of this, so she had to be there when we were finally reunited. It was wonderful to meet them, and we have a great relationship now. They’d always known I existed, but had to respect the family’s wishes. Now we Skype regularly and, as neither of them has their own children, they are delighted to get to know my sons. And all those years learning Greek, at Mum’s insistence, paid off, as I can speak to them.I forgave my parents quickly. At the end of the day, they’d always loved me. My wife and I struggled to conceive for two years, and that was tough. Mum and Dad had close to 18 years of that. My dad has since died, but he taught me so much, including how to be a father. My mum adores my boys. I’ll tell them one day: “Without that lady and the lengths she went to to become a mother, I wouldn’t be here and neither would you.”• As told to Sophie Haydock.

The former Apprentice contestant was in South Africa to produce a film about the treatment of white farmers when the two incidents happened, both of which were publicised on her social media accounts. One picture posted to her Twitter account showed Hopkins being resuscitated by paramedics after collapsing in the street after taking the ketamine, which she uses to reduce pain in a dislocated shoulder.Two days later she posted a separate video from Johannesburg airport in which she claimed she would miss her flight home because “my passport has been marked for spreading racial hatred here in South Africa”.She complained the Mirror had conflated the two issues in its original headline.The Mirror argued its reporting was accurate but later added a correction to the story which the newspaper felt made the chain of events clearer: “A previous version of this article suggested that Katie Hopkins was stopped from leaving South Africa because of the consumption of ketamine. We are happy to clarify that Ms Hopkins was detained for spreading racial hatred, which took place after the ketamine incident.”Hopkins took her case to the press regulator IPSO, arguing the update was not enough to “correct the misleading impression given to the millions of people who had been misinformed by the original headline”. She was concerned most readers would believe she had been detained for taking drugs, rather than alleged racism.Following an investigation the press regulator sided with Hopkins and concluded the original headline gave “the significantly misleading impression that the reason for the detention had been the consumption of ketamine”.As a result they concluded the Mirror had failed to take care over the accuracy of the piece and upheld the complaint."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0fb9214769b864be4e340413e6bfd7422e4ee05/0_43_2202_1321/master/2202.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b92b14b10bc581de2a6d3333d4be7c28","title":"shawn mendes shawn mendes review lip trembling pop is a turn off","story":"It is the law that every teen pop star eventually undergoes a very public sexual awakening, whether that be Britney cavorting with a snake or Justins Timberlake and Bieber respectively embracing debauchery and delinquency. The persona of every solo One Direction member can be summed up as: “Yes, I have sex now.” Even Taylor Swift has abandoned her good-girl persona for leather and frenzied gasps. And so it goes for 19-year-old Shawn Mendes, a cherubic Canadian pop star who’s occasionally seemed less like an autonomous artist than a hard factory-reset Justin Bieber, or his primary influence, infamous lothario John Mayer. How should a young, apparently heterosexual male songwriter best convey his sexual appetite, post-#MeToo? Online fandom is quick to decry the sexual politics of any song lacking respect for its subject or the community it represents. So, despite the myriad girls waking up on Mendes’s bare chest, or leaving him perplexed when they walk out after a one-night stand (“I thought you really felt this when we were talking about breakfast”), Mendes’s MO is all respect. God, he’s respectful: “I don’t know what it’s like to be you,” he duets with Julia Michaels on the earnest, folky Like to Be You. Woke, too: In My Blood is a rousing rebuke of anxiety, and dreary Khalid duet Youth assesses the struggle to stay young in a heavy era. Mendes’s cheeky R\u0026ampB is similarly clean-cut – Robin Thicke with the lines resolutely un-blurred, less rock your body than spoon it lovingly into the night. The start of the album is more adventurous: the ticking guitar of Nervous tells the story just as well as his sweet vocals, and the cross-purposes interplay of falsetto and deeper backing vocals on Where Were You in the Morning? amplifies his internal conflict. But towards the end, Mendes’s bottom lip starts quivering and his sensitivity becomes a tad toxic: girls who don’t love him back are poison, curses. Perfectly Wrong is droopy in the extreme.

As a journalist, I’ve spent much of my career writing about financial corruption in the former Soviet Union, but the invitation came as something of a surprise. After all, ever since I was at school in the 1990s, British politicians have welcomed Russian money to our shores. They have celebrated when oligarchs have bought our football clubs, cheered when they’ve listed their companies on our Stock Exchange. They have gladly accepted their political donations and patronised their charitable foundations.When journalists and academics pointed out that these murky fortunes could buy influence over our democracy and undermine the rule of law, they were largely dismissed as inconvenient Cassandras warning MPs to beware Russians bearing gifts. But earlier this year, after the poisoning in Salisbury of the former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, those little-heeded prophecies jumped straight into the pages of Hansard. “To those who seek to do us harm, my message is simple: you are not welcome here,” Theresa May told the House of Commons on 14 March, in a speech that blamed Russia for the attack. “There is no place for these people, or their money, in our country.”Britain’s entire political class joined the prime minister in this screeching handbrake turn. MPs who had long presented the nation’s openness to trade as a great virtue suddenly wanted to be seen as tough on kleptocrats, tough on the causes of kleptocrats. Having allowing so much Russian money into Britain, these MPs were now seized with concern that Vladimir Putin might, through his power over his nation’s super-rich, be able to influence our institutions. Were we selling Putin the rope with which he would hang us, they wondered.That is why, on 28 March, I took a seat in committee room six, a chamber high up in the Palace of Westminster, with heavy furniture, a view over the River Thames, and a carpet like a migraine. The foreign affairs committee exists to monitor the work of the Foreign Office – essentially, to keep an eye on Boris Johnson – but its members can investigate any subjects they choose. This time, they had chosen to look into the money Putin and his cronies hold in Britain and its overseas territories, with a view to exploring fresh opportunities for sanctions.I had brought along a list of things I wanted to talk about: how we should improve our defences against money laundering how we need transparency about who owns property how MPs themselves must stop taking money from dodgy ex-Soviet oligarchs if they want others to do the same.But the first question, from Priti Patel, the former international development secretary, threw me: “Can you give the committee a sense of the scale of so-called ‘dirty money’ being laundered through London?” she asked.It is a vast question, worthy of a book in itself, and one that even the National Crime Agency would struggle to answer, let alone me. Then came her second question: “What assets has that hidden money gone into?”I tried my best – I mentioned property, private schools, luxury goods – but I think she and I both knew I’d fluffed it. I should have brought along specific examples, with times and dates and names. The embarrassing truth is that, although I have written about Russia and its neighbours for two decades, during which I have increasingly specialised in analysing corruption, it had never really occurred to me to ascertain precisely how much stolen Russian money had found a home in the UK, or to chart exactly where it had ended up.If someone like me had been this culpably incurious, it is hardly surprising that politicians with dozens of other priorities have had to scramble to understand what we’re facing. But for the past couple of months, I have belatedly tried to discover an answer to the foreign affairs committee’s questions.It turns out that the situation is even more worrying than I had suspected.One way to begin investigating exactly how much Russian money there is in Britain – and how much of it is dirty – is to look at the official data. According to Russia’s Federal State Statistics Service, at the end of September, Russian investors held financial assets in the UK worth a total of $3.5bn (£2.6bn). Our own Office of National Statistics provides a broader measure of all Russian investment in the UK, and assessed it – at the end of 2016 – at £25.5bn.That seems like a lot of money but, on a national scale, it’s small change. Investors from Finland alone have a stake in Britain worth twice that much, and we don’t lose sleep over the Finns destabilising our democracy. Sadly, the statistics are telling a misleading story. Russian money that moves through another jurisdiction before arriving in Britain isn’t counted as Russian and, since the overwhelming majority of money that enters and leaves Russia does so via tax havens such as Cyprus and the Bahamas, this means the official figures reflect only a small portion of the money the MPs were interested in.Over the past decade, £68bn has flowed from Russia into Britain’s offshore satellites such as the British Virgin Islands, Cayman, Gibraltar, Jersey and Guernsey. That’s seven times more money than has flowed directly from Russia into the UK. (On top of that, some £94bn has poured out of Russia into Cyprus, £13bn into Switzerland, and £23bn into the Netherlands, which has its own network of tax havens.)This wealth is not actually in the offshore centres – it is just registered there, which helps to obscure its origins. If you’re a Russian official whose wealth is wildly disproportionate to your salary, this anonymity allows you to spend your money in London without anyone realising you’re a crook. The French economist Thomas Piketty estimates that more than half of Russians’ total wealth is held offshore in this manner – some $800bn (£597bn) – and by a tiny number of people, perhaps just a few hundred. “Rich Russians live between London, Monaco and Moscow,” Piketty wrote in a blogpost in April. “Post-communism has become the worst ally of hyper-capitalism.”This means that there is not a single sewer pumping dirty Russian cash into the UK to which we can attach a meter, so as to measure its output. Instead, the cash is diluted into the great tidal flows of liquid capital that pour in and out of the City of London every day, from every corner of the globe. The ordure churned out by Russian crooks and kleptocrats is thus, thanks to the skilled attentions of the tax havens’ best brains, indistinguishable from ordinary investment.One of the few studies to forensically address this phenomenon came from analysts at Deutsche Bank, who, in 2015, looked at discrepancies in the records of money that flows into and out of the UK, and concluded that since the early 1990s, £133bn had arrived here without ever being publicly accounted for. They estimated that “less than half” of that sum was likely to be Russian, which means that Russians could have secret holdings here of up to £67.5bn, on top of the officially declared figure. (That is still a small amount compared with the holdings of German, American or French investors.)So whose money is this? How is it getting here? The bank’s analysts didn’t look into that question. However, had they wanted to, they could have walked down the hall and asked their colleagues, since it turned out that Deutsche Bank itself was a significant culprit in spiriting money out of Russia without informing the authorities. Less than two years after the report – called Dark Matter – was published, Deutsche Bank traders in Moscow were caught secretly moving $10bn (£7.5bn) of their clients’ money out of Russia by illegally exploiting the stock market. (As a result, the bank had to pay fines of $425m (£317m) in the US and £163m in the UK.)With institutions as sophisticated as Deutsche Bank working to hide Russian money, it is unsurprising that the total amount in the UK remains vague. So there is no real answer to the foreign affairs committee’s first question, except to say that the volume of Russian money in Britain is far larger than the official statistics would have us think.There are two reasons why we should be worried about this. The first is the low-probability but high-impact chance that Putin is hiding money here in the financial equivalent of sleeper cells, ready to slip out and buy influence when a crisis comes. The second is more significant: no one steals money if they can’t keep it. By letting Putin’s allies launder their stolen fortunes, and hide them in our country, we are drawing a line under their crimes, and rewarding them for actions we should not be condoning. Do we really want Britain to be the Kremlin’s fence?To attempt an answer to Priti Patel’s second question – what assets has all this money gone into? – we need to look at how wealthy Russians responded to the collapse of communism. They chose to spend their newly freed money on assets they had long been denied, and ones that could not be taken away from them. Above all, they bought luxury goods and property outside their own country, particularly in London.In early 1993, rich Russians were enough of a novelty for the Independent to report that three of them had bought flats in Kensington – at prices between £200,000 and £320,000 – under the headline “Property – a haven for rich refugees”. A month later, a Russian tycoon dropped £1.1m on a house in Hampstead, and then bought all the contents, too. “All he took into the house were four televisions and a vanload of carrier bags from Harrods,” an estate agent told the Evening Standard.Those purchases were the first ripples of a tsunami of wealth that crashed over the whole south-east of England, with spectacular consequences. In 2013, an analysis by the estate agency Knight Frank estimated that almost a tenth of all buyers at the top end of the London market came from the former Soviet Union, while rival estate agents Savills calculated that Russians like to buy the biggest houses of any group of purchasers. Average house prices in Kensington have risen eightfold over the past two decades, at least partly thanks to the influx from Russia.The poster boy for ostentatious expenditure has been the oligarch Roman Abramovich, who bought Chelsea football club in 2003. But even his London house – valued at £125m – was second ision in the spending league. In April 2011, a Ukrainian bought the world’s most expensive flat – the penthouse at One Hyde Park – for £136.4m. Five months later, a Russian bought Park Place, a stately home near Henley-on-Thames, for £140m. Russians who acquired homes valued merely in the tens of millions barely deserved notice.Among those lesser buyers was a banker called Grigory Guselnikov, a boyish 42-year-old who moved to London in 2008. He and his family came on tier 1 investor visas, which provide successful applicants with residency in exchange for an investment (of, at the time, £1m) in government bonds. In the eight years to September 2015, Russian citizens made up 764 of the 3,396 people who paid for these so-called golden visas – making them the second largest group of applicants, after Chinese citizens. This arrangement brought in around £800m of Russian investment, but the flow dropped markedly after April 2015, when the UK authorities began to check the origin of the money used to buy these government bonds. Once rigorous checks were put in place and the price of the visa was doubled, the number of applications fell sharply. In the final quarter of last year, just 16 Russians applied for a golden visa.Guselnikov believes that politicians’ sudden panic about Russian money in Britain is misplaced. When we met in his office in a grand terraced house on Grosvenor Square, he began by pointing out that Russian money had less influence over British business than people think. “I can’t recall any big enterprise controlled by Russians, or any big company. They open restaurants, wine shops, they buy luxury stuff like football clubs.“Where the impact is significant is real estate,” Guselnikov continued. “And primarily real estate in London.” His most high-profile investment was the shop that houses the Rolex concession on the ground floor of One Hyde Park, which he bought in 2011 for £12m (and sold for £20m three years later), and which demonstrates the peculiar dynamics at the top end of the property market, where the price of residential property is inflated beyond any conceivable income it could generate. “There is a shop, with advertising, 300 sq metres and the price is £12m. The flat above has no advertising, no shop, no ability to make money it’s the same size, 300 sq metres, and cost £25m. The shop was two times cheaper than the flat, that was really funny,” he said, with a laugh.His second point was that it was a misconception to think Russians are Machiavellian masterminds buying up slabs of Britain in order to undermine us from within. “You have to understand why people buy real estate abroad – they see it as their pension, they want to ersify the risk. In Russia, you have to be ready to lose everything, you never know what will happen,” he said. “They just spend money here. They don’t invest, they spend.”One reason the Russian super-rich come to Britain, Guselnikov said, was for education. His own children attended private schools, although they now have British passports, so they were not counted among the 2,806 Russian children attending schools surveyed by the Independent Schools Council last year. By multiplying that total with the average fees parents pay, we can calculate that a minimum of £48.3m comes to Britain’s private schools each year from Russia.Guselnikov said banks had become more stringent in their checks on the provenance of money in the last few years, so it was unlikely that significant flows of dirty money were entering the UK from Russia any more. But he conceded things had been different in the past. “If any dirty money is invested in UK property, it was before 2008 or before 2011 at the latest, not now. I don’t think the UK’s attractive any more, I don’t think it’s possible any more,” he said.It may well be that, as Guselnikov said, many honest Russian businesspeople have indeed been behind these purchases of London property. However, thanks to tax havens and skilled enablers from the world’s major financial institutions, their money has been mingled with the proceeds of theft, bribery and corruption. Imagining that Britain will be unscathed by this influx is the macro equivalent of letting a kidnapper, a bent copper, and a heroin trafficker move into your village, and still expecting warm chats at the school gates.Transparency International published a report last year, which, relying only on public sources of information, identified 160 properties in the UK, together worth £4.4bn, that had been bought by what it called “high-corruption-risk iniduals”. Most of those properties were in London, and half of them were within three miles of Buckingham Palace – and that is just a fraction of the true total. “There is currently no credible deterrent in place for money-laundering failings from estate agents,” the report noted.Two years ago, a former fund manager called Bill Browder gave evidence to parliament’s home affairs committee in which he revealed how $30m (£22m) that had been stolen from the Russian state by a group of corrupt police officers and officials had come to the UK, via 12 different banks, and been spent on an array of luxury goods: $176,000 went on chartering a private jet $192,000 on redecorating a yacht $20,000 on private school fees $41,000 on a wedding dress $295,000 to pay off an exclusive women-only credit card that offers “the most privileged and luxurious service”.Browder, who was born in the US but is a British citizen, ran a successful Moscow-based fund until 2007, when the corrupt officials fraudulently claimed ownership of two of his investment companies. They realised that, by fiddling the books, they could claw back the $230m in taxes that he had paid on the year’s profits, which is what they did. The $30m that ended up in the UK derived from this act of grand larceny. When Browder’s lawyer Sergei Magnitsky exposed the fraud, he was arrested and detained in jail, where he was beaten and denied treatment for pancreatitis until he died. Browder has devoted the years since Magnitsky’s death to seeking justice for his lawyer, and punishment for those responsible. He employs a team of forensic accountants, who have traced the movement of the money that was stolen from the Russian budget.The spending that he described to parliament fitted the pattern laid out by Guselnikov: it was being blown on luxury goods, rather than being invested to win influence over British politics or society. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be concerned about it. This money should have been paid as taxes and spent on hospitals, schools and other services in Russia. Instead, it had been stolen from taxpayers and splashed on an absurd array of goodies. This is the kind of money Britain has been happily fencing for decades. Even now, British MPs only seem to care about it because its owners might harm our national security, rather than because it should be returned to the people it was originally stolen from.Browder told the home affairs committee that he had traced chunks of the stolen money to 11 other countries – including France, Switzerland and the US – and investigators in every one of those countries had opened criminal cases based on the information he provided. But in Britain – where he had spoken to the politan police, the Serious Organised Crime Agency (now part of the National Crime Agency), the Serious Fraud Office, and HMRC – he had been turned away every time.Why was Britain the only country that declined to act on the information Browder provided? His conclusion was that too many influential people – lawyers, bankers, accountants, property developers – were dependent on dirty Russian money for their livelihoods. “If that money was stopped,” he said in 2016, “certain people would find themselves without businesses, and I think those people have political weight in this country.”Many British institutions have indeed accepted donations from wealthy Russian businesspeople: Sadiq Khan’s City Hall from Elena Baturina, whose husband was mayor of Moscow the Conservative party from Lubov Chernukhin, whose husband was one of Putin’s ministers, and who paid £160,000 to play tennis with Boris Johnson and David Cameron in 2014.But it is not venal politicians who are stopping British police conducting investigations into the laundering of Russian money in the UK. According to Tristram Hicks, who was the detective superintendent in charge of economic crime at the Met until 2009, and who now acts as a freelance consultant to police forces around the world, the problem is far more serious than that.In order to prosecute a foreign crook in Britain, you need to prove their money originated in a crime of some kind, and that requires evidence from overseas. Essentially, if you want to prosecute a Kremlin insider, you need evidence from the Kremlin, which naturally it will not provide, and that stops investigations from progressing. And this is not just a British problem. After France, Switzerland and the Netherlands received information from Browder that some of the stolen $230m had been spent in their countries, they froze the assets in question – but their criminal investigations are yet to secure convictions. Only US prosecutors have managed a result, and even that was just an out-of-court settlement, without an admission of guilt by the defendant. “You cannot underestimate the technical hurdle that is bringing the evidence to a British standard for a British court,” Hicks said.That isn’t the only obstacle to investigating money laundering. Given that all wealthy Russians have political connections – otherwise, they wouldn’t be wealthy – if the UK does gain cooperation from Russian investigators in a prosecution, the defendant will invariably claim, often with good reason, that he is being politically persecuted, which allows his lawyers to discount the evidence being used against him.Take Andrey Borodin, the owner of that £140m house in Henley-on-Thames. He arrived in Britain in 2011, pursued by Russian charges of having defrauded his own bank. Borodin insisted the charges were politically motivated, and gained asylum here. Had prosecutors brought charges in the UK, his lawyers could have discounted any evidence from Russia as the revenge of political rivals, and Hicks conceded this would essentially doom the prosecution’s case. “That’s hard to argue against,” he said.There is also a third difficulty that Hicks didn’t address, which is just as serious. If a wealthy, ruthless Russian faces investigation, he can stop any chance of prosecution by killing the witnesses. This may well have been what happened to Alexander Litvinenko, who was murdered with radioactive polonium-210 in 2006, and who was working with Spanish and British authorities to expose Russian money flows. It may also explain the death of Alexander Perepilichny, a 44-year-old banker who was helping Browder’s team to understand the destination of the $230m stolen from the Russian budget, and who died while jogging in Surrey in 2012. Investigators at first thought he had suffered a heart attack, but it appears that he may have been poisoned with a rare plant extract.In short, to bring a successful money-laundering prosecution against a wealthy Russian, officers need to win cooperation from Moscow, which is all but impossible to convince a UK court that any cooperation that does result was not politically motivated, which is extremely difficult and then to keep their witnesses alive, which has proven rather hard. In the circumstances, it’s not surprising that the NCA decided bringing a prosecution in the Magnitsky case was not the best use of its resources.The amazing thing is that we have tolerated this situation for so long. Britain has consistently welcomed Russian money, and consistently ignored the warnings of those concerned about what it is buying. In March 2000, when Putin was still just acting president and had spent six months pulverising Chechnya, Tony Blair dashed to St Petersburg to be the first western leader to secure a meeting with the new man, and to urge more investment in each other’s countries.At least Blair could claim not to have known what kind of man Putin was, but David Cameron had no such excuse. In September 2011, Cameron went to Moscow to seek business for the City of London, although most of the facts that are currently concerning MPs about Russia were already known. Litvinenko had been murdered five years previously, and Russia had given one of the Met’s suspects in the case a seat in parliament. Magnitsky had died in jail two years earlier, and his tormentors were walking free. But Cameron went to Moscow anyway.“The whole point about trade is that we are baking a bigger cake and everyone can benefit from it and this is particularly true, perhaps, of Russia and Britain. Russia is resource-rich and services-light whereas Britain is the opposite,” Cameron told students at Moscow State University, on a trip that also involved meetings with Putin and his then placeholder president Dmitry Medvedev.In his speech, Cameron boasted that Russian companies accounted for a quarter of share offerings on the London Stock Exchange. “Governments need to remember that businesses don’t have to invest in our country – they choose to. And we need to help them make that choice,” Cameron said. “It means minimising the burden of regulation so that business and entrepreneurship can flourish.”With a prime minister who considered regulations on the origin of money to be a burden, it’s unsurprising that not many of them were made. This approach did not of course begin with Cameron, or even with Blair. In fact, it goes back to the mid-20th century. After the second world war, Britain was all but bankrupt, the City of London was somnolent, and economic power rested on Wall Street. City bankers wanted to get back into business, but were frustrated by the weakness of the pound, and its unsuitability as a means to finance the world’s trade.Their salvation came from an unlikely quarter: the Soviet Union, which didn’t want to keep its dollar reserves in US banks. Instead, it kept them in London, where British banks began lending them to each other in an entirely unregulated market – they became known as “Eurodollars” – thus giving birth to offshore finance, and providing the City with the startup capital it needed to get back in business. By the end of the communist period, Soviet institutions routinely sent their money through Britain’s offshore territories, and the City was booming. The Central Bank in Moscow even had a shell company in Jersey, which it used to hide money from the government that it was supposedly a part of.This is one of the problems with trying to ascertain the volume of dirty Russian money in London: how far back do we go? Do the fees Midland Bank received for banking Soviet money in the 1950s still count as Russian cash, and if so, are they dirty? Does the commission the estate agent earned by selling those flats in Kensington in the early 1990s count as dirty money? And what about the £800m that Russians paid for government bonds in return for golden visas? Or the $41,000 of Magnitsky money that was spent on a wedding dress in London? How many times does money have to circulate in the economy before we decide it’s not dirty any more?This money is so deeply embedded in the UK that extracting it, or even identifying it, would be an unrivalled feat of investigation. “It would be impossible,” says Prem Sikka, professor of accounting at Sheffield University. “They have the big accountancy firms advising them where best to stash the money, to conceal it, to disguise it, all kind of things. The brains of this pinstriped mafia are available to everyone. They’re for hire.”Recently, I spoke to Jon Benton, who led teams fighting dirty money at the Met and the NCA, and advised Cameron at the Cabinet Office, until his retirement in 2016. “We used to get these suspicious activity reports coming in, Russian ones, all the time. It would be for an investment or a property or a load of other things,” Benton said. “You’re looking at something that doesn’t look right, doesn’t smell right, but we had a tiny number of resources. To get caught up in some really complex Russian money-laundering case, when we weren’t going to get any assistance – you have to weigh it up. Do I try to throw lots of resources at this, when I know I’m really going to struggle to get the door open?”Benton was optimistic about the introduction of so-called unexplained wealth orders, which came into effect in February this year. Once a UWO has been issued, property is frozen, and its owner has to respond and justify why they own it. But that will only confiscate property, Benton noted. It won’t put anyone in jail.“The time when we might have been able to do something about this was 20 years ago, when it wasn’t particularly sophisticated, and the large sums of money were just arriving in the country,” he said. By ignoring the provenance of dirty cash, and allowing it to be spent on property, British authorities have cleansed it of its taint: it is legitimate investment now. “Unpicking all that is a real challenge. The reality is that it’s probably the hardest area to penetrate in the world.”We don’t know how much dirty money there is in the UK, nor do we know exactly where it is, and there’s nothing we can do about it. Or rather, there’s nothing we can do about it with the laws as they stand, and without giving greater resources to law enforcement agencies. Almost 100,000 UK properties are currently owned via offshore companies, obscuring their ownership, many of them undoubtedly by Russian criminals and kleptocrats we could happily do without. The government has promised to force these offshore companies to disclose their true owners, but that won’t be until 2021. For the next three years, criminals will be free to profit from their property in the UK without admitting they own it. Why can’t we hurry that up? To answer both of Priti Patel’s questions – how much money is there, and where is it? – we need transparency.The foreign affairs committee published its conclusions this week, drawing on the evidence that I and others gave it, and they were impressively robust. Its report demanded a more coherent government approach to the “assets stored and laundered in London (which) both directly and indirectly support President Putin’s campaign to subvert the international rules-based system, undermine our allies, and erode the mutually reinforcing international networks that support UK foreign policy”.Earlier this week, it was reported that Abramovich is finding it hard to renew his British visa, and some newspapers are speculating that this suggests Britain is already pioneering a new approach to Russian money, one that demands checks on the fortunes even of the very richest, and even when there is no apparent evidence of corruption. We do not yet know the reasons for the delay in the Chelsea owner’s visa, but such checks should be welcomed anyway: in cases where evidence emerges that someone is corrupt, that person should be kept out of Britain. But this alone is insufficient we need to find the dodgy money that is already here. Confiscating it and finding a way to return it to the Russian people would diminish those who mean us harm, while simultaneously helping those we wish to befriend.That requires strengthening Britain’s investigative power. The National Crime Agency and the UK’s police forces currently lack the resources to bring the prosecutions that could really make a difference to criminals’ calculation about whether to bring their money here. If we wish to prevent Russian kleptocrats from buying our country, we need to start catching them and their enablers in the act, and prosecuting them. That is the only true deterrent.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3799ea1e9871259e0ca4162ad3bc0c6dd681be1e/0_0_4427_2656/master/4427.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f62deab12f488c4d3ea2e1408ec16e31","title":"snp report says independent scotland should keep pound for years politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenA new anti-Brexit party that was set up only last year to try to capitalise on what its founders viewed as the neglected ground of British politics has become embroiled in turmoil.Chris Coghlan, a former counter-terrorism officer and diplomat who was one of the co-founders of Renew, said that he was standing down as its leader and leaving “with a heavy heart”, citing difference with other senior members.His resignation came as the party’s 17 approved local election candidates passed a no confidence motion in the executive committee and board of the party, which has managed to garner about 7,000 supporters.A statement issued on their behalf expressed serious concerns over alleged poor governance and financial oversight as well as other issues.Coghlan said that he was resigning from the party because those in control of the party had refused to recognise the concerns that had been raised.“The last thing that this country needs is another ided party, so it rather defeats the purpose of Renew I think,” he said, when asked if the party would survive.Theresa May has spoken to the leaders of British overseas territories with large financial centres following a recent UK law change that will force them to become more transparent, the Press Association reports. She held a conference call last night about the impact of the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act, which came into force on May 23, Downing Street said. An unopposed amendment to the Act means UK territories like the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands will be required to establish public registers of the beneficial ownership of firms in their jurisdictions by the end of 2020. MPs and campaigners have said public registers would make it easier to uncover money-laundering, corruption and tax-dodging. A Downing Street spokeswoman said that in the conference call, May said she understood the amendment “was a matter of great concern for the leaders and that she was conscious of the strong reactions the issue had provoked in their territories”. The prime minister spoke of the government’s efforts to promote public registers of company beneficial ownership as the global standard and reiterated that we would expect other major financial centres, including the crown dependencies, to adopt public registers at that point. She also welcomed the importance of the existing co-operation of the overseas territories with UK law enforcement agencies and emphasised the need for this to continue and develop. She invited the leaders on the call to share their positions and opinions on the issue and made clear that the UK’s aim is to secure the best possible outcome in a way that minimises any possible risks to the economies of the overseas territories.On the subject of bland tweets (see 9.58am), Philip Hammond, the chancellor, is something of a master too. But I think this means he was glad to offload about Galileo. (See 9.47am.)Jeremy Corbyn is at the Irish border, Sky’s Darren McCaffrey reports.Here is a 55-page summary of the report (pdf).And here is the 354-page report in full (pdf).The sustainable growth commission report is supposed to be available online at sustainablegrowthcommission.scot. But when I tried it a moment ago all I got was a locked page asking for a password.But CommonSpace, a Scottish news website, says it has seen a copy. Its story focuses on the currency issue, and here is how it starts.The final report of the growth commission contains no plan for introducing a Scottish currency, arguing for an independent Scotland to use the UK pound “until the government seeks to do something different” ...The report does recommend putting in place “the arrangements and financial infrastructure that would support a move to an independent Scottish currency at such time as this was considered appropriate for the Scottish economy”. Appropriateness was defined by six key tests which, if passed, could allow the government to move to a Scottish currency “at some future date”.Commonly known as Sterlingisation, the policy would mean an independent Scotland would be using pound sterling without any formal agreement with the Bank of England, meaning its monetary policy would be controlled by London.Advocates say it would mean frictionless cross-border trade with the rest of the UK, Scotland’s largest trading partner, but the move would be an experiment, only being adopted voluntarily by Panama and El Salvador (in those cases utilising the US dollar). Zimbabwe and Ecuador adopted the dollar after their currencies collapsed.Yesterday, in a briefing from an anonymous source, the EU accused the UK government of “chasing a fantasy” in the Brexit negotiations.This morning Olly Robbins, the prime minister’s chief civil servant Brexit adviser, has responded by taking to Twitter to defend his team of officials.The Robbins Twitter account does not have blue tick verification and these are only the second and third tweets he has ever posted. But no one seems to be in any doubt that it is the real Olly Robbins. Only a civil servant could come up with something that bland.Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has warned that the UK will build its own satellite navigation system to rival the European Union’s €10bn Galileo project if Brussels carries out its threat to block access, my colleague Daniel Boffey reports.Earlier this week the SNP released one of the key findings of the report it argues that every Scot could be £4,100 better off if Scotland were able to match the growth rates of other smaller wealthy nations.But it did say the report would recommend 12 key lessons for an independent Scotland to learn from SAEs, with Denmark, Finland and New Zealand particularly important role models. It said the lessons are:1. Quality of governance \u0026amp disciplined public finances 3. Focus on innovation 4. Competitive location for international investment 8. Flexible labour markets combined with fair \u0026amp progressive workplace \u0026amp active employment policies including reducing the gender pay gap 9. Highly skilled workforce with transferable skills 10. Taxation for economic development not competing as low tax location 11. Inclusive growth at the heart of the strategy 12. Quality of life as an asset and objectiveIn a statement issued as part of the news release, Andrew Wilson, the chair of the commission, said:As a first step there must be an acceptance that small nations can be successful and that Scotland can be one of those countries. Our work shows that small countries can be amongst the most economically successful countries in the world, with higher standards of living and lower levels of inequality than many larger economies.There is nothing intrinsic in any of the best performing economies that Scotland does not have. To secure an improvement in our performance will take purposeful strategic effort for over a generation. We require world class policy, world class institutions and cross partisan effort if we are to achieve our ambition to create a much more successful economy and cohesive and fair society. We have produced a design to demonstrate how Scotland can emulate the best performing economies and societies in the world sustainably. Our sincere hope is that this can raise the content and quality of debate at a time such a focus is sorely needed.The Scottish independence referendum took place less than four years ago, but in memory it seems to belong to another era. It featured Alex Salmond, David Cameron and Ed Miliband, and one of the more effective arguments used by Cameron and others on the unionist side was that the only way to guarantee that Scotland would stay in the EU would be to vote no to independence. Also, compared to the carnival of mendacity that came two years later when the UK voted on EU membership, it was a serious, mature campaign that, for the most part, saw the issues being debated in a responsible fashion.And no issue was more important than the economy, and how easily Scotland would manage if it decided to go it alone. Ultimately the SNP could not persuade Scots that they would prosper financially under independence and the no side won quite convincingly. Nicola Sturgeon replaced Salmond as first minister and realised, that if the SNP were to have any chance of winning a second referendum, they would have to go into the campaign with a more robust argument on the economy.And today we’re going to see their most significant move since 2014 towards the construction of that case. The SNP set up a sustainable growth commission, under the former MSP turned lobbyist Andrew Wilson, to draw up an economic blueprint for an independent Scotland and today that mammoth document is being published.And overnight a key proposal has emerged. This is from the Press Association report.An independent Scotland should keep the pound during an extended transition period after leaving the UK, the sustainable growth commission will say. The report - which was set up by the SNP to look at future economic prospects - is to be published later on Friday morning. It will outline that sterling should remain as the country’s currency for a period of time after any break from the union, while the first minister has said the commission will “restart the debate” about Scottish independence.The full Wilson report is due out at 9.30am. I will be covering it in detail.Otherwise it is a relatively quiet day. Jeremy Corbyn is in Northern Ireland visiting the border and Philip Hammond, the chancellor, is at the Ecofin meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels.As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

I suspect there will be a few England batsmen watching this with envy after what went down yesterday. He gets a couple more behind square easier runs there. But just as Jimmy did in the previous over, Stu bites back with a ripper: a full ball that just beats the bat and the stumps. Then a real beaut to finish, seaming away from the right-hander to just evade the edge. Something for everyone  good track? I’d say so. Ping: Australian curators. 29th over: Pakistan 69-1 (Azhar 24, Haris 34) Bang, bang! Haris nearly beat cover to end Anderson’s previous over and does with the first ball of this fresh one. Nice stroke, four runs. Next ball, he’s into it again with an even better drive. The number three is in super nick. Anderson bites back later in the over, seaming one past the southpaw’s edge. Then finishes with a beauty! Again beating the blade, from a ball he had to play at. Plenty in this for fans of both sides in this first half hour or so. Richard Hagan asking a question that I insist that we get to the bottom of. “Which hand did Goughie ring the bell with? I know that he writes left-handed even though he bowled and threw right-handed, so wondered which he used for campanology.” Related: Mark Taylor plays golf right handed. Work that out for me. 28th over: Pakistan 61-1 (Azhar 24, Haris 26) Broad sends down a maiden to Azhar who is determiend to leave as many deliveries early on as possible. Sound approach for the most part, but not when the veteran quick gets one to jag back off the seam. That wasn’t far at all from England’s first breakthrough of the morning. Broad has a little stare in response and fair enough. It won’t bother Azhar, though. I say that having watched him bat for about four days in a row at the MCG a couple of years back. 27th over: Pakistan 61-1 (Azhar 24, Haris 26) Nice tuck from Haris, who works the first ball of Anderson’s fresh over for the first boundary of the morning. He’s back to leaving before Jimmy gets him playing by the end of the set. Nice drive to finish, albeit to the man at extra cover. Enjoying this. 26th over: Pakistan 57-1 (Azhar 24, Haris 22) Broad attacking the stumps, trying to seam into Azhar’s stumpspads. He’s getting some generous movement through the air as well. The right-hander responds by getting on the front foot to drive. It’s more a squirt, but through the gap at cover for two. Good early contest. I have an email from my (other) home town of Melbourne. Good evening to Murray MacLachlan. “Always lovely to see the OBO doing its slow-motion equivalent of the Star Wars opening narrative crawl up the page, and thanks in particular for the link to Ben Jones’ analysis of Pakistan’s first day. As someone with an interest in public communication of statistical analyses, I’m inclined to suggest that the bowler performance graphs of swing and speed might be helped by keeping the players named in say alphabetical order along the abscissa. Another useful graph could be an x:y diagram of speed vs swing. Maybe also add another player into the reporting, because benchmarking is a thing nowadays: Trent Boult, who seems have played a hand in affairs. Finally, moneyball seems to have taken cricket, always a statistical sport, to new heights of measurement: “complimentary” bowling is a great idea to report on, although it’s hard to measure, maybe number of smiles and gentle murmurs of praise per over, and certainly it’s quite the opposite of what we have to put up with hereabouts, as the Australian national side is known for being quite the opposite.”I’ll pass those thoughts onto the CricViz fellas who crunch the numbers at the back of the box. Super nerdy work, but I enjoy what they find. 25th over: Pakistan 55-1 (Azhar 22, Haris 22) Jimmy over the wicket to begin to Sohail from the posh end, making him present a neat, vertical blade from the get-go. He changes up half way through to go round and create an angle to the slips down the slope if he can get it to straighten, but he isn’t quite accurate enough to make him play. Nice tight leave to finish. Maiden. “At the risk of loading a ludicrous amount of significance onto a single day’s cricket I’m going to do exactly that,” advises Ian Dunn. “If Pakistan get a stranglehold on this game this morning it makes the next 18 months of English test cricket look rather fraught. They win this game and England can’t win the series. They’ve then got the five tests against India - the best side in the world, who you’d make favourites - even in England. They’ve then got tricky three match test series away against Sri Lanka and the West Indies, both sides showing signs of resurgence. And With England’s away form... and then it’s back to the Ashes - and the possibility of England going Ashes to Ashes without winning a test series in between for the first time since the dark days of the mid-1980s” I think you might mean the mid-1990s? Either way, I’m feeling your pain. And many others my new inbox is already full of utter dismay. 24th over: Pakistan 55-1 (Azhar 22, Haris 22) Broad into his work running away from us at the Nursery End, beating the bat of Haris Sohail from round the wicket third ball of the morning. Just a waft to a ball that moved gently off the seam. The number three gets his first run of the morning to cover with a push, Dom Bess doing the fielding. I’m looking forward to seeing him a bit later today. Azhar tucks one around the corner to get his day going as well. Oh, nice movement again to finish from Broad, this time away from Azhar, who plays it late from the outside half of the bat down to third man for a couple. Nice start, Stuart. Darren Gough rings the MCC bell. The players are striding out. That means we’re ready to go. Play! More emails on Root. “Morning.” Hello Stephen Wolstencroft. “Further to Felix Wood’s point, the obvious thing to do when Cook (never a natural or willing captain either) stood down was to get Morgan in to bat at six and skipper,” he writes. Interesting. “Even if he averaged 20 he still would have provided leadership and tactical nous that would’ve been more valuable than an extra 10 or 15 runs.” He argues that without the burden of captaincy “Root could’ve carried on cheerfully scampering quick runs and doing Norman Wisdom impressions. The best we can hope for now is for Root to become a kind of neo-Atherton, grimly carving out the odd defiant innings while his team crumbles around him.” As for Philip Malcolm, he believes that Root has problems in the field as well. “His inability to enact the most basic duty of the midweek captain and tell his bowlers to pitch it up last night was indicative. I don’t think he’s strong enough to go against guys who have been playing in the team for 10 years.”Blimey. Brutal takes everywhere this morning.TMS are reporting that the weather will remain fine all day. Good. And getting in before I’m asked, here is the youtube link to listen to their call if you’re outside of the UK (but stick with me). Michael Vaughan is on there now recommending an Alcoholics Anonymous-style solution to England’s batting woes. “They need to get in a circle and admit that they have a driving problem.” Also looking back at Thursday, in case you missed it, here is our Vic Marks presenting Dom Bess with his England cap. I love this stuff.Opening the batting, is Felix Wood. “England seem to have played the same test repeatedly over the last year or so despite all the ‘lessons learnt’,” he begins. Now he really gets stuck in:“When are we just going to admit that Root is a bad choice of captain? Fundamentally lacking the discipline both of self and of his team to win test matches. When your team continually get low totals peppered with soft dismissals, when your bowlers consistently try and force it, when off field distractions regularly disrupt things, when you show yourself utterly incapable of challenging the party line....you’re not a good leader. That’s fine. Few people are. And when leadership also causes your primary strength to go from very good, often brilliant to sub-average, sometimes awful, it’s time to accept the fact that captaincy isn’t for you.”(Don’t hold back!) Can’t say I share this view. Of course, Root will be (and should be) under the pump for the shot be played yesterday and the results over the winter. But I’m not sure what the alternative iswas? What if he just doesn’t have the cattle? More questions than answers, etc etc. Pakistan have got them at a good time, that’s for sure.Some pre-play listening. I popped this on when coming in this morning. An excellent chat yesterday at lunch on TMS with Aggers and Wasim Khan. Great insight on what happens next with The Hundred from an ECB perspective, how the county championship could look into the future and their new South Asian strategy. Worth it. From my vantage point high up in the press box, Lord’s looks just as it as 24 hours ago, without the earlier rain: cloudy and muggy. Conditions that Anderson and Broad should be able to make the most of, and must if they are any chance of dragging the hosts back into this after getting seamed out for 184. Alastair Cook said last night that England were about 60-70 short in what he expects will be a low-scoring scrap. We should know by about tea time today whether that’s wishful thinking or not from the former skip. Beneath me, the Pakistani side have started their warm-ups, the football out for some keepy-uppy in the best traditions of preparing to play cricket. England will be out for their own kickabout soon, I’m sure. On those visiting quicks, they were sumptuous yesterday. I enjoyed this analysis of their accuracy almost as much as I did Hasan Ali’s wicket celebrations. Ali Martin wrote a nice piece last night about Hasan, detailing how much this fella loves his cricket. It shows.Right, so it’s lovely to be back with you on the OBO. The last time I was in the chair for an England Test Match they were being crashed and bashed on the dreary final day in Sydney. Between times, I toured South Africa with the Australians for six weeks. There was nothing to see there, of course. Yeah. Nothing at all. Oh, in case you missed it, the next games Steve Smith (and maybe Dave Warner) are playing are in Canada. I’m sure you won’t need any encouragement to have some fun with that in your emails. Let’s get those emails going between now and the first ball in about 40 minutes from now. In my absence, my address in this parish has changed. You can now grab me on this one (you better believe I’m casual), or on the tweet if that’s more your jam.

That changed late last year when the Golden Knights, the NHL\u0027s first expansion team in 17 years, broke ice in the desert.It\u0027s fair to say that the Golden Knights were viewed as a novelty rather than a team that was meant to instantly contend for silverware. After all, the early years for expansion teams tend to follow a normal pattern: An expansion draft produces a rag-tag group of misfits who go on to stink during their inaugural season, gaining their franchise valuable draft picks for future seasons.The Golden Knights, however, haven\u0027t followed the normal pattern. Their habit has been winning hockey games, shocking pundits along the way to the Stanley Cup final.Historically, NHL expansion teams struggle in their first season and more often than not finish bottom of their conference. The only exceptions are the expansion teams of 1967 who were all placed into their own additional Western conference. This guaranteed that one team, the St Louis Blues, would make it to the final. They were unsurprisingly swept in four games.The Knights, however, weren\u0027t guaranteed anything. Their incredible form (51-24-7) saw them record the best inaugural regular season of any NHL expansion team in history. Their rookie winning percentage was 23 points better than the previous best, the Anaheim Ducks.On top of this impressive record, the Knights are the only true expansion team to make the NHL playoffs in their inaugural season. They even made it look easy by winning the Pacific Division in order to get there. Each step after that was viewed as a remarkable achievement. They beat the Kings, the Sharks and finally the Jets to reach the Stanley Cup final, making an already historic season the stuff of dreams.For context, there are four NHL sides who have never reached the finals, despite trying for a combined 89 seasons. Now the Knights are only four wins away from winning the Stanley Cup. A feat that was priced at a 500-1 chance of happening at the beginning of the season.Within their league the Knights come out golden helmet and shoulder plates above their associates. However, their story isn’t limited to the ice. Compared to the best starters from other major US sports leagues their story becomes even more remarkable.Like the NHL\u0027s history of expansion teams, all new sides brought into NFL, NBA and MLB have failed to make the playoffs in their first season.Almost. New expansion teams from the major four US sports might initially struggle but in MLS it\u0027s a different story.Chicago Fire, Houston Dynamo, Seattle Sounders and Atlanta United all achieved instant success by reaching the playoffs in their first seasons in MLS. The Fire and Dynamo actually went further and brought home MLS Cup in their inaugural season (Dynamo won the title in their second season, too). However, this isn\u0027t exactly a like-for-like comparison.While MLS does have a similar process of inducting new teams into their league, there is one telling difference: the importance of expansion drafts. Let\u0027s take the most recent MLS success story, Atlanta United. They drafted five players in their expansion draft, three of whom were instantly traded while the other two are now on loan at lower-level clubs.The simple reason is that MLS clubs have a huge global talent pool at their disposal. The best soccer players tend to ply their trade in Europe and South America. Top players can be signed freely in less regulated foreign transfer markets. As for NHL, and the other major US sports, the best players are already there. Not only does this make MLS an unfair comparison, it also makes the Knights success even more impressive. They had to feed on the scraps left by the established teams.Outside of MLS, reaching the playoffs for an expansion team is a pipe dream, so the Knights are on the verge of making unprecedented and unexpected history with their shot of winning the whole thing. However, should it all go wrong against their Stanley Cup opponents, the Washington Capitals, all is not lost. If they can come back stronger and prove this team is built for success, reaching the heights of a sport early on in a franchise\u0027s history isn\u0027t impossible.That the Golden Knights are surprisingly good at hockey, regardless of what happens over the next week. Their team, cobbled together from unprotected draft picks, have achieved success that transcends their sport.Opposing fans might bemoan a rigged deck in an expansion draft that was weighted towards instant success. They might have a point given how many players teams were able to protect in the draft (only 11 players compared to 15 in the last expansion draft in 2000). However, it\u0027s worth reiterating that the teams agreed to this format.It\u0027s also worth noting how aggressively their picks were panned by the pundits – some that haven\u0027t dated particularly well. They chose a reliable goalie, albeit an aging one, in Marc-André Fleury who has responded to his critics by arguably having his best season yet. They also picked up a lot of fringe and aging players who are remarkably posting career-best numbers. That doesn\u0027t just happen.Who knows? The Knights are the only franchise in US sports history to be asked such a question in their first season. The fact that so many players have improved under the Knights\u0027 management would suggest there\u0027s been something behind this success. Equally it could just be down to beginner\u0027s luck. The only thing that\u0027s clear is that for Las Vegas, the long wait for a team to call its own has been more than worth it, for this season at least."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f183d9937a705b78a19c48d286edd2031e262242/149_311_5091_3054/master/5091.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=773dcc18600aac09386e55787cc05f9e","title":"amazon alexa recorded conversation","story":"The company, which has insisted its Echo devices aren’t always recording, has confirmed the audio was sentNo matter how suspicious it has seemed that Amazon is encouraging us to put listening devices in every room of our homes, the company has always said that its Echo assistants are not listening in on or recording conversations. Over and over again, company spokespeople have promised that they only start recording if someone says the wake word: “Alexa”.It’s a spiel Danielle, an Alexa user from Portland, Oregon, had believed. She’d installed Echo devices and smart bulbs in every room in her house, accepting Amazon’s claims that they were not invading her privacy. But today she asked the company to investigate after an Alexa device recorded a private conversation between her and her husband and sent it to a random number in their address book without their permission.Danielle found out her Alexa was recording when she received an alarming call from one of her husband’s colleagues saying: “Unplug your Alexa devices right now, you’re being hacked.”She told KIRO-TV in Seattle that at first she didn’t believe the co-worker, but then she said: “You sat there talking about hardwood floors.” Danielle realised the colleague must have heard everything.“I felt invaded,” she told KIRO-TV. “A total privacy invasion. Immediately, I said, ‘I’m never plugging that device in again because I can’t trust it.’”An Amazon customer service representative confirmed that Danielle’s audio had been sent to the number and apologised but didn’t provide any information about why the device had been activated. A spokesperson for the company said it had “determined this was an extremely rare occurrence”.At 6pm ET on Thursday, an Amazon spokesperson provided an updated statement with an explanation for why they believe Alexa forwarded the conversation. They said: Recognising the improbability of this series of mishaps occuring, they added: “As unlikely as this string of events is, we are evaluating options to make this case even less likely.”Although Amazon maintains this was a malfunction rather than proof Alexa is always listening, the company has filed patent applications in the past for functionalities that involve always listening, such as an algorithm that would analyse when people say they “love” or “bought” something. The patent included a diagram where two people have a phone conversation and were served afterwards with separate targeted advertisements."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a3e5a1014d2a13599ce02cad6ad907319da1350/0_63_4798_2879/master/4798.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5842d06022490070adabe3b1e504fea2","title":"sites block eu users before gdpr takes effect","story":"Some companies push new onerous terms of service on users as GDPR rules come into force on FridayDozens of websites shut down their activities completely, others forced users to agree to new terms of service, and inboxes have been flooded with emails begging customers to remain on mailing lists as the GDPR rules come into force on Friday.The biggest update in data protection laws since the 1990s is posing major challenges for developers and businesses – while giving substantial new powers to consumers.Margot James, the digital minister, told the : “Of the eight guiding principles that governed the use of personal information under the old act, we have made an important addition – accountability. In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, UK citizens more than ever need reassurances their data is as safe as it can be and that organisations are accountable for it.”She said businesses would now have to prove they had been given permission to use a inidual’s information, including contact details.“Except in certain, limited instances, organisations now must demonstrate they have our explicit consent to process our sensitive personal data. Generally, we’ve also given greater control to the British public over how their data is used. No doubt like me you’ll have received a flurry of emails in recent weeks from the organisations currently holding your data, and perhaps some you weren’t even aware did, asking for you to re-submit this consent.”The cascade of emails from businesses has become the most visible consumer-facing effect of the new regulation, sent by firms who want users to actively give their consent to remain on a mailing list. But, according to the Information Commissioner’s Office, such emails aren’t necessary to comply with the law.“Some of the myths we’ve heard are, ‘GDPR means I won’t be able to send my newsletter out anymore’ or ‘GDPR says I’ll need to get fresh consent for everything I do’,” Steve Wood, the deputy information commissioner, wrote on the organisation’s website earlier this month. “I can say categorically that these are wrong … You do not need to automatically refresh all existing consents in preparation for the new law.”Campaign groups and political parties who have come to rely on large email mailing lists to contact supporters could find they lose one of their main ways of communicating with the public. It has been suggested that businesses could be forced turn to more traditional methods – such as targeting customers with direct mail through the postal system – to reach customers.How has becoming compliant played out in your workplace?

You can read terms of service\u0026nbsphere.As the GDPR deadline neared, some websites and services started to push users to agree to onerous new terms of service before they could continue on to their destination. Websites run by Oath, the media firm formed through the merger of Yahoo! and AOL, received a blanket request on Thursday morning, asking users for consent “to use your … data to understand your interests and personalise and measure ads”. Users could click OK to move on, or follow a chain of further links to discover that the consent granted involved sharing data with more than a hundred ad networks. Another Oath site, Tumblr, placed a similar clickthrough before users. The blogging platform did offer some links to understand “how our partners use this data”. However, even this background information was hosted on Tumblr blogs, meaning users had to accept the terms in order to read information about the terms they were accepting. The US media network NPR took a simpler approach. Users could either agree to the new terms, or decline and be taken to a plain-text version of the site, looking for all the world like it had last been updated in 1996.It wasn’t just websites. PC hardware maker Razer issued an update to one of its computer mice, warning that users may find their devices weren’t working if they didn’t update Chinese smart-home manufacturer Yeelight disabled inter-connected lightbulbs because of the data protection regulation.And a growing number of companies are taking the nuclear option to ensure compliance: blocking all European users from their servers.Instapaper, a service owned by the US firm Pinterest which enables users to save articles to read at a later date, became the latest to disconnect European customers on Thursday. It said the cutoff was temporary while it made the required changes, and told users: “We apologise for any inconvenience, and we intend to restore access as soon as possible.” Pinterest did not respond to a request for comment.Other companies have taken a more permanent approach. Unroll.me, an inbox management firm, announced it was completely withdrawing services for EU companies due to an inability to offer its product – which is monetised by selling insights gleaned from reading users’ emails – in a way that was compatible with EU law. “We are truly sorry that we are unable to offer our service to you,” the company told EU users.American media network A+E has blocked EU visitors from all its websites, including History, and some multiplayer online games, including Ragnarok Online, have switched off their EU servers.Other firms have not gone so far as to blame the new regulation but have closed EU operations with convenient timing. Crowdpac, a political fundraising organisation set up by David Cameron’s former advisor Steve Hilton, announced it was closing its UK wing “for business reasons” until further notice. The company, which was still raising funds in the UK as recently as Sunday, now says it “hopes one day to be back”.Klout, a social media analytics service, and Super Monday Night Combat, an online game, will shut down on Friday. Lithium, the owner of Klout, said: “Klout no longer made sense as a standalone service. The upcoming deadline for GDPR implementation simply expedited our plans to sunset Klout.”Brian Honan, a data protection expert, said he viewed the shutdowns as a reasonable consequence of the new law. “The GDPR’s primary goal is to enhance the protections around the gathering and processing of the personal data belonging to iniduals residing within the European Union,” he said.“Companies have had well over two years to prepare for the enforcement date and to be ready.”Unfortunately, even going to the extremes of blocking every user based in the EU might not be enough to inure companies from the consequences of GDPR: the law applies to data processed on EU citizens wherever they are based in the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a90a16d09b702c885465fef2c48e9a8fb2da5980/0_0_2988_1793/master/2988.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=befea1fef4e849400ce1209588a611ef","title":"marine le pens niece tipped as future far right leader drops family name","story":"Marion Marechal, granddaughter of National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, changes surname but keeps rightwing viewsThe name Le Pen, for decades associated with anti-immigration and often racist politics in France, is so out of fashion that one of the leading members of the country’s far-right family has abandoned it.The move has further dismayed Jean-Marie Le Pen, the nationalist patriarch who co-founded France’s National Front (FN) party in 1972 and built it up into a formidable political force.First his daughter Marine led a campaign to “detoxify” the FN after taking over as leader in 2011 – in the process disavowing Le Pen senior’s history of incendiary rhetoric. During the 2017 presidential election Marine Le Pen used only her first name on campaign material in a bid to widen her appeal, and she plans to confirm a name change for the party on 1 June as part of a rebranding exercise.Now granddaughter Marion Marechal-Le Pen, often tipped as a future leader of the far right despite stepping back from public life last year, has dropped one of the most famous – and infamous – names in French politics.“Marion perhaps thinks that it is too much of weight to carry,” Jean-Marie Le Pen said last week.On her social media accounts Marion has changed her profile names from Marion Le Pen to simply Marion Marechal and announced she intends to be known by the latter from now on.The change “was a way to demonstrate my transition to civilian life. I have never and will never feel ashamed of my name”, she told the rightwing Boulevard Voltaire website.Marion, a photogenic 28-year-old former MP and devout Catholic, added her mother Yann Le Pen’s name to her surname in 2012 as she launched her successful bid to enter parliament, she explained. Following reported tensions with her aunt Marine, she announced last May that she would not seek to defend her seat in the FN’s southern heartland in the Vaucluse area in order to spend more time with her daughter and work in the private sector.Some observers suspect she intends to return to politics, perhaps to succeed Marine, and a widely publicised appearance at a conservative political meeting in Washington in March fed speculation about her intentions.“Just like you we want our country back,” she told her American audience.Her first act since leaving politics has been to launch a study programme in the south-eastern city of Lyon called the Institute of Social Science, Economics and Politics (Issep).The school, which will offer masters qualifications with no formal recognition, will offer highly conservative courses with an emphasis on “cultural identity”.Its directors and teaching staff are mostly drawn from far-right and hard-right political circles, with conservative views on immigration, gay rights and French culture. It will open its doors to students in September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33000b90e34bd9d2d2bab0c856247a0c32a92b1a/0_393_5015_3009/master/5015.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f00ca193acc03624638546c9001d7286","title":"who betrayed anne frank book claims to shed new light on mystery","story":"Son of Dutch resistance member says Nazis were alerted to family’s secret chamber by Jewish collaboratorA new book has provided what it claims is fresh evidence that Anne Frank and her family were betrayed by a Jewish woman who was executed after the second world war for collaborating with the Nazis.The mystery of how the Franks were found in a secret annex in a building on Amsterdam’s Prinsengracht in August 1944 has thwarted formal investigations and troubled academics ever since.The involvement of Ans van Dijk, who was executed in 1948 after admitting to collaborating in the capture of 145 people, including her own brother and his family, had been previously claimed. But, the Anne Frank House museum and research centre had been unable to come to any conclusion, despite police investigations and its own studies.Fresh claims have now been made in a book by Gerard Kremer, 70, the son of a member of the Dutch resistance of the same name, who was an acquaintance of Van Dijk in Amsterdam.According to the book, Kremer Sr, who died in 1978, was the caretaker of an office building at the back of Prinsengracht on Amsterdam’s Westermarkt, two floors of which was taken over by the German authorities and the Dutch Nazi organisation the NSB during the occupation of the Netherlands.It is claimed that after her arrest on Easter Sunday 1943 by the Nazi intelligence service known as the the Sicherheitsdienst, Van Dijk became a regular visitor to the building, albeit in disguise. She would also use the telephones in the requisitioned offices, Kremer noticed.The book suggests that in early August 1944, Kremer overheard Van Dijk taking part in discussions in the Nazi offices about Prinsengracht, where the Franks were hiding. The Franks were arrested on 4 August, while Van Dijk was said to have left for The Hague.Anne had been hidden for two years in the concealed annex above the canalside warehouse with her father, Otto, mother, Edith, and sister, Margot.The 15-year-old was sent to the Westerbork transit camp, and on to Auschwitz before finally ending up at Bergen-Belsen, where she died in February 1945 from typhus. Her published diary s the period in hiding between 1942 and 1944.A spokeswoman for Anne Frank House said the museum had been in touch with the author of The Backyard of the Secret Annex, but that there remained no proof of Van Dijk’s guilt.“We consider Gerard Kremer’s book as a tribute to his parents, based on what he remembers and has heard. In 2016, the Anne Frank House carried out research into the arrest of the Frank family and the other four people in hiding in the secret annex.“Ans van Dijk was included as a potential traitor in this study. We have not been able to find evidence for this theory, nor for other betrayal theories.”Last year an FBI agent launched a cold case review into the Frank family’s discovery by the Gestapo in 1944. Investigative techniques developed in the past decade, including the crunching of big data to uncover leads, are being used by a team of 19 forensic experts led by Vince Pankoke. Van Hoof said the review led by Pankoke was examining the claims in the book.A 2010 book by Sytze van der Zee, a former editor-in-chief of the Het Parool newspaper, previously noted that many of Van Dijk’s victims had lived near Prinsengracht.David Barnouw, an emeritus researcher at the Dutch Institute for war, holocaust and genocide studies, offered a cautious response to the book’s claims, and suggested the Franks’ discovery may have been pure chance.Speaking to the De Volkskrant newspaper, Barnouw said there lacked a “smoking gun” in regard to Van Dijk’s claims. He said: “And I wonder if we’ll ever see that smoking gun. I fear that it is now too late to establish conclusively who it was.”After the war, Van Dijk moved to The Hague, where she was arrested at a friend’s home on 20 June 1945. Two years later she was charged on 23 counts of treason and brought to the special court in Amsterdam, where she confessed on all counts, and was sentenced to death.Her attempts to appeal the decision and gain a royal pardon on the grounds that she had acted out of self-preservation failed. In January 1948 she was executed by firing squad at Fort Bijlmer, in Amsterdam. She converted to Roman Catholicism the night before her execution."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3507678.1527192306!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish backstop provisions cannot be used for britain says eu","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May:  “The UK thinks everything has to change on the EU’s side so that everything can stay the same for the UK,”  a senior EU official said. Photograph: Will OliverEPAProposals that the UK would use the Irish “backstop” provisions in Britain as well as Northern Ireland after Brexit will simply not be acceptable, the EU told British negotiators at talks in Brussels this week.A senior EU official on Thursday night described the proposals from prime minister Theresa May as a “fantasy”.The UK is proposing to maintain regulatory alignment with the whole of the EU for a limited period after transition out of the EU to avoid cutting the North off from the rest of the UK and to obviate the necessity for a border on the Irish Sea.But its negotiators were told during three days of talks here that “regulatory alignment was not available on an all-UK basis”, because it would mean a form of cherry-picking and a breach of fundamental single market rules.And the UK could not be allowed simply to commit to joint all-UK customs controls on a “time-limited basis” because they would “undermine the whole purpose of the guarantee”.The EU official warned that progress on the Irish border – “let alone substantive progress” – was proving “elusive”.The UK is suggesting the withdrawal agreement protocol and its backstop guarantee should include an assumption that an eventual alternative arrangement will be agreed for frictionless borders between the UK and the EU as a whole. But if such an agreement is not forthcoming, officials here say, there must be the backstop provisions to fall back on. Time-limiting their application would remove that guarantee.In the Northern Ireland strand of the discussions, they had made progress on issues such as the single electricity market, and VAT rules, but had not discussed the “crunch” issues of the Border, regulatory alignment and customs.The issue was raised, however, by the UK team in the discussion on the future relationshiptrade agreement, where they said that Ms May was determined to implement the backstop on an all-UK basis “through the overall EU-UK relationship”.The EU team said that the “backstop must be Northern Ireland-specific”.“We have to do away with the fantasy that there is an all-UK solution to this,” the senior official said.A senior official described the talks on the full range of Brexit issues, from Northern Ireland to the future relationship, as frustrating, observing that: “To paraphrase The Leopard by Tomasi di Lampedusa, I have the impression that the UK thinks everything has to change on the EU’s side so that everything can stay the same for the UK.”The  reported senior sources at the Brexit department, however, rejecting the suggestion that Brussels had dismissed the UK’s new backstop plan, suggesting that it was “simply a negotiating position” and that they believed the EU was open to the idea. “It’s a public stance for them to take during the negotiation,” one said.A No 10 source added: “This is what they do every time. As usual we’ve heard it all before. There’s nothing they’ve said which concerns us.”In their discussions of an overall trade deal, the UK rejected the suggestion from the EU of a free trade pact, and pressed their demands for a generalised system of mutual recognition and managed ergence. EU officials said that a system of mutual recognition, however, would not be available outside the single market – it would require higher external levels of trust than internally.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"South Korea\u0026rsquos Moon Jae-in urges US president to speak directly to Kim Jong-unBerlin and Beijing stand by Iran nuclear deal despite US decision to withdraw from pactDemolition witnessed by foreign reporters but no independent scientists presentGermany\u0026rsquos task is to keep both China and US onside despite contentious trade surplusesMalaysian minister announces conclusion of operation to locate missing planeAccusations of censorship as Otago University says people found cover \u0026lsquoobjectionable\u0026rsquoRoot-and-branch reform under way as regime that ruled for half a century is dismantledTalks between North and South may resume on Friday after military drills involving US finishChinese affluence and urbanisation is leading couples to want to have fewer offspringVirus transmitted by bats and pigs identified as having potential for major outbreakWitness said Philip Wilson ordered him to recite 10 Hail Marys after reporting assaultUS has condemned landings of nuclear-capable aircraft as destabilising the regionSeoul Letter: feminist revolt takes on Confucian patriarchy in IT, arts, politics and filmPyongyang may pull out of talks over air force drillsProperty raid part of inquiry into Najib Razak\u0026rsquos role in major graft scandalDays after election defeat, armed police carry out raid in connection with graft inquiryTrump says \u0026lsquoWe\u0026rsquoll see what happens\u0026rsquo as North Koreans threaten to cancel meetingPyongyang threatens to torpedo summit in anger at US-South Korean air force drillsAnwar to take time off after pledging \u0026lsquocomplete support\u0026rsquo to new PM Mahathir MohamadOfficial says Pyongyang has no interest in holding \u0026lsquoone-sided\u0026rsquo talks with US"},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis erupting kilauea volcano pictures","story":"Kilauea volcano has created nearly two dozen lava-shooting fissures on Hawaii\u0027s Big Island since the eruption began, spewing lava and emitting toxic gases.Thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes and experts remain unsure of where more of the hazardous cracks might open up, or when the volcanic activity might stop.The eruption of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii sparked new safety warnings about toxic gas on the Big Island\u0027s southern coastline after lava began flowing into the ocean and setting off a chemical reaction.Comment: Britain once led the world in fighting climate change.

The enduring commitment demonstrates Britain’s ongoing commitment operationally and diplomatically in the region, naval sources told The .Britain has had a presence in the Gulf for decades, but the three-week sea passage to deploy and recover a ship meant there were long periods with no Royal Naval assets in the region.The plan to base a Type-23 Frigate – and from the mid-2020s the next generation Type-31 – would likely see the whole ship’s company flown out to take over the vessel based in Bahrain.Routine maintenance of the ships would be carried out at the Mina Salman base, with the ship likely to remain in the region for about three years. The more comprehensive depth servicing every five to 10 years will be done in the UK. Gavin Williamson has announced the move in a show of support for NatoSmaller minehunter vessels have been based in the region for the last 10 years, but crews have deployed via Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships. The use of the new support base and a Type 23 frigate is a step change in naval capability.The Defence secretary also spoke of to the “increasing aggression and increasing assertiveness” of Russia. In 2010 the Royal Navy had to respond once to a Russian navy vessel approaching UK territorial waters. “Last year we had to respond 33 times”, he said.Comment: Britain once led the world in fighting climate change.

The trend is really worrying.”The government’s focus on improving the take-up of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) subjects could have played a part as figures show sciences and maths did not suffer the same fate at A-level. The number of entries in computing – one of the government’s flagship subjects – jumped by 26 per cent from 7,710 in 2017 to 9,685 this year. And uptake of the maths A-level rose by 3 per cent.Unions say the government’s exam reforms – such as the introduction of the tougher English GCSE– may also have deterred some students from studying English in sixth-form.Jill Stokoe, a policy advisor at the National Education Union, told The Independent: “I think part of it is the drive towards Stem.“With English, history and geography, it could be that the difficulty of the new GCSE specification has put people off at A-level.”And reforms – which mean AS levels no longer count towards final grades – are likely to have led to fewer students taking these subjects in Year 12 and then deciding to take them onto A-level.Figures show that entries for AS levels have fallen by almost 60 per cent this year – from 659,880 to 269,090 – continuing a trend triggered by the decoupling of AS levels from A-levels.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesAlastair Cook batting against Pakistan during the first test match of the summer at Lord’s cricket ground, London.

And in performingexpressive arts, entries among GCSE students plummeted by 40 per cent. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the school headteachers’ union (NAHT), said: “Students’ experiences of a narrower curriculum at GCSE is now having an impact on their sixth form studies.”Disadvantaged students with lower grades do as well in medical schoolHe added: “It is now impossible to argue that the EBacc measure is not having a narrowing effect on young people’s choices at GCSE. “These reforms put schools in an impossible situation where they must reduce the opportunities they offer to pupils in order to satisfy an arbitrary government target.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “The Government has worked with employers to reform GCSEs and make them gold-standard qualifications. They will prepare pupils for future success and help deliver the skills Britain needs to be fit for the future. Entries to the core academic EBacc subjects have increased, with over 4 million of these exams being taken this year, including significant increases to those taking the inidual sciences.They added: These subjects give pupils the best foundation to progress into further education and employment. Thanks to our reforms and the hard work of teachers, academic standards are rising with 1.9 million more children in good or outstanding schools than in 2010.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it. Even Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Cyprus\u0027 singer Eleni Foureira performs the song FuegoIsrael\u0027s singer Netta performs the song Toy Belgium\u0027s singer Sennek performs the song A Matter Of Time Estonia\u0027s singer Elina Nechayeva performs the song La ForzaCroatia\u0027s singer Franka performs the song Crazy Albania\u0027s singer Eugent Bushpepa performs the song MallCzech Republic\u0027s singer Mikolas Josef performs the song Lie To MeIreland\u0027s singer Ryan O\u0027Shaughnessy performs the song TogetherSwiss duo ZIBBZ\u0027s singer Corinne Gfeller performs the song StonesBulgarian group Equinox\u0027 singer Zhana Bergendorff (R) performs the song BonesLithuania\u0027s singer Ieva Zasimauskaite performs the song When We\u0027re OldFinland\u0027s singer Saara Aalto performs the song MonstersGreece\u0027s singer Yianna Terzi performs the song Oniro MouAustria\u0027s singer Cesar Sampson performs the song Nobody But YouAzerbaijan\u0027s singer Aisel performs the song X My HeartIceland\u0027s singer Ari Olafsson performs the song Our ChoiceArmenia\u0027s singer Sevak Khanagyan performs the song QamiMacedonian duo Eye Cue\u0027s lead vocalist Marija Ivanovska (R) and guitarist Bojan Trajkovski perform the song Lost And FoundBelarus\u0027 singer Alekseev performs the song ForeverNorway\u0027s singer Alexander Rybak performs the song That\u0027s How You Write A SongRomanian band The Humans perform the song GoodbyeSerbia\u0027s band Sanja Ilic \u0026amp Balkanika perform the song Nova DecaSan Marino\u0027s Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening perform the song Who We AreDenmark\u0027s singer Rasmussen performs the song Higher GroundPoland\u0027s singer Gromee feat.

The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.Utah teenager, Keziah Daum, sparked a huge debate on Twitter about cultural appropriation after posting photos of her traditional Chinese prom dressAnd I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War (though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).Fanny\u0027s Kebabs finally dropped the \u0027posh\u0027 bit from their marketing (fannyskebabsInstagram)If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.Black and White minstralsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Due to be released this summer, the\u0026nbspaction plan will be an official response to the survey’s findings.The news comes as the UK falls to fourth in Europe in the Rainbow Index, a yearly ranking of the progress made in LGBT+ rights, having topped the list in 2012.Though given the Conservative Party’s history of dragging their heels on LGBT+ rights, as well as May’s personal history of voting against progressive legal reform, not everyone is convinced. The Labour Party responded by labelling the plan as “empty PR”.Paul Twocock, director of campaigns, policy and research at Stonewall UK, welcomes the Government’s intention to publish an LGBT+ action plan. Stonewall research reveals that 20 per cent of LGBT+ people have experienced a hate crime within the last 12 months. For trans people, this figure increases to a staggering 40 per cent. Paul believes that the action plan, combined with the government’s recently reaffirmed commitment to launching a consultation on reforming the 2004 Gender Recognition Act, will improve life for LGBT+ people in the UK.Both the action plan and reform of the Gender Recognition Act should allow us to make important steps forward towards building a society where LGBT+ people are truly accepted, everywhere and by everyone and it will mean this government can maintain the UK’s impressive record as a world leader on LGBT+ equality.Susie Green, CEO of trans and gender identity charity Mermaids, cites hate crime as a major concern of trans youth. Susie believes that May’s action plan must urgently address this hostility, which is fuelled by sensationalist media coverage.We need stronger controls around media coverage of transgender people, and particular attention needs to be given to the use of online media to perpetuate hate crime. Young people and trans women in particular are targeted on social media, with little done to protect them.Susie would like to see statutory training for all areas of service around transgender children and young people, including schools, social care, police and healthcare. Lesson plans in school covering transgender identities should be mandatory, and included from primary school age.Teachers need to be equipped to deal with conversations around transgender children and young people, which is clearly not the case at present.Concerns over outdated sex and relationships education are also expressed by Liam Beattie, relationships and sex education policy lead at Terrence Higgins Trust. While Wales announced a progressive overhaul of their SRE curriculum, England still lags behind in its approach towards gender and sexuality in the classroom.\u0026nbspBeattie explains that a lack of inclusive sex education at school made him feel “invisible”.LGBT+ sex and relationships must be included when relationships and sex education becomes compulsory in all English schools from next year. Looking back, I’m still angry that I left school completely oblivious to the realities of HIV or the fact that, as a bisexual man, I was at higher risk than my sisters or straight friends.My gaps in knowledge had to be filled through speaking to gay and bi friends or using dating apps. We can’t continue to let young people down like this. The feelings of isolation and shame that follow so many LGBT+ people from childhood to adulthood can have a corrosive impact on their mental health. As a result, LGBT+ people are twice as likely to have a mental health condition compared to heterosexual people. Upon the announcement of May’s action plan, Paul Martin OBE, chief executive at LGBT Foundation, said:LGBT+ people continue to face a significant number of inequalities from poorer physical and mental health, increased risk of hate crime and discrimination, to loneliness and isolation and negative experiences in employment and we hope that a commitment to tackling these key issues will be outlined in the upcoming action plan.To alleviate these inequalities, human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell believes that the LGBT+ action plan must urgently confront homophobia in schools. He says:Nearly half of all LGBT+ pupils have been bullied, often leading to anxiety, depression, truancy, academic under-performance and self-harm.To combat anti-LGBT+ bullying and other forms of hate crime such as racism, the Prime Minister should make equality and ersity lessons mandatory in every school, from the first year of primary education onwards. The health and welfare of pupils must take priority.There should be no opt outs for faith schools and no right of parents to withdraw their kids.\u0026nbspAs Home Secretary, May faced criticism for her handling of asylum claims relating to sexual orientation and gender identity. At present, LGBT+ asylum seekers are still detained indefinitely, despite never having committed a crime. Leila Zadeh, executive director of the UK Lesbian and Gay Immigration Group, told indy100:An action plan to improve the lives of LGBT+ people should include clear and tangible commitments to improving the wellbeing and safety of LGBT+ people who are seeking asylum.As long as LGBT+ asylum seekers can be detained or made to share accommodation, there will be risks to their personal safety. The government should also review the quality of its decisions on asylum applications by LGBT+ people, to ensure none are returned to persecutionNigerian LGBT+ rights activist Bisi Alimi would like to see a national monument commemorating the struggle for LGBT+ rights in the UK. He believes that this will help to imprint the memories of the LGBT+ movement in public consciousness.This monument should put into account the iniduals across race, gender, religion and age that have shaped Britain pre and post Section 28 and should form\u0026nbsppart of the school curriculumThough while there are many voices welcoming the plan, there are also sceptics. Editor-in-chief of Attitude Magazine Cliff Joannou believes that, because of the government’s failure to introduce statutory LGBT+ inclusive relationship and sex education in schools, the legacy of Section 28 looms over schools and local authorities. He tells indy100:For Theresa May to announce her \u0027LGBT Action Plan\u0027\u0026nbspin a gay magazine on the anniversary of Section 28 is both ironic and crass.The government has shied away from tackling LGBT+ discrimination in faith schools, where homophobia and transphobia is most prevalent. Shockingly, conversion therapy is still legal in the UK.While these issues continue to affect young LGBT+ people we will be far away from the equal society that the government likes to fantasise over.Actions speak louder than words, and successive governments have failed to take any action on the very real issues that the LGBT+ community continues to face.More:\u0026nbspWales \u0027leads the way\u0027 with new LGBT-friendly sex education curriculum for next articleWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

It is our duty as representatives of the people and our responsibility as legislators to bring about Brexit and not upset the process. “Her remarks follow that latest report from the committee that agreed that staying in the EU customs union into the next decade is likely to be the “only viable option”.“Currently, there are 21 members on the Brexit committee, only seven of which voted to leave the EU,” Ms Jenkyn’s added. “It is my opinion that reports produced by the committee have been unbalanced in favour of us either remaining in the EU, the customs union or delaying our departure.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesAlastair Cook batting against Pakistan during the first test match of the summer at Lord’s cricket ground, London.

The European Commission’s negotiators have already rejected the plan before its public announcement, as first revealed by The Independent earlier this week.“The regulatory alignment option is not available on the all-UK basis because it would amount to selective participation on the single market,” the senior EU official said, adding that the backstop “cannot be time limited”.It is incumbent on the UK to take the responsibility for its own decision“A backstop that would be strictly time limited would defeat the purpose of a backstop,” they said, before making clear that the Prime Minister’s plan for a UK-wide backstop would have to be withdrawn if progress is to be made at the June European summit.As well as the main issues of customs and the Irish border, side issues like the European arrest warrant and the Galileo satellite system have made little progress since March too. EU negotiators complain that the British side “do not understand” that Britain will not be able to use the European arrest warrant after Brexit, with Theresa May again having pledged to stay in the system just three months ago.“There are member states that simply cannot extradite their own nationals to a non-member of the EU. This is a constraint that unfortunately will apply once the UK is outside,” the senior official said.“The European arrest warrant is simply not available. I don’t think you can expect member states to change their constitutions in order to continue extraditing their nationals to the UK.“These are not bureaucratic issues. We are talking here about the lives and liberty of citizens. This is not something that can easily be done.”Brussels says the best the UK can hope for is to conclude a separate extradition treaty with the EU, as well as bilateral agreements on procedures like intelligence sharing.The row over Galileo has also been the subject of briefing and counter-briefing by the two sides. British sources briefed newspapers this week that they would demand the UK’s £1bn investment in the project back if British companies were locked out of the project. But EU sources disputed whether this stand had actually been made, describing the claim as “spin”.  The EU says British demands to retain the same access to Galileo as a member state are unreasonable. Though officials say Britain could potentially still use the system, they do not want to give British defence firms the right to build or run parts of it because they say that would effectively give the UK, a third country, the power to turn off the EU system for member states. Officials also pointed out that the UK itself had signed off the security rules restricting non-EU countries from running parts of system, as one of the 28 European Council members, before it knew it was going to leave.David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, who is travelling to Europe to drum up support for the UK to keep access to the satellite system, said: “Today we set out more detail on how we think the UK, as a third country, can continue to cooperate with the EU on security and keep our people safe and prosperous. As I travel around member states I hear how much our partners value the UK commitment to the EU’s security.“A relationship based solely on existing third country precedents, as some seem to be suggesting, would lead to a substantial and avoidable reduction in our shared security capability. Our citizens depend on this, let’s not let them down.”The senior EU official said they shared the UK’s concerns but that “this is a consequence on the UK position and it is incumbent on the UK to take the responsibility for its own decision”.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Officials say mutual recognition is not possible outside the single market, because it would amount to asking “the EU to trust the UK more, with less guarantees, than they trust each other”.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has said Theresa May’s red lines mean Britain can only get a free trade agreement similar to the ones the EU has with Canada and South Korea, but the UK said today that this “shallow level of cooperation” was “inconsistent with our ambition”, which would require “a more formal and deeper institutional structure”.A UK Government source said:  “This is their public negotiating position, nothing more, nothing less. We presented 7 papers this week, in the interests of resolving difficult issues in the interests of both sides, so the claim we aren’t providing enough detail is laughable. “The risk is that if they follow down this track, putting conditions on our unconditional offers and trying to insult us, the EU will end up with a relationship with its third biggest economy and largest security partner that lets down millions of citizens in the EU and UK.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Sir Ivan Rogers, the UK’s old ambassador to the EU, was criticised after he advised ministers in 2016 that leaving the EU would take around 10 years. He stepped down from his post shortly after.The EU says under the December agreement just Northern Ireland would stay in full alignment with the single market and customs union to prevent a hard border, while UK negotiators say they actually agreed that the whole UK would do so. The relevant text is somewhat ambiguous as to what was agreed.EU officials do not want the backstop to apply to the whole UK because it would give Britain access to the single market without having to uphold the so-called “four freedom” or submitting to the European Court of Justice. The UK says it cannot accept the backstop only applying to NI because that would create a potential customs border between Great Britain and NI  – which the DUP oppose. Theresa May has relied on the DUP for her majority in the House of Commons since she called an election and lost seats last year.The time-limiting element has now been introduced by the UK because Cabinet Brexiteers like Boris Johnson fear that an indefinite backstop could be a backdoor way of keeping the UK aligned with the EU in perpetuity. Ministers have publicly confirmed that a time-limited backstop is on the way.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesBrexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

They say commitments already made by British negotiators in December – that the backstop would apply “unless and until” another solution is found – rule out a time-limit.The UK’s transition is designed to give officials more time to come up with another solution to solve the border – but means there would be yet another cliff-edge.A Government spokesperson did not deny the reports of the plan, only telling The Independent: “We\u0027re not going to be drawn on speculation – the PM has said we will bring forward our plans on the backstop shortly.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The agency emailed a notice to all US citizens in China about the employee at the consulate in Guangzhou who said there were “subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure”. It advised Americans to contact medical professionals if they experience any “unusual auditory or sensory of phenomena accompanied by unusual sounds or piercing noises”. The incident harkens back to when nearly two dozen US employees working in Havana had sought medical treatment between December 2016 to May 2017 for headaches, ear pain, dizziness, and hearing issues. Symptoms, sounds and sensations reportedly varied dramatically from person to person. Some have permanent hearing loss or concussions, while others suffered nausea, headaches and ear-ringing. Some are struggling with concentration or common word recall, The Associated Press has reported.A subsequent FBI investigation did not reveal evidence of a “sonic attack”. However, the reports put the largest strain on US-Cuba relations since former president Barack Obama forged closer ties in 2014. Recording of \u0027sonic weapon attack\u0027 on US diplomats in Cuba releasedBetween September and October 2017, US President Donald Trump expelled 17 Cuban diplomats from the US, ordered US staff in Havana to come back, and issued a travel warning to the small, island nation - all implying the administration believed Cuba had some role in the mysterious illnesses of the diplomats. Cuba, for its part, denied any wrongdoing and attributed the illnesses to a possible psychological cause. The State Department said it is not aware of any similar situations in China and did not identify the person who reported the systems or when that information was relayed to the agency.

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nobody would believe that.Yet the happy couple set aside family rows, petty jealousies and drunken sabotage and basked in the warm embrace of an adoring public.Windsor’s Disney-style ceremony was watched in broad daylight north of the equator and the middle of the night Down Under by happy viewers of all races and creeds.There is a message here for us all.Harry and Meghan’s wedding did more than unite this nation in sympathy and affection for a popular prince and the love of his life. It showed this country is world class.The sub-plot, of course, was the emotional union between the damaged children of two broken families.Fans have long yearned for Prince Harry to find happiness after the roller-coaster life and shocking death of his fabled mother, Princess Diana.They have warmed to a young man who transformed himself from a mixed-up kid to a likeable soldier, helicopter pilot and champion of war-damaged Invictus casualties.As for his bride, Meghan Markle is the glamorous star of hit TV series Suits, who dreamed as a child of becoming a princess.Best of all in this age of right-on political correctness, she is the daughter of a charming African-American mother and an Emmy-winning Hollywood lighting specialist.The House of Windsor is now truly multicultural.It is also hip.Our amazing sovereign, at 92, and doughty Prince Philip, 96, both heading for their royal telegrams, are the Queen and King of Cool.Where else in the world would you see an Elton John double act with Windy City preacher Bishop Michael Curry?This was a truly uplifting occasion, worn lightly by a once-stuffy Royal Family.Nobody does it better when it comes to choreographing mounted cavalry, trumpets, banners and horse-drawn carriages with an electric-powered E-Type and a vintage Rolls-Royce.All underscored by a sense of humour, as Harry and his supportive brother William exchanged banter at the altar of Windsor’s historic St George’s Chapel.Even the weather turned out in tribute, bathing Windsor Great Park’s glorious greenery in spring sunshine.There may have been some muffled coughs over Markle family squabbles but they were nothing compared with the torrid dramas leading to the Queen’s own “annus horribilis”.The world has become used to British pageantry.But this Royal Wedding was a timely reminder that Britain is not just a small island with a fading history on the edge of Europe.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex ride in a carriage down The Long Walk back towards Windsor Castle after getting married in St Georges Chapel, WindsorThe 21st-century United Kingdom is an unrivalled brand on the global stage.The world was witnessing more than mere pomp and circumstance.This was UK plc on international parade, joining hands with the global community in a way no other nation can match — even the mighty USA.Had Meghan married into the family of a French or American president, a German Chancellor or a Kremlin tsar, would anyone have tuned in?Neither China nor Russia could captivate so many friendly eyeballs.The Olympics might do it.But London 2012 revealed Britain is best on these occasions, too.On Saturday, Britain proved it is capable of reaching out to a world beyond borders.Harry and Meghan’s marriage bonded the UK indelibly with the US.If the new Duke and Duchess have kids, they will be American citizens — as well as British due to Harry’s lineage — and will eventually be liable to American tax.Importantly, this wedding had special significance for the 2.5billion citizens of 52 Commonwealth countries, especially in Africa and the Caribbean, who swear allegiance to the Queen.My Australian in-laws were constantly on the phone from Sydney this weekend, all thoughts of becoming a republic abandoned, to discuss the finer points of royal protocol.But this event was watched from lands with no current ties to Britain — South America, the Far East and the Gulf States.It was a showcase of modern Britain forever adapting to change, the key to our success as an outward-looking nation.There was a clear hint of defiance, too. This steely couple were doing it their way.Our Brexit negotiators — on both sides of the argument — should take note.That big wide world, viewing us in high definition on Saturday, is where Britain’s future lies.These are our markets.The audience liked what they saw and they want some of what we’re having.In marketing terms alone, it was priceless.Too often we underestimate our strength and standing.We have developed an absurd inferiority complex.We’ve been led to believe we are too weak and puny to stand alone on the global stage.Yet we are among the world’s greatest economies, second only to Germany in the EU.We are a nuclear power with a real professional army which has helped keep the peace in Europe, and have an envied place on the UN Security Council.Republican lefties despise all this stuff.They smear Britain’s record as a brutal colonial power while ignoring our global lead in abolishing slavery.Disturbingly, some Conservatives seem to agree the UK is washed up and past its prime.Since we cannot run our own economy, they say, we should hand the job to unelected bureaucrats in Brussels.These, remember, would be the same Brussels flunkies who created the euro, wrecked the economies of member states and put millions of unemployed young people on the scrap heap.Most of those workless youngsters gratefully upped sticks and moved here.I wonder why?Saturday’s Royal Wedding showed we are in the Premier League.Now the world is watching, perhaps with slightly less enthusiasm, as another British saga lurches towards its climax — another broken family consumed with jealousy and bent on revenge.The cast is familiar — the statutory drunk, a bully who prefers to talk with a gun in his hand, some characters who would prefer a car crash to a happy ending.Can we stop the bickering and reach a good Brexit deal?Why can’t the Leavers and Remainers put the country first, join hands, bury their differences and take a vow to work together to serve the national interest?Inspired by the Royal Wedding, by the poem Invictus, we can rise above petty differences.“We are the masters of our fate: We are the captains of our soul.”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Later, I went back with him after he had built a night school for the boys, and asked over a cup of tea: “Why are you doing this, Harry?”He replied: “This is the most important thing I do.”It tells you everything about who his mother was.Inside the Chapel, the hymn was Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, which was played at Princess Diana’s funeral and one of her favourites.Di’s sister Lady Jane Fellowes delivered the only reading. Listening to it was Sarah, the Duchess of York, who had not been invited to other recent royal weddings.Inviting Fergie was a brilliant thing to do. During Diana’s troubled times every Sunday she would drive down to Berkshire to have lunch with Fergie, spending the afternoon talking about their divorces.Outside in the Chapel courtyard were 2,000 people from Harry and Meghan’s charities, including servicemen who have lost limbs.Harry is following Diana’s hugely successful campaign to stop landmines by working with those who have been wounded by IEDs.When Harry was flying back from one of his tours of Afghanistan he shared the plane with three soldiers who were in a coma.He realised these soldiers, if they recovered, would have limbs missing and facing a life of misery — which is why he inspired them with his support for the Invictus Games.And Harry and Meghan asked guests to make donations to the Children’s HIV Association.Harry has clearly never forgotten how his mother took the stigma out of Aids by embracing sufferers, including babies in Brazil.And then there was the ring. On Saturday night Meghan was wearing the emerald-cut aquamarine ring Diana first wore in 1996.Harry once told ITV’s Tom Bradby: “I wanted to do something that would make my mother proud.” He succeeded on Saturday.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So is Her Majesty the Queen. They haven’t felt the need to label themselves as such we know from their actions.As the basic scriptwriting rule dictates, show don’t tell.To her credit, Meghan Markle championed many charitable causes that advocate female empowerment before she met Prince Harry, and no one is suggesting she shouldn’t continue with this work.But what grates about the above statement is the unsaid inference that here is a feisty, independent woman who, unshackled by pomp, ceremony and dutiful political impartiality, is going to drag the stuffy, deluded old monarchy kicking and screaming into the 21st century.That this go-get-’em gal from the US of A is going to shake things up with a few bumper-sticker sentiments and teach those Brits a thing or two about how the world works.Or perhaps we should leave it to Patrick Jephson, former private secretary to Princess Diana, a man very much in the know on the inner workings of the House of Windsor.In his book, The Meghan Factor, he says: “The one key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising force. It’s a useful guideline when weighing the pros and cons of any intended course of action, from saving a local playgroup, to saving an endangered species, to saving the planet. What always comes first is saving the monarchy.”Quite. In other words, don’t get up the collective nose of the British public or they might just, ahem, pick it and flick you off into oblivion.As we saw on Saturday, as Bishop Michael Curry’s address entered what felt like its third decade, The Queen’s resolutely impassive expression suggests she’d make a fine poker player.We have no idea what she thought of it, nor Donald Trump, Brexit or the highly political Me Too campaign. She has opinions, of course. But what she doesn’t do is wear them like a badge.Just like her great-great-grandmother Victoria, who advocated “never complain, never explain”, The Queen knows the future of the monarchy lies in being a non-political figurehead who promotes national unity.Jephson adds: “If you acquire a profile, a purpose and a passionate public devotion independent of the royal mainstream, then you risk being perceived and presented as a threat to the Crown itself.”We already know what Meghan thinks about an awful lot of things, because her life so far can’t be edited.We also know that her soapbox has just got bigger thanks to her new status which, to those unused to it, could foster the corrosive misconception that everyone is hanging off your every word.Read my pursed lips: They’re not. They’re just being polite.So Meghan must learn fast that she’s a very minor cog in an ancient royal machine that has survived so long by saying nothing and doing its duty to its loyal subjects.Frustrating that may be for a “feminist” (or, indeed a manist), but that’s the trade-off for the largely taxpayer-funded life of luxury that is granted, not self-generated.As a celebrity, you can say what you like and we can choose to listen or not. But opinions divide people and, as a royal, you are supposed to represent everyone.Meghan needs to understand, and implement, that distinction sooner rather than later.HUMAN rights lawyer Amal Clooney was officially crowned “best-dressed guest” by fashionistas observing the Royal Wedding.According to one, she was “a sublime vision in marigold”, though personally speaking, Colman’s Mustard yellow might be more accurate.Either way, Ms Clooney once again proved adept at pulling focus from the other mere mortals floundering in her ever-stylish slipstream.By contrast, the Duchess of Cambridge’s understated, Alexander McQueen frock coat got a sniffier reception from certain fashion quarters, not least because she’s worn it three times before.They’re missing the point.A wedding is about the bride, not the guests.And Kate understood that perfectly by wearing something that wouldn’t propel her into the limelight on Meghan’s big day.Now that’s style.THOSE attending Chelsea Flower Show (no, me neither) have declared that “she-sheds” are the latest must-have – kitted out with radiators, chandeliers and squishy sofas.Alternatively, we could have all that inside the house and just send the other half out into the garden.AN Islamic school in Birmingham has warned female pupils against using tampons.The guidance, adopted as school policy, states: “Among the types of pads, tampons may not be appropriate due to insertion.”But the head of the school insists it has “no connection to faith”.Hmmmm. Meanwhile, it has emerged that women are having “virginity restoring” operations on the NHS at a cost of £1,000 a time.The 30-minute procedure involves the hymen – which can break after using tampons, doing sport or having sex for the first time – being stitched or reconstructed.One relationship counsellor suggested that one of the reasons was that some religious women were “over- whelmed” by feelings of sexual guilt and wanted to be “as pure as possible again” for their husband.Want to? Or are forced to by religiously driven, moral expectations not placed on the man they’re marrying?Either way, is this really something the NHS should be funding when money for other, more vital, operations is so scarce?MEMO to Sir Anthony Hopkins: Yes, families do fall out and just because you’re related doesn’t mean you have to like each other.But saying you “don’t care one way or the other” whether your 48-year-old daughter Abigail has children or not seems overly cold and perhaps partly explains your 20-year estrangement.In future, a simple, “We don’t speak and I’d rather not go in to it”, might be wiser.HOW come, in this age of state-of-the-art camera phones, when anyone spots the Loch Ness monster, beast of Bodmin Moor or any of the other fearsome creatures supposedly roaming our shores, the evidential photo is always out of focus?Exhibit A: The “lion” spotted in Oldbury in the West Midlands this week.Yep.

If Theresa May formed a position fully honouring the result, and told the EU to like it or lump it, the unease would end overnight.Our economy would take off like a rocket.IT is disgraceful that Google is revealing rape victims’ names via the “autocomplete” function on its searches. The tech giant must be held accountable.But its software only produces those identities because troublemakers or morons have posted them illegally on Facebook, Twitter or other forums.They must be traced and fined heavily. So must those social media firms. They provide the platforms — and are negligent about policing them.Treat them as publishers and make them responsible for content they host.They’ll soon clean up their act.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government must think again so that people don’t fall into debt or are left at risk of losing their home.”Lib Dem MP Stephen Lloyd added: “These lamentable figures show that thousands of people have still not responded to the significant changes on mortgage interest loans being pushed by the DWP.This is yet another cack-handed benefit change by the Tories which is wholly unnecessary, and is already causing anxiety amongst some of our most disadvantaged, marginalised citizens.The DWP said that any SMI claimants who havent got a phone call about the change will still get the benefit for at least six more weeks.Those affected are urged to contact the official hotline on 0800 731 0459 for pensioners or 0800 169 0310 for anyone of working age.A spokesman said: Over time, someone’s house is likely to increase in value, so it’s reasonable that anyone who has received financial help towards their mortgage should be asked to pay that back.“Everyone who signs up to the loan will continue to get help with their mortgage interest, and it’s only repayable if there is available equity when the property is sold.“If people decide to decline the loan now but change their mind in future the loan can be backdated so in effect there would be no break in payments.“We have already contacted everyone currently in receipt of SMI to explain the change but we are making sure people have time to review the documents, obtain advice and consider their options."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000283428196.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"burn wood they said itll be green they said how the eco freaks got us all wheezing","story":"Pollution in our cities is worse than it’s been for many years. The way things are going you could give your kids 20 Rothmans a day and they wouldn’t be much worse off than they already are.And the reason for this is a genuine scandal. A real eye-opener. It shows what happens when people in authority take notice of the people who know absolutely nothing. The Green lobby. The eco-freaks. The obsessive loons. The climate change fanatics.If you’re middle class, you’ve probably got one. They’ve become incredibly popular in the last decade.Trouble is they spew out enormous amounts of something called PM2.5 particles. That’s soot to you and me.They’re the major cause of soot in our cities and the main reason everyone you know is gasping for breath.We’re about to be sued by the European Union because pollution from these stoves is way above acceptable limits.But why do we have them?Because at the behest of the green movement, the government encouraged us all to have them. Burning wood is much better, they said, than gas or coal or oil. Renewable! Doesn’t churn out as much CO2!No, it just churns out lethal amounts of soot. Billions of pounds were spent by our government on a scheme to convert us to renewable heating systems.The brainchild of the disgraced Lib Dem halfwit Chris Huhne. Millions more was spent converting one of our biggest power stations to woodchip. The wood is shipped over 3,500 miles from the US (there’s eco-friendly for you). And it’s all made everything a lot, lot, worse as a consequence.Then there are diesel cars. You may have one. The government is getting tough on those, too.It’s now been discovered that they are much more polluting than petrol cars. It’s another major cause of pollution in our towns and cities.So why do we have them? Because the idiotic Greens told us to. Back in 2001 the Labour government offered tax breaks on diesel cars. Everyone rushed to buy one.A member of that Labour government has now ’fessed up and said it was the wrong decision, no question.But they wanted their Green credentials.And just look what trouble it has caused — 37,800 more deaths every year in this country simply as a consequence of those wood burning stoves. It is close to unbelievable.I wonder what the Greens will come up with next as an idea to save the planet.Maybe we should burn magpies, or sour cream and chive Pringles, or our own trousers.The truth is they haven’t got the remotest idea. They urge these measures upon us without the slightest notion of what might happen as a consequence.And the problem is that important people take them seriously. Governments, for example.And we end up paying through the nose for their idiocies — and then, a little later, gasping for breath.The wood burning stove business should convince all members of Parliament. Never listen to a green.No matter how nice he or she might seem. Just ignore them. They’re bad for your health.WHAT a shame – Roman Abramovich can’t get back into the country because we haven’t cleared his visa. So he’s sitting on his yacht somewhere, getting snippy. I’m not sure why we let Roman in in the first place.You don’t get his kind of money by being lovely to everybody, do you?First we helped wreck the Russian economy in the early 1990s by plundering its state run industries. Then we opened the doors to a whole bunch of Russkie gangsters – sorry, oligarchs – with boats the size of Poland. Anyway, I’ll probably end up glowing like a Belisha beacon just for writing this.BROADCASTER Dan Snow has admitted he lies to his daughters.He’s told them that during the war there were loads of female Spitfire pilots. Zooming around, shooting down krauts. He says he doesn’t want them to feel limited by their gender. He should have gone further. Told them that back then Britain was led by a nice lady called Winnie.And that the first person up Everest was a little girl called Hillary. And as for that Ada Hitler . . .THE Iraqis are executing the IS jihadi brides. Loads of them.Some of them are whining that they had no idea their husbands were evil Islamists. One of them said she thought she was marrying a rapper.Yeah, right love. We’ve got a few here, mind.Women who went out to join IS and then thought better of it. They’re lucky we won’t extradite them to Iraq.HEY – got your Royal Wedding gift bag yet? Guests to the wedding are flogging them on eBay for as little as £20,000. Hell of a bargain. I’ve got a bid in on one right now. It says it contains:I’VE got a bit of a soft spot for Victoria Beckham. She’s been criticised for not smiling at the wedding of Harry and Meghan.Some people have suggested Posh Spice was looking a bit grim because David had been out on the pull again. Nah. She wasn’t smiling because, basically, she’s a miserable cow.And I like that. Why should she have to wander around grinning like a village idiot?Keep the sulk and the pout, Vikki, love. Plus I liked what she was wearing at the bash. She was dressed as if for the funeral of someone she didn’t know very well. She looked great.SO, all four of the great American authors are dead. Both Tom Wolfe and Philip Roth died this week.Saul Bellow and the finest of them all, John Updike are already dead.These gentlemen were my heroes when I was growing up. But how long will they be remembered?Updike is already unfashionable on account of his alleged sexism. Wolfe and Bellow were quite right-wing, so the literary critics will quickly consign their books to the “dead white male” rubbish bin of history. And as a consequence, we will have lost an awful lot.Keep their work alive, whatever the critics tell you.

We are Europe’s main security power. They have much to lose.Theresa May is demanding back the £1billion we put into this system.But that is chicken feed next to our £39billion divorce bill.

I have my ears pierced, I cry at the end of The Greatest Showman and I enjoy shopping for clothes.Everyone has the right to say how they want the world to see them. Everyone has the right to be happy with themselves.Goodness knows there’s enough things to be unhappy about. You shouldn’t be one of them.But the Labour Party has now decided that anyone who says they are a woman is eligible for political roles that are for women only. They do not ask for any more proof than that.As a Labour member and a woman on Wednesdays, that means I am eligible to stand for one of those roles.So, when the position of Women’s Officer came up for election, I decided to apply. The post involves encouraging women to join the party and speak for women and their experiences - and can only be held by women.Standing for the position was a chance for me to talk about self-identification with my local Party and bring my concerns to their attention.Of course, I was not expecting to win, but I was ready to do the job if I did.I was happy to let people make a democratic, informed choice.Women are worried that letting men say they are women without any checks is dangerous.There is a fear that some men will identify as women just so they can go into changing rooms or loos and spy on or attack women.Women also say that it will affect women’s rights to dignity and privacy, for example on women-only hospital wards or in shelters.Those are also real concerns, but a small minority of people don’t want them to be talked about.They call feminists like Germaine Greer - who has said transgender women are not women - out-of-touch or get angry when people yell out body parts or facts on TV.Those people are stopping a very important debate. I don’t feel that’s right.And self-identification is not just Labour’s position.Nearly every political party in the UK says that the Gender Recognition Act should be changed so that anyone can legally change their sex just by saying they are a man or a woman.The Labour Party made their decision so they could be ahead of the change to the law.Some trans people say that the current requirements set out by the GRA are humiliating and difficult to cope with on top of living their lives. That is a real concern and one that has to be listened to.However, I don’t agree with the idea that you should be able to legally change your sex just by saying you want to.It ignores the very real struggles that trans people face every day.It says that I have had the same life experience as people such as the L’Oreal and Playboy model Munroe Bergdorf, journalist and TV presenter Paris Lees and Lily Madigan - a transgender schoolgirl who was sent home from school for wearing a girls uniform.It says that their life-long fight to feel right in their bodies is the same as me identifying as a woman once a week.I can’t begin to imagine what their journeys have been like, but I know those journeys need to be recognised by more than just words.Following a recent meeting of Woman’s Place UK in Basingstoke, I talked with a reporter about my nomination for the Womens Officer role. The article that he wrote led to the Labour Party suspending me yesterday, with immediate effect.I am not allowed to attend meetings or stand for election and there will be an investigation.They seem to think that I am not enough of a woman.Some people online think the same. I have to ask the question, how much more of a woman would I need to be?I hope that what I did shows we need the debate on gender identity.We need to find the common ground so that trans people can live as they want to, while allowing women the dignity, privacy and safety that they deserve.We are all here thanks to women, so let’s talk to them.Really? I mean, really? I first came across David Lewis smug grinning face in a magazine earlier this week. Announcing he was a woman from morn to midnight on Wednesdays and boasting that he is changing nothing. Not his clothes. Not his routine. Not his womanly beard.Why? Because 15 minutes of fame. Because trans rights has gone too far. Because proposed law changes.He is not trans: has no idea what it is to be trans.The situation he is describing does not happen and has not happened anywhere, except when anti-trans campaigners break the law to make a point.Being trans is not fashion, trend or choice. Mocking transness in this dishonest way hurts people.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She was later arrested and thrown in the back of a police car.Describing his photograph of Kate in 2007, Max told The Sun Online: “Kate had been in Mahiki for a few hours and jumped into a taxi at around 2 or 3am.“I think she was telling the taxi driver where to go when I took the photograph and Prince Harry and Prince William got in their royal transport shortly after.He also said that Posh and Becks would get “mobbed” wherever they went and the photograph of actor Rhys Ifans putting his fingers up was “typical behaviour” because he “didn’t like having his picture taken”."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408607579.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mystery sea creature crocodile whale rhossili beach swansea","story":"The five-foot long carcass found on Rhossili Beach, Swansea has a long head, giant jawline and slender tail.Beth Jannetta, 41, who discovered the monster while walking her dogs, sent a photo of the creature to experts, hoping they would identify it.But boffins are not sure if it is a type of whale, dolphin or porpoise.Beth said: It looked like a well rotted cetacean to me. Other people think it is something different, like a crocodile.It would be very interesting to find out what species it is.”Bioscience expert Dr Dan Forman, from Swansea University, said: When you look at it the first time you may think it is a crocodile, but it is certainly not.There is a big bulge on the base of the skull which is characteristic of a cetacean.”He added: We get a reasonable amount of whales and dolphins, a lot which are dead and decomposed in places like Pendine and Rhossili.“From the data around carcasses washed up, there seems to be a cluster this time of year around June and July.Mark Hipkin, National Trust area ranger, who was called to collect the body, said he thought it was a porpoise.He said: We have porpoises washing up quite regularly, as well as dolphins and seals and sometimes sheep."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408650365.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"apply here for our first summer internship scheme to work for the the number one paper","story":"The internships, for 18 to 25-year-olds, are available in roles including reporting, news-gathering, design and production, across print and online.Placements will last up to 12 weeks and be based mainly in London.

An 83,000 increase in the year was enough to see Romania leapfrog Ireland into second place.Polish remains the most common non-British nationality – with an estimated one million.There are more Poles than any other nationality in every single region of the UK – from 108,000 in the east Midlands to 63,000 in the south West.Alp Mehmet, vice chair of Migration Watch, said: “There is still no sign of a net outflow of EU-born people as a result of Brexit.“Indeed they are still coming in significant numbers and contributing to a population increase which is simply unsustainable.”The ONS showed how immigration has transformed towns across the UK with migrants now accounting for 29 per cent of the population in Boston, Lincs – up from just 3 per cent in 2007.East Staffordshire’s migration population has soared from 3 per cent to 17 per cent.Nearly six out of every 10 people living in Newham, East London – 57 per cent – were born outside the UK.The ONS pointed out there are more Indians and Pakistanis than Romanians by country of birth – but many have since taken up British citizenship.THE Brexit vote appears to have triggered a huge spike in EU nationals seeking a British passport.Some 40,014 applied in the year to the end of March, nearly double the previous year, official figures reveal.A total of 14,137 were from the EU8 bloc, including Poland and Hungary.Ex-PM David Cameron lifted immigration controls on Romania and Bulgaria in 2014 and numbers have soared ever since.Experts claim many Romanians and Bulgarians have come to the UK to fill the gaps left by Poles beginning to return home. There were just 78,000 Romanians living in the UK in 2010, putting it 15th below Bangladesh.Separate Home Office figures today revealed 148,000 National Insurance registrations were given out to Romanians in the year to March - a third of all those handed out to EU nationals.The Home Office said the number of foreign national offenders removed in the 12 months to March fell 11 per cent to 5,630.Last year, Romania threatened to block Brexit altogether unless Theresa May gave its country’s residents a guarantee of UK citizenship.The first Romanian to arrive in the UK to work after Mr Cameron relaxed controls – Victor Spirescu – died in a car crash this January.The man – dubbed the “poster boy” for Romanian immigration – was found to have taken cocaine when he lost control of a car near Newport Pagnell.Or is the reality different?Yes, Britain voted to control its borders, like any nation beyond the EU.But we are still the most welcoming country on Earth. "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408674216.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"britains best pubs revealed","story":"National Pub \u0026amp Bar Awards 2018 judges sifted through 94 boozers before crowning The White Horse, West Sussex as the overall winner on Wednesday night .BBCs Nigel Barden and Tristan OHana hosted the prestigious ceremony at BAFTA 195 Piccadilly.In order to celebrate boozers which are huge assets to local communities, judges also found winners for each region across the UK.Mr OHana, editor of Pub \u0026amp Bar magazine said: The occasion is an opportunity for the whole of the UK to acknowledge the incredible work that these businesses do for us all – our pubs and bars are a huge asset to local communities, as well as the whole of the country.Judges found it difficult to rank each boozers aesthetics, menu and cleanliness. Heres what they said.This boozer found in Chilgrove, West Sussex was described as a quintessential English shooting lodge.Offering £225 shooting party packages and a seasonal field-to-fork seasonal menu, it is situated to Goodwood Estate.The dog-friendly pub boasts country pub style rooms, two of which have private hot tubs.Landlord Richard Miller said: We drive the team really hard and we demand a lot from them, so to be recognised because of them is brilliant.This award is for the team and all their hard work. Im really proud. This award will be fantastic for business.Judges said: This business doesn’t rely on its attractive location to impress visitors.Judges were impressed with The Railways drinks range and immaculate front of house.Located in Lowdham village, near Nottingham, the boozer has offered drinks since 1876.Awarding the pub, judges said: While its drinks range is impressive and beers kept immaculately, it’s the food coming out of the kitchen that truly wows customers.Not to be confused with the overall winner, this White Horse is located in Brancaster.Situated in leafy Herne Hill, the Half Moon boasts a wealth of musical heritage, hosting gigs from the likes of Frank Sinatra, The Police, Van Morrison and U2.The name of the boozer was said to be inspired by Dylan Thomas radio play, Under Milk Wood. Thomas visited the pub when he stayed at a property in Milkwood Road, Herne Hill - a few minutes away from the pub.The Grade II listed building which was closed for four years in 2013, has been restored and now boasts a 12 spacious bedrooms and a gastropub menu.The South Causey in Durham boasts 100 acres of land.The pub said to be eccentrically decorated also offers hot tubs within its bed and breakfast rooms.This brewery in Londonderry is also a pub and a restaurant.Landlords offer two menus, one has £3 snacks including smoked baby back ribs and the other is filled with pub classics.The Pearson family have owned Plockton Hotel for the last 20 years.Customers have access to boats and the finest seafood in the country.This former mill in Pitlochry, is a luxury pub, with a lavish food and drinks menu to match.It boasts a four-star B\u0026ampB with a fine dining room available to all.Judges loved this pubs range of traditional beers from around the world.They said: The effort that has been put into extending that part of this operation is mightily impressive.In January, nominations were taken for the best pubs and bars in each of the UKs 94 counties.The winners within each county were then entererd to become the best boozer in their region, in hope of winning the overall category.To crown find the overall winner, judges used the following criteria to assess each boozer:WEST on the Green is a beerhall-style bar located in the iconic Templeton Building.Now in its 11th year, the bar offers an award-winning German-inspired menu.This is a five-star restaurant and hotel located in a secluded cove near Port Isaac.Located in Anglesey, an Area of Outstanding Natural beauty, The Bull offers its customers a fine dining experience.Judges said: There are two venues to visit when it comes to choosing a bite to eat, each with their own character and menu style.Awarding this Staffordshire boozer, judges said: While its location allows for travelling visitors to escape and unwind, it has also built up a truly loyal following from those who live close by.Judges were wowed by this Sheffield boozers stunning venue design."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nip000407435715.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"prince philip cracked rib harry meghan wedding","story":"The Duke of Edinburgh - who was photographed with what looked like black eyes last Saturday - slipped while washing.The accident happened only days after he had thrown his crutches away following a hip op.The 96-year-old had been hailed a hero for making it to the Royal Wedding without crutches just six weeks after surgery.But a Royal insider said despite sustaining the painful rib injury he refused even the aid of a stick on Meghan and Harry’s big day.They told The Sun: “The Duke is not a fan of showering and prefers to bathe. But he’s a determined man and nothing was going to stop him attending nor would he take any kind of walking aid.”The Duke was praised for his no nonsense attitude as he smiled throughout last Saturday’s celebrations.Last night Sun doctor Carol Cooper branded him the “Iron Duke” saying he took the British stiff upper lip to a “new level”.She said: “I take my hat off to him. He is clearly a very resolute gentleman who will not stop doing what he needs to do.“Fractured ribs tend to be quite painful. It’s very rare for a fractured rib not to cause pain - even a tiny fracture.“Because your ribs move when you breathe, every breath you take can be painful.“Painkillers are often not very effective but it is possible to get a local anaesthetic injected into the area to deaden the pain temporarily.”Prince Philip had spent days walking up and down stairs to get himself fit for the wedding after his hip replacement.Such was the speed of his recovery he was even warned to slow it down.Family biographer Penny Junor described his walk into the chapel - not even with a limp as “completely heroic”.She said: “Given that he is 96 years old and the operation was just six weeks ago, I think that shows what an extraordinary man he is.“That will have meant a huge amount to Prince Harry.

advertisers and countless ­others desperately want ­people to “review our privacy policy” and “accept new terms and conditions.”You might assume this has something to do with the recent Facebook scandal, where founder Mark Zuckerberg had to apologise for allowing users’ data to end up in the hands of political forces.But the real reason is a major shake-up of EU laws governing the information kept about you online.The less-than-snappily-titled General Data Protection ­Regulations (EU) 2016/679 comes into force tomorrow.The beefed-up “GDPR” rules mean everyone from hi-tech firms to public bodies need to change their ways.This should be good news if you are ­deluged by spam or ­embarrassed by party ­pictures on social media.Here, GRANT ROLLINGS answers some common ­questions about the changes.If that message came from a ­provider you actually like, such as a charity or your favourite football team, not responding will limit their future interactions with you.Under the new data laws you need to give clear consent to online tracking or being sent unexpected messages.And if you haven’t done so by today, that charity or football team might have to stop ­letting you know about new offers and deals.Don’t worry, though – if you miss today’s deadline it shouldn’t mean you are suddenly blocked by all the sites or services you have been ­subscribed to.Everything in the new digital age is snappy and easy to digest – apart from the long and baffling terms and conditions.That all changes from today.Under the new law, companies cannot use mind-numbing T\u0026ampCs full of impenetrable legal jargon to make you aware of the changes.The request for consent must be given in an intelligible, separate and easily ­accessible form.And if they are handing over your data to someone else, they have to spell it out in plain English.If you are suffering from unticking fatigue, help is on its way.Currently consumers face the annoying task of having to untick several boxes that ask them whether they are happy to receive “selected marketing” communications.After today, you will only receive ads from “marketing ­partners” if you are told their name and you actively tick or click on a box to say you want them.While the cascade will be greatly reduced, it won’t cease altogether.Legitimate companies should abide by the new rules but there is little to stop conmen sending emails offering to enlarge your ­manhood or informing you about a financial windfall waiting in Nigeria.If you lost out on a loan, a pay rise or a job because a computer has said “no”, you can now ask for a good old-fashioned human being to be involved in the decision- making process.The problem until now has been that computers have based their decisions on the information they are given.If the data held about you was incorrect or incomplete, you may have been treated unfairly.Adam French, a consumer rights expert from Which?, said: “For some workers an ­algorithm is used to judge whether they are completing their tasks quickly enough to be paid a certain rate.“With the new law, you’ll be able to get a human involved, because maybe you are being slowed down by faulty machinery and the ­computer doesn’t know that.”If there is a particularly sensitive image or over-opinionated late-night social media post that you don’t want anyone to see any more, help could be on the way.Under the new law you will be able to ask for so-called “Data ­Erasure”, so those words and images are removed from sight forever.But this “right to be forgotten” is not ­guaranteed and can be challenged by the firm holding the data.What caused the most outrage in the recent scandal involving Facebook was that British marketing firm Cambridge Analytica used data such as post “likes” to create a ­profile of millions of voters.But profiling is also used by firms to target adverts at consumers.And many companies, such as Facebook, have made a fortune by harvesting that data for advertisers.From now on firms will have to make it clearer that they do this, and consumers will be able to opt out of profiling for targeted ads.Ailidh Callander, a lawyer for ­Privacy International, which has campaigned for tougher data laws, said: “Companies are exploiting our data in ways we do not understand, making it their business to learn about your habits, sex interests, political beliefs and more.Companies must protect our data and the new privacy law pushes companies do this.”The new rules say that younger children cannot ­consent to online services without a parent’s agreement.But there is little to stop your kids from pretending they are an adult.There was outrage last November when taxi app Uber admitted it had kept secret a data breach that affected 57million of its customers and drivers.From today, firms will need to report any breach within 72 hours of first becoming aware of it.Failure to comply could result in a fine which is equal to two per cent of the firm’s annual global ­turnover.Every business, no matter how big or small, has to abide by the new data protection laws – from media giants to landlords with just one buy-to-let property.Public services also need to implement it, as do firms operating from outside of the EU if they want to do business within it.At the moment the Government intends to keep the new EU data laws after Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming, that was cracked following a slip-up on social media.Authorities launched an investigation after an airman posted a Snapchat video of himself smoking marijuana, despite strict rules from Airman 1st Class Nickolos Harris, the ringleader.Fourteen airmen were disciplined. Six of them were convicted in courts-martial of LSD use or distribution or both.“Although this sounds like something from a movie, it isn’t,” said Capt.

Everybody’s happy right now. Let’s keep it that way,” he told airmen in a video recorded at a Cheyenne apartment in 2015.The disgraced airman was sentenced to 12 months in jail and other penalties — but avoided a punitive discharge as part of an agreement with prosecutors.The AP’s report is the result of documents obtained over the past two years through the Freedom of Information Act.Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Uriah L.

The biometrics strategy is now technically five years overdue as it was originally to be published as a joint biometrics and forensics strategy in 2013.Although the government said it would be publishing separate strategies in 2014, the publication date for the biometrics strategy has still not been confirmed.MPs have demanded that it must be published by June of this year.A Home Office spokesperson said: \"Analysis of images plays a critical role in helping the police to protect the public.

The scathing attack emerged last night from Brussels after the UK government warned it would want cash back from a space programme.  Mrs May\u0027s government made the threat in an ongoing row over the Galileo satellite system, which will soon be an EU rival to US-based GPS. EU officials are trying to block Britain from the programme after Brexit on security grounds, even though the UK has been a major contributor. This has enraged Tory ministers, who yesterday published demands for a \u0026pound1billion refund if they are excluded. Last night an EU official accused Britain of chasing a fantasy and said: The EU doesn’t negotiate under threat.  Such a request for reimbursement would be backsliding and unacceptable.” The row is so deep it has prompted a rare backlash from the UK\u0027s leading Brexit negotiator. Civil servant Olly Robbins, who reports directly to Theresa May, took to Twitter for the first time in nearly two years to praise Britain\u0027s calm approach - a thinly-veiled dig at the EU. He tweeted: Very proud of the x-Government team that worked so hard to support technical talks in Brussels this week. UK proposals for a deep relationship, calmly and professionally presented.   The EU official spoke to Brussels-based British journalists last night. They said: I have the impression that the UK thinks everything has to change on the EU side so everything can stay the same for the UK. The pre-condition for fruitful discussions is that the UK accepts the consequences of its own decision... rather than chasing the fantasy of denying the consequences of Brexit. The sooner we get away from this fantasy, the sooner we can talk about the future relationship. UK government sources hit back swiftly with one telling the : We\u0027ve heard it all before. Another told Politico: We are dealing with 10,000 German lawyers, what do you expect? They have got to wise up. This cannot be about punishment any more, it has to be about mutual benefit.

It follows a string of delays and spiralling costs in the project to modernise the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS), the agency which allows employers to check if job candidates are suitable to work with children and vulnerable people. The modernisation programme is over four years late, and expected to come in some \u0026pound229 million over budget. At the same time, the cost of performing DBS checks has increased. Customers are charged \u0026pound13 a year for the ‘update service’, which was intended to make it easier and faster to check whether there are any changes to safeguarding information, instead of the \u0026pound10 expected when the Home Office launched the service in 2012. The service was launched without a pilot or properly engaging with schools or other users.  The Home Office’s original plan for the upgrade was to create a fully digital service that would be cheaper for both government and users. But the report found none of this has been achieved. The committee’s brutal assessment of the programme found much of the service is still paper based and the promised safeguarding benefits are being forgotten as they are not being tracked. At the same time, and despite the new ‘update service’ running at a \u0026pound9 loss for every application, DBS is running a huge surplus from profits made from issuing standard paper certificates. Meg Hillier, chair of the Commons Public Accounts Committee said:“Government has a crucial role to play in safeguarding children and vulnerable adults but the handling of this project has been a masterclass in incompetence.

The Prime Minister blasted Russia\u0027s well-established pattern of aggression while discussing the crash in a phone call with the President of Ukraine. MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine on July 17 2014 with all 298 people on board, 283 passengers and 15 crew, killed.  Investigators said yesterday the missile launcher that shot down the packed Malaysia Airlines jet was part of the Russian armed forces.  Today the Netherlands said it and Australia hold the Russian state responsible and a possible next step would be presenting the case to an international court. We call on Russia to accept its responsibility and cooperate fully with the process to establish the truth and achieve justice for the victims of flight MH17, Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok said. The Netherlands and Australia have asked Russia today to enter a dialogue in order to come to a solution that does justice to the enormous suffering and damage caused by the downing of flight MH17.  UK Prime Minister May phoned Ukraine\u0027s leader Petro Poroshenko last night following the expert findings. A Downing Street spokeswoman said: They discussed the announcement by the Joint Investigation Team that the missile which brought down flight MH17 belonged to the Russian army – pointing out that such actions fit into a well-established pattern of Russian aggression.  The Prime Minister offered the UK’s full support to the investigation team which is looking into the incident, which saw 10 UK citizens lose their lives. A huge investigation was launched after the passenger plane came down with Russia blaming Ukraine for the tragedy. The plane was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was shot down. All the crew were Malaysian and more than two thirds of the passengers were Dutch. Wilbert Paulissen, head of the crime squad of the Netherlands\u0027 national police, said the missile was fired from Russia\u0027s 53rd Anti-Aircraft Brigade.

The number of Romanian nationals living in the UK in 2017 was estimated to be 411,000 - a jump of 25% on the previous year, and the largest increase for any country. Polish remains the most common non-British nationality, with an estimated one million in the UK. Romania has overtaken the Republic of Ireland and India to move from fourth to second place in the list. Some 350,000 Irish nationals lived in the UK in 2017, while there were 346,000 Indians.  The figures, from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), show the total number of non-British nationals living in the UK in 2017 was 6.2 million, up 4% on 2016\u0027s total of six million.  This is a smaller rise than that recorded between 2015 and 2016, when the number rose by 8%. Nicola White of the ONS migration statistics division said: Non-UK born and non-British populations continued to increase in 2017, as more people continued to come to the UK to live than move to live abroad for a year or more. Poland-born residents and Polish nationals were the most common populations from outside the UK. However, the largest increases in population were seen from those born in Romania and those with Romanian nationality.  The figures show that 3.8 million (61%) of the 6.2 million non-British nationals living in the UK in 2017 held EU nationality. This is roughly the same proportion as 2016 (60%). London had the largest proportion of non-British nationals in 2017, with the highest numbers in the local authorities of Newham (38%), Westminster (36%) and Brent (34%).

Many people took time off work or cut their holidays short to make sure they had a say over the future of the eighth amendment, which bans abortion in almost all circumstances. Ciaran Gaffney, based in Buenos Aires, Argentina, spotted four of his countrymen on a plane home to vote. He tweeted: Was actually so humbled and relieved to meet four other Irish people on the flight from Buenos Aires to London, all of them flying onwards to Dublin today or tomorrow to #voteyes.    Aoife Bennett, 25, an editor with a travel magazine based in Dortmund, Germany, will be making the journey to Dublin to vote then making the journey back in less than 24 hours.  She tweeted: I\u0027m flying home for not even 24 hours to vote for this. Anyone I\u0027ve said this to hasn\u0027t called me a muppet. Or insane. They\u0027re thanking me. This is the most important referendum we may ever face. Of course I was coming home.  She told the Press Association: This referendum is about giving women the respect we deserve. I cannot believe that, in this sense, Ireland is held back by values that are over 100 years old.   She said that a year ago her mother was diagnosed with cancer, but was told by doctors that if she was planning on having more children she would not be given the life-saving treatment she needs.  Ms Bennett said: It makes me shiver to think that if she had been diagnosed 26 years ago, or 21 - my brother\u0027s age - we could have killed her because we would have been seen as more important.  Many people from the No camp also made the journey.    Eoin O\u0027Loughlin, 20, from County Clare but living in London, told the Press Association at Dublin airport: I think the unborn baby is entitled to life - I think the abortion procedure and the whole industry behind it is fairly frightening. I think obviously the pro-choice side talk a lot about the hard cases, but this legislation that the Government are proposing goes far beyond that and I think goes way too far and will be detrimental to Irish babies and mothers.   He added: There\u0027s about 30 of us who are coming home over the next 24 hours. We\u0027ve been in touch for the last few weeks and trying to organise flights together and so on. Mary Galvin, 73, from Wexford, cut her holiday to Italy short by a day to be home for the referendum to vote No.   She said: I\u0027ve been a nurse all my life - the hard cases, there are many hard cases, like a lady who had been raped, and you help deal with that and the aftermath of that, with support.  I was involved in the pro-life back in 1983 and we had a lot to do with that. A lot of marching and it\u0027s been something that\u0027s very dear to my heart and I feel like there\u0027s a lot of pain involved in abortion on young women through their lives - it will go on and on after the day it happens. I pray to god it doesn\u0027t come in to the country.  Another woman had returned home from her holiday in Croatia to cast her vote.    She said: I\u0027m certainly going to vote No. Of course I\u0027m going to vote No. In a civilised country, that we\u0027re actually going to the polls to be asked to decide whether we should make it legal to kill an unborn child I think is terrible, and people don\u0027t seem to understand that every right is being taken away from every unborn child.   Elsewhere, travel writer Alice Murphy, who covers the Philippines and Australia , even offered to stump up the cash for another person to travel home to vote from the UK to vote Yes because she could not make it herself.  She tweeted: Irish working in the UK: If there\u0027s anyone who can fly home to vote on Friday but doesn\u0027t have the money, please DM me - I will pay for your flights home as I can\u0027t come home myself. #HometoVote #Repeal8th #TogetherForYes.

O\u0027Brien fled in the wake of Mr Hanson\u0027s death and was thought to be in the Netherlands and United Arab Emirates before returning to Europe.  He has been placed on Interpol\u0027s worldwide most wanted list and there is also a \u0026pound50,000 reward for information leading to his arrest and prosecution.

The politan Police say O\u0027Brien was flown out of the UK on a privately chartered plane from Biggin Hill Airport. He was arrested in Prague for criminal damage and assault in February last year under the Italian alias Enzo Mellonceli and released on bail.  Police say he has been travelling extensively and there were reported sightings in Gibraltar, Nice in France and Prague following an appeal for information in October last year. Detective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh said: Based on what we know about O\u0027Brien\u0027s lifestyle and interests, we are looking to people in nightclubs and boxing gyms as well as expats and any women he may have become involved with to come forward. Please do not assume that someone else will call in, what you perceive to be a small piece of information could in fact be the missing piece of the jigsaw that gets justice for Josh. He added: Everyone wants to give Josh\u0027s mum Tracey and his sister Brooke the news they so desperately need to hear. As the months go by, the lack of justice only adds to their heartbreak. Josh was an amazing young man with his whole life ahead of him and Tracey and Brooke miss him desperately. They need to see O\u0027Brien brought to justice.

Russell Edwards, who weighed almost 20 stone, realised his fast food habit was getting out of control after he looked at his bank statements and noticed how much cash was being spent on burgers and chips. He says he was eating breakfast at McDonald\u0027s at least five times a week. However, the 37-year-old soon turned his life around after swapping McDonald\u0027s for power walking on his lunch breaks.  When we had our son, things started to change in my life and I didn\u0027t realise it at the time - but I started to struggle with my weight, Russell told Wales Online.  Having a new child meant I had no time for fitness and I let myself go. He was a poor sleeper, so I\u0027d stay up all night watching Netflix and started eating chocolates and biscuits at around 2am.  Russell said things started to get worse after he left his job as a health club manager at The Miskin Manor Hotel \u0026amp Health Club and landed a new job at a water treatment company - which was right next door to a McDonald\u0027s restaurant. The job was office based and right next door there was a Greggs and a McDonald\u0027s. I was so big that I started to get lazy - which meant I\u0027d sleep late in the mornings and wouldn\u0027t have time to make breakfast. It wasn\u0027t long before Russell started stopping in McDonald\u0027s before work. It\u0027s lethal having a contactless debit card - because I didn\u0027t realise what I was spending there, he said. I was having breakfast there around five days a week.  It started with a coffee and then coffee and a breakfast meal and then all of that and a wrap as well. And sometimes I\u0027d even have lunch there too. One month I remember checking my bank statement and I\u0027d spent \u0026pound200 at McDonald\u0027s. I couldn\u0027t believe it! Russell added: It wasn\u0027t McDonald\u0027s\u0027 fault - you can make good choices there these days, but I was just making the wrong choices. It was my own fault - I chose to eat it and I slipped into a bad habit. Russell said his weight at the time - which was around 19 stone 4lbs - was not only effecting his physical health, but his mental health too, making made him desperately unhappy. I came home from work one day and my son said to me \u0027Dad, Dad - come and play with me\u0027 and I had to say no because I was too tired. Seeing his face all upset made me think - what are you doing? I wasn\u0027t tired I was just overweight. Russell said another experience which played a huge factor in his decision to lose weight was when he travelled to Toulouse to watch Wales during the UEFA Euro 2016 Championship.  I hadn\u0027t tried on any of my clothes, so before the game I realised none of my Wales tops fitted me and I couldn\u0027t button up my 44-inch waist shorts. I had to go out and buy XXL clothes.  Looking back at photos from two years ago, what stands out is the shirt I wore to the games, Russell said. It was the biggest size I had ever had to buy and although I knew then that I had to do something about it, I couldn’t. I was in a rut and it was really hard to get going. He added: I told my brother - who was with me in France at the time - I\u0027m not going to be like this next year. When he returned from his trip, Russell - who left his office job to return to work at the health club - started running in the lane behind his house. He also bought a Fitbit watch to track his steps. I was too self-conscious to go to the gym. I was worried people would laugh. So I started running in the lane behind my house. And I was very unfit. I could only run for around three minutes.  I was also only managing around 1,000 steps a day on my watch, and 800 of those were just walking to and from my car to get to work. So, I set myself a target of reaching around 10,000 a day. Russell also made an effort to change his diet in conjunction with the watch - which meant cutting out his McDonald\u0027s breakfast and lunch. I knew the watch wouldn’t work miracles on its own, but I understood it would make me accountable for my activity, or lack of it, he said. I started focusing on healthy meals and cooking more at home - things like spaghetti bolognese and fish. I still had the odd treat too, but I cut out McDonald\u0027s totally. Despite his lifestyle and diet changes, Russell says it was running that really helped him transform his life. So much so, that last year he completed his first 10k race and has signed up for this year\u0027s Cardiff Half Marathon. He\u0027s now hoping to inspire others to follow suit.

Nathan Guilfoyle, who passed his test in January, has slammed the estimate on his 2004 Ford Fiesta from Allianz as unfair.  The 18-year-old told the Irish Mirror : “My original reaction was that it was really unfair rather than being shocked.  “You do expect high enough prices but when it came to that one, I thought, ‘OK €6,000, €5000, I can see why they might go high enough. “But when I saw €16,785.01 (\u0026pound14,701), which is eight times what the car is worth, I just thought it was unfair.” The Leaving Cert student, who has a clean licence and never been involved in a crash, said he believes some companies do not want to insure young motorists. Nathan, from Claremorris, Co Mayo, added: “I think that’s definitely the case. I don’t think they’re being proper with that figure. “I think there’s an element they don’t want to insure young drivers. “I know there’s a stigma around us but I think it’s just unfair for everybody involved because most of the lads I know just want to have a car and drive around. “We’re a victim of other people we don’t get a fresh start. We don’t get a clean slate. I think it’s unfair the way the whole system works really.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prince philip attended prince harry","story":"NewsPrince Philip attended Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s wedding despite having a \u0027cracked rib after bath fall\u0027The Duke of Edinburgh was also recovering from a recent hip replacement when he watched the Duke and Duchess of Sussex exchange vows\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByZoe ShentonUS Showbiz Editor (Digital)02:45, 25 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Prince Philip was determined to watch his grandson walk down the aisle last weekend.  The Duke of Edinburgh, 96, attended Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s nuptials despite reportedly having a cracked rib after falling in the bath just days earlier. Showing no sign of pain, Philip appeared in high spirits smiling at Royal Wedding well wishers as he walked unaided into St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle with the Queen.  A royal insider said he refused to use a stick to help him, and added to The Sun : The Duke is not a fan of showering and prefers to bathe.  But he’s a determined man and nothing was going to stop him attending.”  The groom\u0027s grandfather is also said to have run up and down the stairs in order to get in shape for the special day. Royal biographer Penny Junor described the Duke as \u0027completely heroic\u0027 after attending the wedding. She said: Given he is 96 and the operation was six weeks ago, I think it shows he is an extraordinary man.”  Philip had also recently recovered from a hip replacement after undergoing surgery at King Edward VII hospital on April 4. Nine days later, he was pictured smiling and giving onlookers a royal wave as he was driven away from the London hospital.  In early May, Kensington Palace said they were unsure if the Duke would attend the Royal Wedding , adding that Buckingham Palace staff would have guidance on that closer to the time.   The Duke of Edinburgh, the longest-serving consort in British history and also the oldest serving partner of a reigning monarch, retired from public duties in August of last year - 64 years afer he began his service to the British public. Prince Philip\u0027s first royal engagement after the Queen\u0027s coronation was a dinner in the Officers\u0027 Mess at Eastney Barracks on July 15 1953.  Philip, who was 32, wore smart Royal Marines mess dress. The Times recorded how he motored from Odiham to Eastney Barracks and watched the massed bands of the Portsmouth Command beat retreat on the cricket field. The Duke had been appointed Captain General of the corps and the newspaper said: For the occasion, officers and men of the corps had come from all Royal Marine units in the United Kingdom and ships of the Home Fleet.

Bearing a strange resemblance to a crocodile, the 41-year-old placed a photo of the animal on Facebook , with many weighing in with their theories of what it could be.  She said: “I was going for a run with my dogs when I came across it. It looked like a well rotted cetacean to me.  “I put it on Facebook and it caused a big discussion. Other people think it is something different, like a crocodile. “It would be very interesting to find out what species it is.” Dr Dan Forman, of the Swansea ecology research team at Swansea University\u0027s department of biosciences, has now offered his view on what it could be. He said: “Its jawline suggests it is like a cetacean whale or a dolphin. “We get a reasonable amount of whales and dolphins, a lot which are dead and decomposed in places like Pendine and Rhossili. “From the data around carcasses washed up, there seems to be a cluster this time of year around June and July. “The jaw is thin in places and it looks from the picture like it is upside down. “When you look at it the first time you may think it is a crocodile, but it is certainly not.

The clips shows a huge blast in the countryside, leaving behind piles of rubble and a large dust cloud while invited western journalists looked on.  Sky News, the only British broadcaster invited, said it had witnessed what North Korea claims to be the destruction of its nuclear test tunnels at Punggye-ri. Sky\u0027s Tom Cheshire said: We hiked up into the mountains and watched the demolition about 500 metres away. There was a huge explosion, you could feel it. Dust came at you, the heat came at you. It was extremely loud.  North Korea claimed the tunnels and equipment that had been installed at the observation centre, control centre and research institute in the northern nuclear test ground were dismantled and withdrawn. This included information communications and power systems and construction and operation equipment. The process of the dismantlement was covered by reporters from the UK, China, Russia, the US, and South Korea.  Although the decision to demolish the test site has been welcomed internationally it is not an irreversible move with other steps also required to meet Trump\u0027s demands for denuclearisation. A source told online newspaper Daily NK that the regime has designated Chagang Province a \u0027Special Military-first Revolutionary Zone\u0027 and that the regime will hide its weapons and materials in tunnels beneath the mountains there. The source said: “Nuclear weapons can be hidden anywhere but the North Korean authorities have chosen, it seems, a place where even satellites will have difficulty locating them.”  It comes as Trump called off a historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un scheduled for next month, citing Pyongyang\u0027s open hostility. Trump warned that the US military was ready in the event of any reckless acts by North Korea. But North Korea has responded saying it sets in high regards President Trump\u0027s efforts, unprecedented by any other president, to create a historic North Korea-US summit.

The pedestrian, Elaine Herzberg, was struck by the vehicle as it travelled at around 40mph on a busy road, and Uber has been branded reckless in the aftermath of the tragedy. It was the first time a pedestrian has been killed by a self-driving car. Now it has emerged that the car\u0027s emergency breaking system had been disabled ahead of the tragedy, which happened in Arizona in March. The 49-year-old victim was struck despite the modified Volvo XC90\u0027s radar systems observing her six seconds before the crash, a preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board. The car has an autonomous mode, during which a computer does the driving, and a manual mode, when a human takes over.  A safety operator behind the wheel appeared to be looking down, and not at the road, moments before the crash, according to video from inside the car released by police. The operator told the NTSB she was not looking at a mobile phone but monitoring the vehicle\u0027s self-driving systems. William Wallace, senior policy analyst for Consumers Union, the advocacy division of Consumer Reports, called Uber reckless and said the NTSB report makes it clear that a self-driving car was tested on public roads when it wasn\u0027t safe enough to be there, and it killed a pedestrian. He added that the system was far too dangerous to be tested off a closed track. It said the self-driving system software classified the pedestrian as an unknown object, as a vehicle, and then as a bicycle.  Just over a second before the impact the car\u0027s self-driving system determined that emergency braking was needed, but Uber said emergency braking manoeuvers were not enabled while the vehicle was under computer control. Uber has said it would shut down its Arizona self-driving testing program and focus on limited testing in Pittsburgh and two cities in California. Arizona\u0027s governor in March had suspended Uber\u0027s permit for the testing, citing safety concerns. The company did not directly comment on the NTSB findings but noted it recently named a former NTSB chairman, Christopher Hart, to advise on Uber\u0027s safety culture.

fraser","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlaymaker Scott Fraser looks set for a switch to England after announcing he’s quitting Dundee United.Burton Albion, looking to rebuild after relegation from the Championship down south, now seem the 23-year-old’s most likely destination.The Tangerines announced last night that Fraser had rejected their offer of a lucrative new deal and would be pursuing other options.He’s been speaking to a number of clubs in England and there has even been interest from abroad.For the past month or so Hearts have appeared to be leading the race for Fraser and their first-team coach, ex-Tannadice favourite Jon Daly, has watched him on several occasions.Burton, managed by Nigel Clough, have now jumped to the front of the queue.They’re expected to beat off that interest from Tynecastle as well as offers from English rivals Peterborough and Blackpool, to get Fraser fixed up.Accepting the player’s decision to go, manager Csaba Laszlo stressed United had fought hard to hang on to him.“We did everything we could to keep Scott at the club,” he said.“He is a gifted player and we made him a very good offer to stay with us.“He is a great example to young players of the pathway that is open to them in professional football and I have no doubt he will do very well in the future.“We know that good players will attract attention and, for this reason, we are already at an advanced stage in replacing Scott and a number of the other players that left at the end of the season.”Fraser himself made it clear after over a decade at Tannadice he felt the time to move to pastures new had come.His big regret is the broken foot that’s plagued him since early last year prevented him doing more to help in the battle to get back to the Premiership.He first broke it at St Mirren in March 2017 and did it again at the same venue when United lost there at the end of December.“I would like to take this opportunity to thank the club for everything they have done for me over the past 12 years.“When I joined the academy back in 2006 I could only dream of making over 100 appearances.“Unfortunately, my last season was the most frustrating I have ever had with the injury and I am gutted we couldn’t achieve promotion.“Thanks to all my team-mates, coaches and managers over the years.“I now feel the time is right for me to move on in order to improve as a player by playing at the highest level I possibly can.“Thanks again and good luck for next season.”Meanwhile, Graeme Liveston, who for many years was in charge of United’s youth recruitment in the west coast, could be set for a return to Tannadice as part of the shake-up to the youth set-up that’s taking place this summer.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/02/5a86c4d42bb4d-e1518786790343.jpg ","title":"council apologise for handling of road closures ahead of bbcs

All in just one year for this happy couple!Kayleigh Petrie, 22, and Aaron Ogilvie, 23, met when they were just 11 at the carnival but the pair only became a couple after Kayleigh picked Aaron up from a night out just over four years ago.Aaron, an auxiliary worker, said: “From the night that Kayleigh picked me up we were together, although it took me months to officially ask her out!”Three years later the pair were shocked to find out that Kayleigh was pregnant after originally being told that a natural conception would not be possible.Kayleigh, a social care worker, said: “We didn’t expect me to get pregnant as I was told I couldn’t have children because I have endometriosis.“However, I did fall pregnant naturally and I even had to cancel an operation to have my eggs removed that I had been waiting more than a year for.“It was a massive shock but an amazing one.”The Coldside couple welcomed beautiful baby Oak Ogilvie on March 19, weighing a healthy 7lb 10oz.Following five days in hospital, the new family arrived home and although Kayleigh and Aaron admit parenthood is hard, they say it is all worth it.When Oak was eight weeks old, she donned the family christening gown that her mum and many other relatives going back almost 50 years had worn and was christened at St Martin’s Church in the Hilltown.The surprises kept coming at the reception as Aaron decided to get down on one knee and propose to Kayleigh – although it almost did not happen.Aaron said: “I wasn’t sure if I was going to be able to propose that day as a family friend was buying the ring on a trip to Dubai and was only returning home on the same day as the christening.“I was so nervous as I am not a speaker anyway and I was worried the ring wasn’t going to arrive.“I was even sick outside due to nerves. Kayleigh thought I was just drunk and told me to stop drinking. I had only had three drinks!“The ring finally arrived around 5pm and I made a speech in front of both of our families and got down on one knee.“Kayleigh had no idea I was going to do it.”Kayleigh added: “I was so shocked. I didn’t expect it at all.“If I had known I would have battered him.“It was amazing that our families were there to see it because family is so important.“There are now five generations in my family so it was really special.“My mum kindly looked after Oak that night so we were able to go out in the Ferry and celebrate.”The couple are now busy planning their wedding in 2020, which they hope can be on the same date as their engagement.“I can’t wait for the wedding,” said Kayleigh. “Oak will be two when it comes around so she will be our flower girl and she will be able to walk down the aisle.”The happy family would like to thank Kayleigh’s mum Gillian for organising and paying for the christening and also uncle Paul who took all the pictures of the day.Kayleigh added: “We would also like to say a massive thank you to all of the godparents.

Nicky has tremendous ability and in addition to scoring he is also very good at reading the game,” he said.The 26-year-old had the option of staying at Dunfermline, for whom he hit 37 goals in the past two seasons, but admitted the lure of a move to Tannadice was too much to resist.“I am delighted to be joining a club of the stature of Dundee United and my main intention is to help the team get us up to the Premiership.“I am really looking forward to this new challenge in my career,” he said.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b05375707da0-e1527072047490-709x564.jpg ","title":"fraser fyvie tipped to be main dundee united man by ex star","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt’s going to be a summer of signings for Dundee United as they attempt to build a squad capable of getting out of the Championship.As many as 17 new faces from goalkeepers to strikers are expected to come through the doors at Tannadice as manager Csaba Laszlo, aided by club legend Paul Sturrock, completely revamp the home dressing-room.That’s likely to see a mix of youth and experience as well as some exciting talent arriving right up until the end of the transfer window in August.One United old boy, though, believes Laszlo and Luggy might already have made their most important signing.The former player is Stuart Duff and the capture he believes could be more significant than any other is that of existing employee Fraser Fyvie.The midfielder’s campaign in the season just ended was ruined by a knee problem suffered at Christmas. Prior to that the Tangerines were unbeaten in 15 of 16 league games he played.With the 25-year-old set to return around the start of the new season, Duff believes it was vital United beat off interest from Championship rivals Ross County to get him fixed up on a new two-year contract. Having known him since he was a kid at Aberdeen the best part of a decade ago, Duff is well placed to judge what he can do.“I actually watched one of United’s play-off games with Fraser and from speaking to him I know he is working hard to get back fit,” he said.“He’s about to start running again so it shouldn’t be too long before he is back. That, and him signing a new deal, is very good news for United.“You saw the quality he has when he played for part of last season.“He was a bit of a stand-out in the United team and I will not be surprised if that’s the case again next season.“It really will not surprise me if they build the team around him because that’s the level of ability he has.”With most of last season’s team gone, Fyvie will be surrounded by new faces.That will make United something of an unknown quantity and bringing so many players in at one time has to be something of a gamble.For Duff it’s a calculated risk and, so long as the right type of player is sourced, he believes the team can gel.“I think if you go out and get the right players with the right attitude and philosophy, it can work.“You want players who want to come in and work hard to prove, basically, why the club signed them and that they should be playing at a club like United. If they do that then United can be where they want to be.”And having spent the best part of a decade at Tannadice from the start of his career, he would like nothing better than to see them back in the top flight.Last week he was back in a United strip for Dave Bowman’s annual game to raise cash for skin cancer and dementia charities. Running out at Tannadice reminded Duff where United should be.“You look around the place and it’s geared up for the Premiership but no one has the divine right to be there, you have to earn it. It will be a battle again next season because it’s a tough league.“But I was here nine-and-a-half years from when I was a kid and the upbringing here was very good – second to none – so I want United back up.”At 36, and despite recently taking on a new job with the Connect Energy Group that involves a lot of travelling, Duff has no plans to hang up his own boots.Next season he’ll again be plying his trade in the Highland League with Inverurie Locos.“The new job is keeping me busy but I do get Saturdays off so I’m available and happy to keep playing.“We finished third last year, so the aim is to go a bit higher next season.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"livingston star byrne on dundee united radar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tLivingston promotion hero Shaun Byrne is the latest player to be linked with a move to Dundee United.But the Tangerines will face stiff competition from elsewhere if they do move for him.The 24-year-old was part of the side that clinched promotion to the Premiership by beating Partick Thistle in the play-offs on Sunday.He’s now out of contract and that’s alerted United, Falkirk and a string of English clubs.

Scotland confirmed a 48-year-old woman had been arrested and subsequently released without charge pending further inquiries.Parents had claimed a woman wearing dark lipstick and a dark hood had targeted children of nursery age.One mum in Dundee’s Charleston area said her four-year-old daughter had been “grabbed” in the street by a middle-aged woman matching the description.The woman had

dundee wishlist","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee are in the hunt for a goalscorer and Leyton Orient marksman Macauley Bonne is top of their wishlist.The Zimbabwe international scored 25 goals for the National League side last season, sparking the Dark Blues interest.Born in Ipswich, Bonne started his career at Colchester United, where he played with current Dundee midfielder Glen Kamara briefly, before loans at Lincoln City and Woking.It’s been at Brisbane Road, however, where he’s shone, smashing in 22 league goals last season.With a year remaining on his current deal there, a fee will be required to prise him from Orient and that could be a sticking point with the non-league side holding out for six figures.With Shrewsbury, Portsmouth and Burton Albion all interested, too, Dundee have fierce competition to land the 22-year-old striker.Orient are also keen to keep him on a longer contract but a mid-table finish in the National League is unlikely to have been enough to keep him amid interest from other clubs.Dens gaffer Neil McCann highlighted a lack of killer instinct in his side throughout last season, something he is determined to rectify this summer with a proven goalscorer.With money in the bank from the January sale of defender Jack Hendry, Dundee have the funds behind them to strengthen that area of the team.And having already raided the English non-league for Roarie Deacon last summer and Elton Ngwatala last week, Neil is hoping he can attract another National League star to come north of the border.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the

fund","story":"\u0026nbspA VOLUNTEER for the Highland Hospice has signed herself up for a gruelling 10-week transformation programme to try and raise cash for the charity.Tracey Morrison (47) had already volunteered to take part in the hospice\u0027 Rocky Mountain challenge this September when kind-hearted personal trainer Alan Goodwin offered the hospice a free place on his intense fitness programme.Mrs Morrison, of Milton Of Leys, accepted the opportunity to get fit fast in preparation for her upcoming trek even though it was completely out of her comfort zone.\"You could say that I am an unfit 47-year-old,\" she said.\"Activity isn\u0026rsquot the best for me and I had never even heard of a fitness bleep test. I thought\u0026nbsp I have to do something about my general health and lifestyle and get to a better place.\"She hopes people will follow her journey as she takes part in the Spartan 70 challenge with Mr Goodwin and donate pounds as she sheds them.\"I am hoping to lose 20 pounds over the course of 10 weeks so if people were happy to donate to match that, it would be wonderful,\" she said.She has been volunteering with the hospice since 2013 and was delighted to be chosen to take part in this fitness challenge and the Rocky Mountain Challenge, that will see her embark on a 10-day trek through the Canadian Rockies.\"It is the challenge of a lifetime and so completely out of my comfort zone,\" she said.\"I am delighted to have the opportunity.\"Mr Goodwin came up with the idea of offering a place on his course after a recent tour of the hospice facilities.\"The Spartan 70 programme has been so successful that we expanded it, doubled the number of recruits and took on another trainer,\" the 39-year-old said.\"I wanted to give something back and the hospice is just so great. They do so much with so little funding.\"He launched Alan Goodwin Personal Training three years ago and is now based in the Inverness Tennis and Squash Club but likes to take as many of his sessions outdoors as possible.He added: \"The fundraising team next door at Highland Hospice do an incredible job of keeping the place running day to day and, having received a recent tour, they offer something so meaningful.\"We are very lucky to have something like this in the area.\"He will be supporting Mrs Morrison to achieve her goals but he admitted that the programme can be tough.For 10 weeks Mrs Morrison will have to give up alcohol, submit a weekly food diary based on strict healthy-eating guidelines, attend early morning group sessions twice a week, attend weekly outdoor boot camps on Nairn Beach and Ord Hill and during this time she is not allowed to miss\u0026nbsp more than eight sessions.Anyone taking part in the programme who breaks these rules will be disqualified.\"It is really strict but I think Tracey will do really well,\" Mr Goodwin said.\"It is really successful because the people that take really want to get in great shape.\"He added: \"I really hope that people will give generously and sponsor her for her losses between now and July 22.\"Weekly updates on Mrs Morrison\u0027 progress will be posted on the Alan Goodwin Personal Training Facebook page and also the Highland Hospice\u0027 social media.To donate to Tracey Morrison\u0027 challenge visit https://www.justgiving/fundraising/tracey-morrison71\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFriday 25 May 2018 11:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"}]
