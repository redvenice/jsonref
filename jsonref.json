There are also several large kitchens and social rooms where officers could wind down after a hard day, and judging by the amount of bars I would imagine they were big social drinkers too.\u0027In the basement of some of the buildings you can find dark bunkers with thick concrete walls, a few benches and a ladder leading up to the surface through a concealed hatch. I imagine they would have been used as air raid shelters for the ground crew during attacks - they are very cold and dark and it must\u0027ve been uncomfortable.\u0027There is also a nice little general store on site with a retro checkout counter.\u0027The remarkable site has witnessed more than its fair share of history, both aviation and otherwise.         Immediately post war, the station retained its role as a front-line fighter station in the defence of northern England. In April 1946, the station became one of the first in the country to operate jet aircraft, the Gloster Meteors of 263 Squadron. But sadly since then, the site has fallen into disrepair, with the floors and ceiling rotting away         It also played a crucial role protecting the Allied troops during the D-Day landings.

Wang said both sides would need to go through legal checks, translations, and arrangements for an official signing ceremony.Liao Min, of the office of the Central Commission for Financial and Economic Affairs, said China would also consider not implementing previously planned tariffs on US products, to go in effect on 15 December.“China hopes the US will fulfill its commitment. Removing tariffs is the core concern of China’s,” he said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S\u0026ampP 500 index closed only slightly higher on the news on Friday and experts questioned how much the agreement resolves long-running tensions between the two countries.“The deal will ultimately be weighed in terms of how much it does to address structural issues like intellectual property and market access,” said Shehzad Qazi of China Beige Book. “The push for financial decoupling and of course the larger technological competition are also all here to stay.”“Trump’s trade war may have been the opening salvo of a long drawn conflict,” he said.As China comes under more pressure to support its slowing economy, major structural changes are less likely.“The trade war so far has damaged the bilateral relationship in every dimension,” said Dan Wang, the China analyst for the Economist Intelligence Unit.“This may be the end of act 1, but far from the end of the trade talks. China will continue to rely on industrial policies and the state sector to lead growth. The role of state-owned enterprises is strengthened, not weakened during this economic downturn and the opening-up policies are rather limited,” she said.Beijing’s muted response earlier on Friday had raised questions about whether an agreement had been reached. Speaking at a symposium in Beijing, China’s minister of foreign affairs, Wang Yi, did not mention the negotiations.Instead, he took the occasion to criticise the US for having “seriously damaged the hard-won mutual trust” between the two countries. Wang said the US had “slandered” China by criticising it over its policies in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.“We will never accept the so-called unilateral sanctions and any acts of bullying,” he said.For the last year and a half, Beijing and Washington have been locked in a tit-for-tat trade war that has inflicted pain in both economies, caused market uncertainty, and slowed global growth.Critics say striking a deal now negates the last year and a half of pressure on China to reform practices that give its businesses an unfair advantage.The US senator Marco Rubio wrote on Twitter that the deal would “give away the tariff leverage needed for a broader agreement on the issues that matter the most such as sub­sidies to do­mes­tic firms, forced tech transfers \u0026amp blocking US firms access to key sectors”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf6c4d9128238c587f06116f800a60e09ebccef7/0_47_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bb84f5f84b9fdafe09946ac8f081bd6","title":"helena morrissey top city boss turns instagram fashion star","story":"Aspiring Bank of England governor styles herself as ‘soft power dresser’ offering tipsTop City fund manager, campaigner for equal pay and opportunities, aspiring governor of the Bank of England, author – and now social media fashion influencer?Styling herself as a “soft power dresser”, Morrissey, who has nine children and was recently interviewed to become the next Bank governor, has launched an Instagram account offering “daily tips for modern feminine career dressing”.She started posting in late November and kicked off her recommendations with a full-length picture of herself wearing a Zara shirt dress with a silk scarf print.As in most of the 20 or so other images, she is posing next to gold floor-length curtains in her family living room.In her captions, Morrissey discusses how to cope with “sartorial challenges”, advocates comfortable shoes and sings the praises of young British designers.She claims her family motto is “reduce, reuse, recycle”, and says the motto is the inspiration behind her second-eldest daughter’s new vintage fashion venture, Florence Clementine Archive, where some of the photographs of the luxury clothes for sale feature a suspiciously familiar model.In one recent post, Morrissey styled a pleated “truly special skirt” costing thousands from Gucci with a ribbed polo neck from the Japanese clothing company Uniqlo, which sells for about £25.Under the photo, she extols the virtues of wearing less corporate outfits: “A young colleague started dressing more distinctively. One day, I admired the beautiful skirt she was wearing she told me I had inspired her to dress for work in the feminine style she preferred. It was so lovely of her to share that – and wonderful to see her grow in confidence – and get promoted!”The handful of comments below that post from her followers are entirely positive. “I adore this skirt,” writes one. “I love you’re sharing, what an inspiration,” says another.Whether new or vintage, some of Morrissey’s outfits from labels such as Stella McCartney, Alexander McQueen and Jimmy Choo may be beyond the means of most of her 2,700 followers, if they are not on a top City salary.Nor do they appeal to every female worker.“I would never wear that, it looks like something my mother thinks I should wear as a CEO,” says one thirtysomething female boss of a financial services firm, of Morrissey’s green Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana dress, which is embellished with large white daisies. “As a leader in a male-dominated and often bullish environment, what I wear really matters as to how I am perceived.”Another female leader in the fintech business suggests bright colours and embellished skirts are easier to wear for women already at the top of their profession: “I stick to that more corporate look as otherwise assumptions would be made and I would be dismissed more quickly. Dressing in a more flamboyant and fun way isn’t helpful when you aren’t at the level of seniority Morrissey is.”Morrissey recently quit Legal \u0026amp General, saying she wanted to pursue other interests.If she grows her follower count apace, designer-sponsored Instagram posts and brand partnerships may well follow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9779f8cd8346739e91b8e59178845559fb6652d/0_274_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1da2e0595ff78b99e388e8563520e61d","title":"whistleblower reveals financial ombudsman service in disarray","story":"Consumers are waiting up to two years for adjudications, according to FOS documentsCan you trust the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) to resolve your dispute with a bank or insurer? A whistleblower has told  Money that a “disastrous” management reorganisation has left the service in disarray, with the public waiting as long as two years to get justice.The whistleblower, a senior staff member at the FOS who wishes to remain anonymous, alleges that:• Consumers sending complex complaints to FOS can wait 10 months before a file is even picked up and examined.• The waiting time for pension disputes is seven months.• Wronged consumers can wait up to two years until their claims are finally adjudicated.• The number of unresolved general claims (non-PPI) that remain unresolved a year after being received now stands at 15,551.• Managers expected case handlers to resolve 4.5 complaints a week, but the real figure is 1.7.Documents shown to Money by the whistleblower indicate that a consumer with a complex dispute with their mortgage company or home insurer faces a wait of about 10 months before the file is even picked up and looked for the first time.The service was set up to help consumers get fair treatment from the banks, insurers, pension and other financial services providers. Staff act as independent adjudicators over disputes, and their findings are binding on the companies concerned. It’s free for consumers to use, but the company concerned must pay £550.However, the service has been beset with problems in recent years. In 2018, an undercover reporter for Channel 4’s Dispatches found that staff with inadequate training or financial competence were judging cases – sometimes without, it claimed, properly reading case files.Several staff have since turned whistleblower in a bid to get the Financial Conduct Authority to take action. Their comments chime with complaints to Money from readers who, having been through the arbitration process, claim the service is not fit for purpose.According to the latest whistleblower, things are even worse now than a year ago. A 2016 reorganisation changed the way cases are distributed, he says. Instead of using expert adjudicators to deal solely with disputes in their specialist areas, new investigators were expected to work across all areas of finance. The result, he says, has been a huge drop in the service’s performance in what it calls its “general cases”, leaving a growing list of people awaiting what can be life-changing sums of money.Complaints are initially judged by an“investigator” and only escalated to the experienced ombudsmen if either party appeals against the first decision.The queue of complaints waiting for an ombudsman’s decision has increased dramatically in recent years and now stands at 15,592.“Managers believed their changes would enable investigators to resolve 4.5 complaints a week, which turned out to be a gross misjudgment. The system has never delivered more than 2.6 case closures per week and the current output is now 1.7,” he says.“The organisation is facing problems beyond simply the backlogs. The resolved complaints per investigator per week is less than half of what it was claimed would be achieved.And the cost of resolving each complaint now exceeds £1,100 – placing the long-term sustainability of the organisation in doubt.”The end of the tsunami of PPI claims that swamped the service was set to be an opportunity to start clearing the backlog in complaints. However, improved service times have not emerged, he says.“This year we intended to resolve 50,000 more complaints than we received – 510,000 versus 460,000 – to deal with the large backlog of cases which had developed, particularly in general casework as a result of the failed restructure. We have just learned that the target has been cut to 310,000.”The delays are particularly hard on those with buildings insurance complaints, including subsidence and high-value claims that are taking 10 months before anyone starts to look at the complaint.“The queue for an ombudsman’s decision is, if anything, worse than the queue at the front end of the process. In areas such as buildings insurance and pensions, complainants are now regularly having to wait over a year from the time they request an ombudsman’s decision. Putting the two queues together, it can be seen that if one were to complain today about, for example, a buildings insurance claim for subsidence, it is likely to be over two years before a decision is issued. The complainant just has to hope their house hasn’t fallen down in the meantime,” he says.A spokeswoman for the FOS said: “Last year an independent review of the Financial Ombudsman Service concluded that we provided an ‘effective and essential service’. We have come off the back of our busiest year for five years and are working to get people answers on their cases as quickly as possible. Our team work hard to make sure every complaint we handle is investigated thoroughly, to ensure we reach a fair result for people and businesses.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e1c25340386445632106ddb6b69a8117666a1e7/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aabff8a1f67041a06fd1ba524a8033b6","title":"around the world in a day without leaving shenzhen a photo essay","story":"For Chinese tourists who cannot travel, the Window of the World theme park offers versions of 130 global attractions. Photojournalist Anthony Micallef took a whistlestop tour More than 3 million visitors a year flock to the Window of the World theme park in the megacity of Shenzhen to see 130 copies of the world’s largest tourist sites gathered in a single place.For Chinese tourists who may not be able to travel out of the country this is their only chance of seeing the New York skyline, the pyramids of Giza or the Taj Mahal – or smaller replicas of them, at least.The visit typically begins at the metro station, modelled in the shape of the Louvre pyramid in Paris, designed by Chinese-American architect IM Pei. Most tourists then head for the nearby splendours of European architecture: the Acropolis of Athens, the Palace of Versailles, Buckingham Palace and Tower Bridge from London, or Italy’s Leaning Tower of Pisa.Moving to Asia, the Angkor Wat temple is always popular with visitors. The Hindu temple complex in Cambodia is the largest religious monument in the world, although the copy here is somewhat smaller. Mount Fuji and the Iranian city of Persepolis are also packed with visitors. A few hundred metres further on, Sydney Opera House is a step or two from the sacred sandstone rock of Uluru.Next up is the Manhattan skyline, Rio de Janeiro’s Christ the Redeemer statue, and the monumental stone figures of Easter Island – all without ever leaving Shenzhen.Many visitors buy a fake passport which the theme park hostesses will stamp with as many foreign visas as you want.The theme park also offers boat trips down the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon, and a cable car ride across the Amazon rain forest. If you want to cool down there is a climate-controlled indoor ski centre with 4,000 sq m of artificial snow slopes.If you look closely, many of the reproductions appear a little kitsch and the decor outdated. Some visitors complain a few need a new paint job, or even a total rebuild.But putting aside aesthetic disappointments, the park does allow the visitor to learn a lot about the real sites and their histories. I emerge knowing that the Moscow Kremlin was first a residence of the tsars, then of the leaders of the USSR, and is nowadays the official residence of Russia’s President Putin.I learn that the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption of Pisa is located in Piazza dei Miracoli, which is a Unesco world heritage site that includes the famous leaning tower. Finally, we learn that the gate of Ishtar in Iraq was one of the eight gates of Babylon, built in 580BC on the orders of King Nebuchadnezzar II and dedicated to the goddess Ishtar.Many tourists at the Shenzhen park come from modest backgrounds. Some cannot afford international travel and others are forbidden to leave the country because their “citizen score” is too low. Often they are seeing representations of these monuments for the first time.The park is unrealistic to say the least: in truth the presidents on Mount Rushmore, for example, look out on to South Dakota, but at Window of the World they overlook Washington’s Capitol Building, some 1,600km away. The Shenzhen Eiffel Tower rises to a third of its real size (108m instead of 324m), but you can climb it and admire the view of the pyramids of Giza in Egypt.On the other hand, the park allows visitors an opening to a world that would otherwise be inaccessible and unknown to them.The ability to eat Mexican food while walking in the Cambodian temple of Angkor Wat is the novel offer of a park which slashes both distance and time. By the end of the visit, the landmarks are blurred: we toured the planet by jumping over continents and centuries. We come out confused.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31b01cb51a304a40d14b5a36ad4a85fb487baa05/0_122_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f78dc807c0af00b3ab286a3a6c9e4e5","title":"corbynism labour left party","story":"We can skip the first stage of grief. A result like this leaves no room for denial. Let’s move instead to the next stage: anger. We can feel a deep and bitter fury at what five more years of Boris Johnson will mean – at what his government, armed with such a mandate, will do. It will allow him to pursue a hard Brexit, to cosy up to Donald Trump and to trample on our democratic norms and judicial restraints. It will risk the union. It will allow him to ignore the poorest and most vulnerable, the children going to school hungry, to abandon the people whose lives and communities have been made thin by a lost decade of austerity and shrunken services – a decade that will now stretch, like a prison sentence, to 15 years.We can be angry at the Tories for winning this election, but we must feel an equal rage for the people who let them do it. I am speaking of those who led the main party of opposition down a blind alley that ended in Labour’s worst election performance since the 1930s – a performance that broke new records for failure. Look upon the scale of that calamity: to lose seats to a government in power for nine lean years, a government seeking a fourth term that is almost never granted, a cruel government so ided it purged two former chancellors and some of its best-known MPs, led by a documented liar and fraud. A half-functioning opposition party would have wiped the floor with this Tory party. Instead, Labour was crushed by it.The leadership’s defenders wasted no time in blaming it all on Brexit. To be sure, Brexit has convulsed our politics and made Labour’s electoral coalition perilously hard to hold together. But pause before declaring that this was the Brexit election: in fact, the NHS overtook Brexit as voters’ top concern. The trouble was, voters trusted Johnson on the NHS more than they trusted Jeremy Corbyn. You read that right.Which brings us to a core point that those culpable for this disaster would rather you didn’t contemplate. Like anyone who travelled the country and listened to voters, candidates and canvassers, I heard with my own ears the Labour voters who said they couldn’t back the party this time, not because of Brexit but because of Corbyn. Indeed, Brexit was often cited not for its own sake – little of this campaign was spent debating customs zones and trade agreements – but rather for its confirmation of their view that Corbyn was irredeemably “weak”.This problem did not wait until the election to reveal itself. The polling data was clear and voluminous on this point long before the election. Corbyn is the most unpopular opposition leader since records began. And though we may not like it, we know that voters’ assessment of the party leaders plays a huge part in their decision.Labour knew it and Corbyn knew it. Those appalling numbers were not state secrets. His admirers always describe him as a selfless, almost saintly man, devoid of ego. So why didn’t he take one look at his own ratings and say, “I am clearly a drag on this party’s prospects. Those who need a Labour government have a better chance of getting one if I step aside.” Not a chance. Corbyn’s own vanity was too great for him even to consider such an act of self-sacrifice. Instead he was encouraged by his own devoted legions of supporters, for whom the idea of a change of leader was heresy. In their mind, it was better to lose under Corbyn than to have a shot at winning with someone – anyone – else. Perhaps it was too much to ask that he make way for a candidate less sure to repel the electorate. But he made this a presidential campaign, his face everywhere, other Labour heavyweights banished from the airwaves. In their place were factionally approved nodding dogs such as Richard Burgon. Never mind that they were bound to be useless, what mattered was that they were loyal to the ruling clique. Of course, this relates not just to Corbyn but Corbynism. For the last four years, Labour has been in thrall to the notion that it’s better to have a manifesto you can feel proud of, a programme that calls itself radical, than to devise one that might have a chance of winning. Some even argued that, “win or lose”, Corbyn achieved much simply by offering a genuinely socialist plan – in contrast with Labour’s 1997 offer, which was so boringly modest and incremental.Well, guess what. Labour’s “radical” manifesto of 2019 achieved precisely nothing. Not one proposal in it will be implemented, not one pound in it will be spent. It is worthless. And if judged not by the academic standard of “expanding the discourse”, but by the hard, practical measure of improving actual people’s actual lives, those hate figures of Corbynism – Tony Blair and Gordon Brown – achieved more in four hours than Corbyn achieved in four years. Why? Because they did what it took to win power.That’s what a political party is for. It’s not a hobby it’s not a pressure group that exists to open the Overton window a little wider it’s not an association for making friends or hosting stimulating conversations and seminars it’s not “a 30-year project”. Its purpose is to win and exercise power in the here and now. It is either a plausible vehicle for government or it is nothing.That was beyond the reach of the faction ruling Labour. Not for them the electoral basics of reassurance and credibility. They came up with a manifesto more stuffed with giveaways than Santa’s grotto, and about as believable. The voter who quite liked the extra sugar in their tea represented by, say, free tuition fees, gagged when the sweetener of discounted rail fares, Waspi compensation, free broadband and a promised £6,700 a year to every family were all spooned into the cup.Labour’s ruling elite forgot that parties of the left are held to a higher standard than those committed to the status quo: to change people’s lives and spend their money, first you must win their trust. That obligation is even spelled out in Labour’s constitution, which insists that “Labour seeks the trust of the people to govern.” Instead, the leadership clique dragged around their 1970s baggage and arcane ideological obsessions – the antisemitism arose not by accident, but as the inevitable outgrowth of a strain of left conspiracist thinking – that marked them out as cranks, unfit to run the country.To warn of this danger and sound the alarm was to be instantly howled down as a Blairite, a centrist, a red Tory. On social media, a group of outriders policed the conversation, unleashing a pile-on of mockery and denunciation on anyone guilty of pointing out that the emperor seemed to be unnervingly lacking in clothes. (Then they affected surprise when those they’d told to “fuck off and join the Tories” didn’t come running to help.)The tragedy of this is measured in the idealistic young volunteers who signed up for a new and necessary movement in 2015, but whose faith was abused by a clique of hard-left sectarian dinosaurs – and, most important, it is measured in the millions who needed a social democratic government and now won’t get one.The question now is, how long will it take to draw the obvious conclusion? You might have thought that the experience of the 1980s – four defeats in a row, followed by a march towards electability – had been education enough. We’d seen this movie before but, it seems, we needed to see it all over again.We’ll have a clue whether it’ll take a fifth – or sixth – defeat for the penny to drop when Labour selects a new leader. Will it look for someone who ticks all the ideological boxes, who’s as sound and “radical” as Corbyn, or will it look for someone who can win?Underneath that is a larger question: are you in politics to control the Labour party, or to win power? If the honest answer is the former, then get out of the way. Go back to your student unions and your pub meetings and give Labour back to those who seek the power of government – and are fit to wield it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef76e11b0534fc69e328677e9ac997debf9e35cf/0_4_4407_2644/master/4407.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17f0a757a63f23e77f284304d428ac71","title":"election 2019 panel results mean for them","story":"Johnson’s thumping victory means a reconfiguration of the political landscape throughout the union and British societyThere are no good Brexit outcomes for Ireland, north or south. This election was about degrees of damage. The UK’s formal rupture with the EU, which Boris Johnson can now declare in triumph by 31 January, is a travesty for Ireland more destabilising than for any other EU country. Brexit will put Ireland and Northern Ireland on different sides of Europe’s external border. This uncoupling puts at risk the economic integration that underpins Ireland’s fragile peace, a peace made possible by simultaneous UK and Irish EU membership.The size of Johnson’s thumping majority, though, is paradoxically the least worst outcome. His EU withdrawal deal (which can now clear the Commons easily) commits the UK to an orderly exit and removes the threat of a hard land border. The DUP’s baleful influence over the shape of Brexit is gone, their deputy leader Nigel Dodds humiliatingly lost his seat to Sinn Féin. No wonder Taoiseach Leo Varadkar spoke of the tectonic plates shifting: for the first time Northern Ireland elected more nationalists than unionist MPs.Johnson’s fudged withdrawal deal stores up future headaches though. A new Irish Sea border will have to be designed with checks on most goods shipped between Northern Ireland and Britain. For many unionists this is betrayal: an “economic united Ireland”, which – along with eventual Scottish independence – could hasten Sinn Féin’s dream of an end to Irish partition. And even if you welcome Irish unity, a botched form of it that leaves loyalists nursing a fresh historic grievance is a terrifying prospect.EU membership helped secure the Good Friday agreement and allowed Ireland and the UK to become equal partners, sharing sovereignty around the European table. It helped to heal the pain of a 30-year conflict that claimed 3,500 lives. The Brexiteers’ reckless disregard for the consequences of their crusade is a cause of justifiable bafflement and sadness right across Ireland.If Johnson cares a jot about Ireland he should pivot to the softest possible form of Brexit, to full UK access to the EU single market and customs union, even if he doesn’t call it that. He no longer has to listen to the ERG or the DUP.The altered political landscape in Northern Ireland should also create a positive impetus for all parties to revive the devolved Stormont assembly, which disgracefully has not sat for nearly three years.The search for a hopeful future from this mess begins perhaps with the knowledge that half of people in Northern Ireland no longer identify as either unionist or nationalist.When the result of an election will mean bad things for so many, there’s no putting a gloss on it. There is no real celebration in loss, but it means resistance is necessary. And it’ll be young people at the forefront of that. The evidence we have suggests there’s a big generational ide. Put simply, working-age adults are more likely to have voted Labour, while retired people went Tory. The engine of the Labour party campaign was young people, flanked as ever by their older counterparts. They were out in the streets this election, enthusiastically advocating for public ownership, a green new deal, social housing and a fundamental rewiring of how our deeply unequal economy functions. Whatever happens next, one thing is sure: sustaining and building that movement will be essential.Brexit has often been talked about as fundamental to the future of this country – how do we want our relationships with the EU to look, and what kind of country do we want to live in. But what has so often been eclipsed is the life-chances of millions of children in the UK that will continue to be made worse in myriad ways by Conservative policies. Minute-by-minute dissections of Brexit will continue even as child poverty continues to rise, inequality grows and the climate crisis worsens. Based on recent history and the sharp rightward turn of the Conservative party under Johnson’s leadership, superficial change and meaningless soundbites are all that is likely in response.Still, there are people all around us who will resist the oncoming onslaught. A few months ago, standing in the middle of Westminster, I was surrounded by some of the people who will be part of that change. Thousands upon thousands of 15-, 16- and 17-year-olds led the way protesting against the lack of action to fight the climate crisis. Cutting through the noise of UK politics to pinpoint this is the most pressing issue young people face. That is the future – one that can’t come soon enough.• Maya Goodfellow is a writer and academic, and the author of Hostile Environment: How Immigrants Became Scapegoats“Get Brexit sorted” has always been a fantasy. But even if this government could snap its fingers and magically unslip all our entanglements with Europe at the end of January, the Conservatives have made it very clear that their version of “getting on with it” doesn’t include climate action.The party has always tried to have it both ways with climate policy. The Tories signed up en masse for the world-leading Climate Change Act 2008, which created a roadmap and targets for our future contributions but have consistently undermined, underfunded, or straight-up undone the actual policy commitments that would deliver them. The green development bank and the zero-carbon homes initiative were buried under Conservative watch.This tendency degenerated further over the election campaign. The manifesto mentioned climate more than any previous election, but was lightweight compared to the monumental efforts promised by Labour and the Liberal Democrats. And Boris Johnson not only skipped the climate debates, he turned it into a circus by sending Michael Gove in his stead. The future of climate policy in this country will likely track with the general rightward shift of the Conservative party – as bad or worse than before, but with more show-stopping stunts. We are currently expected to surpass our next two carbon budgets, and the party has not indicated it has any policies that would get us back on track.One thing we can be sure of: Johnson will deliver some kind of Brexit, and soon. That is the only mandate he asked for, and he got it. The UK has been a strong voice and leader on climate negotiation and action through the EU, and that is set to end. Much is still unclear around how the government plans to alter or replace climate policies and schemes that are currently synched up with the EU – this includes our Paris agreement commitments, which at the moment are part of the larger EU contribution.Johnson’s vision of all future negotiations is one in which the UK is free to manoeuvre as it wishes, free of the slow, creaking, EU behemoth, and yet somehow still retain much of its power and heft. In climate negotiations, as with everything else, we were a powerful voice within a much more powerful bloc. It is not a good sign that, buried deep within the leaked UK-US trade documents that set off the furore about NHS privatisation during the campaign, was a bullying ultimatum from the American side: climate change would not be discussed or referenced in any future trade deal.• Stephen Buranyi is a writer specialising in science and the environmentAnd so it is, as Boris Johnson was clear in saying that we have treated the UK like our own country for too long. All this after more than three years of life in limbo after being called queue-jumpers and being forced to apply to stay after being disenfranchised again and again. Our voices, our stories, irrelevant yet again.But there is some nuance – EU citizens in Scotland frequently say they still feel welcome and supported.At the very least, Johnson’s victory is likely to offer a degree of certainty that we have not known since 2016. Leaving the EU with a withdrawal agreement will provide some safeguards for the first time – although many questions about implementation and future developments remain.And that will not salve the feeling of loss that hangs over us. It seems almost like a homelessness of the soul a rapture in the love for this country that many of us have felt for decades. The EU referendum and all that has followed has transformed us from integrated neighbours, colleagues, friends and family to “others” who do not belong. How we are meant to come back from this?Johnson has a duty to treat us with respect and to ensure rights are protected in the way he promised in 2016. As prime minister, he has a duty to represent all residents of the UK. That includes us. This is our home.• Tanja Bueltmann is a professor of history at Northumbria University. She is an EU national whose work focuses on diaspora and migration historyThere is no solace, no silver lining, no “yes, but ... ” Today’s election result says many things about where the country is, most of them complicated and not reducible to simple binaries. Except, that is, when it comes to what it entails for minorities. As the implications of the vote begin to become clear over the next few days, months and years, we might find ourselves in a position where in hindsight, it wasn’t an augur of inevitable tragedy, that it said less about ideology, and more about the alchemy of this specific election.But make no mistake. Right now the Conservative victory sends one clear message. Voters saw a party that has made ethno-nationalism, anti-immigration and Islamophobia its calling cards, and endorsed it. Dog-whistles that previously were heard on the streets will now become government policy. The country, already less safe for minorities and immigrants in general and Muslims in particular since the Brexit vote, will become one large hostile environment for anyone this rightwing government is happy to marginalise.Those who voted Conservative at best looked away from the party’s racist policies, at worst demanded them. This is an uncomfortable fact that hangs over millions of voters, so it is understandable that many think the allegation is wild. But the truth is simply that the problem is so huge that the first response to it being pointed out is denial. There are now promises that must be delivered by a government that were simply xenophobia under the guise of Brexit delivery. Ending freedom of movement, withdrawing rights from people who for too long “have treated this country like their own”, narrowing the definition of a British citizen. Tory Islamophobia, always at heart a proxy for dislike of a certain type of brown Briton, and a frustration with non-EU immigration as a whole, will thrive.And then there is Boris Johnson, a man who from behind the masks of plain speaking one moment and jesting the next, will give sanction to the wounding ways in which we will address and attack each other. Letterboxes, bank robbers, piccaninnies with watermelon smiles and bum boys brace yourselves, it’s about to get a whole lot worse.• Nesrine Malik is a  columnist and the author of We Need New Stories: Challenging the Toxic Myths Behind Our Age of DiscontentNo one saw this coming. Senior SNP politicians were hoping for a handful of extra seats. Nothing on the ground or in the media suggested the astonishing transformation of SNP fortunes that lay ahead, with swings from Labour and the Conservatives boosting the party’s tally from 35 to 48 seats. So, what happened?Critics said her #indyref2020 slogan would prove to be a gift for the Scottish Conservatives, whose Brexit- and Johnson-free campaign north of the border focused solely on opposition to a second independence vote. The campaign was explicit – its rejection by Scottish voters equally so. The Scottish Tory MP contingent was halved.Britain now has a tale of two mandates. Before Christmas, Nicola Sturgeon will seek some kind of Northern Ireland-style deal for remain-voting Scotland, and will ask Johnson to devolve referendum powers from Westminster to the Scottish parliament. There will be no “asking permission” but instead a search for agreement. Of course, the Tory leader has already said no. But he is a gambler and a realist.Ruth Davidson was the darling of the Tory party. She has now quit party politics. Her 13 Scots MPs were a vital part of Theresa May’s slim majority. They are now irrelevant. Voting patterns in Scotland demonstrate an enduring and entrenched opposition to any type of Conservative government. Without the Scots, the Tories would have an inbuilt English majority. The opinion polls in Scotland don’t yet reveal a sizeable majority for independence. But that’s likely to change if Britain withdraws from the EU on 31 January and embarks on a turbulent and uncertain year of trade negotiations.So, is there a strong electoral reason for Johnson to fear a second independence referendum in 2020?• Lesley Riddoch is a writer, journalist, campaigner and broadcasterWhile the election results in Scotland and Northern Ireland tell a straightforward tale of unionist collapse, the picture in Wales was much more mixed. There was no nationalist surge, but neither did Wales entirely lose its electoral distinctiveness.A north-south ide developed as the night went on. In the north of Wales the Conservatives seemed to sweep all before them, winning all but one Labour seat – Alyn and Deeside, which Labour kept hold of by only 213 votes. The Conservatives were far less successful in the south, however, only picking up Bridgend. They did not even come close in their target seats of Gower and Cardiff North, and fell short in Newport West too. Here, the Welsh Labour brand still had purchase.Somewhat ironically for an election so focused on Westminster, perhaps we can look to devolution as part of the cause of this difference. Professor Richard Wyn Jones of Cardiff University made the point on S4C in the small hours that Labour’s mishandling of the NHS in the north of Wales – where the health board is in special measures – could be the culprit. I would add to that a growing estrangement with the Welsh government in general, which is considered to favour the south of Wales over the north.Despite not making any gains, members of the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru will be generally happy with their performance, as they had been sweating over two marginal seats, which they returned with much improved majorities this time. There is a general acceptance that they, like the SNP, will not be able to prove their relevance at a Westminster level until they are able to realign the debate around the question of Welsh independence.• Ifan Morgan Jones is a lecturer in journalism in Bangor University’s Department of Creative Studies and Media"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87baf14000ab40cbf351715b6b805c3d63a1c8df/0_272_5450_3272/master/5450.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=876bb4c201cc30a489380f68da1ce587","title":"the guardian view on the 2019 election result a new political landscape","story":"Boris Johnson has redrawn the map and Labour and the Lib Dems are in disarray. Brexit will pass and Scottish independence will move to the centre of the stageFacts are sacred. So any response to the 2019 general election must start with the fact that Boris Johnson’s Conservative party is its undisputed victor. With 365 seats, up 48 on the last parliament, the Tories have a majority of 80. This allows Mr Johnson to govern for a full term with a working majority, something the Conservatives have not achieved for 32 years. It is a party triumph, because the Tories have recovered their claim to be Britain’s most enduring governing force. It is also a personal triumph for Mr Johnson, who sensed the opportunity and seized it with enormous effect.Yet Mr Johnson now has a mandate to complete the business of the 2016 referendum and to take Britain out of the EU. He has fought and won that battle. But he has not yet won the battle on the terms under which the UK will trade with the EU. On this, he has neither defined his goal nor negotiated a deal to reach it. It is hard to believe he will do so, as promised, within 12 months. This is too important an issue to be imprisoned by a timetable. Mr Johnson should accept a delay if necessary. He now has the authority to defy any objectors within his party.This is all the more important because the Liberal Democrats will not lead an alternative. Jo Swinson’s party had its chance and blew it. Its share of the vote went up more than the other UK-wide parties. But Ms Swinson fought a flawed campaign and lost her seat. The question facing all those to the left of the Tory party is whether they can or wish to find common ground and cooperate. If they do not, and especially if Mr Johnson changes the voting rules and boundaries, this 2019 result could be the shape of things to come.The prime minister implied on Friday that he understands the transformed political landscape. Reiterated commitments on NHS investment, on more teachers and police, and on carbon emissions, may mean he grasps that the Tory electorate changed radically this week, and that public spending is key to retaining it. The one-nation and healing rhetoric may herald a new kind of Toryism. Yet such populism also opens the way for attacks on judges, human rights and the BBC. Where migrants fit in the one nation of which Mr Johnson spoke remains to be seen. Strikingly, the nation he invoked was one that stretched from Woking to Workington, not from Woking to Wick or Warrenpoint. Mr Johnson has won a great victory. But his problems are only just beginning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/530c12c49df3b812dd80f118d5cb4b5837830e72/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbfef70c0d9ac6725cc91c2840146ec7","title":"labour meltdown decades govern votes","story":"The party has no God-given right to expect votes, let alone to govern. It needs to renew its contract with its baseOn the really painful days in politics, most commentary isn’t worth the name. It’s not analysis, it’s score-settling party political broadcasts for the I-told-you-so brigade, rushed out by people who won’t admit to ever getting a single thing wrong themselves.So it will go this weekend. You’ll read that Labour’s wipeout was only down to Brexit, by those who won’t admit a flaw in Jeremy Corbyn and his noodling mess of a campaign. Or that it was all the Labour leader’s fault, said by remainers who have seen the position they urged on him blown to bits. It was both, of course. Ask voters in those seats that have just gone blue for the first time since the 1930s, or the Labour would-bes who tried canvassing them. If you want to play election Cluedo, then Corbyn and Brexit go together like Colonel Mustard with the candlestick. But when a party descends into civil war, the factions at each others’ throats rarely bother looking up at the rest of the country.To clear the decks, here’s my confession. I never foresaw the scale of this wipeout – and what it spells for our already failing economy, fractured society and battered democracy frankly scares me. Yet the reporting I’ve done – both in this election and before – made me almost sure Labour was going to lose, and in precisely those areas that are all over the front pages. What were called its heartlands, at least until Thursday night. The Bolsovers, the Bishop Aucklands. The un-metropolitan, unfashionable, never-kissed-a-Tory land that would, as the old saw goes, elect a donkey if it wore a red rosette.And I can say with certainty that this week’s meltdown is the culmination of trends that stretch back decades. They were Corbyn’s poisoned inheritance, not his creation – but any leader who wants to win back those seats will have to deal with them better than he managed.For decades, their party took much of the north, the Midlands and Wales as its birthright. It was the “red wall” that would repel invading Tory forces. As one Labour county councillor in Derbyshire, the region that lost Dennis Skinner as an MP on Thursday night, told me: “They barely bothered to campaign.” While the party bigwigs threw their weight about, the mines and the manufacturers, the steel and the shipbuilding were snuffed out. With them went the culture of Labourism: the bolshy union stewards, the self-organised societies, most of the local newspapers. Practically any institution that might incubate a working-class provincial political identity was bulldozed.In North East Derbyshire last month, I saw up close what was left: warehouses and care work. Bullying bosses, zero-hours contracts, poverty pay and social security top-ups. Smartphones to tell you whether you have a shift that morning, and Facebook to give you the news, or some dishonest fragment of it. Across the UK, mines were turned into museums, factories swapped for call centres, meaningful local government replaced by development quangos.And what was Labour’s response? Tony Blair and Gordon Brown pretended some new skills-based economy lay around the corner and parachuted their own chosen people into these safe seats. Thinktankers, union HQ bureaucrats, ex-student politicians: all found careers and weekend homes for themselves.David Miliband swung from the Institute for Public Policy Research to Blair’s office to MP for South Shields, – which, as a longstanding Labour parliamentarian told me yesterday morning, “he couldn’t even find on a map”. Last week Miliband claimed on Twitter: “The biggest Labour challenge is not the angst of the middle class … it is the disbelief of the working class.” This tribune of the Tyneside proletariat now works 3,000 miles away at a New York-based charity that in 2017 reportedly paid him £680,000.What did such smooth-cheeked careerists offer their constituents? Head pats about the “white working class” and their “legitimate concerns”. Never mind that the working class might also be brown.Even as the working class were marginalised politically and destroyed economically, New Labour patronised them into apathy. As the Oxford political scientists James Tilley and Geoffrey Evans argue, the “decline of class-based voting was driven by Labour’s shift to the political centre ground”. Meanwhile, the big gap in the electoral market that opened up was for a party offering a welfare state with reactionary social policy. That was Nigel Farage now it’s Boris Johnson. What won on Thursday night wasn’t Conservatism: it was Faragism. The Tories’ key personnel come from Vote Leave and, just as in that campaign, are happy to play with racism. Some in Labour might well think they can win back seats by beating up on immigrants and tacking to the right: Johnson’s party can do both with far more gusto.Corbynism began with promises of democracy, but ended up as bunkerised as all other Labour leaderships. What started as anti-austerity movement is now a melange of ideas, most of which look and sound utterly absurd on a doorstep on a rainy morning.In the era of taking back control, Corbyn offered yet more direction from Westminster, with utilities run from the centre and hundreds of billions disbursed from remote state institutions. Many of these ideas are interesting, but few of them were properly worked through and none patiently argued for.Giving workers stakes in firms, a green new deal, free broadband: each one came well-intentioned but bedecked in question marks. Any radicalism that fails to ask the really thorny questions isn’t radical at all. In Britain in 2019, those include: against rampant inequality and climate change, what’s the economy for? What do the public actually want from politics and economics?In the 2017 election I wrote that a party that grew out of social institutions needed to turn itself into a social institution in precisely those areas it historically took for granted. That remains the key task: providing advice to those whose benefits are being slashed, legal support to tenants under the cosh from their landlords, haggling with the utilities to provide cheaper and better deals. Add to that: teaching political and economic literacy to voters, not just activists, and consulting constituents on what issues Labour should be battling on.None of this is as easy as getting the woman with the great backstory to run No 11, or some GCSE marketing talk about finding new “narratives”. It’s hard graft, and it won’t make good copy. But Labour has no God-given right to expect votes, let alone to govern. It needs to renew its contract with its base. The big question is whether it wants to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4321b70768f172c6e4aa2f803106febaa44722d3/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3da9dd2dc596cae37bcab0f8ba20a67","title":"culture to make you feel less terrible about the uk election","story":"You may be distraught at the result, or just want a break from politics – so find solace in our critics’ pick of 30 films, songs, books and more to hide under a duvet withBlades of Glory Will Ferrell and Jon Heder enjoyed their finest hours in this comedy as egotistical ice-skaters barred from the sport after a disgraceful display of bad temper.

Eddie Murphy plays street-smart Detroit cop Axel Foley, who shows up in Beverly Hills on a mission to solve a murder. Murphy’s wheezing laugh in the face of LA’s myriad absurdities is something we need right now.Robyn – Dancing On My Own The best pop song of the last 20 years, not least because it’s blessed with a chorus that somehow manages to be despairing and dizzyingly uplifting at the same time, its overall message – everything may seem ruined, but you have to keep on regardless – perfectly suits current events.Chic – Good Times Good Times starts with an eye-roll at the awfulness of everything – “happy days,” it offers ironically, “are here again” – then suggests you get wasted and go dancing: a short-term solution, but if the bassline doesn’t lift your gloom at least a little, you’re probably past the point where music can help you.Nina Simone – O-o-h Child Any version of O-o-h Child will do – it’s the musical equivalent of a comforting arm around your shoulder – but Nina Simone’s just edges it: the hint of weary hard-won experience in her voice makes its message more potent. And as a bonus, it’s on the same album as her cover of Here Comes the Sun, which has the same effect.MIA – Paper Planes It doubtless wasn’t intended as head-under-the-duvet comfort-eating music, but Paper Planes works perfectly in that context: you get the melancholy of the sample from the Clash’s Straight to Hell and the invigorating screw-you defiance of the lyric: “Already going to hell, just pumping on the gas, no one on the corner has swagger like us.”The The – This Is the Day This song is dual-purpose. If you want to be uplifted, then the contrast between the verses and the chorus – “your life will surely change … things fall into place” – will do it. If you want to wallow in your misery, then assume said chorus is intended sarcastically and the song is saying everything is terrible and likely to stay that way.Strictly Come Dancing final (Saturday, 7.05pm, BBC One) Dust off your nattiest sequin number and settle in for the Strictly final, to find out whether Emma, Kelvin or Karim will hold high the Glitterball trophy. And if you need a pick-me-up before then, rewatch Karim and Amy’s quarter-final jive on loop. The mood outside may be frightful, but the dancefloor will surely be delightful.Tiffany Haddish: Black Mitzvah (Netflix) “People think they know everything about me … well, here’s something they probably don’t know!” So begins the first solo Netflix special by the Girls Trip star. Ostensibly about the comic’s discovery that she is part Jewish, it soon morphs into a belated version of the bat mitzvah tradition it takes its title from. Haddish celebrates her own ascent from foster care to hanging out with Beyoncé, and the result is both anarchic and relatable.The Repair Shop (BBC iPlayer) The perfect antidote to use-it-and-chuck-it culture, this heartwarming balm of a show sees a team of craft experts bring people’s treasures back to life, from toys to jewellery, a homemade gramophone to a tippling stick (that is, a walking stick with space for a tot of whisky or three). Deeply moving without being saccharine, it might leave you crying like a baby – but at least they’ll be tears of joy.The Marvellous Mrs Maisel (Amazon Prime Video) To put some pep in your step look no further than Mrs Maisel, the 1960s Jewish housewife turned foul-mouthed standup supremo known for getting dragged off stage by police for her criminally obscene jokes. Now in its third season, Mrs Maisel is out on the road for her first tour, a whirlwind of Las Vegas hot spots and sexual tension with her idol, the even more obscene comic Lenny Bruce. It’s silly, perky and gag-heavy – all in all a fine distraction.Freaks and Geeks (All4) If anything can get you through dark days it’s this cult teen comedy by Judd Apatow about the rebels, mathletes, Dungeons and Dragons lovers and hermaphrodite tuba players of William McKinley High School in 1980. It kickstarted the careers of everyone from Apatow and Paul Feig to Seth Rogen and Linda Cardellini, it’s a work of genius from start to finish and all 18 episodes are available on All4 now.Queenie by Candice Carty-Williams Queenie, a 25-year-old Londoner who is getting over the end of a long relationship while struggling to make an impression as a journalist, is also coming to terms with a traumatic past in this smart, insightful and funny novel.

She painstakingly bred 240 mice in captivity and in 2004 released the elusive mammals on to a coastal nature reserve with plenty of reedbeds for them to hide in.When not a single harvest mouse – Britain’s smallest rodent – was recaptured in subsequent trap surveys, Fail concluded that her efforts to reintroduce them had been unsuccessful.Now, 15 years later, fresh harvest mouse nests have been found for the first time at East Chevington nature reserve, showing that the descendants of Fail’s original harvest mice are in fact thriving.A team of volunteers found two distinctive, orb-shaped nests in dense reedbeds close to where Fail had originally released them. Sophie Webster, of Northumberland Wildlife Trust, who led the search, said: “It was really exciting for everybody. It’s such a big area to search we doubted we would actually find them so it was a real treat.”The nests were woven into grasses a metre (3ft) above ground and contained green leaves showing they were freshly made. Webster is planning a more extensive search of the wider reedbeds, with camera traps and live mammal trapping to see if they can calculate the population.Fail, who now works in outdoor education, was contacted by one of her original team members with the news. “To say I’m ecstatic with this positive result is an understatement,” said Fail. “I’m proud that my work, along with the support of volunteers and experts, has managed to secure the survival of one of Britain’s declining species.”She also emailed her old PhD supervisor. “I told him, ‘This is the email I always wanted to send you’ and he replied, ‘Bloody hell, it worked!’ He was as surprised as I was.”A priority species for conservation and protected by law, the harvest mouse is the weight of 10p piece and is Britain’s only mammal with a prehensile tail, which it uses for grip and balance as it lives in the stalk zone of tall plants.Preyed upon by barn owls, cats and even pheasants, the mouse also suffers in cold, wet weather. Historically, it is more common in southern and eastern England than in the north. It is rarely found north of the Tyne, although recent surveys have discovered it on several sites in County Durham.Fail’s original studies found harvest mice were vulnerable to being predated by wood mice when they were first released and so the 240 captive-bred harvest mice were first released into secure cages to acclimatise.The mice were released incrementally into the wild over the course of eight weeks to avoid saturating the site or endangering all the mice at once.Follow-up survey work using specially adapted traps, which capture small mammals without hurting them, caught plenty of wood mice, shrews and even an angry weasel, but failed to find any trace of harvest mice, despite successfully catching them in trials.Fail said she hoped her phased return methodology could be potentially used to help other reintroduction projects, now it had been shown to be successful.She added: “I’m not saying we’ve changed the world but I hope that what we’ve done gives other people faith and hope that it is possible to conserve a much-loved species with a bit of hard work and dedication.”Mike Pratt, chief executive of Northumberland Wildlife Trust, said: “We’re really pleased and encouraged that in these days when we think we know everything about everything because we’ve got so much data, we can still find something that we didn’t know was there. We know wildlife is suffering terrible declines so this is refreshing to say the least.”Last year, Northumberland also witnessed the return of the pine marten in the wild for the first time in 90 years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96545f22217ecf75ceb2365071b9e42d35791374/0_114_3432_2059/master/3432.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cc1699e14c0e7800095bbe5f40d2aec","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"The pick of the best flora and fauna photos from around the world, from an illuminated giraffe to an elusive southern elephant seal"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b892a2c91fb63847f671ea59cd9ccfaaaa63b4cb/59_0_1187_712/master/1187.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3a8abebaa9a1e6fa5bc1a9f728651a1","title":"richard jewell kathy scruggs olivia wilde irresponsible","story":"The controversy swirling around an unverified claim of a journalist having sex with an FBI agent in Clint Eastwood’s new movie has led to a string of unconvincing justificationsThe ongoing furore over Clint Eastwood’s Oscar-hungry new drama Richard Jewell shows no signs of abating, partly because the contentious issue at its centre is so egregious and partly because no one involved with the film is willing to admit this.The film purports to tell the “true” story of the heroic security guard who found the pipe bomb which killed one person and injured 111 others at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. He was heralded as a hero until he became the focus of the FBI investigation, a fact that was first made public in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution before getting picked up across the country. Jewell was ultimately cleared after a difficult 88 days of accusations and media focus.Since its premiere last month, one particular scene has sparked controversy, an interaction alleging sex-for-tips between Kathy Scruggs, the AJC journalist who broke the story – and played in the film by Olivia Wilde as a vampish femme fatale – and an FBI agent, an amalgamation of characters played by Jon Hamm. It’s an unverified claim according to her colleagues, friends and family as well as Kent Alexander and Kevin Salwen, the authors of The Suspect, the book that served as a basis for the film and which involved over 180 interviews in research. In a firmly worded statement this week Alexander and Salwen stated that they found no evidence of sex-for-tips ever having taken place. Scruggs herself died in 2001.Those who knew and worked with Scruggs have expressed their anger. The AJC has threatened legal action against Warner Bros, and female journalists have shared their frustration with both the sullying of a respected and hard-working professional and also the recycling of a tired stereotype of reporters sleeping with sources for intel. Warners and Eastwood stood their ground, turning the tables on the paper, blaming them again for reckless journalism but not explaining the origin of the scene itself. And at the Gotham Awards last week, Wilde claimed it was sexist for critics to call out the scene and was a misunderstanding of feminism.This week, as the film is released in cinemas, the backlash has increased, from a reported feature I wrote to others from the New York Times to the Washington Post. As a result a new round of statements have emerged from those involved, but rather than providing any substantial proof or apologising, they have only added to the controversy.Hamm believes the complaints are coming from people who simply hadn’t seen the film and that it wasn’t fair for anyone to reduce the character of Scruggs to this one scene, echoing Wilde’s words. First, this isn’t true with a large percentage of reviews revealing unease over the scene and second, the only people reducing the character to this are those involved in the film.Scruggs was referred to as a “dedicated reporter” known for her bawdy humour and larger-than-life character in The Suspect, but is portrayed on screen as an unprofessional and highly sexed cipher, slithering up to an FBI agent, pushing her hand up his thigh and debating whether to have sex in a hotel room or a car.Screenwriter Billy Ray, who initially told me he would “reserve comment” has now opened up, attacking the AJC for “a distraction campaign” by focusing on one minute of a two-hour-plus movie. “The movie isn’t about Kathy Scruggs it’s about the heroism and hounding of Richard Jewell, and what rushed reporting can do to an innocent man,” he told Hollywood news site Deadline. “And by the way, I will stand by every word and assertion in the script.” He also takes credit for “the redeeming of Kathy Scruggs” as in the film, she realises her mistake despite never “publicly atoning” in real life.In the same piece, Deadline confirms what we already knew, and what those who knew her have said and what the two men who wrote the exhaustive book about Richard Jewell have stated: there’s no evidence she traded sex for information. Deadline’s editorial director Anthony D’Alessandro tracked down a deposition referred to in The Suspect where Scruggs revealed that she had a relationship with a member of the Atlanta police department, not the FBI, and it had ended two years before the Olympics. Jewell’s lawyer has since referred to it as “a damning and unprovable claim”.Jewell tried to sue the AJC along with a host of more powerful news sources for libel. While the others settled out of court, the AJC stood firm and ultimately a court ruled in their favour as their sourcing and reporting was deemed “substantially true at the time they were published”. Alexander and Salwen, an attorney and journalist respectively, agreed, calling Scruggs’s work “very well-checked”. Scruggs didn’t need to publicly atone for her reporting, a judge decided this, and it’s not up to a screenwriter to decide that she should.Soon after came a new statement from Wilde parsed out in a nine-tweet thread. While more considered and less defensive than her initial response, her explanation remains uneasy. She calls the character of Scruggs “bold, smart, and fearlessly undeterred” while noting the sexism she must have faced at the time. Fine.But then: “Contrary to a swathe of recent headlines, I do not believe that Kathy ‘traded sex for tips’. Nothing in my research suggested she did so, and it was never my intention to suggest she had. That would be an appalling and misogynistic dismissal of the difficult work she did.”She claims that the “fictional dramatisation” of events implied that Scruggs was in a “pre-existing romantic relationship” with the FBI agent who leaked “false information” and it wasn’t a “transactional exchange for information”. She adds that her opinions are based on her “own independent research”.The scene in question does not contain any of the nuance and depth Wilde seems to think it does. Whether or not that’s how she’s now claiming to see it, the interaction plays as a strict sex-for-tips arrangement – Hamm’s character even asks, “What makes you think you can fuck it out of me?” while the original script had him remarking on her “tits-ablaze blouse”. Even without this scene, the character of Scruggs is portrayed as an unprofessional one-note floozy who expresses ruthless, inhumane ambition after the bombing, and is one of the clear villains of the piece. It’s one of the most regressive portrayals of a female character I can remember in a film of this scale. Wilde has built a career hinged on the importance of feminism, wearing a “Feminist AF” T-shirt, claiming to raise her son as “a little feminist” and spending the year promoting her directorial debut, the female-fronted, sex-positive teen comedy Booksmart. Just this week she welcomed “the era of sisterhood” in a speech. Both her and Ray have dug deeper holes at a time when they should have been trying to dig their way out. Eastwood’s politics have long been murky and with age, they’ve become more prominent in his work, from the jingoistic Islamophobia of American Sniper to the lazy racism of The Mule, and signing on to one of his films is an acceptance of this fact. The responses from him, Ray and Warners are based on their fury over the unfair treatment of Jewell whose story is brought to the screen for maximum sympathy. But using this as a cover to denigrate a dead woman as well as push a damaging myth about female journalists, one that’s predictably been reinforced since on Fox News, is irresponsible. Let’s hope one day someone makes a movie called Kathy Scruggs and has the same determination to get her story straight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d0780c23ba3637c4507307e47dc42450438fee6/0_409_3840_2302/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a87d2f6a05d9622cf3de8c9b1c1fe18e","title":"christmas recipes alternatives mulled wine cinnamon spritz mulled cider sherry cobbler winter sangria","story":"From a warming cava spritz to a port and cranberry sangria, festive party tipples that can be prepped in advanceIf you’re throwing a Christmas party, mulled wine has one thing going for it: you can make up a big batch and leave it for your guests to help themselves – no fuss for the host. But if by mid-December, you can’t face another glass of what is all too often sickly-sweet, tooth-coating stuff – let alone the thought of offering it to your nearest and dearest – here are four alternatives for festive party tipples that can be prepped in advance. Many draw on a long tradition of party punches and festive drinks that deserve to get more of a showing at this time of year.For the spiced apple puree6 large tangy eating apples1 tsp ground cinnamonCaster sugar, to taste1 vanilla pod, split lengthwaysMake the spiced apple puree in advance: core and peel the apples, then cut into quarters. Put into a large pan, add enough water just to cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until soft. Strain off the water and put the softened fruit in a food processor with the cinnamon (or use a stick blender).Blend smooth, adding just as much sugar as you need to match your taste. Scrape in the vanilla seeds to round out the sweet flavours, then cover and chill until needed. The puree keeps for a week in the fridge, and will make more than 20 servings, but it’s great on porridge or stirred through yoghurt, too.On the night of the party, prepare your glasses: for each guest, spoon a heaped teaspoon of apple puree into the bottom of a champagne flute or small wine glass. Add a dash of cava to wet the inside of each glass and swirl it around to mix it with the puree.As your guests arrive, hand them a glass topped up with chilled cava and garnished with an apple crisp. To introduce even more festive warmth, add a 20ml shot of bourbon to each glass before you add the cava.Not just for trifles (or grannies), sherry is a fortified wine that forms the basis of some of the oldest known cocktails, with recipes dating back to 1820. This version is made with amontillado and fresh fruit, served over ice. Because it’s not fashionable, you can get good sherry at great prices, making it ideal for catering for a big group.500g caster sugar2 litres amontillado sherry4 oranges, cut into 1cm-thick slicesTo serve2 big bags of ice cubes or 1 bag of crushed iceA few punnets of blackberries and blueberries 1 big bunch fresh mint The day before, make a simple syrup: take a litre measuring jug, fill it halfway with caster sugar (ie, 500g, give or take), then fill nearly to the top with boiling water. Stir to dissolve, leave to cool, then refrigerate. (You almost certainly won’t need all the syrup, but it keeps well and can be used in all sorts of cocktails.)The proportions for the cobbler are simple, so it’s easy to scale up or down. One serving  100ml amontillado + 20ml sugar syrup (or a 5:1 ratio of sherry to syrup, if you prefer). So, for 20 guests, combine two litres of sherry with 200ml syrup in a serving pitcher, then add the orange slices.If you have ice cubes, crush them by wrapping one bag at a time in a tea towel and bashing it with a rolling pin (excellent post-Christmas shopping stress relief).To serve, set the jug of cobbler, a bowl of crushed ice, highball glasses, the berries and the mint out on a table. All you or your guests have to do is fill a glass with crushed ice, top up with the cobbler and garnish with berries and a sprig of mint.Warming, Christmassy spices work so much better with sharp, mouth-smacking cider than with wine, and the result is less alcoholic, too – ideal for anyone pacing themselves over the long party season.Zest and juice of 2 lemons, peeled carefully in wide strips, with a potato peeler to leave as much of the white pith behind as possible3 clementines, peeled2 cinnamon sticks6 cloves2 star anise2 cardamom pods, lightly crushed with the flat of a large knife2 vanilla pods, split lengthways50g fresh ginger, finely chopped4 litres good, dry cider500g dark brown sugar, or less, to tasteIn a heavy-based frying pan over a very low heat, toast the lemon peel, clementine peel (keep the fruit for later), cinnamon, cloves, star anise, cardamom, vanilla and ginger for around 10 minutes, constantly moving everything around in the pan so nothing can catch and burn. Once the aromas of the spices start to fill the air, tip into a bowl and set aside.Pour the cider into a large saucepan for which you have a lid. Cut up the clementine flesh and add to the cider with the lemon juice and the reserved spice mix. Warm over a low heat and gradually stir in the sugar, tasting as you go. You may decide you don’t need all of it, depending on how much of a sweet tooth you have.Leave the mulled cider on the lowest possible heat for your guests to ladle directly into mugs, but make sure you and they keep the pan covered, or the alcohol will boil off and you’ll be left with nothing but hot spiced apple juice.Normally only spotted at the end of Christmas dinner when the cheese is rolled out, port is actually at its best served slightly chilled. Combining it with Christmas-coloured fruit makes for a beautiful, ruby-red party punch.2 x 750ml bottles juicy red wine, such as a cabernet franc, merlot or syrah ½ bottle (375ml) ruby red port50ml brandy150ml cranberry juice, or more to taste2 red apples2 firm, crunchy pears 1 handful fresh cranberries1 bag ice cubes10 fresh figs, halved, to garnish (optional but beautiful)Pour the wine, port and brandy into a large jug (or two), making sure at least a third of the jug is left empty to accommodate the ice, then add the cranberry juice – add more if you want to make what is otherwise a very robust drink that bit more quaffable, but don’t let it get too sweet.Core the apples and pears, but don’t peel them. Dice into 1cm cubes, then stir through the sangria with the fresh cranberries.Keep refrigerated until your guests arrive, then top up the jug with ice and stir well. Serve in large wine glasses, with half a fig slotted over the rim of the glass for extra festive flair.• Recipes by Albert Blaize and Claire Strickett.

As a football club, Arsenal has always adhered to the principle of not involving itself in politics.”Özil had added his voice to the wave of international outrage about the treatment of the Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking Muslim minority who have been subjected to a campaign of religious and ethnic persecution by the Chinese authorities.Around 10 million live in Xinjiang and there are claims that more than a million have been held in detention camps over recent years. Özil’s post had listed a range of the issues facing Uighurs in China, accusing other Muslims of staying silent on the subject.His Instagram message read: “East Turkistan, the bleeding wound of the Ummah, resisting against the persecutors trying to separate them from their religion. They burn their Qurans. They shut down their mosques. They ban their schools. They kill their holy men. The men are forced into camps and their families are forced to live with Chinese men. The women are forced to marry Chinese men.“But Muslims are silent. They won’t make a noise. They have abandoned them. Don’t they know that giving consent for persecution is persecution itself?”It is not the first time Özil has become involved in social and political issues. His support for Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has caused controversy and he was widely criticised in 2018 after posing with him for a photograph. Erdogan was also best man at Özil’s wedding in June.Özil is the second Arsenal player in as many days to air forthright political views on social media. On Thursday, with polls open for the general election, Héctor Bellerín tweeted: “Young people across the world have a chance to change what the future can be. Today’s the chance for all the British people to influence what your future and those living here holds. #FuckBoris #GoVote.”On that occasion, the club did not issue a statement in response."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a13b6ff48691b24ee51d58dc11abbc0f6b180ce1/0_64_4360_2616/master/4360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b548027fe8e98fcdd4fa33d0606bba2","title":"dwight mcneil character building released by united","story":"The Burnley winger was let go by the club he supported as a boy but he has bounced back to attract United’s interest once againDwight McNeil turned 20 only last month, yet he is already an established presence on the left wing at Burnley, with the promise of a long Premier League career ahead and bigger clubs beginning to show interest in his rare ability to beat defenders with the ball at his feet.To say those feet are firmly planted on the ground might be understating the matter, for McNeil’s is a football success story based on family values and recurring routines. As a child he would watch his father playing for clubs at non-league and lower league level around the north-west. “Stalybridge Celtic spotted him first, and he went to Hyde, Runcorn, Macclesfield and Stockport, with me and my mum following him everywhere every week,” McNeil explains.“From a very young age all I wanted to do was watch football, particularly when my dad was playing. According to my mum there was an old couple at Runcorn who couldn’t believe how quiet and well-behaved I was at the age of about three. ‘He loves football,’ she told them. ‘He follows the game.’”McNeil still lives with his parents, Matty and Tracy, in a house that bears testimony to two football careers, not one. “Going up our stairs, you pass my debut shirt on the wall, then my England Under‑21s debut shirt, then Dad’s from playing for Macclesfield against José Mourinho’s Chelsea, then finally his Stockport one from the promotion play-off at Wembley, with his winner’s medal next to it,” he says. “It’s a nice reminder all the time you go past my stuff then his is there.”Naturally McNeil Sr, a striker rather than a winger, did everything he could to help his son realise his ambition to also become a footballer. “He would have supported me with whatever I chose to do, but with me it was only ever going to be football,” McNeil says. “I still don’t have a clue what I might be doing if I hadn’t been any good, but once that decision was made Dad gave me tons of help.“Where we used to live there was a park with a massive cage. We would be there all the time doing sessions and drills. Lots of technical stuff, loads of cones and little goals. We would work on getting my touches going dribbling has always been one of my strengths but I still work on improving it.“Dad advised me to watch the players who could go past people, and told me that if I got the first touch right I could glide past defenders too. It’s a really key quality to have on the pitch, especially in tight situations, but for me it all goes back to all those drills in the cage in the park.”The player the young McNeil modelled himself on most was Ryan Giggs. “I used to watch everything he did,” he says. “Direct dribbles past people, crosses, goals, leadership, I just lapped it up. I was a United fan anyway, and so was my brother Bailey, but whereas he used to change the name on the back of his shirt quite often, every time United bought someone exciting or new, I just stuck with Giggs all the way through.”Despite spending nine years in United’s youth ranks McNeil never got to meet his hero, the policy of the club being to keep development players strictly separate from senior performers. Rather ludicrously, McNeil was picked up by United at the age of five, spotted while playing at a JJB Sports soccer school near the Trafford Centre for which his parents used to pay £10 for two hours of football activity.“Bolton approached us first, but my mum and dad told them I was too young,” he explains. “Then when United showed interest and said they could see I had some technical ability, they were willing to go along with it. I was at United until I was 14, then I was released. The club didn’t say anything to me, they just contacted my parents. Obviously I was disappointed and a bit hurt, because I had been chasing a dream and I wanted to prove I could be better than my dad, but Burnley stepped in to offer me a six-week trial and I’ve never looked back since.“There are other players here who have been through the same thing, and now I’m older I can see it sometimes works out for the best. Everyone has setbacks in life and even at a young age you have to deal with them. Personally I became more demanding of myself from age 14 onwards, more driven to succeed, so I suppose it was character-building in a way.”If the football rumour mill is to be believed McNeil could be back at United in the not too distant future. Burnley’s manager, Sean Dyche, has accepted he has a talent on his hands who may soon outgrow homely Turf Moor, though for now McNeil is perfectly happy. “Everyone is down to earth here, everyone gets treated the same and we’ve got a really good team spirit,” he says. “I’m the youngest in the squad by about four or five years but everyone gets on, it is a really good group. I feel like part of the family.”McNeil’s actual family must be delighted. “Of course,” he says. “My dad comes to every game, no matter where it is. It’s funny but my mum didn’t really like football at first, when she met my dad. Now she’s just used to it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ab91e70d78fadff378a3f77fae7a7f68c2cb627/0_288_4545_2727/master/4545.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12ee360cc9e2748a3c4fa80c33599faf","title":"jurgen klopp signs liverpool contract extension 2024 new deal","story":"Jürgen Klopp has said he agreed a new contract with Liverpool until 2024 to help the club attract their main transfer targets and to create a lasting legacy at Anfield.The Liverpool manager, along with his assistants Peter Krawietz and Pepijn Lijnders, has committed to the next five years at Anfield and will become the club’s longest-serving manager since Bob Paisley by the end of his third contract.Liverpool’s owner, Fenway Sports Group, had been trying to extend Klopp’s deal since the end of last season when his transformation of the club yielded a sixth European Cup triumph. The 52-year-old spent seven years at both of his previous clubs – Mainz and Borussia Dortmund – and was on course for a similar stay on Merseyside with his current £7m-a-year contract due to expire in 2022. But he has committed to the longest spell of his managerial career to oversee a gradual rebuilding of the team and because he could not imagine leaving Liverpool in three years’ time.Klopp said: “This squad in the moment is outstanding, we all love it, but we have to stay on track as other teams don’t sleep and we don’t sleep. We have to see what we change, what we don’t change. All of these decisions should be made out of a real comfortable situation. When you are in, you should be responsible for all that stuff and I feel responsible for it. When I leave at any point in my life it is important that it is still in a very good place.“We will have to refresh things in moments. This team will always be the core set, the basis for all other teams following, and there is no need to make the same number of changes that we made in the last four and a half years in the next four and a half years. Absolutely not. This is an outstanding team but of course there will be things. A player might want to leave, then we have to bring in the right replacement. To keep the level we are on we have to be really on our toes and to be on your toes you need to sometimes change a little bit and that is what we will do.”Klopp believes his new deal will be important for stability and enticing new players. A deal to sign the Salzburg playmaker Takumi Minamino has been agreed for January. He said: “When you want to bring new players in they ask: ‘How long is the manager going to be here?’ We all wanted to avoid that so it’s done and I am really happy about that.”Liverpool hold a commanding eight-point lead in the Premier League as they pursue a first league title in 30 years and will aim next week to land a first Club World Cup. The European champions have also made substantial progress off the pitch, too, with plans unveiled recently to construct a new Anfield Road stand that, following the Main Stand redevelopment, would increase the stadium’s capacity to more than 61,000. A new £50m training complex in Kirkby is due for completion in the summer of 2020.Liverpool’s principal owner, John Henry, the chairman, Tom Werner, and FSG president, Mike Gordon, issued a joint statement to express their delight at Klopp’s willingness to extend his stay. It read: “We feel this represents one of the big moments of our stewardship of Liverpool Football Club so far as we believe there is no better manager than Jürgen.”Liverpool have also announced a new contract for James Milner, who has committed his future to the club until 2022. The 33-year-old’s previous deal was due to expire next summer but, with Klopp anxious to retain the influential midfielder, he has signed a new two-and-a-half-year contract."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bd02c5ed7d42853c94d9be9b230625feaf72c34/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=153941c63323e170928e4debf9b30634","title":"manchester united academy 4000 squads milestone scott mctominay","story":"The system that bred the Busby Babes, George Best and the Class of 92 hits a remarkable milestone on SundayScott McTominay is the latest poster boy for a remarkable Manchester United academy that has produced the Busby Babes, George Best and the Class of 92, and which will provide a player to the matchday squad for the 4,000th game in succession when Everton visit on Sunday.McTominay was blooded at the age of 20 by José Mourinho in a 2-0 defeat at Arsenal in May 2017 and by the end of the following campaign had received the manager’s player of the season award.McTominay, spotted at five when he attended a development centre in Preston, is the epitome of a system that has sourced United’s top five appearance makers: Ryan Giggs, Sir Bobby Charlton, Bill Foulkes, Paul Scholes and Gary Neville.Of the 4,000 landmark, he says: “It’s amazing. Whenever we were in the youth team we had different members of staff saying to us about the consecutive matches we’ve had a youth player from the academy in. To get to 4,000 is incredible and a real credit to the staff who have invested so much in every player who has contributed.”The run began on 30 October 1937 in a second ision game at Fulham when Tom Manley and Jackie Wassall were in a United XI that lost 1-0. During the next eight decades the nascent careers of Dennis Viollet (1940s), Duncan Edwards (1950s), Best (1960s), Norman Whiteside (1970s), Giggs (1980s), Scholes (1990s), Paul Pogba (2000s), and Andreas Pereira (2010s) would presage them becoming first-team regulars and taking a place in the roll call of the academy’s headline successes.In this billing the Busby Babes and Class of 92 are prominent. The former were developed under Sir Matt Busby, with the manager’s assistant, Jimmy Murphy, and chief scout, Joe Bishop, executing his vision.This stellar group formed the core of the consecutive title-winners of 1955-56 and 1956-57 before eight – Roger Byrne, Mark Jones, Eddie Coleman, Edwards, Billy Whelan, Tommy Taylor, David Pegg and Geoff Bent – were killed in the Munich air disaster of 1958, with Jackie Blanchflower’s career ended by the injuries he suffered.This glittering and tragic history has informed the subsequent culture of the academy, says Nick Cox, who succeeded Nicky Butt as its head in the summer.“If you think back to what Sir Matt Busby tried to create, he made the point that people who pay to watch have been grafting in the factories all week,” Cox says. “They’re local folk, this is their one release and we have a duty to entertain and show them we’re the same, but just privileged to be on the pitch. When it’s local boys that connection becomes even greater and more powerful.”Butt, Giggs, David Beckham, Gary and Phil Neville and Scholes became known as the Class of 92 because of the role the first four of them had in the FA Youth Cup triumph of that year and their status as mainstays of Sir Alex Ferguson’s stellar side in the mid-1990s to early 2000s, whose 1999 Treble triumph remains the domestic game’s greatest feat.They were in a second wave of “Fergie Fledglings” developed under the Scot, whose commitment to youth began with the late-1980s crop that included Russell Beardsmore and Lee Martin.Cox follows a long tradition of United talent scouts and developers. Luminaries include Bob Bishop, who discovered Best and Whiteside Murphy, who was prominent in healing a near-broken club until Busby recovered and Eric Harrison, the youth team coach from 1981 until 2008.Cox says: “What we’re doing here is producing the equivalent of gold medallists and spacemen who are landing on the moon. To produce young players who are ready to play at Old Trafford is the pinnacle. We’re trying to create a rich ecosystem.”Many of those who do not make it have fine careers elsewhere. Cox says: “It’s kids in our first team, kids playing professional football across the country but, more importantly, kids who have been enriched by the contact they’ve had with us.”Ole Gunnar Solskjær was made Mourinho’s successor partly because of his belief in homegrown talent. The Norwegian has proved his commitment to it, though a net summer spend of only around £80m indicates pragmatism is at work, too.Thursday’s 4-0 Europa League win over AZ Alkmaar was graced by two goals from Mason Greenwood, an 18-year-old graduate. In 2019 Solskjær has given debuts to nine other club-reared products: Tahith Chong, James Garner, Brandon Williams, Ethan Laird, Di’Shon Bernard, Dylan Levitt, Ethan Galbraith, Largie Ramazani and D’mani Mellor.Solskjær says: “Giving young players a chance is a tradition we are very proud of. It’s part of our DNA and you learn that quickly when you join the club. Young players can only surprise and impress you when you give them a chance to show their talent. The 4,000 is a milestone we are proud of and long may it continue.”A subplot of the academy narrative concerns those who did not realise their potential. Ravel Morrison is one example, a midfielder rated very highly by Ferguson but who failed to make a league appearance before leaving in January 2012.Cox tutored Borussia Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho when both were at Watford. “I’ve known him since he was seven but Jadon Sancho produced Jadon Sancho,” says Cox. Sancho moved from Watford to Manchester City in 2015 and United face competition from their crosstown rival in the race to attract talent. If this reflects a lack of success in the Youth Cup since 2011 or at Under-18 Premier League level for six years, Cox hints City’s approach may be counterproductive.Reminded of how Phil Neville and another former United player, Robin van Persie, chose to have their sons schooled at City, he says: “We’ve opted to do things a very Manchester United way. Where we set ourselves aside is that we have got some amazing developers of young people – they are not coaches – who have been here for a long while: Tony Whelan, Dave Bushell, Eamon Mulvey.“We are absolutely – and I think a lone voice – resolute that if you start too soon the love of football is going to vanish. We would be happy to move the age of registration up to sign kids at 10, 11. We want this to look like a childlike rather than a cut-throat, sanitised environment.“We’ve always had our eye on the bigger picture. Where are these kids going to be in 10 years? Do we still have kids who are going to play in the first team? If you win at the expense of development, you don’t produce footballers.”Cox may have a point, as beyond Phil Foden City have struggled to produce a first-team squad regular since Micah Richards in 2005.McTominay describes the values United imbue. “It’s about general standards: being punctual, always wearing black boots until you get to the reserve team,” he says. “There are no big egos, no kids coming in wearing jewellery. If a young player is doing that in the canteen I would certainly be one to say something and the same with other boys in the first team, and the manager as well.“You don’t realise how much things like that are going to help. You think: ‘This is rubbish.’ Now I look back and those standards have been passed through, so everybody has the idea of what a Manchester United player should look and be like – the DNA that comes with wearing that badge.”Cox’s ambition is to produce a fresh wave of talent as impressive as the Class of 92. “We have to aspire to do that, absolutely,” he says. “We have to believe it’s possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/658e52235a534936d1faab13209c9bc4cb3472f4/0_774_5481_3290/master/5481.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=faa05e5f1b70172d07068162f8032e67","title":"stormzy guest editor of the observer magazine takeover black culture celebration","story":"Guest editor Stormzy sets out his mission statement for this weekend’s Observer Magazine takeover. Only with The Observer on SundayA few weeks ago I took Jay Rayner, this magazine’s restaurant critic, to Bluejay, a café in south London. I wanted Jay to come to my ends. To eat where I eat. To meet the owner, Joy. To try this food and that. That’s how I think, in an ideal world, bridges between cultures can be made. It was an invite. It was me saying: ‘Hey, come check this out. Be open to what we do.’ Jay has lived in Brixton a long time, so he knew of the place. And he embraced it beautifully.When I said yes to guest-editing this magazine, I didn’t have a specific message in mind, but I knew I wanted it to be a celebration of black British culture, of people like Joy and places like Bluejay. Lots of us know who Idris Elba and Raheem Sterling are. We know the stories of prominent black people. But a lot of Britain doesn’t know all that much about black Britishness – that there’s this whole beautiful world to be explored. This issue of the Observer Magazine is an opportunity to show how multifaceted our culture is. And a chance for me to shine a spotlight on people and places on which the spotlight isn’t normally shone. It’s understanding that black culture doesn’t always get the recognition it deserves. Coming from the black community in south London, I know how we can all use a bit of help. I hope everyone in this issue soars.This is my favourite thing to do: sharing my platform with others. Bruv, I’m good! My career’s going alright. So you’ll see my mug on the cover and then I’ll get out the way as much as possible. Inside is all talent, and a few moments of seriousness.I’m super grateful to the Observer Magazine for this opportunity. This is the Observer saying that me and everything I stand for are important, that black culture is important. In a day and age when people prefer to play it safe, this magazine has said ‘nah’. That’s ballsy! And where I’m at in my career, this is all I should be doing: highlighting and celebrating black culture. I pray readers see it like that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bf6016326a481d5b019c1d56abef1ff83020ca2/0_222_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4b32fda21f13e78e4ef38544646613b","title":"spike ebola cases alarms health officials drc","story":"Many cases blamed on a single inidual who appears to have caught virus for second timeHealth officials are investigating an alarming spike in Ebola cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with many blamed on a single inidual who appears to have contracted the disease for a second time this year.According to officials, it appears to be the second time the person has been documented as suffering from Ebola in six months. An investigation is being held to understand the circumstances around the case.Ten cases were notified on Wednesday in Mabalako, North Kivu province, where the inidual is believed to be from, after another six on Tuesday, according to officials who noted that three out of the six were practitioners of traditional medicine.The spike – and the worrying circumstances behind it – appears to buck a trend towards a declining number of cases, although security issues in the key zones of Beni, Biakato and Mangina had recently paralysed the response after violent attacks on health workers.Among the possibilities being examined are reinfection with the disease – which would ring the most serious alarm bells as no case of reinfection has ever been recorded before – or a relapse.Ebola virus disease (EVD) first appeared in 1976 in two outbreaks, located in what is now known as South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The latter outbreak was in a village near the Ebola River, giving the disease its name.Ebola causes fever, aches and diarrhoea and attacks the immune system, causing blood clotting cells to malfunction so that victims bleed extensively and die if their immune system cannot fight off the viral infection. It is spread from person to person through body fluids.A vaccine, still experimental, has proven to be highly effective in preventing the disease, according to the World Health Organization.\u0026nbspWhile rare cases of relapse have been documented, in which a person who has recovered from Ebola gets its symptoms again, reinfection would mean a person who has recovered has been infected anew with the virus by another person, a circumstance so far undocumented.Experts have long been anxious about the risk of recurrence because the virus can persist for months in areas of the body that are immunologically protected, including semen, vaginal fluids, sweat, aqueous humour, urine, breast milk and even spinal fluid after initial onset and recovery.That has led researchers to speculate about the continued risk of transmission in iniduals not showing any symptoms, including through sexual activity, leading to reactivation of the illness.Reinfection, relapse and recurrence are all sources of acute concern in controlling the outbreak, as Ebola survivors are employed widely in treatment centres in DRC on the assumption they cannot usually recontract or transmit the disease.In July another patient died from what was also presumed to be a relapse or reinfection, calling into question the assumption that Ebola survivors have lifelong immunity from the virus.According to figures from the African Union as of 8 December, the Ebola outbreak in DRC has claimed 2,209 lives since it broke out, with 3,327 recorded cases."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/225c073b7ffbab7c7927d65683355bc38edca12e/1_0_4165_2500/master/4165.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3494540b2879ed91bfc8827ba79ba67f","title":"a letter to the school class i let down","story":"‘Hearing about the struggles you faced, I wanted to give more – but it was never enough’: the letter you always wanted to writeI was in my second year of teaching in a primary school when I met all 30 of you. I was jaded enough by my late 20s to not expect the simple, life-altering experience some of the other trainees were anticipating, but I didn’t expect to find it so overwhelmingly difficult.My first year had gone well, but as I moved away from my mentor into a higher year group, cracks began to appear. I loved you all more than I could possibly describe, but your needs were so high and the level of support at the school so low I felt like I was the only person you had to turn to.Hearing about the daily struggles so many of you faced, I wanted to give more and more of myself – but it was never enough. I fell into a deep depression. It started at weekends, but quickly spilled over into the classroom. Lessons would go badly, and this would make my depression worse. By Christmas, one of the hardest-working and most understanding among you came to me in tears saying, “Miss, I just can’t get anything done in class. It’s always too loud and I hate it.” I went home and cried.When a new member joined your ranks while experiencing a bereavement, and another of you had mental health needs that became more severe, I got personal and professional support for myself, and some of you, from the once-weekly school counsellor (serving more than 700 students). I talked to Teach First and signed up for NHS therapy – these things made minor improvements, but the process was slow.When the year ended, I unceremoniously told you all that I was leaving teaching. Many of you burst into tears. At that point, my self-worth was so low, I thought most of you would have been happy to see me go, so you could get a teacher who could actually help you learn. But in retrospect I think I underestimated the emotional bond I had with you. In the end, I became one in a long line of teachers to abandon the profession due to the sheer exhaustion caused by an underfunded, overburdened system.I still think about many of you: I wonder if you’re well and if you’re achieving all the great things I know you can. I hope a year of slightly-less-than-optimal learning wasn’t too damaging. While, I suspect, a depressed, lifeless teacher was significantly less than you needed, I want you to know that I would have given the world to you if I could.• We will pay £25 for every letter we publish.

Now we have to rent a castle to fit them all inThis Christmas you’ll find me sitting around a crackling fire with my family: my mum whomping down her third mince pie, my sister searching for bubbly, and my stepfather burying his nose in the sports pages. One of my ex-boyfriends will be making us die with laughter while another ex polishes off the cava, and a completely different ex tries to pull focus from the first ex, who is on all fours pretending to give birth to a penguin. My actual boyfriend will either be in hysterics or dreading his turn at charades. Christmas is complicated.People start moaning about how stressful Christmas is around the time Pret release their new festive sandwich. Single gay friends, especially, worry about travelling to towns they left as soon as they could, populated by people they hid from on Facebook and hoped never to see again. I know this feeling, because for years it’s what I did, too. Back in the early noughties, the thought of going home to Jersey was so gloomy that I was forced to take action. I was single, but had stayed pretty good friends with an ex who had grown up in a family of Jehovah’s Witnesses, so I asked him to come home with me. He was thrilled to have an invite, and that year proved that just because turkey is dry it doesn’t mean the holiday has to be. Having an ally took the edge off, and the lively addition of a guest with ADHD and a gift for candid storytelling meant we all had the most fun we’d had in years.When I met my next boyfriend, he got on brilliantly with my ex, who was now also my best friend, so spending the next Christmas together was a no-brainer. When we split up, we remained good friends, and a couple of Decembers later he was spending Christmas with me, the original ex, another ex and my current boyfriend. These days, there are so many of us at my family Christmas that we have to rent somewhere big enough. We’ve spent it in a cliff-top fort, a 14th-century castle, a Tudor cottage and an actual abbey. This year we’re off to a medieval manor house in Shropshire.Is this all a bit weird? It doesn’t feel weird. I don’t know if it’s a gay thing or a “me” thing, but it seems likely that gay people sometimes stay friends with the people they sleep with, or else face a pretty desolate social circle. When you’re young, randy and searching for validation through intimacy, it’s easy to misdiagnose kindred spirits as potential mates, and my guess is that about half the people we go out with should just be friends.It took time for my present boyfriend to assimilate. He is younger than the rest of us and it must have felt overwhelming entering our coven with its shared history, habits and nonsense language. Initially there were arguments: between him and me, and between him and certain exes. But a year or two later we were laughing about it. He admits that when he spent his first Christmas with us he felt lost, but he quickly carved out a role as the cook and could disappear to the kitchen for a breather when it all got too much, with my mother often hot on his heels.I asked my mum about the situation I’d imposed on her before writing this piece, and she was typically Aquarian in her response, saying: “That’s just the way it is.” When pushed, she did agree that it must seem strange to other people, but she’d never really thought about it because she’d met everyone and got on with them before they showed up at her door. And that’s worth pointing out: these are all bona fide long-term partners. Casual dalliances get an Insta follow not a turkey dinner.Because my mum lives on Jersey and my sister and I have emigrated to “the mainland”, things are pretty quiet for her most of the year, so when she jumps off-rock and joins the annual circus of my failed love affairs, she welcomes the change of pace, the constant chatter, filthy stories, dance routines, games and amped-up gaiety. She lived through the 70s, so I’m sure we seem pretty tame.My younger sister has never known Christmas without my plus ones and, like mum, never used to give it a thought. But she assures me that it is odd, because even among her group of trendy pansexual Brighton millennials, exes rarely stay friends, let alone make a date to spend every December together. Despite this, the ex thing has rubbed off on her, and she is now best friends with her ex. I’ve never understood why more people don’t stay friends with their exes. No one ever did me so much wrong that I never wanted to speak to them again. Of course I’ve been cheated on, but you’ll get over your boyfriend having toilet sex while you wait on the dancefloor with a vodka and cranberry, really you will. After breaking up with my exes I forgave any indiscretions because I really enjoyed their company – and because being righteous is lonely and dull.There are downsides to Exmas. It gets competitive at jigsaw time, and we’ve worked out that three exes is too many: they make pacts, take sides, and eat all the After Eights. Three upsets the dynamic, iding one healthy group into bickery factions until we’re so annoying that my stepfather is driven to passive-aggressively clanging the coal scuttle as he cleans out the fire – which absolutely needs doing at 6am on Boxing Day. We are a lot and no one is offended if somebody makes a temporary escape – though the time one ex disappeared to go on a Grindr date halfway through Doctor Who was a plot twist no one saw coming. Another year, an ex made amorous overtures to one of my sister’s friends. The sot was so soused that the friend gallantly helped him to his bedroom. Finding himself alone with the young man, my ex wrongly assumed he was there for one thing. The next day was awkward, but it was something to talk about over leftovers. My Christmases have not always been like this. When my parents split up and my mum remarried, I was a belligerent teenager and resisted the new family. I was angry at my dad and didn’t want to be with him, either. One Christmas I said no to everyone and stayed at home alone, Macaulay Sulkin’. Shrinks might call this the “inciting moment”. I’m not saying that I’ve done everything in my power since then to make Christmas all about me, but I’m also not not saying that either.Because I feel comfortable at my curated Christmas, I can be myself in a way I might not with my extended family. The dressing up started off small – it was easy enough to coax everyone into a fake moustache and comedy teeth – but things have since escalated. My finest moment was luring everyone to a fancy-dress shop and convincing them to hire every historical costume they had. Watching my mum baste a giant ham dressed as Eleanor of Aquitaine is something I’ll take to the grave. The Jehovah’s Witness thing means one of my exes may never spend Christmas with his family, but he’s made peace with that. The one who bore the brunt of the coal scuttle incident has never returned, and another is torn: for many, Christmas is family time, and he admits that spending it with mine can lead to moments of melancholy. Perhaps out of guilt, or inspired by our trips away, he is taking a sabbatical from this year’s Exmas to go on holiday with his own mum. I hope he has a lovely time, but I fully expect him back in 2020 – and if he ever wants to bring his boyfriend, I’m sure that would be fine.We grow up with stories where the ex is either a villain or the one that got away, but I’ve found that to be a lie. Our beloved becomes the one: the one we love and the one we can’t live without meanwhile, the ones that got away should be able to come round for a wine whenever they like, although a text first would be nice. Like many gay people, when I left home I created a new “chosen” family. But it turns out I wasn’t replacing my actual family, I was adding to it. Bringing both together at this time of year means I get to have my Christmas cake and eat it, too.•\u0026nbspIf you would like your\u0026nbspcomment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc6a20400c82382fe1ed1a7e674b64dbf44f7989/55_0_2425_1455/master/2425.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc22726a962cdc3101c86e932576901e","title":"romesh ranganathan christmas low point dad singing in a nd e","story":"This year we have invited everyone to ours. With any luck, we’ll get the rest of the break to ourselvesIt may seem to sit in direct contradiction to my misanthropic shtick, but I bloody love Christmas. I loved it when I was a kid, mainly because my parents went in for Christmas hard. There is a big Sri Lankan community in Crawley and we would do a circuit of people’s houses over the festive period, with my dad getting hammered and making a real show of himself before going home to the traditional Christmas sound of my mum giving him a bollocking.One year he slipped on the ice and hurt his face. My mum took him to hospital and he decided he was going to try to lift everyone’s spirits in the waiting room (showing a wilful ignorance of the reason everyone was there) by singing Christmas songs at full volume. My mum said her low point was when he went behind reception and started trying to check in patients.Having children obviously makes Christmas even better. They get very excited, although I am starting to become convinced that our eldest son has twigged re Santa. There is, of course, no incentive to him letting us know that, as Santa is giving him presents but I am starting to wonder if the dynamic has now changed and the kids have hushed conversations about not letting us find out that they know he’s not real: “It would break their little hearts, they love doing the mince pie and the crappy little footprints across the living room. I can’t believe they think we don’t know it’s flour.” Etc.The one thing that we haven’t figured out is a system for who is going where on Christmas Day. My wife has a sister and I have a younger brother, and every year my wife and I sit down to deliberate about what we are going to do, as if Christmas has never occurred before and this is a brand new conundrum. Suddenly, the time that we spend at people’s houses has become a premium commodity, and we have to measure it out carefully, so that the different parties involved in “Ranganathan Christmas” do not feel slighted in any way.We have Brexit-like trade discussions: “If we spend the morning of Christmas Day at theirs, we may be able to use that as leverage to get ourselves some time with just us in the evening. But that means we don’t see my mum, so I think we’re going to have to face the very real possibility of losing Boxing Day.”This year, we decided that we have been too forceful in the past, and agreed we would wait to see what everyone else wanted to do. The last couple of weeks have been the most high-pressured of our lives meeting up with family members and trying to ascertain what their plans are, like Christmas detectives. Eventually we caved under the pressure. I was away on tour and my wife phoned me to say, “I couldn’t take it any more, so I’ve asked everyone to ours.”This actually is the most clever move of all: Christmas Day is the ultimate play – you sacrifice one day and buy yourself enough superiority points to have the rest of the break to yourself. My wife says she finds it stressful. I tell her that she has never spent Christmas in a hospital waiting room with my dad.

Thankfully, as many health experts – and a 2017 “Love Potatoes” campaign from the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board – have pointed out, this staple of British cuisine is low in fat, high in fibre and a great source of energy. Bonus points if you eat the vitamin-packed skin.But making an effort not to bin the peel isn’t going to solve the problem of food waste alone. The potato has long been a contributor to the more than £1bn of produce thrown away every year before it even reaches a supermarket.“Potato growing is not precision agriculture. You’re much more at the whim of Mother Nature than with some other vegetables. From year to year, exactly what’s coming at us has quite a lot of variation to it,” explains James Truscott, managing director of Branston.Branston is nearing its 30th anniversary with Tesco, for whom it processes over a third of a million tonnes of potatoes annually. That’s a lot of spuds.To ensure supermarket success, the produce must meet the expectations of customers – some of whom are swayed by appearance. While food-waste-reducing efforts such as “wonky veg bags”, including Tesco’s Perfectly Imperfect range, have emerged in recent years, Truscott points out that we need to be realistic about what sells.“There is an increasing number of consumers who have food waste much higher up their priority list than they might have done a few years ago, which is great. And things like “wonky veg” have real resonance for some customers. But the reality is, great-looking produce sells better.”However, oversized or undersized potatoes are attractive to ready meal manufacturers, something Tesco recognised five years ago when it was trying to find ways to reduce food waste across its business – part of its commitment that no food fit to eat should go to waste across its entire UK operations.Branston, in turn, was able to invest in state-of-the-art peelers that can cope with the wonky veg.“We now take a really big proportion of those secondary potatoes, peel them and then send them off to Samworths to become the mash on the top of a cottage pie,” says Truscott. “Finding other routes to market for the crop is key. We can offer a product customers want and still find a really good added-value home for the rest of it.”Branston sends 350 tonnes of product a week to Samworths from its potato-peeling unit, which means that ready meal we grab when we’re too tired to cook may be more sustainable than we think.But that’s not all. Keen to further stamp out food waste, Branston and Tesco are embracing state-of-the-art technology, an investment that has been helped by a five-year contract to supply Tesco with most of its fresh potatoes. Introducing the “digital potato”, which predicts how likely the crop is to get damaged during harvesting, washing and sorting.“It looks like a potato, but it’s bright orange and blue,” says Truscott. “It’s basically got a load of sensors in it. You plant it in the field, and then harvest it and see how much damage happens on the harvester. You can put it through washes and graders on the production lines too to see if there are particular points of impact, so that we can address those with a smarter design.”And just when you thought the potato couldn’t get more high-tech, Truscott reveals that the company has launched a new system that started life as a 3D camera from an Xbox.“We will mount it on harvesters and it will count and size all of the potatoes on the harvest bed, so we know exactly what’s coming at us,” he explains.“Right now, growers go into a potato field with a fork, dig up a few potato plants and measure them. It’s a method that’s been used for centuries, but it’s a tiny snapshot and statistically not a very good view as to what’s coming.”The camera will enable growers to see the size profile and expected yield of crop for every field. This information will hopefully generate fewer potatoes that would have otherwise gone to waste.“We’re really excited about technology, because it’ll help growers get better at what they do in the field, and therefore be more sustainable,” says Truscott. “But it’ll also allow us to plan really, really well.”Tesco’s long-term partnerships with its suppliers means they can then invest in new technology, such as Branston’s major investment in handling and packing tech, and work together to cut food waste.Giving potatoes a new lease of life is not the only way that Tesco is working with its suppliers to reduce the impact producing food has on the environment. Tesco and WWF are working together to halve the environmental impact of the average UK shopping basket, partnering with suppliers to drive innovation and tackle sustainability challenges across their supply chains, starting with some of the most popular products in the modern basket, like potatoes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ac848d224c9fb92853df841e80551ad4d7156e4/0_55_1731_1039/master/1731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bd665bce9a0c3e342df6a089a1e181f","title":"we feed 2000 children turning surplus food into free school meals in kenya","story":"One international grower has found an ingenious way to use up surplus produce – while also benefiting its local communitySome pupils at Maua school in Naivasha, Kenya, were so hungry that they’d skip school to search the bushes for wild fruit. Others who didn’t cut class would steal from nearby shops so they’d have something to eat for lunch.Headteacher Rosalin Wafula was growing concerned with the high levels of truancy and signs of poor concentration in the 850 students she looks after.“Some children had food some did not. In a school, we should have equality. But many would feel out of place because they didn’t have anything to eat,” she says.But thanks to a new scheme that turns surplus food from local packhouses into free meals for children, Wafula has seen a big improvement in attendance and classroom participation.Stevenage-based Flamingo Produce has been supplying vegetables such as green beans, baby corn and broccoli from Kenya to Tesco in the UK since 1994, and was looking for ways to reduce food waste and benefit the community at the same time.“In Kenya, we end up with a lot of green beans that are too curly. In the UK, you may have the opportunity to sell them as part of Tesco’s ‘perfectly imperfect’ veg range. But we’re 6,000 miles away and flying such a product is not environmentally, or economically, very wise,” managing director Ian Michell explains.Flamingo had already taken small steps to tackle food waste, such as no longer trimming green beans before they are transported and sold. But Michell knew more could be done.Working with Tesco, he came up with the idea of setting up kitchens in the Kenya packhouse to make soup from the leftover vegetables to give to children at lunchtime. The scheme is based on the supermarket’s Community Food Connection programme in the UK, where leftover food from stores is donated to local charities. To date, Tesco has donated more than 150m meals from surplus food to local charities worldwide.“We’re now feeding 2,000 children a day,” Michell says.It wasn’t as simple as it sounds, though, recalls HR manager Tabitha Ngaywa. Soup isn’t a particularly common meal in Kenya. She was worried the kids wouldn’t actually want to eat it. Luckily, Flamingo Produce’s canteen manager was able to work with pupils and their parents to create a hot meal that the community could enjoy.“We don’t really appreciate soup in Kenya. So when the idea came to us it was a little bit difficult for us to imagine how it would be done,” Ngaywa reveals.Parents, pupils and teachers were brought on board to test the dish. Once feedback was positive, Flamingo Produce went ahead with the pilot in March, recruiting extra staff to help prepare and transport the meals.According to Wafula, Ngaywa needn’t have worried – children often ask for second helpings. She’s seen a great improvement in the quality of their work and attitude in the classroom, too.“Some of these children might not have had dinner the night before, or a proper breakfast in the morning. Their concentration was very low. But now they are very eager to learn. They are able to stay in class and participate. So they love it.”The scheme is in place across two schools in Naivasha now, and Flamingo Produce plans to roll it out to the company’s packhouses in Peru, Guatemala and Morocco soon.“Tesco’s help and funding will allow us to scale this into different regions all over the world. My target is 2m school meals in the year 2020,” says Michell. “We also hope to take a lot more of our products and make them into nutritious meals with long shelf lives. This will help us transport the product anywhere in the world to low-income families.”As Wafula points out, the promise of a free, nutritious meal each day can have a positive impact on mental wellbeing.“Every child should have that sense of belonging. And now, everyone feels equal because they all have something to eat.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14ec00be45658ae670cd911fb7278e3cc8d88784/1596_703_5124_3074/master/5124.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf9d2338eda8ad8becd5f8767f40a977","title":"acting had to take a back step for my family but now im staging a musical","story":"Kali Peacock on how she manages her finances and the demands of bringing up three small childrenName: Kali PeacockAge: 44Occupation: Actor, EastbourneIncome: £8,000-£12,000 including self-employed earnings and benefitsI knew I wanted to be an actor after I was cast as chief Oompa Loompa in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when I was eight. I’ve spent most of my career working in theatre productions but have also starred in TV shows such as The Inbetweeners and My Family. The biggest thing I’ve acted in was Finding Neverland with Johnny Depp. However, my career had to take a back step when my husband Martin and I started our family six years ago.When Finn came along it felt like the rug had been pulled from under us. He was born with a rare brain condition called pachygyria that manifested itself in uncontrollable seizures. He would have hundreds day and night.When he was 19 weeks old, he had a hemispherotomy at Great Ormond Street hospital. They severed the connections between the two sides of his brain. This stopped the seizures but left him with cerebral palsy. The right-hand side of his body is weak, he’s lost half his sight, he has development delays and has recently been diagnosed with autism. He can’t walk without a frame and the support of an adult, and he can’t speak.He’s a total whizz on the iPad and he laughs a lot. He’s taught himself so much including learning the alphabet on a toy, which left us speechless. We also have two daughters: Naia, four, and Rae, two.I still do the odd acting job. It tends to be voiceovers and radio promotions because I can’t up sticks like I used to. My income varies from month to month – it could be £200 or £750, or nothing at all. We receive £180 in child tax credit a week and child benefits of £140 a month, plus money for mobility care for Finn. It was more likely that I would find work, so my husband is the official carer for Finn he receives a carer’s allowance of £60 a week. Being dependent on benefits isn’t something that sits well with me or that I would ever have envisaged.A year ago I launched a charity production company called UnderWired with actor and friend Katy Morgan. We wanted to create more opportunities for mums and women over 40 in the industry, having found that work pretty much dried up for us once we’d had children or lived outside London. We’re running a multi-sensory Christmas family musical, The Lost Toys’ Big Christmas Adventure, from 13 to 29 December at the White Rock theatre in Hastings and the Royal Hippodrome theatre in Eastbourne.It’s such an important project for many reasons: I needed to do something creative to remind me who I used to be. Also, it’s difficult to find things we can do together as a family because of Finn’s needs. Often we have to split up. I take the girls to soft play and Martin takes Finn and walks our dog, Neeps. Our aim was to create an accessible, affordable Christmas theatre show for the whole family, including those with disabilities. I’m so proud of what we’ve created. We haven’t taken a salary from it. We’ve also covered all the expenses – meetings, petrol, train fares, childcare.We’ve been waiting to be urgently rehomed by the council for more than three years, as our current home isn’t suitable for Finn’s needs. However, a friend of ours is buying us a home and will become our landlord in March. This will be life-changing for us. Finn will have a downstairs bedroom and wet room, so we won’t have to carry all 30kg of him up and down the stairs.Life is pretty tough. We’re always in debt. We spend more than we receive every month. Our current rent is £850 a month. The bills all come out of my account as I receive all the childcare tax and benefits. We do a family shop once a week that comes to more than £100.My biggest vice is white wine. Life is extremely stressful being Finn’s mum. Any mother of a child with complex needs has to fight. You have to fight for everything – therapy, equipment, school, transport.It keeps me awake at night that I don’t have any savings or a pension. But I’m more concerned about right here and now and getting through to the end of the day. If the kids are fed and happy, then we’re winning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/661d3dd9ce5f687021961853a56dbe886a7b6116/0_585_2333_1399/master/2333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e14736758044d4af33a2a5fa28989be1","title":"stormzy new album tops charts hours after release heavy head","story":"Heavy is the Head poised to become one of UK’s most streamed albums of 2019Stormzy’s long-awaited second album looks likely to become one of the most streamed British albums of the year only hours after its release.Heavy is the Head was No 1 in the Apple Music album chart on Friday and several tracks were in the top 40 singles chart.Apple said: “Stormzy’s Heavy is the Head is the fastest-ever pre-added album on Apple Music in the UK to date, as well as the most pre-added album week one on Apple Music in the UK to date.”Critics have said the album established Stormzy, real name Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo, as a peerless “boundary-crossing figure in British cultural life” and praised his “confessional” and “assertive” second LP.The album, the follow-up to the acclaimed Gang Signs and Prayer, comes six months after he made history as the first grime act to headline Glastonbury.On the album, Stormzy addresses the reaction to his Glastonbury performance – where he wore a stab-proof vest designed by Banksy and struggled with technical issues – and the disintegration of his relationship with the TV presenter Maya Jama.On the first track, he raps: “When Banksy put the vest on me, it felt like God was testing me”, and the reference is the first of several mentions of the Glastonbury set, which the ’s pop critic, Alexis Petridis, says was an “epochal performance” that served to underline Stormzy’s “unique position among his UK rap peers”.The release comes a few weeks after he backed Jeremy Corbyn in the general election when he, along with other prominent cultural figures, signed an open letter supporting the Labour party’s socially progressive agenda and manifesto.After the letter was released, Stormzy tweeted: “Don’t sit there and think ‘my little vote ain’t gonna do anything’ – your vote is CRUCIAL. Your ‘one little vote’ can quite literally tip the scale for what will be the most important election of our generation.”He was also involved in a Twitter dispute after Michael Gove quoted his lyrics and criticised the rapper’s decision to back Labour. Some said a white, middle-class politician imitating a young black grime MC on social media was the equivalent of “Twitter blackface”.Official streaming figures for Heavy is the Head have not yet been released but his latest single, Audacity, which was released this week, has had 1.5m YouTube views in two days. The rapper’s popularity was summed up by Petridis, who wrote: “Britain is currently teeming with fantastic MCs, but Stormzy is the only one your dad knows the name of.”Stormzy is the guest editor of this Sunday’s Observer Magazine. There will be an interview with him by Miranda Sawyer a piece on racism in football and how it moved from the stands to online a profile of his Merky Books imprint a lunch date with Jay Rayner and an explanation by Dina Asher-Smith on what it takes to be a gold medal superstar. The takeover is being billed as a celebration of British talent. The album also features several collaborations with British acts, including the Manchester rapper Aitch, Ed Sheeran and J Hus. There are some literary references as well. The track Superheroes samples the Tracy Beaker soundtrack and references the children’s author Malorie Blackman, who Stormzy will work with when Merky Books publishes her forthcoming autobiography."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7679c932ee4d1c93b3633b4b97422fff893d117/0_232_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45cb25ef66ab724e8a25b203c1e1430f","title":"election 2019 john crace on the lowlights and the gaffes","story":"’s political sketch writer, John Crace, runs through the highs and the many, many lows of the 2019 general election campaign.

This was how he liked it. To be both seen and unseen. This was his victory. Boris Johnson was just his amoral, frontman clown. He knew it and Boris knew it. Without Classic Dom, the prime minister would be a nobody.Elsewhere, Dom’s Praetorian Guard prepared the room for the start of the impromptu 7am campaign celebration. “Can you move off the platform?” barked one minder. “You’re a health and safety risk.” There was no one within three feet of me. “I thought the whole point of Brexit was that we were going to deregulate this sort of thing,” I replied. The joke didn’t land well. It had been a long night.When all the faithful, many of whom were still pissed having been on the lash ever since the exit poll was declared, had been herded into position, Dom clicked his fingers. The show could begin. Moments later Needy Matt Hancock, Sajid Javid and James Cleverly were brought out as human wall-paper, before Michael Gove was sent on as warm-up act. Dom, Mikey and Boris was quite the Vote Leave reunion. Only this time the acid trip had been rather more fun. Gove tried his best to be statesmanlike as he addressed the nation. Tricky for someone whose insincerity is now second nature. He didn’t make it any easier by making vague promises to give more money to towns he clearly hadn’t heard of before yesterday. And insisting that the Tories were now a One Nation party when it had just kicked out its entire cohort of One Nation MPs immediately before the election was just taking the piss.But Mikey saved the best till last. Boris was the right man to lead the country, he said. No one had ever admired Johnson more than him. He was not worthy to kiss his feet. In fact the only reason he had twice stood against him for the leadership of the Tory party was to show up just how useless he was in comparison to the magnificence of Boris. There is no bum into which Gove won’t thrust his nose.Then it was Johnson’s turn. “What will we be able to do?” he asked. That question was rhetorical. Because the real answer was that he would now be able to do whatever the fuck he wanted. The World King was in business. Though the one problem with being able to do whatever you believe in, is it rather requires you to believe in something first. And Boris has never really believed in anything but himself. And only then as a series of bodily impulses catapulting him from one crisis to another.He said he’d get Brexit done but he still hadn’t a clue how. Or why. And one of the problems of a landslide majority was that now there was no one left to blame. He would be responsible for whatever shitshow Brexit inevitably turned into. More people had voted for an anti-Brexit party than for a pro-Brexit one, so the country was just as ided as it had ever been. The idea of healing was a sick joke. Besides, he’d never thought for a minute that Brexit was a good idea anyway. It had just been a means to an end. To get him right here, right now.So he’d better try to enjoy it. Though best not to look as if he was enjoying it too much. Now was the time for a show of humility. To keep it low key. To at least look as if he was grateful that so many people had voted for him when in his heart it just felt as if the natural world order of privileged entitlement had been observed.Boris mumbled some thanks to Labour voters for overlooking his dishonesty, racism and homophobia and promised he would try to do rather better at repaying their trust than he had in any previous relationships. A fresh start and all that. Or maybe not. Dom gave him the eye and he swiftly wrapped things up. He had no idea what came next, but something would come to him. It always did. The trick was to stay one step ahead of exposure.Back home in Islington, Jeremy Corbyn was equally bewildered at the way the night had turned out. More in sadness than in anger, the Labour leader tried to explain how the real victim of his party’s failure had been him. He was the misunderstood Messiah. A man out of time. Too good for this world. Just give him another 1,000 years and the country would come to realise the salvation that had been offered in his party’s manifesto. His one regret was that he had not been even more radical. Perhaps then the people might have seen the light and not been distracted by Brexit.Corbyn sighed, willing his stigmata to bleed. It was time for him to move on. Though not quite yet. A period of reflection on the ine mysteries of his complete uselessness was required. Replacing someone as enlightened as him could not be rushed. Someone who would take the road less travelled of making the party unelectable for another 10 years. So why not give the Tories a free ride for several months while Labour tore itself to pieces? There was madness in his method.As Johnson nipped off to see the Queen – he’d lied to her once, he could lie to her again – and prepared to make another largely untrue statement outside Downing Street, Cummings quietly congratulated himself. He was the disruptor in chief. The man who tore things down. And his crowning achievement was to install an impostor as prime minister.

Screwing up his face in distaste at the pugilistic metaphor, he replied: “I’m not a boxer!”He was much more comfortable reeling off a long list of constituencies he had visited in the past few days – something one close ally described as a “coping mechanism” – as a bruising campaign drew to a close.Another exasperated colleague complained that by the campaign’s final week Corbyn had all but given up the fight, and his advisers were beginning to cast around for a leftwing successor to keep the flame alive. “He almost gave up the leadership,” said one frustrated Corbynite frontbencher.Within minutes of the catastrophic exit poll being published on Thursday evening, the recriminations began, with many defeated Labour candidates pointing the finger at Corbyn’s unpopularity on the doorstep, particularly among working-class voters.The former cabinet minister Alan Johnson complained that Corbyn “couldn’t lead the working class out of a paper bag”.Meanwhile, Corbyn’s allies quickly laid the blame with the party’s Brexit stance, pointing to the fact that Labour’s losses were greatest in leave-leaning seats.The party chair, Ian Lavery, said: “Ignore democracy and to be quite honest the consequences will come back and bite you up the backside.”Over the coming weeks and months, this row will shape the battle for the future of the Labour party. Races for the leadership and deputy leadership are about to ensue, after Corbyn said he would step down, though most likely not until the new year.But the ’s experience following Labour throughout the election campaign, speaking to many senior figures along the way, suggests neither voters’ scepticism about Corbyn nor the party’s Brexit position tell the whole story.Insiders complain of clashing egos, confused messaging, and an infuriating lack of clarity about both day-to-day planning, and where the party’s battleground lay.Many Corbyn allies in key positions during the 2017 general election complained bitterly at the time that veteran party officials, including the elections chief Patrick Heneghan, had restrained them from running an offensive campaign. Some believed a more aggressive approach, pressing forward into Tory-held seats, could even have won them the election.Since then the last vestiges of the Miliband era, including the former general secretary Iain McNicol and a slew of other party officials, have left and been replaced by Corbyn loyalists, overseen by McNicol’s successor, Jennie Formby.Rather than the cautious approach of two years ago, party strategists made clear from the outset of this campaign that they were determined to make inroads in Tory territory, targeting up to 100 seats.Corbyn visited 10 Labour targets in the first few days of electioneering, as a signal of Labour’s determination to make gains. But campaign veterans say there was a lack of focus, followed by a refusal to retreat to a more defensive stance as polling and campaign data continued to point to a Conservative majority.“We ended up with 150 target seats,” said one Labour insider, who revealed that campaign chiefs were so reluctant to abandon any seats that each time a sitting MP signalled they were in trouble, their seat would simply be added to the list, without removing others.Many candidates in marginal Labour seats reported feeling frustrated that hundreds of activists were being sent to Boris Johnson’s Uxbridge seat, for example, when some elsewhere were having to cancel canvassing sessions because of low turnout.The lack of focus also appeared to extend to Labour’s policy offer, and the strategy for communicating it to a wary electorate.The slimline manifesto of 2017 – and its “For the many, not the few” slogan – was ditched in favour of a weightier document and several subsidiary booklets about nationalisation, boosting investment and a string of other policies.Instead of the Tories’ fearsome message discipline, which saw their “get Brexit done” slogan hammered home at every opportunity, Labour appeared to flit from one issue to another. The new slogan – “It’s time for real change” – also appeared more nebulous than its predecessor.“One day we’re talking about workers’ rights the next day we’re talking about pensions the next day we’re talking about free broadband. It’s pick and mix,” said an insider. Another complained of “policy incontinence”.An exasperated party veteran said that while watching a Conservative press conference from Labour’s Southside HQ, a young press officer was heard to remark: “These Tories are so boring: they say the same thing over and over again.”There was also intense frustration, even among diehard Corbyn loyalists, about the lack of organisation that left them unable to answer the most straightforward questions about Labour’s plans for the days ahead, or what its key messages would be.“No one was allowed to see the grid,” complained one adviser to a shadow cabinet minister. “Basically the grid leaked early in the campaign, and then they went super paranoid. We had a grid: but because no one knew what was in it, it was completely useless as an organisational tool. The whole point of the grid is that everyone has a vague idea of what’s happening: and who’s going where on what day.” On some days the party sent out two or even three policy press releases for the next day’s papers.The question of who was in charge of the campaign was at times as hard to answer as what was on the grid. The most senior official was Karie Murphy, whom Corbyn had sidelined from running his office after she disobeyed him over a plan to abolish deputy leader Tom Watson’s job.The most senior politician was John McDonnell, who had been instrumental in pushing Murphy out of Corbyn’s office. Party sources reported a series of “clashes of personality” between this pair of foes.Corbyn’s most senior adviser remained Seumas Milne, aided by the Unite chief of staff and longtime comrade Andrew Murray, both of whom were deeply sceptical about the party’s shift to backing a second referendum – a decision ultimately forced through by McDonnell.Milne and Murray – sometimes referred to, along with Murphy and the Unite general secretary Len McCluskey, as the “four Ms” – had sought over many months to resist the shift towards an anti-Brexit stance.They trace the roots of Labour’s catastrophic defeat back to the relentless insistence of Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry and others, including close Corbyn ally Diane Abbott, that the party would suffer if it failed to embrace a remain position.McDonnell ultimately swung to that stance himself, bringing longtime Eurosceptic Corbyn with him, amid fears that Labour’s overwhelmingly remain-supporting activists would never forgive the party for enabling Brexit.McCluskey blamed Labour’s defeat on this Brexit contortion. “Like most elections, this one was not won or lost during the campaign,” he wrote in a HuffPost article on Friday. “And it is Labour’s slow-motion collapse into the arms of the People’s Vote movement and others who have never accepted the democratic decision of June 2016 for a single moment which has caused this defeat.”In a striking sign that support is draining away from Corbyn, the Unite general secretary also complained about the party’s failure to apologise for antisemitism – something the Labour leader declined to do in a disastrous interview with the BBC’s Andrew Neil (though the prime minister dodged Neil altogether).Even senior Labour figures said they were unclear which of the three – Murphy, McDonnell or Milne – were really in charge of the campaign and there was a widespread perception that Corbyn’s outriders were beginning to look ahead to who would replace him.While the message may have been scattergun, the messengers were highly consistent: Brexit-leaning Corbyn loyalists Rebecca Long-Bailey, Richard Burgon and Ian Lavery appeared frequently remainers Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry barely at all.Starmer, who had hardly been seen in the national media for several weeks, appeared on stage at one event where Corbyn unveiled a leaked document exposing the impact of Johnson’s Brexit deal on the Northern Ireland economy. Despite it being the shadow Brexit secretary’s area of expertise, he was not given the opportunity to give even a brief speech: instead, Corbyn turned to him to help answer some of the journalists’ questions afterwards. Usually a confident media performer, Starmer shifted uneasily in his seat, looking awkward and uncomfortable.He is likely to be one of several senior figures who will now make a bid to take on the party’s leadership, and the job of rebuilding its reputation in working-class communities. Other likely contenders include Rebecca Long-Bailey, Angela Rayner, Jess Phillips and Lisa Nandy.As if to underline the changing of the guard, Andrew Fisher, who has been by Corbyn’s side as his policy chief since his early days as leader, emailed colleagues on Friday evening to say it was his last day in the office, telling them: “Whatever the failings of the party overall, you should be very proud of your work and your contribution.”Labour staffers joked at the start of the general election campaign that for them it meant “Downing Street or the dole”. By Friday afternoon it was clear that for some, it was likely to be the latter. Workers in Corbyn’s office and advisers to Labour frontbenchers received an email from Formby that said decisions on staffing would not be made until next week, and that no one would be let go before the end of the year. Many face an anxious weekend. For the wider party, facing up to the implications of a historic defeat, the immediate future looks equally uncertain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d1c847bf840c684885d1cdbba33696c343fa22c/1503_1181_3299_1980/master/3299.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3da3a186cb8dfcfc1994db819ddd813","title":"kind of blue uk comes to terms with tory election victory","story":"Nation remains ided with Boris Johnson calling for reconciliation, and Nicola Sturgeon demanding a vote on Scottish independenceBritain awoke on Friday morning to an electoral map that had turned an emphatic shade of Tory blue, and to a country as starkly ided as ever – this time into those delighted by a thumping Boris Johnson election victory and those despairing at the prospect of a rightwing Conservative government, a hard exit from the European Union and ever more pressing questions over the sustainability of the UK itself.The brutally unambiguous exit polls on Thursday evening, which left no room for hope of a hung parliament or any reprieve from Brexit, meant there had been some time overnight, at least, to process the result. But the scale of the Conservative victory still held the power to astonish on Friday morning.“Just think,” Michael Gove told gleeful Tory activists shortly after 7am, “next year both the Durham miner’s gala and the Notting Hill carnival will take place in seats represented by Conservative MPs!”In fact, he was wrong about that: the Tories may have won a surprise victory in Durham North West, unseating the shadow employment secretary, Laura Pidcock, who had been groomed as a potential successor to Jeremy Corbyn, but the famous socialist march takes place in a neighbouring constituency.His broader point, however, stood. As well as being defeated in Kensington, the home of Grenfell Tower, Labour’s so-called “red wall” – a ring of formerly rock-solid constituencies traditionally seen as the foundation of the party’s support in the north – had crumbled. Both sides were still coming to terms with what that meant for the country.Moments later, and back to his bumptious worst, or best, Johnson took to the stage in front of a sign that read, audaciously: “The People’s Government.”“Well,” he said. “We did it! We pulled it off, didn’t we? With this mandate and this majority we will at last be able to do what?”His obliging crowd duly roared: “Get Brexit done!” That three-word mantra was now, he said, “the irrefutable, irresistible, unarguable decision of the British people”, and the UK would leave Europe before 31 January, “no ifs, no buts, no maybes”.The prime minister did make an attempt at conciliation, however, repeatedly referring to “this one-nation government” and telling his Conservative colleagues that “we must change ... we must recognise the reality that we now speak as a one-nation Conservative party, literally for everyone from Woking to Workington”.To those on the left, however, Johnson’s victory meant devastation, as #notmygovernment and #notmyprimeminister trended on Twitter throughout the day. The night was particularly brutal for the Liberal Democrats, whose leader, Jo Swinson, lost her own seat to a buoyant SNP, which took 48 of Scotland’s 59 seats.Corbyn had conceded, in his acceptance speech in his home seat of Islington North shortly after 3am, that it was “obviously a very disappointing night for the Labour party” and pledged that he would stand down as Labour leader after “a process ... of reflection” for the party.On the morning airwaves and on social media, however, the battle for the future direction of the party had already begun, with Corbyn loyalists insisting that a popular manifesto had been undone by Brexit, while weary candidates, both those who had been successful and those now out of a job, spoke again and again of an antipathy to the party’s leader on the doorstep that had proved fatal for Labour’s election hopes.The shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, toured the TV studios, insisting: “People on the doorstep weren’t complaining about our policies, and we wouldn’t have had the policies ... if it weren’t for Jeremy’s leadership.”But Phil Wilson, who lost Tony Blair’s former seat of Sedgefield to the Tories, said attempts by the leadership to put the result down to Brexit was “mendacious nonsense”. “Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership was a bigger problem. To say otherwise is delusional. The party’s leadership went down like a lead balloon on the doorstep,” he said.There was support for both positions on Friday morning in Conisbrough, a hilly Doncaster town within the Don valley, one of the high-profile northern constituencies to fall to the Tories.“I don’t see it as a vote for the Conservatives, I see it as a vote for Brexit,” said one retired woman shopping on the high street.“It’s the first time I’ve done it. My dad was a miner, and his dad was a miner, and I’ve always voted Labour. I think if there had been another leader, I would have voted for them again.” Asked what it was in particular that she disliked about Corbyn, she replied: “There’s something about his mannerisms.”John Glarvey, owner of Bella’s Butties sandwich shop in Conisbrough’s town centre, said he was glad “the community has finally realised the miner’s strike has finished”.“When you ask a lot of people around here why they vote Labour, it’s always been because of that or because their granddad did. It’s good to see change ... I’d like the NHS to get sorted, but I don’t believe Labour would’ve actually put the money they were offering in.”But at pet store IGO pets, Alice Dann, a 19-year-old covering shifts during a Christmas break from her studies at the University of Hull, said her heart had sunk when she awoke to the result. “My family aren’t really Labour voters but I’ve always wanted to vote for them since I was in school. I liked their policies on tuition fees and helping younger people out,” she said.There were similar reactions in Wrexham, north Wales – another formerly solid Labour seat that elected a Conservative for the first time in its history. Mike Evans, whose family has run the ME Butchers business since 1911, described Johnson’s victory as “fantastic news”.He has voted for Labour in the past but believes the Tories will bring about the change he thinks is needed in north Wales. “I didn’t believe in Corbyn’s policies – his changes to public services went too far. We’d have gone backwards.”Asked if he liked Johnson, Evans sighed. “I think he’s the best of a bad bunch but it’s brilliant that the town has turned blue. It’s been Labour for too long. We need a change. Things can’t get worse.”In Peterborough, where the Tory gain from Labour meant the constituency had its fourth MP in three years, Brexit-supporting builder Martin Allpress said he had voted Labour all his life, but had abstained this time citing Corbyn’s “weakness”, antisemitism and his suspicion that Corbyn would not have delivered Brexit.“When the English people voted leave, wham!” he said. “I know it can’t happen overnight, but it’s like our opinion didn’t matter.”England and Wales aside, voters in Scotland and Northern Ireland – where the DUP had a dreadful night – were also coming to terms with their new political realities on Friday.“The SNP is on a roll,” said Larry MacDougall, a retired museums worker who has lived with his wife Moira in Swinson’s seat of East Dunbartonshire for 52 years. “People are fed up with being dictated to from down south.”His wife had voted for Swinson, who was unexpectedly squeezed out by the SNP’s Amy Callaghan, but MacDougall said the SNP gains across Scotland indicated that voters there were ready for a second referendum. “I’m not a nationalist. I just want my own government, then I can make up my own mind.”An emboldened Nicola Sturgeon later addressed Johnson directly at an SNP press conference to insist that a second referendum was now a “democratic right” for Scots.“Let me be clear. This is not simply a demand that I or the SNP are making. It is the right of the people of Scotland – and you as the leader of a defeated party in Scotland have no right to stand in the way.”In Northern Ireland, more nationalist MPs than unionists were elected for the first time in its history. In a brutal comedown from its king-making role during the last, brief, parliament, the DUP suffered a humiliating night, losing two MPs, including Nigel Dodds, the party’s leader in parliament.“Heartbroken,” said Charlotte Dickey, 77, a retired charity worker who had voted for Dodds. “I voted for Nigel to keep us under the crown of England,” said her husband, James, 79.With Sinn Fein’s share of the vote having also tumbled, there was pressure on Friday for the two largest parties to restore power-sharing to the defunct Stormont assembly.The SDLP leader, Colum Eastwood, who won one of two seats for his party in Foyle, said the parties had to get back around the negotiating table. “Everyone knows what has to happen. We must take responsibility. No longer is it good to stand on the sidelines. No longer can we look in the window. Let’s get on with it.”Shortly after 3pm, in front of the tall Downing Street Christmas tree, Johnson emerged in front of the cameras to make his first formal statement as a nationally elected prime minister and set out the priorities for what he called “our new one-nation government, a people’s government”.It was a speech sprinkled with conciliation, careful to offer gratitude to Labour voters who had lent the Conservatives their vote, and to stress respect for “your feelings of warmth and gratitude” towards Europe. Whether they believe him or not, after a campaign littered with lies and disinformation, will be open to question.His government’s first priority would be the NHS, he said, and it would “unite and level up” the country, “bringing together the whole of this incredible United Kingdom: England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland”.Britain now has five years to discover the truth or otherwise of those promises."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f538720f6dba2f5be1fa9505748852badbf32c3/0_324_5783_3470/master/5783.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d1ebcd87fa4f0e872e13af7aed8e5f5","title":"things cant get worse wrexham turns tory amid welsh labour losses","story":"Seat held by Labour since 1935 was one of six to switch to ConservativesThere was jubilation among Conservatives in Wales as the party achieved its best results since the heyday of Margaret Thatcher, even winning in once rock-solid Labour seats such as Wrexham, which has never before returned a Tory MP.Labour remained the biggest party in Wales with 22 of the 40 seats, down six on 2017, while the Tories were up six on 14. Plaid Cymru held on to its four seats.Among the winners for the Tories was the former Welsh secretary Alun Cairns, who quit the cabinet at the start of the campaign after a row about what he had known about a former aide’s involvement in the collapse of a rape trial. Despite the scandal, he held on to his seat in the Vale of Glamorgan in south Wales.People who had backed Labour all their life deserted the party. At one of the covered markets in the town centre, Mike Evans, a butcher, said he had voted Tory but sighed when asked if he liked Boris Johnson. “I think he’s the best of a bad bunch,” he said.Evans’ family has run a butcher’s business since 1911 – even longer than Labour has held Wrexham. He has voted Labour in the past but said: “I didn’t believe in Jeremy Corbyn’s policies – his changes to public services went too far. We’d have gone backwards. Wrexham has been Labour for too long. We need a change. Things can’t get worse.”Boris Johnson’s Brexit message resonated among Welsh Labour leave voters. Steven Vale, the owner of Caroline’s Viennese Patisserie in Central Arcade, used to vote Labour but has no time for Corbyn and voted Tory this time.He said: “It’s about time people realised there’s more to politics than Labour. Especially when we’ve lost all the industry, the coalmines, the steelworks. We’ve had a Labour Welsh government for 20 years. Have they tried to improve the hospitals? All they do is blame the government in Westminster for not giving them enough money.”Yvette Moss, a local government worker, said she had stuck with Labour. “This place was decimated by Maggie Thatcher. I’ve seen how austerity has affected local government and people at the lower end.”The soul-searching was beginning for Labour activists. Mary Wimbury, the defeated Labour candidate in Wrexham, said Corbyn had to go. “He was by far the biggest issue on the doorstep,” she said.Adrienne Jeorrett, a hard-working Labour councillor in Wrexham, said she was shocked at the size of the Tory win there. “I don’t understand how people are not seeing what I’m seeing – the homelessness, the food banks, the holiday hunger, the period poverty, the increase in children being taken into care,” she said.“How are people not understanding that’s because we’ve got a Tory government. Am I wrong? Am I in a bubble? Why aren’t people drawing the dots? I find it very distressing. I just don’t understand. It’s very painful.”Jeorrett added: “We do have to look at the leadership. They really, really need to listen to Labour party members and what our experience has been. They have got to listen to those conversations we have with people.”The Labour leader in Wales, Mark Drakeford, a Corbyn ally, sent his congratulations to Johnson, with the reminder that he only had a majority in England.Delwyn Derrick, a Plaid Cymru supporter, said he was angry that so much attention was being paid to Johnson’s “amazing majority”. “It’s only a majority in England, not in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland,” he said.Derrick said a Tory MP was bad news for Wrexham. “This is a working-class town. My grandfather would be turning in his grave. But the area voted for leave and that’s made a lot of people lean towards Boris Johnson and the Tories. Brexit has polarised people.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffc781b69cca0e14ba04ec2ef26bfd469b1e874f/0_0_4574_2744/master/4574.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27b475b50fdd4eabfff39d8fc929a240","title":"working class voters desert labour stoke on trent england red wall","story":"Party shaken by possibly terminal decline of tribal loyalty in Welsh and northern England heartlandsOn 9 September 1981, the Norwegian football commentator Bjørge Lillelien famously celebrated his national team’s 2-1 victory over England in a World Cup qualifier. Alternating between English and his first language, he lost himself in a list of English notables and icons: “Lord Nelson, Lord Beaverbrook, Sir Winston Churchill, Sir Anthony Eden, Clement Attlee, Henry Cooper, Lady Diana … vi har slått dem alle sammen, vi har slått dem alle sammen.” The latter words roughly translate as: “We have beaten them all.”At Manor sports complex in Fenton, one of the six towns that make up the city of Stoke-on-Trent, the early hours of Friday morning presented a similar spectacle. As the counting of ballot papers went on, local Conservative activists gazed in awe at TV screens filled with the names of once-solid Labour seats that were falling to the Tories.On and on the list went: from Bolsover, the Nottinghamshire home turf of the 87-year-old Dennis Skinner, through Burnley, Derby North and the Yorkshire seat of Don Valley, to North West Durham, won by the supposed Labour leadership hopeful Laura Pidcock in 2017 with a majority of nearly 9,000, but lost on Thursday, to gasps of surprise.By way of a climax, 4am brought confirmation that all three constituencies in Stoke – once a byword for a deeply Labour culture of potteries, coalmines, and trade unionism – were now blue. The assembled Tories repeatedly roared with delight Labour faces, including that of Ruth Smeeth, the Jewish former MP who became a harried and marginalised symbol of the party’s antisemitism crisis, were painted with expressions of shock and disbelief.Such was the story of the “red wall”, the expanse of Labour-held seats running from north Wales through the Midlands to the north east of England that was held to be crucial to a Boris Johnson win, and that the Tories reduced to political rubble. Just about all of them registered majorities in favour of leaving the EU. What happened on Thursday exceeded the expectations of all the pollsters, and sealed the sense that this election heralded a possibly historic realignment.It is often missed by accounts of Theresa May’s premiership as an endless disaster, but the groundwork was laid in 2017, when May’s Brexit offer packaged with the promise of a “strong and stable” government sent Tory vote shares in many post-industrial seats skyward. There were omens for the 2019 result in Labour’s 2017 losses of Walsall North, Stoke-on-Trent South, Mansfield, North East Derbyshire and Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland.Then, Smeeth held on, despite a rise in the Tory vote of nearly 18 percentage points. This time, the Conservatives’ support went up by a relatively modest 2,000 votes, while Labour’s fell by 6,500, a reflection of the broader national picture. Her seat had turned blue.Two weeks ago, the  embarked on a tour of four such seats for the video series Anywhere but Westminster. All four seats were lost by Labour on Thursday. We began in Wolverhampton South West, the West Midlands constituency once held by the Tory politician Enoch Powell. At a shopping parade, we spoke to about 20 people from a variety of backgrounds and could not find a single person who said they were going to vote Labour.A teacher said Corbyn’s lack of a clear position on Brexit had simply “lost me”, while a British-Asian man whose job involved caring for children with autism said Labour no longer represented a credible opposition. There were similar stories in the eastern coastal seat of Great Grimsby, which Labour had held for 74 years. We met a primary school teaching assistant who seemed an archetypal Labour voter, but said she could not bring herself to support the party. “I really don’t like Corbyn,” she said. Her friend, who worked in the petrochemicals industry, nodded in agreement. In 2016, she had voted remain. “I don’t like his neutral stance on Brexit,” she said. “We all know he’s a leaver. Why can’t he just say it?”Other people questioned whether Corbyn would be a suitable prime minister. And why, three years after the 2016 referendum, the UK had yet to leave the EU. “They don’t listen to what we want – Brexit,” one woman in Worksop told us, with palpable anger. “What’s the point in having a democratic country if they’re not going to listen to the voters in the first place?” Set against this fundamental mistrust, promises to end child poverty and a £6,500-a-year windfall for every household were perhaps going to struggle to be believed.Woven into this is the death of the assumption that with enough cajolery, the party’s lost tribes will, as the trade union leader Len McCluskey recently put it, “come home to Labour”. Such an idea now seems woefully misjudged, along with an array of allied assumptions: that of the “Labour heartlands”, the party’s “core vote” – perhaps even the previously symbiotic link between being working class and supporting Labour.Clearly, working-class communities do not represent a monolithic social bloc, and the idea that “working class” is synonymous with “white” is deeply misplaced. But over the past six weeks we repeatedly met voters in the C2, D or E social grades whose distance from Labour became less and less surprising.In Stoke, Smeeth told us, the gravity of Labour’s defeats suggested an existential crisis, something she said she was looking forward to trying to fix. “Unless something significant changes, I don’t know what the Labour party is for. We don’t represent the people we were created to represent,” she said.We spent an hour before the count for her seat shadowing Labour’s canvassers in the town of Tunstall. Darkness had long since fallen, and Smeeth and her comrades – including Jewish people who had travelled hundreds of miles to help her campaign – were knocking on their final doors of the night, trying to convince potential Labour supporters to go to the polling station before it closed.At one house, a fiftysomething man answered the door. “Have you voted?” Smeeth asked.

But since last month a number of exposés have reported claims it was pressuring young members to beg, borrow and steal money for the church.This week HuffPost UK reported allegations that some Spac Nation members had taken teenagers to donate blood for medical trials, in a practice known as “bleeding for seed”. The church denies the claim.The commission said Spac Nation had been subject to a regulatory compliance case since April 2018 after it received reports about safeguarding and financial concerns. This summer it issued the charity with an action plan that required a response from trustees by November. Information contained within that response “raised further concerns about the charity’s financial controls, policy and procedures,” it said.“Of immediate concern to the commission is that substantial amounts of charity money are held in cash,” the commission said in a statement. “As a protective measure, the commission has issued an order under section 84 of the Charities Act, requiring the charity to bank its money.“The commission is also concerned about the apparent lack of clarity between the personal, business and charity roles of leaders within the charity.”The commission said it had opened the inquiry after allegations emerged that iniduals had been encouraged to give money to the charity by taking on personal debt.A commission spokesperson said: “Charities exist to improve lives and strengthen society the issues that have been raised related to Spac Nation in recent weeks are highly concerning, even more so as the allegations are entirely at odds with the expectations about the way that charities will operate.“The opening of this inquiry is an important step that will allow us to examine these concerns further and establish the facts. We will seek to provide assurance to the public and the community that these matters will be considered fully and, where necessary, resolved.”A report with the commission’s findings is expected to be published once the investigation is concluded.In a statement from its board of trustees, Spac Nation said the inquiry was “needful to lay to rest some unverified allegations”. It added: “Inquiry is what we have always asked for. If anything is found wrong we will adjust it, and if not we will keep going strong.“If any pastor or leader is caught pressuring people to donate, such leader will be expelled without delay, not to talk of pressuring to donate blood for money. We encourage people to donate blood and all they can for the community but we also say not for money ever, that just won’t happen here.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90d8a19496cd647ac94cef0a1136582cb6b0cf37/0_184_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6979eec2e82315c20e0b324d25832b76","title":"rewilding how trees for life are renewing the highlands","story":"Helped by volunteers, Trees for Life planted nearly 2m native trees on its Scottish projects. It wants to plant millions more The bracken-clad hills are marked “Dundreggan forest” on the map but this Scottish glen is mostly stark Highland scenery: open, beautiful, and almost totally devoid of trees.On a steep-sided little gully, 40 years ago, a few baby silver birches escaped relentless browsing by red deer and grew tall. Now, the nearby path through the bracken is dusted with thousands of brown specks: birch seeds.“Each year, this ‘forest’ produces trillions of birch seed,” says Doug Gilbert, the operations manager for the charity Trees for Life at Dundreggan. “Until we reduce the deer pressure, not a single one has grown into a tree. Once we get the deer population right, this forest will absolutely take off. It’s starting to do that now.”The charity purchased the Dundreggan hunting estate 11 years ago. Slowly – “at tree speed,” smiles Gilbert – it is rewilding 4,000 hectares (10,000 acres) of this degraded Highland landscape, restoring a ersity of native trees, scrub and associated life, from the dark bordered beauty moth to black grouse and, yes, red deer.Trees for Life is one of four charities chosen for the  and Observer’s 2019 climate emergency appeal, each of which is committed to renewing nature and the planet by planting and protecting trees, forests and woodland. Increasingly, Trees for Life’s aims – to revive Scotland’s native forests with practical rewilding that includes Scottish people at its heart – are chiming with the times. During the general election campaign, politicians desperately tried to outbid each other with tree-planting pledges. Who doesn’t love a tree? More trees can tackle the climate crisis – absorbing carbon dioxide – and the bioersity crisis. But Trees for Life’s efforts reveal it is not quite so simple.The first step at Dundreggan has been to increase deer culling. Ecologists calculate that a red deer population of five per sq km in the wider landscape will allow natural regeneration in many Highland regions it is 20. But culling deer is controversial because the value of stalking that estates base on deer numbers. Trees for Life has proceeded slowly with culling, seeking positive dialogue with neighbouring stalking estates. They’ve also tried non-lethal methods such as bagpipe-playing volunteers acting as nocturnal deer scarers. Trees and deer can coexist and Dundreggan’s deer population is now at a level where some young birches, pines, rowans and junipers will grow tall.“We would like to let the trees come on their own,” says Steve Micklewight, the chief executive. “But because this land has been so bare for so long, there isn’t the erse seed source to make this happen.”So, helped by volunteers, Trees for Life has planted nearly 2 million native trees so far at Dundreggan and on its other Scottish projects. It wants to plant millions more.All the trees come from Scottish seeds – meaning they are suited to Highland climates and species, as well as being free of novel diseases. Half have been grown from seeds collected around Dundreggan. Its on-site nursery bristles with 94,000 saplings.Seed-collecting is not as simple as it sounds. Seed must come from a wide variety of inidual trees to ensure genetic ersity. Cones from Scots pines have to be harvested before they drop to the ground, so specialist tree-climbers are employed. Trees for Life specialises in growing non-commercial high-mountain species such as woolly willow and dwarf birch. Surviving specimens are often only found on cliffs and crevices – with seeds or cuttings only retrievable by specialist climbers.Because of the deer grazing, every sapling is planted within a fenced enclosure (costing £10 per metre). Fencing is “a little bit of an admission of failure,” says Gilbert. In the long term, when reducing deer numbers becomes less controversial, trees won’t need fences. Gilbert hopes the fences will last 30 years, when the well-established trees and scrub will survive browsing deer.At first, Dundreggan’s biggest fenced enclosure looks dominated by bracken. But crouch down, and the horizon is fuzzy with young trees: downy birch, rowan, and plump little Scots pines. There are no straight lines – it is emphatically not a “plantation” like the rigid blocks of non-native sitka spruce on the far side of the glen. (Trees for Life are concerned that politicians’ tree-planting pledges will lead to new non-native commercial plantations, which are disastrous for most wildlife).At Dundreggan, life is beginning to return. A black grouse shoots up and a raven scuds on the wind, prospecting for the small mammals and young birds in the burgeoning scrub. Gilbert has a better word for scrub: elfin forest.“It’s getting to the blue touch-paper stage,” says Micklewight. “You plant the trees and not much visible happens for seven years as the roots slowly build. Then it suddenly moves quite fast. We’re just about to see that at Dundreggan. The trees in the ground enable the landscape to take off.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c37101f6976d40847fbabf6da175a57746eaf60d/0_100_3356_2014/master/3356.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=964cc6c9e9b69b58b36b29c94c0bc6d2","title":"australia v new zealand first test day three live","story":"13th over: Australia 25-0 (Warner 17, Burns 7) Wagner carries on, mostly full to Warner this over, who takes five balls to get a run to fine leg. Wagner bowling in the low 130 kph region in this over, it will be interesting to see whether he can get his pace back up as he warms into his spell. 12th over: Australia 25-0 (Warner 16, Burns 7) Warner isn’t landing much on de Grandhomme. Finds mid-off with a drive, then tries a swat-pull shot to a ball that doesn’t get up high enough so that Warner misses by a foot. Finally he taps a run to point.11th over: Australia 24-0 (Warner 15, Burns 7) Wagner is on for his first over. He’s had 24 hours’ break since his two days of marathon spells. What he wouldn’t have given for another night. Burns gets forward and drives a boundary through the covers for four. That’ll make him feel better.What is it with New Zealand’s luck and day-night Tests in Australia? “The flash on Lyon’s bat a few years back could have come from anywhere,” emails Nathan Green, “and the lack of a snicko on CDG’s gloves could have come from anywhere too.”10th over: Australia 20-0 (Warner 15, Burns 3) Eventually de Grandhomme gets a couple wrong, on leg stump for Burns who gets a single, then Warner who gets four. Now then, New Zealand will review! A short ball that surprises Warner zooms past the glove, hits his shoulder and loops to second slip. There’s a good take ing forward. Aleem Dar says not out, Williamson reviews.Now then. This is basically Colin de Grandhomme’s dismissal all over again, except that the umpire on the field has said not out this time, and out the other time. It’s inconclusive around the glove, so the TV umpire has no choice but to go with the original call. New Zealand are not getting the rub of the green. 9th over: Australia 15-0 (Warner 11, Burns 2) Southee bowls nicely to Warner from around the wicket, angling in with some swing and Warner is squared up, sparring to cover his off stump and nearly edging behind. A maiden in the end.8th over: Australia 15-0 (Warner 11, Burns 2) Joe Burns is really starting to sweat on that first run. Gets a straight ball from de Grandhomme but hits it to midwicket and can’t score. Then finally he gets a skewed push that goes accidentally into a gap at cover and gets him down the wicket, then back for a second. Ok. Deep breath. What’s next?7th over: Australia 13-0 (Warner 11, Burns 0) Warner frees his arms to redirect Southee behind point, and that takes him to 7001 runs in Test cricket. He’s got his average back up to 48.6 and has 23 Test hundreds. It’s a pretty remarkable record, before you even add in what he’s done in the shorter formats. 6th over: Australia 9-0 (Warner 7, Burns 0) A familiar pattern, with Warner pushing a single to the off side and Burns seeing out the rest from de Grandhomme.5th over: Australia 8-0 (Warner 6, Burns 0) Warner squirts Southee away off the inside edge, and Burns is immediately back on strike. Needs to find a way to relax and just play. He can’t get off the mark in these next five balls either.4th over: Australia 7-0 (Warner 6, Burns 0) Joe Burns really isn’t comfortable at the moment. He’s nervous after a couple of low scores, I fancy. Fair enough, given how fast he’s been dropped repeatedly through his career. He nearly gets a duck here, hesitantly pushing at de Grandhomme, getting an inside edge, and turning to watch it bounce over his middle stump.3rd over: Australia 7-0 (Warner 6, Burns 0) Southee to Warner, who is blocking anything on a good length but pounces on the one full delivery to drive it straight for four! So clear in his thinking and his execution at the moment. 2nd over: Australia 3-0 (Warner 2, Burns 0) We’re back, and Colin de Grandhomme will open the bowling after lunch rather than Neil Wagner. Perhaps looking for some swing early while saving Wagner to change things up with the short ball. No run off the bat for Burns who keeps leaving outside off stump, but the first ball of the over was an overstep that Warner knocked away for a run. So Australia wrapped up the Kiwis for a paltry score in that session and have declined to invoke the follow-on with a bowler down. There’s half the Test match yet ahead of them to forge a bigger lead.What are the tactics from here? Will Australia put the foot to the floor for two hours and then declare to make New Zealand bat under lights once again? Or bat long into the fourth day to declare then? The first option would be tempting, if the Aussies could batter 150 runs or so in the next couple of hours. But the second could really steamroll the whole New Zealand team, making them do another three sessions in the field before batting again. I suspect that’s what will end up happening, unless NZ can find a rush of wickets from somewhere.1st over: Australia 1-0 (Warner 1, Burns 0) Tim Southee to bowl this one over before the lunch break then. Wide of the off stump and Warner leaves. On the leg stump, Warner glances a single. Burns gets to leave a couple, then block the sixth. Australia make it through that little bit of discomfort.They’re 250 behind but Australia will not enforce the follow-on. And with about a dozen minutes until the lunch break, Australia will have to come back on and face an over or two before that interval. That’s the only thing that hasn’t gone their way though. They started this morning with the prospect that Taylor and Watling could bat stubbornly into the day, but in the end they’ve been able to take those wickets and wrap New Zealand up within a session. Excellent bowling by Starc, with sustained hostility throughout, while Cummins was typically excellent and Lyon played his part as well. The licence is taken, but it doesn’t last long. First ball against Lyon this over, Southee gallops down the track to aim a big drive down the ground, doesn’t get near the pitch of the ball, and slices a fat outside edge high and into the hands of the sub fielder at point. It’s all over.55th over: New Zealand 166-9 (Southee 8, Ferguson 0) Lockie Ferguson has come out to bat. He has a calf strain, so I can’t imagine he’ll be dashing any singles. That will certainly give Southee licence to line up the fence if he wants to. Ferguson watches two leg-breaks go by.He can do no wrong! Three hundreds on the trot, and a wicket to top it off. The leg-spinner coming around the wicket, very wide on the crease, angled in, and the left-handed Santner aims a big drive. Misses it and loses his stumps.54th over: New Zealand 166-8 (Santner 2, Southee 8) A maiden for Lyon bowling to Southee, who maintains his position as a model of restraint.53rd over: New Zealand 166-8 (Santner 2, Southee 8) Starc’s foray is over, Labuschagne is back. Southee drives a single. Santner whacks a ball straight back past the bowler who claims to have got a touch on it before it hits the stumps. Labuschagne got out that way himself in the UAE last year so he would like to get one back and level the ledger. But on the replay Southee’s bat is down in time.52nd over: New Zealand 165-8 (Santner 2, Southee 7) The clear incentive, I suppose, for Southee to play sensibly is that it’s still half an hour short of lunch, it’s 40 degrees out there, and if he isn’t out there batting then he’ll have to be out there bowling and fielding. It’s much less strenuous to be blocking a few off-breaks out with the bat than running in with the ball. So Southee defends and defends until he gets a thick outside edge from Lyon for three runs, with the sub fielder Michael Neser chasing back and ing to save a run.51st over: New Zealand 162-8 (Santner 2, Southee 5) A maiden for Starc, as Santner defends and leaves with determination. 50th over: New Zealand 162-8 (Santner 2, Southee 4) Lyon to Southee, who again doesn’t try to hit a six but only gets a thick bottom edge past his stumps for four, between keeper and slip.49th over: New Zealand 158-8 (Santner 2, Southee 0) Tim Southee has more Test sixes than AB de Villiers, Ben Stokes, Ian Botham, Sachin Tendulkar, Sanath Jayasuriya, David Warner... aiming for number 73 today to match Ricky Ponting. But Mitchell Starc won’t be so easy to hit. A single and a leg bye, as neither batsman can do much convincing. 48th over: New Zealand 156-8 (Santner 1, Southee 0) Santner gets a single first ball of the over, and Southee somehow restrains himself from trying to slog five consecutive balls over the rope. Good grief.Starc gets five. In controversial fashion though. Colin de Grandhomme has been batting beautifully. He batters a boundary with a pull shot, a boundary with a cut, and then gets a short ball zooming through a tangle of arms and gloves to hit his helmet and bounce to slip. Aleem Dar has a long think before dismissing the batsman, who immediately reviews. On the replay it doesn’t look like he’s hit it, but it’s not entirely conclusive that the ball has missed the glove before hitting the helmet. So Marais Erasmus upstairs decides that he can’t overturn the on-field decision, and the batsman is out. Last ball of the over.46th over: New Zealand 147-7 (de Grandhomme 15) Drinks now, with Taylor’s wicket, and New Zealand are in strife. Santner in next.A brilliant spell of bowling by Lyon! He’s been all over Taylor, making the batmsan look increasingly anxious. Taylor misses a sweep, which is his shot to get off strike. Lyon looks especially dangerous when the ball doesn’t turn, going on past Taylor’s edge. Taylor nails a rare half-volley but Travis Head es and saves it one-handed at cover before bouncing up and hitting the stumps direct, nearly snaring Taylor as the batsman es back in. That’s a team-lifting effort, and frustrating for the batsman. So Taylor, back in his shell, just prods in defence at the last ball of the over, a delivery full enough to reach for and drive, but instead the batsman hangs back and when the ball doesn’t turn it takes his edge to slip! Chalk up part of that wicket to Travis Head, but it was exceptional from Lyon. You could feel the tension building for Taylor, and now it breaks.45th over: New Zealand 147-6 (Taylor 80, de Grandhomme 15) Marnus settling into his work, and he’s getting some turn with his leggies. Trying to land just outside off stump to force drives through the off side. Both batsmen take him up on it, taking singles to the cover sweeper. There’s one slip in, Smith there. A short third man in Warner and a backward point in Burns. A regulation cover, then Head back on the rope. Strong off-side field. Three singles from the over.44th over: New Zealand 144-6 (Taylor 78, de Grandhomme 14) Lyon, with his nude pate shining in the sun, his arms swinging across his body like a clock’s before he unfurls at the bowling crease. This time de Grandhomme’s first-ball shot is worth two, playing it behind point this time. The batsmen trade singles, couple of yelps for a catch as de Grandhomme plunges forward to defend balsl that are bouncing substantially.43rd over: New Zealand 140-6 (Taylor 77, de Grandhomme 11) Again de Grandhomme gets off strike first ball with a drive, and Taylor soaks up the rest of the Labsuchagne over. Lots of encouragement from Paine behind the stumps.42nd over: New Zealand 139-6 (Taylor 77, de Grandhomme 10) The double spin attack now, with Lyon partnering Marnus. In an ideal world New Zealand would like to be able to go after these two, hit them out of the attack, and put the pressure back on Australia by making their fast bowlers come back and exhaust themselves. But with six wickets down NZ can’t take that risk.Tell you what, they won’t have much chance of hitting Lyon anywhere based on that first over. A single first up to de Grandhomme, but Taylor gets a hand grenade that explodes back through the gate, then a ball that keeps its line and bounces over the attempted cut.41st over: New Zealand 138-6 (Taylor 77, de Grandhomme 9) Indeed, here’s the first bowling change already. Labuschagne’s leg-breaks will be the next on the menu. Jeet Raval’s part-time stuff got substantial turn yesterday. Marnus is more of a skiddy bowler, faster through the air and with more topspin. He drags down first ball and Taylor pulls two runs, denied two more by a good ing save behind square. Taylor cuts a run next ball. I wonder how long de Grandhomme can restrain himself from trying to put Labuschagne in the stands. He drives a single along the ground first up. Taylor cuts twice and should have eight runs really, but finds backward point both times. 40th over: New Zealand 134-6 (Taylor 74, de Grandhomme 8) Cummins carries on with the short-pitched attack to Taylor, too much angle on these bouncers from the right-armer which go across Taylor and almost outside leg stump. Tim Paine is going as far towards a Douglas Jardine field as the rules allow: two in the deep behind square leg, then three just in front, one next to the batsman for the edge off the pad, one at regulation square for the top edge, and one on the rope for the full-blooded pull. Regardless, Taylor keeps playing the shot. Not the smartest strategy given Australia’s two premier quicks will need a break soon. But he gets a single to ground, then de Grandhomme slams a full ball past the bowler in the air for four. 39th over: New Zealand 129-6 (Taylor 73, de Grandhomme 4) Another single immediately for de Grandhomme from Starc, eased behind point, then Taylor is back on strike. He hasn’t faced much, hasn’t scored much, and hasn’t looked comfortable, but he is still New Zealand’s main hope. Has to just get through this short barrage. It is a barrage though, and Taylor gloves the ball just in front of slip! Fast from Starc, hitting Taylor’s fingers on the bat handle and just dying before reaching Smith in the cordon! Good bowling. Taylor looks a little desperate as he takes on a pull shot next ball and meets fresh air, again looking every chance to glove down the leg side. Third time is also lucky, as he finally gets a pull shot out of the middle, Starc’s bouncer not getting up above chest high, and Taylor clobbers four behind square. Then he bails out of another against a great short ball that zings over his front shoulder on its angle across him. Yet another pull shot finishes the over, this one mistime and limping away in the air for a fortunate run. 38th over: New Zealand 123-6 (Taylor 68, de Grandhomme 3) New Zealand’s next hope is Colin de Grandhomme, and Mitch Santner in next just made his first Test hundred the other week against England. Tough task for them up against Cummins and Starc though. The new batsman gets started with a drive through cover for three. He tends to like to get on with things. Another good bit of bowling from Cummins! He’s been landing the ball on a perfect length often today, and moving it into the right-handed batsmen. This time Watling is anticipating that inward movement, pushing to cover it, and the ball goes a bit the other way. Suddenly his hands are outside the line of his body and he’s getting a thick inside edge back onto his stumps! Huge wicket, Watling can bat some seriously long hours in Test cricket.37th over: New Zealand 119-5 (Taylor 68, Watling 2) Starc bowling with a bat-pad catcher on both sides of the wicket now, so the bowler has to do the fielding himself when Taylor pushes a run towards mid-on. Watling plays more decisively, a handsome off-drive for two as Starc pitches up. Wade doing the fielding. He might be called upon with the ball again today, with Australia short of seam options. Starc full again to Watling, with the short leg removed. There’s some excitement behind the wicket as Watling misses his next drive, but the sound was bat hitting turf, missing ball by a distance.36th over: New Zealand 116-5 (Taylor 67, Watling 6) Cummins bowls a beauty. One ball after Watling drives a full ball down the ground for four, Cummins gets a ball to hit a crack, seam in at the batsman, and keep low. The pitch is starting to break up on this third day, with cracking along the length of the wicket in true Perth style. Hard not to love this new stadium’s surface. 35th over: New Zealand 112-5 (Taylor 67, Watling 2) Taylor is starting rusty this morning. Short down leg side again from Starc, and Taylor wafts a pull that doesn’t threaten much except a glove to the keeper. Starc has a leg gully and a long leg behind square, then a short square leg and a deep square leg in front of the line. Only two fielders allowed behind square leg, as per the old Bodyline amended rules.All of that planning, then New Zealand nearly hand over a wicket with a run-out. Paine has made a mess of that. So did Taylor. He should have run himself out last night while batting with Williamson, and this time he burns Watling. Taylor knocks away a run to point, turns for the second, Watling honours the call, then Taylor bails out and turns back. Watling has to do the same, at the striker’s end. He’s miles out. He’s gone. Lyon throws in. And then Paine, having come up to the stumps, fumbles the take. I think he was distracted by Labuschagne, who had run in from short leg to the stumps to try to take the ball as well. Between the two of them they mess up a straightforward chance, and Watling survives. He adds a single next ball like none of that ever happened.34th over: New Zealand 110-5 (Taylor 66, Watling 1) Pat Cummins starts from the other end, and his first ball is beautifully on the money. A hint of movement, snaking in at the off stump, making Watling defend. His second, a similar line but seaming in from a slightly shorter length, taking a small nick from Watling’s inside edge before thudding into the pad. Too high to prompt an appeal. Fuller next ball and Watling digs at it. A maiden.33rd over: New Zealand 110-5 (Taylor 66, Watling 1) We’re away! Watling to face the first ball, Starc bowling it. A low full toss that Watling blocks, then a ball on his pads that the Kiwi keeper can knock away to get off the mark. Taylor comes on strike and immediately Starc is bouncing him. Ricky Ponting on the TV is analysing vision from last night, saying that Taylor was least assured against the short ball. Took his eyes off it, often had his feet off the ground. That will likely be the mode of attack today then, and it is, though Starc bowls too much down the leg side. Today is International Ross Taylor Day. He’s the great hope for New Zealand to stay in this contest. New Zealand are five wickets down already, but both teams are short a bowler, with Josh Hazlewood doing his hamstring last night and Lockie Ferguson his calf. So a lot rides on Taylor’s innings. If he can bat through the first wave of attack from Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc, then Australia won’t have a huge amount in the way of reserves. It will come down to a spin focus with Nathan Lyon and the part-timer Marnus Labuschagne, though Lyon should get some bounce and turn out of this surface and could be the key bowler in his own right. But Taylor looked a million bucks last night after some early jitters between the wickets. He clouted his way to 66 as the wickets fell at the other end. He made 290 last time he played a Test in Perth, across the river at the Waca, and this year he’s been in some of the best form of his life.If Taylor goes early today though, then NZ could be bundled out cheaply and would have to bowl again through the heat of the day, after doing that twice already. Australia would pile up a huge lead and then Lyon would have plenty to bowl at in the fourth innings. So a lot rides on this.If, contrarily, Taylor can bat long with BJ Watling, then New Zealand have the better bowling balance with a true all-rounder in Colin de Grandhomme to boost their attack. Starc was an irrepressible force last night, but it remains to be seen what he’s like here during the day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f6579e00bbced60a033dbfd9ecbe0fc64f17f45/215_149_4555_2733/master/4555.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f876350d5348f8d695cf076cfe7cb4e9","title":"club 2b review belgrade theatre coventry","story":"Belgrade theatre, CoventryCharacters including The Great Gatsby’s Daisy round on a Greek god in this bewildering Christmas showThe setting is a cabaret-style jazz club with saxophonist, drummer, blackjack table and finger food. Our host is Z, a 1920s incarnation of the Greek god Zeus, who is performing a rap in a natty suit. “Before the Trumps and the Johnsons there was Zeus,” he says, and the reference feels apt for election night.The rap, performed by Corey Campbell, is an intriguing start to a Christmas show, co-produced by Strictly Arts theatre company, that promises “an exhilarating trip through time”, with mythic characters making appearances. What follows is original but incoherent, with the drama performed around the room and woven together with song and dance. The central story revolves around Zeus and ancient goddess Hera (Iona Coburn). He is yearning for her (“I keep hearing her voice”) but she spurns him, with accusations of infidelity.Characters such as Lady Goa (Charis McRoberts) and The Great Gatsby’s Daisy Buchanan (Aimee Powell) speak snippets of their own stories but channel Hera’s rage as well. The female characters seem to converge towards the end as they round on Zeus and accuse him of “erasing” them and “rewriting” their histories. Even if it is a strong feminist message, it is slightly bewildering in this context.The spoken scenes are too short and tenuously linked to build a satisfying enough narrative, while the singing and dancing are not always strong, though Powell and Campbell give good performances. There are glimmers in which the cast gathers into a physical formation to appear like a rowing boat or a cantering horse that are expressive, but these are the few, fleeting highlights. • At the Belgrade theatre, Coventry, until 31 December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/042cb2c3b3830f9d5d406c49a56e7e32f7f96d68/109_0_3281_1969/master/3281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dce18581546073d3434d4cc72b9169a","title":"tv tonight get glitterball ready for the strictly final","story":"The celebrity dance contest comes to an end for another year but who will you vote as the king and queen of the dance floor?

The more ambitious the trade deal, the more we need regulatory harmonisation.”The intervention from Macron came as the new commission president Ursula von der Leyen warned that the post-Brexit negotiations on the future relationship would drag on beyond 2020.Johnson has said he will not extend the 11-month transition period, during which the UK will stay in the single market and customs union, but that this provides “ample” time for a comprehensive deal on the future relationship to be finalised.Von der Leyen appeared to directly contradict the prime minister by warning that certain parts of the deal would need to be prioritised, including trade in goods, fisheries and security cooperation, but that others, potentially including the arrangements for the financial services sector, would be left for later.“We will have to prioritise,” Von der Leyen said at the end of a two-day leaders’ summit in Brussels. “We will put specific focus on those issues that were an economic cliff edge at the end of 2020 if they would not be done. Why is that? These are issues where we have neither a framework to fall back on nor the possibility to take unilateral contingency measures covering the period after 1 January 2021.”Von der Leyen described the plan as a matter of “sequencing” adding that “there will be more emphasis on a certain ranking”.The size of Johnson’s majority has been welcomed in Brussels, where the 27 heads of state and government have gathered for a two-day summit.Charles Michel, the European council president, said he expected the withdrawal agreement to be passed through parliament within weeks to allow the UK to leave on 31 January.“We expect as soon as possible a vote by the British parliament on the withdrawal agreement,” Michel said.EU leaders believe the Conservative majority will give Johnson free rein to decide his negotiating objectives and compromise in the talks where necessary.EU leaders are now waiting to see what incarnation of the prime minister will emerge now he is secure in Downing Street.The new Brexit deal is essentially the old\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspdeal with a new chapter on the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland and a few key tweaks to the political declaration. Here is a\u0026nbsplink to the full text.The backstop has essentially been replaced by a full stop whereby Northern Ireland remains aligned to the EU from the end of the transition period for at least four years. A change can only happen if it is voted on by the Stormont assembly.Stormont will have a key role in future Brexit arrangements. And if there is cross-community support to remain aligned to the EU rather than the UK the consent will hold for eight years.The arrangements in this deal will automatically kick in for a mandated four years if there is a breakdown in trade talks, so it remains a “backstop” but with a permanent tinge.That four-year period will start at the end of December 2020.Two months before the end of the four-year period, that is October 2024, Stormont will be asked to vote on whether to remain aligned to the EU in ways outlined by this deal or not.Under the deal, the UK and the EU are “underlining their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland”.The EU and the UK will aim for a zero-tariff deal with unlimited quotas. The entire UK, including Northern Ireland, will be free to sign trade deals. The line in the political declaration that “the United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas” in any future trade talks has been ditched.Northern Ireland will remain legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. There will therefore be no customs checks on the border but tariffs will be payable on certain commercial goods.No customs duties will be payable on “personal property” being transited from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That protects online shopping and all items bought for personal rather than commercial use.Customs duties will be payable on goods imported from the UK for commercial use unless it can be demonstrated that the goods remain in Northern Ireland or are for personal use, as above.A system of rebates will allow importers to be reimbursed.The commitment to frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is restated.EU law on VAT will apply in Northern Ireland.The island of Ireland is considering a single market for electricity so homes in Northern Ireland can get their energy from a supplier in Northern Ireland or the republic. There were fears this could be disrupted by Brexit. Under the Johnson deal, the provisions of union law remain so nothing will change.This guarantees that the UK will remain in line with EU conventions on climate, environment and workers rights in a future trade agreement.Johnson had initially approached the negotiations on the withdrawal agreement with bullish, uncompromising talk, but swiftly broke his red lines to concede to a customs border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, hinted at private assurances from Johnson that he would sign up to EU standards in order to secure a trade deal.“It’s a case of now getting on with it and I think the prospect is there to develop a new future economic partnership between the EU and UK, and one that’s going to be mighty and good for all of us.”There is a debate among the EU27 and with the European commission on what might be possible to negotiate between 31 January, when the UK is expected to leave, and the end of the transition period 11 months later.The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, conceded at the summit that it would be “quite a challenge given the short time available” to find agreement even on trade by the end of next year. “We have to discuss the precise approach to these negotiations,” he said.The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said her government would be pushing hard to maintain access to UK waters for Denmark’s fishing industry. “There is no doubt that fishing really matters,” she said.Satisfaction that there will now be clarity from the UK over the next steps has, however, been tempered by sadness at the its imminent departure.The Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, said: “It is obviously a giant success for Boris Johnson. He is a charismatic leader. He won and now they will leave, unfortunately. That is bad news for Europe.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec7b957e7098f96302e6e560fb14518d029c887e/0_204_6123_3674/master/6123.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0f7b1fe63d15a8c0d328090610fa960","title":"cryptocurrency exhumation gerald cotten investors canada","story":"Lawyers for customers of an insolvent cryptocurrency exchange have asked police to exhume the body of the company’s founder, amid efforts to recover about $190m in Bitcoin which were locked in an online black hole after his death.Miller Thomson LLP sent a letter to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on Friday, requesting authorities “conduct an exhumation and postmortem autopsy” on the body of Gerald Cotten, founder of QuadrigaCX, citing what the firm called the “questionable circumstances” around his death earlier this year.Citing “decomposition concerns”, lawyers requested the exhumation be completed no later than spring 2020.Gerald Cotten, 30, died abruptly in December 2018 of complications relating to Crohn’s disease while on honeymoon in Jaipur, India, with his wife, Jennifer Robertson. His body was repatriated to Canada and a funeral was held in Halifax, Nova Scotia.Soon after his death, however, reports surfaced that nearly 80,000 users of QuadrigaCX – at the time Canada’s largest cryptocurrency exchange – were unable to access funds totalling more $190m.Cotten was the only one with access to necessary permissions. While Robertson has possession of the laptop containing the necessary passwords, she remains locked out.“The laptop computer from which Gerry carried out the companies’ business is encrypted and I do not know the password or recovery key. Despite repeated and diligent searches, I have not been able to find them written down anywhere,” she said in court filings.Uncertainty about the missing funds has fueled speculation that Cotten may still be alive. In their letter to the RCMP the law firm underlined the “need for certainty around the question of whether Mr Cotten is in fact deceased”.They also found a substantial amount of money was used to fund a lavish lifestyle for the couple, including the use of private jets and luxury vehicles.

Photograph: James CrombieINPHOMinister for Sport Shane Ross will meet members of the board of the Football Association of Ireland on Monday for talks on the organisation’s future. The meeting will take place after requests from the association to “discuss the pressing challenges facing the organisation at this critical time”, the Department of Sport said in a statement. It comes as staff at the FAI expressed frustration after no clarity emerged on the future of the association during talks with management on Friday.Denis Hynes, the sectoral organiser representing FAI workers, said employees had sought clarity on a number of matters, including potential job losses, during a meeting between staff and management.“There was no information forthcoming at all, staff were disillusioned and disappointed with the outcome of the meeting,” he said. “Staff were very disappointed that they’re none the wiser.”The FAI has previously said there will be “consequences” for employees at the organisation arising from its deep financial difficulties, which have emerged following the departure of former chief executive and executive vice president John Delaney earlier this year. The organisation last week disclosed that liabilities had jumped to €55 million, and it is in technical breach of the covenants on its bank loans. It had a loss of almost €9 million in 2018, and restated accounts led to a surplus of €2.75 million to become a loss of €2.9 million. It is also facing a potential revenue tax bill of €2.7 million.Staff had asked at the meeting about job losses and the potential restoration of €2.9 million in state funding for the FAI, much of which goes to support community development officers. Employees also expressed frustration with the lack of progress on the appointment of four independent directors, which Minister for Sport Shane Ross has made one of the key conditions for the restoration of State support. Some staff are involved in a plan to reform the FAI, which would involve splitting the organisation into two separate structures. One would be charged with running the professional game, while a second would take responsibility for grassroots football.Threats to staffThe FAI made reports to gardaí after a number of threats were made against staff in letters sent to the organisation’s Abbotstown headquarters. In an email to staff last week, executive lead Paul Cooke said the organisation was putting “certain safety measures in place purely as a precautionary mechanism”. A wider review of security at the headquarters was also carried out. The FAI cancelled an agreed meeting with the Oireachtas Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport this week, saying key staff and board members were working on a refinancing of its bank debt and the appointment of independent directors, which it said would ultimately protect jobs.The association is waiting to hear whether an offer it has made to a new independent chairperson has been accepted. The FAI nominations committee made the offer this week, but does not know the identity of the person concerned. This is only known to the consultancy firm running the process on the FAI’s behalf. The candidate is making an assessment of the current difficulties at the FAI before accepting the offer.A further three independent directors have been identified by the same process, and will be given the chance to have a briefing about the FAI’s difficulties before deciding whether to take up an offer.

We are out of kilter with everywhere else”The Football Association of Ireland’s financial travails has dismayed and angered the public, but it will not dent the dreams of young Irish players and often their parents about pursuing a career in the professional game.Generations of young Irish footballers have made the journey to Britain to pursue a professional career, yet most are in the dark as to the realities of what they face.Today (Saturday) the first Irish football parents’ conference, to be held at Dublin City University (DCU), will offer information to parents whose children could become professional footballers.Organised by Stephen Finn, a former Shelbourne under-17 coach, sports journalist, FAI communications officer and now sports administrator, it will offer empirical, rather than anecdotal evidence about the realities to be faced.“I could come with a thousand sob stories. I just want to see what the evidence shows us. You need to make educated decisions,” says Finn, who offers startling statistics about the realities facing parents.Nearly 93 per cent of under-17 internationals across Europe play their club football at home. However, two-thirds of their Irish counterparts play club football abroad, far from family, relatives and friends.“In other countries it is not the norm to send kids away so early. We are out of kilter with everywhere else,” Finn tells The .Of the 176 under-17 Ireland internationals between 2008 and 2013, just nine (5 per cent) went on to win full caps with the senior team. A third were never capped again at any level.“Football is really bloody hard. It’s an incredibly difficult career to have,” he says.EducationEnglish clubs provide a BTEC (Business and Technology Education Council) qualification for footballers wanting to stay in education, but it is less than the Leaving Certificate or A Levels.“It’s not going to get you into university if football doesn’t work out. While they are providing a form of education, is it substantial enough to facilitate a kid going down the academic route if his football ambitions don’t bear fruit? These are the type of things that parents might not be aware of,” says Finn.He says young Irish footballers should finish the Leaving Cert before leaving. The highly sought after goalkeeper Gavin Bazuna did his final exams before joining Manchester City.Half of recent Ireland senior internationals did their Leaving Certificate. Everyone should, he believes.“If the kid goes away with the Leaving Certificate they have something to fall back on, and it takes away a lot of the pressure because it is a very difficult culture over there.”Former Ireland international Gareth Farrelly, who had a successful Premier League career with Everton and Bolton Wanderers, did not have his Leaving Cert when he left school at 17 to join Aston Villa in 1992.“Lots of people told me to stay and do my Leaving Certificate, but I wanted to play football,” he remembers now.He was offered a perfunctory education by the club in business and finance “but it was entirely tokenism”.“We were incredibly young, naïve, and immature. I didn’t understand the value of it. To us we were just footballers.”Plunged into a bullying culture perpetuated by the then youth team coach, Kevin MacDonald, Farrelly had “a very difficult time”.“I was one of the first kids to sign a three-year professional contract. I had a serious injury at the start which left me out of football for nine months.”However, he still encourages those with the skills to follow their stars.“Go for it. If you get presented with an exceptional opportunity, go and embrace it, and give it your best. You can structure your move in such a way that your education is a part of your journey.”He is a case in point and now practises as a solicitor in Liverpool.CareersParents attending DCU will hear parents of children who have already gone on to have careers as professional footballers, including Kevin Carroll, who played semi-professional football in England and lives in Lucan.Today his son Jake is at Motherwell his daughter Rebekah is a former Irish under-19 international, and another son Jordan is currently training with Motherwell while still on the books with Shamrock Rovers.Jake Carroll joined Huddersfield Town at the age of 22 in April 2013. He had studied for a degree in venture capitalism in Maynooth University and turned down an approach at the time from Bournemouth FC.Since then he has sustained a career in Britain with spells at Hartlepool United, Cambridge United and currently as left-back at Motherwell in the Scottish Premiership. Along the way he has learned to cope with knocks.“We really underestimate the changes that young Irish players have when they leave Ireland. Be careful what you wish for. It is fine if your son is Ronaldo or Messi, but the vast majority of players are experiencing far more lows than highs. You have to deal with all of those low points and to rebuild yourself to stay in the game.“Jake says the mental side is high at 80 per cent. If you are not mentally strong enough, regardless of your ability, you won’t make it.“It’s a very cold, calculated tough business. The mental strength of dealing with disappointment, the rejection that a lot face, and then there is the challenge of not going home to their families at the end of every day.”His son Jake picked up a knee injury while on loan to Partick Thistle\u0026nbspfrom Huddersfield. In the end his son drove “from Glasgow on New Year’s Eve injured to go in on New Year’s Day by himself for treatment. If you get injured at a club it’s a form of leprosy. They aren’t interested in you.”"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord s week varadkar set for family christmas in mumbai","story":"The Taoiseach is enjoying some rare time off over Christmas and this year promises to be a particularly special one for Leo Varadkar and his family.He will spend the big day at home in Ireland before the family flies to India to celebrate his father’s 80th birthday. It’s an “entirely personal” trip, said a spokesman, although we suspect the Taoiseach won’t escape his visit without a little bit of official attention and fuss.Leo’s parents met in England in the 1960s. Ashok, who was born in Mumbai, met his mother Miriam, a farmer’s daughter from Dungarvan, when he was a junior doctor in an English hospital and she was a student nurse. After their marriage, the couple moved to India for a few years before returning to live in Ireland.On the day their youngest child became Fine Gael leader and Taoiseach elect, he had a special word for his dad in his acceptance speech.“I know when my father travelled 5,000 miles to build a new home in Ireland, I doubt that he ever dreamed that one day his son would grow up to be its leader and despite his differences, his son would be judged by his actions not his identity. That despite his differences, his son would be treated the same and judged by his actions and character not his origins or identity°,” said an emotional Varadkar from the Mansion House stage.“Every proud parent in Ireland today can dream big dreams for their children.”And in turn, Leo and his sisters Sophia and Sonia are hugely proud of their parents. Ashok became a GP in Blanchardstown and Miriam ran the busy practice.This trip to Mumbai has been long in the planning. Leo visited India a few times when he was growing up and he also visited when he was minister for tourism.When he became Taoiseach in June 2017, it made big news in India. In the Mumbai suburb of Borivali some 55 members of the Varadkar family gathered to watch the count on the internet and celebrated when the result was announced.Donohoe plays with Super Mario“Welcome to Dublin Central, Mr Draghi,” said local TD Paschal Donohoe to the former head of the European Investment Bank when he arrived in the city on Thursday night for the annual Business \u0026amp Finance awards.

But it sailed right over Mario’s head.The Minister for Finance presented the Peter Sutherland leadership award to Draghi, who is a big rugby fan. Paschal told guests at the black tie awards banquet that the banker is a huge rugby fan. He invited Mario to join him in the Aviva stadium for a Six Nations game and said he would also love to bring him to Croker to watch a hurling match.Former taoiseach Enda Kenny presented the TK Whittaker award to Lord David Puttnam in recognition of his outstanding achievements and contribution to the arts, education and climate change.

Guests rushed to mute their phones and the event continued.After the ceremony, Paschal repaired to the upstairs bar in the company of Kenny and former finance minister Michael Noonan. They ensconced themselves on a sofa and sat talking into the early hours while getting the latest updates from the UK election count and posing for selfies with a steady stream of starstruck corporates.Marty Party comes to the DáilGreat excitement in the corridors of power on Thursday night and it had nothing to do with events across the water.No. Word had it that Marty Morrissey was in the building.

The Commissioner for Trade broke out the canapés and the vol au vents for Ireland’s high fliers – the current cabinet representation is the largest ever.The Taoiseach was guest of honour. Also in attendance was EU Brexit chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his wife Isabelle, Commission vice-president Margrethe Vestager (Denmark) and commissioners Vera Jourova (Czechoslovakia) John Dalli (Malta) and Janez Lenarcic (Slovenia).In a short speech, Varadkar thanked the commission for having stood by Ireland over the last three years. He also spoke of the importance of having Irish representation at the highest levels in Europe.Present were Anthony Whelan, who is in President Ursula Von der Leyen’s cabinet Fiona Knab-Lunny from the cabinet of the high representative for foreign policy, Joseph Borrell (Spain) Kevin O’Connell from Jourova’s cabinet (transparency and values) Paddy McCullough from the cabinet of jobs and social rights commissioner Nicolas Schmit (Luxembourg) and Brian Synnott, who is in Swedish commissioner Ylva Johansson’s cabinet (home affairs).Guests from Big Phil’s team included Peter Power, his chef de cabinet, Dermot Ryan and Kevin Keary. Tom Tynan couldn’t make it. Dan Ferrie from the commission’s spokesman service also attended.But wait. There’s somebody else. Who else from Ireland is serving in the cabinet of an EU commissioner? Who could it be?How could we have forgotten. Why, it’s Dara Murphy, recent appointee to the cabinet of Bulgaria’s Mariya Gabriel (innovation, culture and youth).He wasn’t able to make it.Discretion being the better part of valour, and all that. Probably just as well.The case of the two Fianna Fáil TDs at the centre of Votegate – Dooley and Niall Collins – is still with the Dáil ethics committee. Apparently the committee is to carry out further investigations in the new year. Timmy has been requested to clarify the apology he furnished to the Dáil after the story broke.Meanwhile, Micheál Martin worked the basement room in the thorough manner of a party leader nursing big general election expectations. Had he gone upstairs and into the main bar, he might have seen Enda Kenny holding court in his favourite spot inside in the snug.The former taoiseach was holding his annual drinks for his staff – all his former Garda drivers were there, along with his support staff from Government Buildings and the Dáil. They started in Napper Tandy’s on Merrion Row and graduated to Toner’s.Meanwhile, Fine Gael’s staff party, which usually takes place in the Taoiseach’s department, was held this year in the private dining room attached to the members’ restaurant. “Nothing fancy, just drinks and plates of those finger yokes, what you call them? Knick-knacks. There was no dinner,” reported a veteran politician.There was discussion of this year’s Fine Gael Superdraw. The top prize of €20,000 was won by Brian Scannell of the Dublin North West branch. The winning ticket was sold to him by his brother-in -law, deputy Noel Rock. Former Labour party senator Lorraine Higgins apparently won €100 in the draw and Maria Bailey won €150.Leo Varadkar popped in for a mingle and to sample a few of the knick-knacks but he didn’t join the large crowd which decamped to Kennedy’s pub on Westland Row.It didn’t go unnoticed among the revellers that the two Simons – Coveney and Harris – carried on to Kennedys. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Health arrived together and spent a long time with their FG colleagues. “The two Simons were going from table to table. They went around the place like they were out canvassing. They met everyone and were the last to leave,” said one shrewd observer.Jam wisdom in the SeanadA definite first for the Seanad on Wednesday morning when Sinn Féin Senator Paul Gavan put the words of The Jam’s Paul Weller on the official record of the Upper House. Speaking as “a prou d member of the London-Irish community”, Gavan appealed to the Irish across Britain to “use their votes wisely” and reject Boris Johnson in Friday’s election.“My mum and dad worked in factories all of their lives. They were not well paid but we had a national health service, free education and my parents were able to give us a decent future. That, in turn, helped me when I came home because my oldest brother was in a position to help fund my education,” he told colleagues during the order of business. “I am saying this because I am not going to be here tomorrow and I want to appeal to the Irish across Britain, in particular in London, to use their votes wisely tomorrow.”Gavan said he was always a big fan of The Jam and noted that the band’s last gig took place 37 years ago to the day, “which is a bit scary”. He told the Seanad that Weller wrote Going Underground in response to Thatcher getting into power and he quoted the lyrics because they are “directly relevant” today.You choose your leaders and place your trust As their lies wash you down and their promises rust You’ll see kidney machines replaced by rockets and guns And the public wants what the public gets But I don’t get what this society wants.Labour’s old rocker Kevin Humphries went misty-eyed. “I echo Senator Gavan’s remarks. This is probably the first time those lyrics were quoted in the Seanad.”“Or in any parliament,” sighed his colleague Ivana Bacik."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4114663.1576255332!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar says bare bones trade deal may replace no deal brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeo Varadkar  in Brussels on Friday. The Taoiseach said Boris Johnson had a ‘very strong personal mandate. . . It’s up to him to decide how he wants to use it.’ Photograph:  Kenzo TribouillardAFP via Getty ImagesTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said a “bare bones” trade agreement between the EU and the UK may be possible late next year if a full trade agreement cannot be negotiated in time, as most EU leaders expect.EU leaders attending the summit in Brussels acknowledged that the UK would now leave the EU in January, but most do not believe a trade agreement can be agreed before the transition period ends next December – raising the prospect of another “cliff edge” in 12 months’ time.However, speaking to journalists after the conclusion of the summit, Mr Varadkar said it “may be possible to put together some kind of bare bones agreement to cover some aspects of it”.He said this would “not be ‘no deal’ in the sense that we used to talk about no deal” because of the guarantees in the withdrawal agreement.Earlier, Mr Varadkar warned against moves towards a united Ireland in the wake of Northern Ireland result, which saw unionist losses and gains for nationalists and the Alliance Party.Mr Varadkar said while the “tectonic plates” were shifting in the North, the focus should be reviving the powersharing institutions, rather than pushing for a united Ireland.PowersharingHe said there was now “no unionist majority, no nationalist majority and an ever-expanding centre ground”.He added: “The one thing that hasn’t changed for Northern Ireland is that the best future for Northern Ireland is one based on powersharing and one based on reconciliation, one based on bringing all communities together. And the next step in that has to be getting the Executive and Assembly up and running before January 13th.”On Brexit, Mr Varadkar said that he agreed with French president Emmanuel Macron who told the council meeting there should be “no quotas, no tariffs and no dumping” – referring to the need for the UK to uphold European standards of worker protection and product standards if it was to benefit from open access to the European market.“That’s the kind of space we’re in as the European Union,” Mr Varadkar said.Asked “which Boris will turn up” at talks, Mr Varadkar said he had met Mr Johnson on a few occasions and they had spoken a lot on the phone “but I certainly can’t read his mind, nor do I know his mind”. “But if I had to guess, I think he is somebody who is an economic and social liberal. And he’s somebody who is going to want to have a close relationship with the European Union, and will want us to have a trade deal as close and also a future relationship that goes beyond trade into an economic partnership, citizens rights and also a political partnership too. But that all remains to be seen.”He added that Mr Johnson had a “very strong personal mandate . . . It’s up to him to decide how he wants to use it.”‘Absolute caveat’Mr Varadkar said Ireland would be an advocate in Europe for the UK to have a close economic and political relationship with the EU – “but with the absolute caveat that it can never undermine the European Union”.“We’re in a different place and we’re in a more vulnerable place in a lot of ways, so we need to maintain our place at the centre of the European Union – but also we need to maintain a close relationship with our nearest neighbour. So that’s going to be a challenge, but I think it’s one we can navigate,” he said. Mr Varadkar said EU leaders in their private discussions had stressed the importance of maintaining unity among the EU member states behind chef negotiator Michel Barnier’s task force.The Taoiseach said that would be difficult because the interests of EU countries would erge in the trade talks. “So we need to stick together and we need to maintain solidarity and unity, and that’s what we intend to do.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4115749.1576311102!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"clown or statesman which pm has uk woken up to european press react to tory victory","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Boris Johnson arrives back at 10 Downing Street after visiting Buckingham Palace where he was given permission to form the next government during an audience with Queen Elizabeth II on Friday. Photograph: Stefan Rosseau WPA PoolGetty ImagesBoris Johnson extending his stay at Downing Street — and its wider implications - make headlines around the world on Saturday.Many papers described the size of Mr Johnson’s victory as a “landslide”, while columnists have been given plenty to mull over following the poll win.Brexit appears to be the prism through which the majority of newspapers and their editorials view the election victory, as Mr Johnson promised the departure will take place by January 31st. In France, Le Monde says the focus is now on Britain’s future relationship with the EU.Its editorial says: “It’s now up to Europeans to stick together and guide them to the right choice: preserving as closer links as possible with its neighbours rather than let them carry out their threat of turning the UK into a dumping paradise at the gates of Europe.”Liberation offers up a double-header of British references on its front page — sticking Mr Johnson’s head on the Queen’s body and running the headline “Let It Be”.To Germany, and Suddeutsche Zeitung’s head of foreign policy Stefan Kornelius writes that Mr Johnson “had it easy”, calling Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn “the main campaigner of the Tories”.He writes: “The idea of a choice is that — well: you have a choice. The British didn’t really have a choice.“Nobody showed them the path that would have led them out of the deep undergrowth of Brexit.”On the future negotiations, he adds: “The EU must now stand by its principles more than ever: no softening of the internal market, no light membership.“That will be at the expense of the Irish, probably true. But if the British overruled rules of the internal market or undermined standards, the EU’s central vault would collapse.”The country’s biggest online news site, Der Spiegel, was more succinct: “The turkeys voted for Christmas,” it said. Johnson had won big and could rule uncontested, it said, “but what has been lost is decency, sincerity and integrity”.Eirin Hurum, the European correspondent for Norwegian paper Aftenposten, asks “clown or statesman, which prime minister has the UK woken up to?”She writes that Mr Johnson may be troubled by the “whole new landscape of voters” in areas the Tories may not have reached previously.“These include voters from northern England who are concerned about minimum wage rates and social safety nets,” she writes.“They expect Boris Johnson to spend public money on infrastructure and investment outside London, and he takes them seriously.“Among the voters are also small industry leaders and factory workers who work in the large automotive industry in northern England. For these, it is not unimportant that the UK still has access to European markets.”In Spain, El País wrote: “Boris Johnson wins an overwhelming victory that clears the way for Brexit. El País’s London correspondent, Rafa de Miguel, noted that, for all his personality and popularity, Mr Johnson remains something of a “blank page”.–PA "},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Matt\u0027s cartoon - the first of three(!) for Dec 14Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.General election 2019: Boris Johnson to visit the North after general election gains in Leave-voting Labour heartlands - latest newsComment: There is no way back now for the pulverised, pig-headed Labour PartyComment: Those who saw Boris Johnson as an unelectable charlatan will take some time to recover from this victory Comment: Protean Boris Johnson has the battle scars and magic dust for success\u0026#39Near zero visibility\u0026#39 as ers search for remaining victims of White Island volcano eruptionQuadriga creditors seek exhumation of founder Gerald Cotten\u0026#39s body in bid to retrieve £122 million in cryptoArrests after anti-Boris Johnson protests in London and GlasgowSupreme Court will rule on release of Donald Trump\u0026#39s tax records Customers who haggle with broadband providers save average of £120, but nearly half have never tried, says Which?

There’s been other techniques to combine the two in the past but they don’t end up with pictures that are nice to look at.”Spectral Edge is the second acquisition of a UK startup\u0026nbspfor Apple this year, following the takeover of digital marketing startup DataTiger\u0026nbspin February.The technology giant will be hoping the latest buyout can offer a critical edge over competitors when it comes to camera performance, which has become one of the key differentiators between high-end smartphones in recent years.Apple is not expected to release a new iPhone until September 2020, meaning there is plenty of time to integrate Spectral Edge’s technology into its devices.\u0026nbspBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearIn a six-part blog published from letters he wrote in\u0026nbspprison, Ulbricht\u0026nbspapplied a form of market analysis known as Elliott Wave Theory to predict new all-time highs for bitcoin.The theory forecasts the highs and lows in financial market cycles by identifying extremes in investor psychology, which in the case of bitcoin appear to be far more tempormental compared to traditional markets due to the nacency of the cryptocurrency.The principle posits that price movements in speculative markets are driven by investor expectation, which when combined with mass psychology can force prices artificially higher through a positive feedback loop of buyer optimism.Looking at the previous price waves of bitcoin, Ulbricht puts the next big wave reaching between $93,000 and $109,000 before the 17 February, 2021. He notes that his speculation should be considered with appropriate scepticism.“We have a price target... of ~$100,000 some time in or near 2020,” he wrote. “However, there is no rule that market moves have to be proportional. This is just a patter we see unfolding that may or may not continue.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It predicts that this proportion could rise to between 12 and 20 per cent over the next decade as younger people join the workforce.The 29-page guide advises staff to cut out unnecessary gendered language and provides advice on how to ask someone which pronouns they prefer when describing\u0026nbspthemselves.It suggests providing all-gender facilities, promoting visible trans and non-binary role models and ensuring forms do not only include options for two genders.“It is much simpler to refer to someone as Hilary, than ‘she’ or ‘he’, and this can avoid worries over mis-gendering,” the guide states.Managers are advised to demonstrate their commitment to inclusion by personally taking action such as adding their pronouns to their email signatures.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I said that I identified as non-binary and told people that I was saying it for the first time and everyone applauded, which was heart-warming. Then nothing really happened, apart from a few people, who said ‘well done’. It was all very low-key and remains so.”In the foreword, Mr McKenna-Coles wrote that Lloyd’s has “room for further development” on trans and non-binary inclusion.“One of the secondary threads of our research was confusion and lack of knowledge on behalf of managers and colleagues over how to handle the situation, and, with the best intentions in the world, how to make it all ‘work right’ for all parties,” he wrote.City employers are taking note of the fact that increasing ersity and inclusion is good policy and good for business.Firms in the top quartile for ersity were 21 per cent more likely to have above-average profitability than those in the bottom quartile, a study by\u0026nbspMcKinsey\u0026nbspfound last year.Lloyds of London\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The pub chain owner and prominent Brexit supporter saw the value of his stake in the pub chain jump almost 10 per cent from £487m to £531m.Mr Martin had backed the Brexit Party, which failed to secure a single seat, but he will likely be pleased with the result in any case after a Tory landslide prompted Wetherspoon shares to rise from\u0026nbsp1,482p to 1,619p.Boris Johnson’s decisive win boosted the pound and sent shares in a number of UK companies soaring\u0026nbspon the hopes that uncertainty around Brexit will now fade away.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Martin has been one of the few business leaders to vocally back leaving the EU.

Wetherspoon\u0026nbsphas doubled in value since then,\u0026nbspadding more than £250m\u0026nbspto Mr Martin’s personal wealth.Earlier this week, Wetherspoon\u0026nbspalso announced plans to invest more than £200m in pubs and hotels over the next four years, creating around 10,000 jobs.New pubs and hotels will be opened, and existing pubs across the UK and Republic of Ireland will be enlarged.Most of the investment will be channelled into developments in small and medium-sized towns, but will also include larger towns and cities.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It predicts that this proportion could rise to between 12 and 20 per cent over the next decade as younger people join the workforce.The 29-page guide advises staff to cut out unnecessary gendered language and provides advice on how to ask someone which pronouns they prefer when describing\u0026nbspthemselves.It suggests providing all-gender facilities, promoting visible trans and non-binary role models and ensuring forms do not only include options for two genders.“It is much simpler to refer to someone as Hilary, than ‘she’ or ‘he’, and this can avoid worries over mis-gendering,” the guide states.Managers are advised to demonstrate their commitment to inclusion by personally taking action such as adding their pronouns to their email signatures.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I said that I identified as non-binary and told people that I was saying it for the first time and everyone applauded, which was heart-warming. Then nothing really happened, apart from a few people, who said ‘well done’. It was all very low-key and remains so.”In the foreword, Mr McKenna-Coles wrote that Lloyd’s has “room for further development” on trans and non-binary inclusion.“One of the secondary threads of our research was confusion and lack of knowledge on behalf of managers and colleagues over how to handle the situation, and, with the best intentions in the world, how to make it all ‘work right’ for all parties,” he wrote.City employers are taking note of the fact that increasing ersity and inclusion is good policy and good for business.Firms in the top quartile for ersity were 21 per cent more likely to have above-average profitability than those in the bottom quartile, a study by\u0026nbspMcKinsey\u0026nbspfound last year.Lloyds of London\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

If we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric vehicles, but then lay intellectual property landmines behind us to inhibit others, we are acting in a manner contrary to that goal.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

With one constituency left to declare, the Tories stand poised to secure a majority of 78.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn contrast, it was a night of humiliation and defeat for Labour, losing a series of stronghold seats across the country. After the party’s share of MPs dropped from 243 to an estimated 203, leader Jeremy Corbyn announced that he would lead Labour through a “process of reflection” before standing down\u0026nbspahead of the next election.With Labour lurching left and the Tories seemingly\u0026nbspwooing the Eurosceptic right, the map below highlights the changing voting habits\u0026nbspamong the\u0026nbspelectorate while showing the results of every single UK constituency.The fall of the ‘red wall’When contrasted with the 2017 election, this year’s vote demonstrates a clear swing among traditional Labour seats across the north and central regions of the UK – the so-called ‘red wall’ – to the Conservatives.The results means Mr Corbyn’s party, which had 243 MPs when Parliament was dissolved last month, is headed for its worst result since 1935.Among the long-held Labour seats to be taken by the Tories were:Even veteran left-winger Dennis Skinner, who had been set to become the Father of the House, lost his seat of Bolsover, a former mining stronghold which had been Labour since its creation in 1950.Labour has gained just one seat across the UK (Putney).The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by email‘Historic’ success for the ConservativesThe election has been heralded as\u0026nbsp“historic” for the Tories, with the party securing their largest majority since 1987.The prime minister is on course to finish with more than 43 per cent\u0026nbspof the popular vote, the highest for a Tory leader since Margaret Thatcher’s victory in 1979 and around the same as Tony Blair’s in 1997.The Conservatives’ unwavering\u0026nbspcommitment to ‘getting Brexit done’, a ‘safety-first’ manifesto and the Brexit Party’s retreat have all been credited with the Tories’ ascension to power. The Independent’s political columnist Andrew Grice takes a closer look at the factors behind the party’s success, as well as Labour’s shortcomings – read his analysis here.​There was success for the Scottish National Party\u0026nbsptoo, making strong gains across Scotland. Their increased parliamentary presence could prove troublesome for Mr Johnson in the coming weeks and months, with a strong opposition to Brexit among the country’s voters.And not all the biggest scalps of the night were Labour’s. DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds – whose party propped up Theresa May’s administration – lost his Belfast North seat to Sinn Fein.Tory former minister Zac Goldsmith fell to the Lib Dems in Richmond Park while Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson also lost her seat to the SNP and quit as party leader. Sir Ed Davey and Baroness Sal Brinton will become joint acting leaders ahead of a leadership contest next year.But Labour’s drubbing by the Tories was no doubt the story of the night and leaves the party questioning what comes next.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Wetherspoon\u0026nbsphas doubled in value since then,\u0026nbspadding more than £250m\u0026nbspto Mr Martin’s personal wealth.Earlier this week, Wetherspoon\u0026nbspalso announced plans to invest more than £200m in pubs and hotels over the next four years, creating around 10,000 jobs.New pubs and hotels will be opened, and existing pubs across the UK and Republic of Ireland will be enlarged.Most of the investment will be channelled into developments in small and medium-sized towns, but will also include larger towns and cities.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required for enrolment. This includes among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes. Foundations like TOMS have given 95 million pairs of shoes to people across 82 countries.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Evaline, 11, was enrolled in grade three at Remagwe primary school, when at the age of eight, her father passed away suddenly. In 2018, she returned to school with the help of her teenage sister, who had told her about the EAA-GMT education programme. She lives with her mother, who is a farmer, and her four siblings in a grass thatch house with no mattress. Evaline helps her mother with farming and domestic work. The family survive on two meals per day, usually one meal of soft porridge and another of stiff porridge. She walks about 1.5 hours each way to school, something not uncommon to these children in the hardest to reach areas of northwestern Tanzania. Evaline dreams of becoming a nurse and understands she can achieve her dreams through education. Her role model is Maria, a nurse in the city of Mwanza who originates from her village. Evaline’s message to the world is that they should support all the children to receive education.Often shoes that adhere to a specific dress code are required for students to attend school. In addition to uniforms, books, transportation, other informal fees or the cost of shoes can be a roadblock to enrolment. TOMS Giving Shoes help to reduce families’ financial burden.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Afya, 14, was enrolled into primary school through the EAC and GMT partnership in 2017, after being identified in the out-of-school children survey. Despite being enrolled in school, poverty still remains her greatest challenge. Her  refuses to contribute to the informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required to continue enrolment.Matteus, nine, in the office of the principal at Remagwe school, looks down while he nervously scratches at the torn and faded zebra-print fabric sofa. One of the pre-requisites for children attending school in Tanzania is that parents must contribute to scholastic materials like school uniform and shoes, of which he has neither. His parents, both farmers, are unable to earn more than £375 a year in wages. They are sustaining a family of five. Matteus was identified through the partnership as being from an incredibly poor background, which would prevent his enrolment. He wakes early to ensure all the farm chores are complete by 11am. When he returns from school at 6pm he collects the cattle from the pastures and then helps his mother in the house with any jobs. Matteus and his siblings have two meals a day of porridge and bananas. They cannot afford any protein in their diet.Elizabeth, now 16, was enrolled at school aged 13 with the partnership, which helps the hardest to reach children struggling with things like poverty, early marriage and female genital mutilation. At age six, her father passed away, followed by her mother when she was 12. She was placed under ship of her uncle, who was arranging her marriage, with her unaware. The incentive for parents looking to marry their daughters is to benefit from sizeable dowry payments, more often livestock or land. Elizabeth’s second uncle heard the news of the marriage arrangements and spoke to the new education programme. Elizabeth wanted to enjoy her right to education and her second uncle helped void the pending marriage arrangements. She explained how extremely grateful she is to the foundation that gave her the opportunity to enrol and avoid the marriage she never wanted.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added, “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Josephine, 14, is an orphan and now lives with her aunt. She lost her parents and youngest sister to Aids, however, her blood-work is clear and negative. She was enrolled into the joint education partnership in 2017. Living far from school, she is forced to travel 4km to get there. Poverty remains a constant worry for Josephine as her aunt will not contribute to the additional costs. When asked what it meant to her to have access to education she replied, “Being in school means I will face less hardship and have a less fragile future. I would much prefer to be in class than live at home with my aunt who tries to prevent my going to school. She often beats me. She wants me to get married.” She was identified by the partnership as being vulnerable and teachers would buy her exercise books to ensure she doesn’t go without. Despite being three years behind she is catching up extremely quickly and ranking in the top five students out of 168 pupils.A young girl nervously clasps her hands as she explained how she was beaten repeatedly and threatened with being married off at the age of 13. In remote rural parts of Tanzania, the average age of marriage is between 12-13, from which point they are invited to leave the family home and fend for themselves. This makes them extremely vulnerable.A young boy seated in a dark classroom. In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme (PEDP) and eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. But the programme has faced many challenges.A young girl enrolled at Remagwe school in northwestern Tanzania. The school allows her to attend without uniform, which is a rarity. Uniform, shoes and scholastic materials are expected to be funded by parents under voluntary parental contributions, which are around £10 per year. The fees are an enormous barrier to enrolment, typically parents working as farmers will collectively earn no more than £375 a year in wages that must support and sustain a family.Maryam, 12, has been enrolled in primary school since 2014. She lives with her mother and six siblings, who have all become domestic servants in houses. Education up to the age of 16 is free in Tanzania, except for the parental voluntary contributions. Her mother, a farmer, only earns £380 per year and has been paying £69 towards “informal” school fees for her daughters. Maryam has ambitions of becoming a nurse. She wants to help women, explaining: “Women are very vulnerable in Tanzania, friends my age have been married or propositioned for early marriage”. And she added, “Young girls in primary transitioning to secondary schooling take risks walking to school of being kidnapped.”1518 A classroom blackboard used to provide lessons at Remagwe Primary SchoolToday challenges to establishing an effective and stable education system persist. Assistance from international donors and partnerships helps the Tanzanian government achieve universal primary education and refurbish classrooms to improve the learning experience for children.As challenging as it is to see past the barriers to providing a quality education for children, small changes such as repainting blackboards for teachers and students can have enormous and direct benefits.Alex, 13, explained: “I can no longer wash my clothes any more as they will fall apart”. He has no school uniform, unlike many schools in Tanzania, his school still allow him to attend class. His sandals are torn and one held together by a bit of wire twisted at the sole. Alex enrolled into the first grade of his school in 2017 at the beginning of the EACGraca Machel Trust partnership. He lost his father when he was very young to a simple case of diarrhoea. He now lives with his mother and five siblings. She supports the family by working the fields as a peasant farm hand. For him, poverty remains the greatest barrier to his education, having to walk four hours each way to school, meaning he is constantly tired at school. Challenging geographies is a major barrier to education in remote Africa.A typical classroom in rural Tanzania, often without any electricity. Classroom furniture is in need of repair and broken floors leave a surface of sand or mud. In 2001, Tanzania eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. This bold move by the government saw a rapid increase in enrolment overnight but abolishing school fees has left schools trying to deliver education on a shoestring budget. Tanzania has the desire to make the change to education but it needs help from the international community to continue the process.Today poverty remains one of the greatest barriers to enrolment in education and no better example of this can be illustrated than in rural and remote parts of Tanzania.

No better example of this can be illustrated than in rural and remote parts of Tanzania, where a 12-year-old boy, out of school, forced\u0026nbspinto a life of work, trapped in a dead-end cycle of danger and despair so he can provide for his family, provides perspective. He says: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my brothers and sisters. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.”Chacha works 12-hour shifts, seven days a week, under the cover of darkness to avoid detection, on one of the many small-scale gold mining sites in the northwest of the country. Illegally, he scavenges the mines for residue-bearing rock which he digs up and sells to middle-men who crush and extract the gold. Chacha’s cut of £1.50 a day is used to contribute to household bills. The work is exhausting and dangerous. Trespassers are shot on sight – even children.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTanzania\u0026nbsphas strong laws governing child labour,\u0026nbspreinforced by the national action plan to eliminate the practice. The plan prohibits under-18s from engaging in hazardous work, including mining, but children are still lured into mines with the hope of changing their fortunes and those of their families.Chacha has never set foot in a classroom, perhaps he never will. He is one of the estimated 1.895 million children out-of-school children\u0026nbspin Tanzania today.New hope for Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge’s brutal war on educationHis only possible salvation may come through partnerships such as those between the Education Above All\u0026nbspFoundation (EAA) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT). These collaborations place a strong emphasis on capacity building – boosting schools in all areas to help them run efficiently and sustainably – as well as community engagement and service support. The EEA-GMT partnership has successfully enrolled 23,479 out-of-school children\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspquality primary education over\u0026nbsptwo years in the Mara region – comprising the most challenging and hardest to reach districts of Tanzania.GMT brought in the Complementary Basic Education in Tanzania (COBET) accelerated learning programme, to give a second chance to over-age learners who had never been to school – and to those who had dropped out.In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme\u0026nbspand eliminated public school fees\u0026nbspto increase access to primary education. But\u0026nbspmany challenges have arisen. Schooling is now mandatory for children aged seven to 15, and although enrolment has dramatically increased, Tanzania has not yet achieved universal primary education. A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary\u0026nbspparental contributions required for enrolment. This includes, among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes.All children should be able to attend primary school regardless of whether their parents can or can’t afford to pay or see the value, perhaps never having received\u0026nbspan education themselves. At its core, if a child fails to gain the basic skills required to contribute as a functioning member of\u0026nbspsociety, the loss is vast, not just to the child or society but the nation as a whole. For those sceptical, education can ultimately reduce poverty for future generations. Studies show the cost of educating children is far outweighed by the cost of not educating them.Their schools lie in ruins – but is there hope for Mosul’s children?Women of Gaza: Empowered and resilientThe global challenge to ensure all children can go to schoolSheikha Moza bint Nasser, chair\u0026nbspand founder of EAA, has dedicated much of her life to ensuring the most marginalised children can go to school, when there was no duty or expectation for her to do so. At\u0026nbspUnesco’s headquarters in Paris last year, she said: “Statistics cannot catalogue the impact of\u0026nbspchildren’s broken dreams. So we must not allow ourselves to be ‘numbed’\u0026nbspby the numbers, and we cannot accept apathy as a response. Because history, as we know, will judge us, by both what we do, and what we choose not to do.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At stake was the survival of Brexit.But the very future of Britain as a free market economy was too. It was vital the Tories won and it appears they have, convincingly.Corbyn and his poisonous, anti-Semitic cult have been crushed, hopefully terminally.The country must NEVER again be placed at risk from their extremism. Never.It falls now to Labour’s many moderate voters and MPs to take back control of their party and make it electable again.Boris’s Brexit deal can go ahead on January . Sensible, stable, strong government canafter three years of abject chaos and paralysis inflicted on us by Remain diehards.Their campaign and their second referendum are over.Boris can fulfil on his pledges, such as a £billion injection for the NHS, , more nurses and , new cops. He can deliver Brexit and keep taxes low across the board.The Sun campaigned for a Tory win because we believe Boris will make our readers’ lives better. It is that simple.Britain has many problems. Pay is too low. Homes are unaffordable for young people.The NHS is under immense strain. Too many regions have been left behind as London has prospered.But all our economic prospects will be vastly greater under the Tories than Magic Grandpa and his cult of halfwits.We are delighted to see the back of this utterly vile election campaign.It was far too long and almost unimaginably toxic, overwhelmingly due to Corbyn fans vilying their opponents in the street, on TV and on social media.Even so, Boris campaigned well, a couple of own-goals aside. Get Brexit Done looks to have proved as powerful a slogan as he hoped.And, while the Tories’ manesto played it too safe it was a stark contrast to Labour’s tsunami of unaffordable freebies.What should profoundly disturb us as a nation is that so many dismissed Corbyn’s anti-Semitism, his support for terrorists, his lies and his insane spending plans and voted for him anyway.Some claimed, in the same breath, that Labour might be racist but it is “progressive”. That is simply a contradiction in terms.Our great hope for Britain now is not just that Boris can reunite us and steer us wisely into a new era.It is that millions take a hard look at themselves and the Labour extremists they backed and feel some measure of shame.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It isn’t just a defeat for Jeremy Corbyn but for everyone who supported his hard-left, extremist agenda.Andthis doesn’t make them think again, what will Of course, they will claim this was the Brexit election, not a verdict on their mad manesto.They will blame the media, the opinion polls, their opponents and even the weather. Anything to avoid responsibility for taking the Labour Party to its worst result since .But what did they think would happen when Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell and the rest of them won control of the party  And what did Labour MPs think would happen when decent British people were asked to put them in power A shattering defeat such as this demands a complete rethink.And moderate MPs need to devote every minute to reclaiming the party from the hard-left extremists.They need to boot Corbyn, McDonnell and the rest of them out, get back to the centre ground and start listening to decent, patriotic working-class voters in places such as my old seat in Dudley.They need to show that they can be trusted to tackle terrorism, defend our country and protect its borders.Most of all, they must banish for good the anti-Jewish racism that has poisoned the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn.This catastrophic defeat can be put down to a number of factors: Brexit, their economic policies, extremism and Corbyn’s useless leadership.But it’s also clear that anti-Semitism had an impact, too, and everyone who wants a Labour Government needs to think about this long and hard.Labour’s anti-Semitism crisis goes much deeper than just the leader.It is now in the party’s bones and a change of leader won’t be enough to solve it.So my old party has a long and hard road back to respectability and relevance.And we all have a big job to do to stand up for mainstream democratic values and beat the extremists for good.But I’m optimistic about that because I could not be prouder of the British people tonight.They have rejected extremism and the poisonous hate which the hard left brought into the Labour Party.And they have stood up for Britain’s Jewish community, rejected racism and said enough is enough.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Corbyn vowed to step down as Labour leader before the next election after failing to win a second poll in a row.As he won his seat in Islington North, Mr Corbyn: I want to also make it clear that I will not lead the party in any future general election campaign. I will discuss with our party to ensure there is a process now of reflection on this result and on the policies that the party will take going forward. And I will lead the party during that period to ensure that discussion takes place and we move on into the future.Mr Corbyn added: This is obviously a very disappointing night for the Labour Party with the result that weve got.Latest news:Labour MP Jess Phillips, who is at   to take charge of Labour, says she is devastated by the projected election result and that her party needs a change.Speaking with Sky News, the MP for Birmingham Yardley refused to rule herself out of the leadership race. She said: If people trust me, then yes I will take a role in rebuilding Im not going to sit here and make headlines.Ms Phillips said that the country has delivered a message to Labour  and that the party has to listen to the electorate. She said: The truth is people didnt trust us to deliver the manesto. There is no trust left in politics. The bar has got so low we could allow somebody like Boris Johnson to rule our country with what seems like a blank cheque. We have got to rebuild trust.After the disastrous exit poll, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC: If it is anything near this it is disappointing. And he gave a hint that Mr Corbyn could stand down in hoursit were true. Mr McDonnell said: Lets see the results themselves, as I say, the appropriate decisions will be made and well always make the decisions in the best interests of our party.Already Labour MPs started blaming Brexit for the result.  Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon tweeted: Disappointing Exit Poll. Lets seeaccurate. If, as it seems, this was a Brexit election then the next one wont be given Johnson’s Thatcherite agenda.But a Labour Party spokesperson dismissed the exit poll and said: Its only the beginning of the night, and its too early to call the result.Odds too odd!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He made sure lines of communication were kept open and regularly hopped on his motorbike and visited his grandparents and other members of his extended family.I suspect that being caught up in this nightmare, which has seen them appear on network TV both here and in the US, as well as an utterly surreal meeting with Donald Trump at the White House, has made it almost impossible for Harry’s parents to grieve properly for their son.They are still in shock, dazed and barely sleeping, and it is only their resolve to achieve justice for their son that is driving them on. Harry’s death made global headlines.Sadly, the spotlight shts all too quickly, and the world forgets about such tragedies and moves on. But Charlotte, Tim and Niall, and everyone who knew and loved Harry, lives with the pain every single minute of every single day.Charlotte told me that Niall, always the quieter and less out-going twin, is finding it extremely hard to come to terms with the death of his brother.He cannot bear to talk about what happened and is haunted because he doesn’t know exactly how Harry died.Tim has spoken about seeing his son’s poor shattered bloody body at the crash scene and how he tried to reassure him that all would be well, but his boy died shortly afterwards.Frankly, I don’t know how Anne Sacoolas can live with herself.If she had only stayed to help the police piece together what had happened, she would have had the chance to express her sorrow, and more than likely been given a suspended sentence.That would at least have given Harry’s family some peace of mind.Instead, Charlotte and Tim are trying to get US officials to listen to them and hoping Donald Trump will make good on his promise of getting something done.If the President thought he could steamroller this “ordinary” British couple during that encounter, he was soon put right.They turned down his clumsy attempt at setting up a meeting with Sacoolas, who was waiting in a White House side room. They didn’t want to be bounced into a Trump photo opportunity, and they also said they rejected an offer of compensation.Charlotte and Tim are also ready to file a civil lawsuit against Sacoolas in the state of Virginia, in an attempt to have her hand herself in to UK authorities.I spoke to them about how the family would face Christmas, and they simply shook their heads in sorrow. Fighting tears, Charlotte told me it was going to be horrendous, especially as Harry loved this time of year so much.I can’t get out of my head the image of them at home, surrounded by sadness, while neighbours in houses around them are making merry.Charlotte said it was made worse by the fact that Sacoolas will be able to celebrate Christmas with her children.It seems the Sacoolas family and the authorities are hoping thatthey stall long enough Charlotte and Tim are just going to go away.I can assure them that they will never give up.I sincerely hope this courageous couple, who are going through the torments of hell, somehow manage to shame officials here and in the US into doing what’s right.Sacoolas should be sent back to the UK to explain herself, apologise and face her punishment.New PM Boris Johnson has a bloody long to-do list, but justice for Harry must be one of his priorities.WILL he fall at the final hurdle Saturday night or will Anton du Beke go all the way and win his first ever Strictly Glitterball after  years of trying.If I was ever to do the showthen you can bet your le it would be poor old Anton who would have to shove me around the dancefloor like an overstuffed wardrobe.He tends to get the plucky no-hopers of a certain age, but this year was given a real contender in the shape of firecracker Emma Barton, from EastEnders.It’s too close to call with the other two finalists, Karim Zeroual and Amy Dowden, and Kelvin Fletcher and Oti Mabuse at the top of their game, but no one would begrudge Anton his moment of glory.JENNIFER Lopez celebrated her Screen Actors Guild Award nomination with an online message to her fans – while on a treadmill in the gym.Being J-Lo, her make-up was flawless, she was wearing a gorgeous tracksuit and she completed the look with fabulous hoop earrings.Despite working out, she wasn’t even glowing, never mind perspiring.What a contrast to the rest of us.I’m a sweaty, red-faced mess after my exercise class and look as though I’ve been dragged through every hedge in the land not just backwards, but forwards too.J-Lo has been nominated for a SAG for her role as Ramona in Hustlers, and during the message she even got a little teary, but of course without the red nose and puffy eyes of us mere mortals.She makes the world a more beautul place.She’s the powerhouse behind the insane Kardashian phenomenon and expert at making very little talent go a bloody long way.

If untreated it can lead to deafness, meningitis, and can reduce male fertility.It’s a direct result of parents refusing to let their kids be given the MMR jab when the recent crop of sufferers were babies at the turn of the century.Scare stories about MMR being linked with autism led to parents opting out of immunisation and now we are reaping the whirlwind.Health officials have urged anyone who hasn’t had the jab to do so immediately and have warned of a “public health time bomb”.There’s also been a surge in the cases of measles, a disease that can kill.It is outrageous that we are fortunate enough to have the science to eradicate these diseases completely, and save millions of lives in the process, but through misinformation, stubbornness and, even in a few cases sheer laziness, measles and mumps are being allowed to flourish once more.We need to get a grip and protect our babies, children and young people from harm that is easily preventable.WELL done to Great British Bake Off runner-up Steph Blackwell for being so refreshingly honest about her struggles with ious eating disorders.The -year-old, who was a joy to watch on the show, wants to help other people struggling with anorexia, bulimia and depression and to reassure them that things can get better.When she was , and in the grip of the illness, she would never have imagined one day she would be enjoying baking in front of the nation.Steph is proof that debilitating and often le-threatening eating disorders can be brought under control with understanding and the right kind of help.More power to her.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is now vital, economically and politically, the Tories pump money into those regions and transform them.The gap between them and London has been too wide too long.And our re-elected PM was dead right to make that his priority in his first speech at No since winning his thumping majority.We must “unite and level up”, he said. Exactly.Remainers may take a while to “unite”, to “heal”. But the levelling-up can start now, by spending on infrastructure, including big transport improvements.That, admittedly, takes years. In the short-term, low-tax zones and other tax breaks can revive High Streets and lure job-creating firms out of big cities and into regions which need the boost.More money for public services is key too. The NHS, social care and crime are priorities across the country. So are many more affordable homes.Visible improvements can be made rapidly, such as with a new determination to end rough sleeping, as the Blair Government almost did.For years The Sun backed the Tories as they cut spending to fix the chaos Labour left in .That work is largely done — and, let’s face it, public patience for penny-pinching is at an end.We will trust a Tory Chancellor infinitely more than a Marxist one to spend prudently without bankrupting us.Equally exciting is the power Boris now has both to reinvent the civil service to deliver on national priorities and to reshape our politics.The Tories have a golden chance to rebrand and recast themselves as the party of working people, of Sun readers — and end the lefties’ tired mantra that they serve only the rich.It is also time to fix the anti-Tory bias in our election system.It is incredible their big win came even despite constituency boundaries favouring Labour. These must be redrawn.Two years ago we said Britain needed a strong Tory majority to improve lives and take big decisions to reform public services. It has finally come true.We heartily congratulate the many new Tory MPs. Chiefly, though, we congratulate three men.One is Isaac Levido, the party’s talented and driven Aussie elections guru.The other two, Dominic Cummings and Boris himself, have genuinely made history twice, against staggering odds.They took on the Remainer establishment and won the Brexit vote in . Now they have crushed the Remainers’ long refusal to deliver on it.In one momentous instant, as the exit poll dropped at pm on Thursday, these men ended three and a half years of ­political purgatory and paralysis.All the trickery and plots of duplicitous Remainer MPs and their rogue Speaker Bercow to reverse the referendum came to nothing.All the expensive legal cases, the collusion with EU officials, the long PR campaign of hatred towards Leavers and Boris . . . all were for nothing.In that one moment Boris won his mandate, Brexit was secured and the “People’s Vote” charade destroyed.Corbynism — which had terried millions, not least Britain’s Jews — was instantly over too and the nation liberated from the shadow of hard-left extremism.Then one Brexit-blocking MP after another was dumped by voters.Cummings’s and Boris’s achievements cannot be overstated. They are victories on a dferent scale even from Tony Blair’s against an exhausted Tory Party.As for what remains of Blair’s party we say this: It is staggering to see Corbyn cling on, plainly hoping to stitch up the leadership for some hard-left successor.That will just guarantee ­perpetual irrelevance.He, McDonnell, Seumas Milne, their Momentum social justice warriors and their repugnant media foghorns must be driven out NOW.With a few honourable exceptions, Labour’s “moderate” MPs and voters have shown a repugnant lack of spine by failing to do so already.Indeed the hypocrisy of politicians like Jess Phillips and Stella Creasy has never been plainer, begging Britain to hand power to Corbyn and his anti-Semitic, terrorist-supporting mob, then denouncing them the instant they lost.These unprincipled charlatans backed a Marxist manesto, only to turn on it once voters recoiled. Shame on them. It may be too late anyway. Labour looks irredeemably in the grip of hard-left cranks. Do Phillips and Wes Streeting really need five more years of this  We look forward to a bloodletting like this once-great party has never seen.“Change is coming”, Corbynistas used to say, with no little menace.It sure is.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The media intrusion on peoples lives is very high indeed.And the attacks that take place against family and loved ones of politicians continue and they are disgraceful and frankly they are disgusting.Sir Keir Starmer is now the favourite to take over as Labour boss - but Jess Phillips threw her hat in and Emily Thornberry gave a speech hinting shell go for it too. David Lammy also broke cover to suggest he will throw his hat into the ring to succeed Mr Corbyn.Tottenham MP Lammy said: “Of course I’m thinking about it, because people like me that have been in the party for  years have now got to do a lot of heavy lting to get us into the right place.”Ruth Smeeth declared that she lost her because Labour is now the racist party and blamed Corbyn, adding they should have ditched him months ago.Her furious tirade came as she announced she had “definitely lost” her seat on a crushing general election night for Labour.Smeeth’s Stoke-on-Trent South constituency was one of Labour’s “Red Wall” seats that fell to the Conservatives to re-draw the political map of England.She blasted: “Jeremy Corbyn’s actions on antisemitism have made us the nasty party. We are the racist party.“He should have gone many many, many months ago. I am, well I was, the Parliamentary chair of the Jewish Labour Movement.We passed a motion of no confidence in him in April.There is absolutely no justication for why he is still there and his personal actions have delivered this result for my constituents and for swathes of the country overnight.Smeeth lost her seat to the Conservatives, the first time in history theyve held the Stoke-on-Trent seat.And Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray, although retaining his seat, also last night brutalised Corbyn - amid claims the partys safest seat in Scotland was under threat.Murray - now Scotlands only Labour MP - said: Every door I knocked on, and my team and I spoke to , people, mentioned Corbyn.Not Brexit but Corbyn. I’ve been saying this for years.The outcome is that we’ve let the country down and we must change course and fast.Former Labour Foreign Secretary Jack Straw jumped on the bandwagon of critics, saying he was relieved Mr Corbyn had lost. He branded him an “apologist” for the IRA and said he “had this worry that the country could be in really dangerous hands” had Labour won.Labour moderate Wes Streeting said Mr Corbyn and his hard-left pals — who include Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell — must take the blame for the defeat.He added: “They had the leader they wanted, the NEC they wanted, the manesto the wanted. The one thing they didn’t have was the support of the British people.”Corbyn is still in denial about the flaws in his leadership and policies leading to Labours crushing defeat.He said: “I think the issue that dominated this election, ultimately, was Brexit.“Our policies, I’ve named some, there are many others I could name, were actually, all of them, inidually, very popular.“There was no huge debate or disagreement in the party about any of the policies in our manesto. The issue was, ultimately, the Prime Minister said he’s going to get Brexit sorted.”Corbyn thanked his sons before thanking his we for all that she puts up with because of the way in which the media behaved towards me, towards her and indeed towards my party during this election campaign.But clinging on to his Islington seat, Corbyn said it had been a very disappointing night as support for his party crumbled in Labours former heartlands.The MP ran as an outside candidate for the party leadership in  and managed to outlast two Tory prime ministers.But finally conceding defeat as the red wall was left in tatters, he said he will call it a day on his time as leader - although he refused to immediately step down.He said: I will not lead the party in any future general election campaign.I will discuss with my party to ensure there is a process of reflection on this result and I will lead the party during that period to ensure the discussion takes place and we will move on into the future.Upon Corbyns loss, the Tories’ Michael Gove sent a moving message to Jewish Brits. He reassured them they would “never have to live in fear again” after Corbyn’s defeat.He denounced the Labour chief for embracing “anti-Jewish rhetoric” and “anti-Jewish terrorists”. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was  re-visited, right down to a socialist icon like Dennis Skinner being ousted the same way Tony Benn was, and a thumping rejection of Labour giving Margaret Thatcher, like Boris Johnson, the chance to go after the enemy with a merciless vengeance. The Cabinet will now be dominated by hardline right-wingers like Priti Patel, Dominic Raab and Liz Truss, authors of a book called Britannia Unchained. It advocated Thatcherite free-marketeering taken to extremes, with everything up for sale and all workers’ rights turned to dust. This is what post-Brexit paradise will look like. As in  Labour has to take a hard look at itself and ask why many voters in their heartlands deserted them and how a man like Skinner, who held Bolsover for  years, can be so callously discarded by his own working-class people. But Johnson will inevitably let those people down. That’s what he specialises in. They will soon realise he won’t Get Brexit Done for their benefit and the only potential being unleashed will be for the rich to get even richer. During that  election Neil Kinnock famously warned usThatcher won “not to be ordinary, young, to fall ill or get old.”  Now that her heirs have won a huge majority I warn you not to be any of the above but also not to be dark-skinned, have a passport from the EU, be disabled or low paid, be in a trade union or be employed in the public sector. I warn you to expect the NHS to look unrecognisable, state school classes of -plus and a poverty-pay economy as the UK becomes a low-tax haven for sharks.

And, unfortunately, it’s my hat in the ring.Asked why it was him, he replied: Well, Diane [Abbott] and John [McDonnell] have done it before, so it was my turn.  I have never held any appointed office, so in that sense it’s unusual, butI can promote some causes and debate by doing this, then good. That’s why I’m doing it. At my age I’m not likely to be a long-term contender, am I  Born in May , Corbyn attended Adamsapos Grammar School in Shropshire before moving to London. He was an activist at a young age, and was in his early s when he became MP for Islington North in . The following year he was one of eight politicians arrested for protesting against apartheid outside Londonaposs South African embassy. One of the most famous photos of Corbyn from his career was taken this day, showing him being taken away by police officers carrying a sign reading: aposDefend the right to demonstrate against Apartheid. Join this picket.apos Since  heaposs defied Labour whips more than  times, according to voting record website The Public Whip.That includes on some of the most controversial issues of the Blair years, voting against the Iraq war, ID cards and increasing tuition fees . He criticised Ed Miliband for promising too much austerity before the election, and said there should be more nationalisation and a £ minimum wage. While his controversial stance hasnapost always made him very popular in the Commons, heaposs kept his Islington North constituency and in  was the surprise addition to the Labour Leadership election ballot - and he won. But as his campaign manager MP John McDonnell later revealed, Corbyn had to be forced to run. Groups of left-wing politicians wanted to pick a candidate - any candidate - to run in the leadership race.  McDonnell said: And we turned to Jeremy and said aposlookapos and he said aposalright, Iaposll have a goapos. This is the sort of leader we want - where we force them to become leaders. There were  days of begging before they reached  nominations - just two short. Five MPs had promised their votesCorbyn got to . They were standing there. It got to  seconds before the close of nominations and two of them cracked. Gordon Marsden and Andrew Smith, I am eternally grateful. I admit it. I was on my knees in tears begging them.At the end of his first year at the reigns analysis revealed the party’s poll ratings were the worst they had ever had in opposition , trailing behind the Tories by an average of  points. But the  snap election against Theresa May was a huge turning point, and while he didnapost win the results were better than anyone predicted .Labour won  seats, nowhere near close enough to secure a majority, but Corbyn still exceeded all expectations The party started the campaign  points behind but ended up winning key symbolic seats in south east England, Wales and Scotland.Corbyn led his party to top % of the vote - just shy of the share it won in  under  Tony Blair and declared triumphantly: Politics isn’t going back into the box where it was before. Big guns including Nick Clegg, Alex Salmond and rising Tory ministerial star Ben Gummer were humiliated as they lost their seats.  Corbyn also won his own seat with a thundering ,-vote majority.Shortly after he received a rock star welcome when he took to the stage at Glastonbury - drawing a crowd to rival that of Mick Jagger.Chants of Corbyn, Corbyn began as the festival gates opened at Worthy Farm continued throughout the event. He addressed tens of thousands of music fans on the Saturday afternoon, some wearing Corbyn face masks and T-shirts and other waving banners with his name on them. He received a huge cheer when he criticised growing inequality between rich and poor, highlighted by the Grenfell Tower fire in the Kensington area of London.  He said: “Is it right that so many people in our country have no home to live in and only a street to sleep on  “Is it right so many people are frightened of where they live at the moment having seen the horrors of Grenfell Tower  Is it right that so many people live in such poverty in a society which has such riches  No it obviously isn’t.” In recent months Corbyn has been heavily criticised for the partyaposs handling of anti-Semitism cases under his leadership.The Chief Rabbi accused him of being unfit to be PM, warning that the “overwhelming majority” of British Jews are “gripped by anxiety” over the outcome of the election. He insisted he has developed a much stronger process and had sanctioned and removed members who have been anti-Semitic. Mr Corbyn also denied that the blight increased after he took over the party, saying: It didnapost rise after I became leader. Anti-Semitism is there in society, there are a very, very small number of people in the Labour Party that have been sanctioned as a result about their anti-Semitic behaviour.Days later during an interview on This Morning, he said he is obviously Iaposm very sorry for everything thataposs happened . He added: But I want to make this clear. I am dealing with it. I have dealt with it. Other parties are also affected by anti-Semitism. Corbyn has paid a price for his passion and dedication to the causes he cares about, particularly in his personal le. He married his first we, fellow Labour councillor and university lecturer Jane Chapman, in . The pair orced just five years later, with her claiming his joyless approach to le wrecked their marriage and saying he cared more about campaigning than her needs. She also said she would often find him eating cold baked beans straight from the tin as he simply didnapost care about food.After their marriage ended Corbyn had a year-long relationship with his Labour colleague Diane Abbott in .At the time, -year-old Diane was was working as a race relations officer for the National Council of Civil Liberties.  Their relationship reportedly broke down for the same reason his first marriage fell apart - politics always came first. While their romantic relationship didnapost last long, they remain close friends and a professional alliance. Corbyn has three sons with his third we Claudia Bracchitta, but they split over a disagreement about the boysapos education in . She wanted Ben, their eldest, to attend a grammar but the politician didnapost agree as it would go against his politics - despite attending one himself. She refused to send Benjamin to an inner-city comprehensive and eventually the marriage couldnapost stand the strain.

After a disappointing result which saw the party slump to its worst result since , the race to find his successor will soon start. And before the starting pistol has been fired, some front runners already seem to have started warming up for the race ahead. But how does the Labour leadership race work and who will pick Mr Corbynaposs replacement for the top Labour job  Here is everything you need to know about the Labour leadership contest. When will Labour get a new leader  Jeremy Corbyn has said he will step down in the early part of next year.The timetable for the leadership election is decided by Labour ’s National Executive Committee made up of MPs, unions and party activists.Allies of Corbyn have a majority on the NEC and there are fears they could delay the contest to give a leadership loyalist time to organise a bid. However, it is understood allies currently envisage a -week contest which would finish around Easter. As Tom Watson has stood down as an MP a contest for the deputy leader will be held at the same time.  How is the leader elected Under the old system you needed the backing of % of Labour MPs. Jeremy Corbyn only scraped onto the ballot paper after a handful of moderate MPs lent him their vote to broaden the debate.The rules were changed in  to make it easier for a candidate to get on the ballot paper. You now need the support of % of MPs and either % of constituency parties or % of affiliates . Labour Party members, affiliated trade union members and registered supporters, who can sign up for £, are able to vote. Will the Labour membership elect another left-wing candidate  The change in the rules have certainly made it easier for a contender from Labour’s left to stand. Corbyn was able to increase his grip on the party thanks to the surge in membership, the backing of Unite leader Len McCluskey and the backing of Momentum. Momentum is well organised and a candidate who has its backing will have a head start in any race. Does that mean a candidate from the centre left is doomed  Not necessarily. Rule changes brought in by Corbyn’s allies made it easier to de-select parliamentary candidates. They had hoped this would make it easier to get rid of MPs opposed to his leadership. But in every single de-selection battle the local parties backed the sitting MP including Margaret Hodge, Diana Johnson and Emma Lewell-Buck.

In a letter from party General Secretary Jennie Formby, staff were congratulated for their hard work in the campaign.But the letter also warned that a reduction in money Labour receives to support its work as the Official Opposition meant people may lose their jobs.The letter thanks staff for the incredible work over the last six weeks. But while it confirms that no staffing decisions will be made over the weekend it warns that Labour chiefs will meet early next week with the full time officers from each of the unions to discuss the impact of this result. In what will be a small conciliation to the staff whose jobs are at risk, Ms Formby said that at risk staff, believe to be those associated with Mr Corbynaposs office and the Shadow Cabinet, will not be out of before the end of the year. The party could lose just over £million pound in public support - known as short money -  as it is calculated by the number of MPs a party elects. The Mirror understands that the party is yet to make any decision about where jobs may be lost, but that funding for ious roles is was dependent on the previous level of short money funding. Jennie Formbyaposs letter to staff in full Dear All, Firstly, I want to thank you all for your incredible work over the last six weeks. No-one could have done more than you during the election campaign, whether in London, Newcastle or in the regions - and I know that like me, you will be devastated at the prospect of a Johnson-led Conservative Government. Of course we will now need to spend some time reflecting on the results to determine what our next steps should be, but we will always fight for our Labour values of inclusion, equality and compassion, and to do all we can to resist further privatisation and sell off our NHS and the terrible impact of Tory austerity. I am conscious that many of you will be worried about what this means for you personally and I want to confirm that we won’t be making any decisions in relation to staffing until next week. This includes those staff on contracts linked to Jeremy as Leader of the Opposition or to specic politicians. I want each of you to be able to rest over the weekend after the massive effort everyone has put in. Once the dust has settled we will confirm what this means for you and offer the opportunity to talk to one of the team about it. However, it is very important to reassure you straight away that no one from the above groups of staff will leave before the end of the year.

A North East fortress lost, along with former mining and steel towns like Redcar and Consett. The early result from Blyth Valley – like Sedgefield, held by Labour since  but which also turned Tory – signalled what was in store.For many of the lapsed Labour voters, Brexit was not the key issue – it was Jeremy Corbyn .Moderate Keir Starmer was favoured by some as his successor, while others called for a first female Labour leader, such as traditionalist Angela Rayner, or the more maverick Jess Phillips. But far-left activists Momentum are seen to control the levers of party power through the NEC.  They want a true believer like Mr Corbyn. In Sedgefield, voters want anything but more of the same. Retired headteacher Mike Blocki, , whose Polish father Jack served with the RAF in the Second World War, insisted Labour’s wounds were “self inflicted”. The former Blair backer told the Mirror: “For me, Jeremy Corbyn was simply unelectable. “Momentum and the party in London have lost touch with the rest of the country.  “There were so many die-hard Labour voters in this area that I thought they would have enough to hold the seat. “It goes to show you cannot take anything for granted.” Inside the Dun Cow pub, which once hosted George Bush when he was visiting Blair, visitors from as far afield as New Zealand discussed the result with locals. One elderly diner eating with friends, agreed leadership was the issue. “I turn the news off when Corbyn comes on,” she said. “I voted for Tony Blair , but we would have ended up like Cuba under this lot. There are people here who have voted Labour all their lives and they could not do it this time. Not with him as leader.”Cheryl Grundy, , who runs Betty’s Boudoir on the high street, voted Remain in . But she too backed victorious Conservative Paul Howell, saying: “The [Corbyn] promises sounded fantastic, like free internet for all. “He was spending money on this and that and you think, ‘The books have to balance. How are you going to do that ’” Former MP Phil Wilson, who lost by , votes, said Corbyn had gone down “like a lead balloon” on the doorstep.  Saying it was “delusional” to blame Brexit for the wipeout, he added: “Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership was a bigger problem.” Forty miles away in Blyth, retired MP Ronnie Campbell said he regretted not defending the seat he had won eight times. And after watching Ian Levy’s , votes edge out Susan Dungworth to claim a first Tory win there in  years, the former miner insisted Labour must now “listen to the people”. Ronnie, , said: “We were just not clear enough on Europe and that was the key issue here.  “I think there should be a woman leader now, and it would be good to have a young woman too. We need a breath of fresh air. “I like Jeremy, but the time has come for him to stand down.”Locals also called for a swt end to the Corbyn era.“I wouldn’t trust him to run the bath, let alone the country,” said retired bricklayer Alan Boag, , who voted Tory for the first time. Retired binman Chris Barnes, , added: “I always voted Labour, but Jeremy Corbyn is a complete a***hole, so not this time.”  Ex-miner Mark Wakenshaw, now a taxi driver, stayed with Labour but added: “There is no way I could vote Tory. “But people here were fed up with Brexit – and Jeremy Corbyn.” Keith Ritson, a retired managing director, was walking his great Dane Ge-Ge. He said: “% of this is down to Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell. “The mining legacy is falling away and other things have taken its place.” Darlington, Stockton South, and Durham North West all fell to the Tories.

The party’s MPs, members and union backers must now reflect on why it has lost four general elections in a row. While Jeremy Corbyn has accepted he has to go, the malaise within the Labour movement goes far deeper than just one inidual. The party needs to understand why it lost support in seats it had held, in some cases, for more than  years. There has to be a thoughtful examination of which parts of its manesto resonated with voters and which were seen as too ambitious. And there must be a y exploration of why Labour does not have a single MP in Essex, Worcestershire, Cornwall and Lin­­colnshire... to take a handful of the many constituencies now painted completely blue. After nine years of austerity imposed by an unpopular government this should have been an election where Labour cleaned up. Instead voters decided a Tory government best represented their interests. Labour does not just need to rebuild its red wall of seats, it needs to build bridges with areas which have not backed the party since the days of Tony Blair. The worst response by Labour would be to spend the next few months engrossed in an internal battle for the soul of the party. If there is one lesson from the Corbyn era it is that factionalism and ision inevitably lead to defeat at the ballot box. Playing the blame game will not just be self-indulgent, it will also be counter-productive. Rebuilding Labour will take time but the task has never been more essential. In the next few years it will be more important than ever that there is a strong opposition ready to hold the Government to account and remind people there is a better way, based on better values.

For whatever reason, voters have ed the Tory leader a Commons majority after he risked his career by focusing on leaving the EU above all . His victory in the  general election means we are likely to be officially out of the EU at the end of January. But it is by no means the end of the road, no matter how loudly the Prime Minister proclaims it. So what exactly is going to happen with Brexit , when will it happen, and will it happen at all  Here is everything you need to know. The Prime Minister plans to railroad his withdrawal agreement through Parliament to make sure we leave the EU by January .  MPs will come to the Commonsto begin swearing in on Tuesday  December. The Queen will attend Parliament for a stripped-down Queenaposs Speech on Thursday  December with no ceremonial robes and no golden carriage. MPs will then hold the second reading vote on Boris Johnsonaposs Brexit deal before Christmas - probably on Friday or the Monday after next - to pass its first hurdle. MPs will spend much of the month carrying out detailed scrutiny of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the legal mechanism for translating the Prime Ministeraposs Brexit deal into law. They need to go through a committee stage, aposthird readingapos and the House of Lords before it receives Royal Assent before January . Unfortunately for the nation, it has loads of problems which we explained previously here:Clause  of the Bill has a trapdoor to no-deal Brexit. It says MPs wonapost get a veto on the hard deadline of  December  to get a trade deal . There will also be checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. And the Bill stops short of guaranteeing workersapos rights will continue to be aligned with the EU.Even more unfortunately for the nation, it seems quite likely to pass despite these problems. That is because Boris Johnson ousted nearly all the Tories who were critical of his deal, and made every single candidate sign a loyalty pledge saying they would the his deal through. Is  February  the end   No. Boris Johnson claimed the deal passing would get Brexit out of Parliament and stop people talking about it, but this is a lie. That is because the deal contains a hard deadline of just  months,  December , to secure a Free Trade Agreement with the EU. Most experts including EU chief Michel Barnier say that is simply not possible. If that deadline is not extended, and Boris Johnson says it wonapost be, we could be facing a no-deal Brexit on  January  when the apostransition periodapos, continuing current EU rules, ends. Meanwhile we will be embroiled in months,not years, of trade talks with the EU and other countries, including the US, India and Australia. The Tories say theyaposll aposaim toapos have % of UK trade covered by free trade agreements within the next  years - starting with US, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. But it could be a long road.

But it becomes much, much more dficultBrexit is passed on January . At this point, although there is a transition period, the UK will have legally left its membership of the EU under Article  of the Lisbon Treaty. Before we left, a second referendum would have been held on whether to revoke our exit - effectively cancelling the notice we gave to leave. But after we leave, the UK would have to reapply for membership under Article  of the Lisbon Treaty.

The result is nothing less than devastating. The Red Wall crumbled. Seats which have been held by Labour since the end of World War I are now in the hands of Boris Johnson. This is the worst Labour defeat in  years. And now, we must work out why it happened. Labour’s Leave voters were always in the minority. But losing them proved fatal, tipping the balance in the Conservative’s favour in key English constituencies across the former industrial heartlands. The British electoral system is unforgiving of uneven vote distributions, and even though Corbyn managed to claim just over % more of the vote than Ed Miliband, he wound up with  fewer seats than Labour’s tally after the  election. So does Corbyn’s bruising losses in ex-industrial strongholds mean that his party have lost touch with the working class  Initial polling suggests there’s not a massive dference in the Labour vote across social grades. The really striking story from election  is about age. Out of ’s voters, the Tories command a majority of the electorate aged  and over. But under s  Corbyn absolutely cleaned up. A whopping % of - year olds voted for Labour. And don’t tell me that young people - who are overrepresented in low waged work, burdened by personal debt, and trapped in the extortionate private rental sector - don’t count as the “real” working class. Unlike previous generations, I don’t think that Corbyn’s core support of young voters will necessarily get less radical with age, for the simple reason that they have been failed by s of the status quo. Even when Brexit was nothing but a glint in Farage’s eye, the young people of this country were fobbed off and sold out by politicians of the sensible centre.

People are being urged to look for brown, hard walnut-sized lumps, which look like pine cones, as they may in fact be a sac of - praying mantis eggs. The lumps are usually found on the end of branches and your toasty living room is the prime environment for the critters to hatch. Molly Kreuze, from Springfield, Virginia in the US, was stunned to find her Christmas tree had smuggled hundreds of bugs into her home. She found them crawling up her walls, ceilings and even in her bathroom and bedroom. “They’re fast. They jump,” she said.  To catch the bugs, veterinarian Molly used a box and an envelope, as well as feeding them fruit flies before they were removed from her home.“In my Googling, I discovered that people really like praying mantises,” she said. “They are useful, they eat other bugs. People use them for organic gardening.”Praying mantises can grow to be up to  inches long, according to  National Geographic . And the insects, typically brown or green, are well-camouflaged on trees and other plants. Daniel Reed also previously issued the warning on social media about the bugs and his message has been doing the rounds once again this year.More than , Facebook users have shared the post, with thousands more commenting on it.Daniel advised thatyou find the lump on your tree, to simply cut off the branch and put it outside in the garden. He wrote: If you happen to see a walnut sized shaped egg mass, on your Christmas tree, don’t fret, clip the branch and put it in your garden. These are - preying mantis eggs! We had two egg masses on our tree this year. Don’t bring them inside they will hatch and starve! One person commented: “Another reason I have a fake tree.” A second said: “If I start seeing things crawling across the floor I will be gone until after Christmas.”  A third wrote: “If only I knew this last year before they hatched and were all over my walls.” The warning only applies to real Christmas trees and finding clumps are rare, especially in the UK. However, a Norway Spruce, Scots Pine or Fraser Fir might have once been home to one of the bugs. Research has also revealed that legions of lice, mites, moths and spiders can be lurking in Christmas trees too.[Bugs] hibernate for the winter and usually empty their bodies of fluids, produce a chilled liquid and become completely inactive, said Bjarte Jordal, associate professor of the University Museum of Bergen told the  IB Times  . Upon feeling the heat and being awakened by the light, they believe that springtime has arrived and spring back to le. If you pound the tree on a white cloth before you throw it out after Christmas, you will discover quite a number of small bugs. The study also found that most mites will remain on the trees and soon die owing to a lack of food available to them indoors. A number of people have been sharing their horror stories. One wrote on social media: “A couple years ago the egg case was really hidden because we check our trees well. “After it was in the house for several weeks they sprang or hatched and yes a couple hundred.” "},{"url":null,"title":"caffe nero hasnt paid corporation","story":"NewsCaffe Nero hasnt paid corporation tax for  years skipping potential £.million billThe coffee firm made £ million profit up to May this year but claims shareholders havent taken idends since it was founded  years agoShareCommentsByGraham HiscottHead of Business:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsCaffe Nero has reportedly not been paying corporation tax\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

After a spot of bowling he had gone with a group of friends to the cityaposs Valley precinct, only to be denied access at the door. They took my ID off me, scanned me and then security guard leaned over and said aposoh Iaposm not allowed to let you in because of your mullet, itaposs against the dress codeapos, Jed said. First he was refused entry to Retroaposs Cocktail Lounge and then RG. The experience has left Jed, who says he was not drunk at the time, feeling discriminated against.Lawyer Bill Potts told now that he had never heard of a case like Jedaposs while urging venues not to go down the mullet discrimination road. I can understand itsomebody is drunk or disorderly or violent but when we start entering into hair taste this is a whole new world, he said. Jed says he has no plans to cut off the mullet anytime soon. Staff from Retroaposs approached now while they were filming Jed and attempted to explain their door policy.  At first they said they had a strict dress code and hair policy, before revising the assertion to suggest there was no hair policy but it was up to the management to decide who came in. The mullet is a favourite hairstyle of Australians.

Everybody in this league would want to add quality to their squad.“Looking at the bench on Saturday at Arbroath, we are a bit short. If we get a couple of injuries then you are short but you are always looking to improve anyway.“I’ve said before, I don’t want to go back to chopping and changing  players or whatever every window. That has happened for a number of windows at this club and that has to stop.“That’s why we were so busy in the summer so we don’t have to keep doing that. It has taken a bit of time to get everything right since then.“We are looking where we are short and what we can add but it has to be quality not just to add numbers to bulk up the squad for the second half of the season.”Next up for the Dark Blues is a home clash with one of the form sides in the ision at the moment, Dunfermline.Since Dundee have taken just one point from their last , Stevie Crawford’s Pars have racked up three wins on the spin.“It shows you what can happen,” added James. “We’ve kind of switched. Dunfermline have started winning games and we’ve started losing them.“I met Stevie at a reserve game recently and we were talking about how quickly things can turn.“It shows you thatyou put a couple of results together you’re right back up there. They’re in the play-off places where we need to get back to.“It’s a big game on Saturday, we need to be really positive and take the game to them.”The Dens gaffer is wary of the threat posed by Dunfermline frontman Kevin Nisbet, who has scored  goals in his last seven matches for the Pars.But he says,his team can supply the Dundee strikers with the service Nisbet has enjoyed at East End Park then it’ll be the home attackers making the headlines.He said: “Nisbet is a player I like.“He was a threat in the first game of the season and we’ve obviously seen what he can do since then.“They get the ball into the box for him. The big thing is they’re creating the chances for him and he’s putting them away.“I believe we’ve got strikers who are every bit as good as anybody in the league – and they will score plenty of goals with the right service.Arbroath - Dundee: Dark Blues# winless run extends to four thanks to Bobby Linn#s curler\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arbroath---dundee-dark-blues-winless-run-extends-to-four-thanks-to-bobby-linns-curler embed # secrettQXpZpu\" data-secret\"tQXpZpu\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"“With the strikers we’ve got in our team, we have to play to their strengths.

When you are full of confidence you try things you wouldn’t do when it’s low.“The only way it is going to come back is by picking up results and grafting in training.“Hopefully, we can turn things soon.”Dundee head back to Dens Park aiming to rebuild their relationship with the home faithful after some very disappointing displays.However, Byrne says the Pars are a perfect example of how quickly things can turn around after three straight wins has seen Stevie Crawford’s side shoot up the ision.Byrne said: “We’ve got to win the fans round but we have to do it for ourselves as well.“It’s down to us to get results. We know it hasn’t been good enough as a team and inidually, so we need to get results. Only those will get fans back onside.”He added: “You could see when we got our three wins in a row it pushed us right up the table and you can see that now with Dunfermline.“I think they were down in mid-table and now they are up in third. One result can change a lot in this league and we need that.“Dunfermline will come here confident after a few good results but we are at home and we need to use that advantage.“We had a decent home record up until the last few. We need to get wins here and make this a hard place to come.”Byrne began his career with Dunfermline in the old First Division before moving on to Livingston after three years.There are still one or two old faces around the club he remembers but the midfielder insists his only focus is on his own, and the team’s, performance.“It’s a club I know really well and they gave me a chance to play in the first team,” he added.“I have a lot of good memories there but it was a long time ago now. I want to concentrate on doing well for Dundee, though.“I know myself I’ve not been good enough. I’ve had some good games but I’ve not played well consistently enough week to week.“When we got those three wins in October I was starting to feel good. Inidually, I know I can be a lot better.“I’m not going to say I’m going to do this and that. I can only work as hard as possible and I’m sure it will come together again and I can get back to how I was playing last season and enjoying things again.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.42076342-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.42076342-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.42076342-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.42076342-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"evening telegraphs christmas cash winner ready for a spending spree","story":"Shonni Cullen is celebrating her festive fortune after winning the #s Christmas cash contest.The -year-old Dundee woman scooped the £ prize when her name was plucked out the hat from more than  potential winners.Shonni, of Baldovie Terrace, told how she had already completed her Christmas shopping and was planning to spoil herself and fiancee Chris Webster with a little extra bonus gts.She said: #To be honest, I am not sure what I will spend the money on although I have got a few wee things to get and possibly buy myself clothes and an extra present for Chris.#We only got engaged in July, so we have not set a date yet for the wedding, so the money will go on us after getting most of my Christmas presents.

She spent most of her time alone in her bedroom.One day she randomly bought an embroidery kit online and became hooked on having a task and “creating something beautul”, improving her feeling of self-worth in the process.Inspired, she was suddenly eager to take part in crafting sessions to learn more but could only manage a few steps outside the door.Nicola said: “Everyone was out living their lives and to me an achievement would be only napping once a day, instead of three times.“When I first started going out again it was terrying. I felt so shaky and unsure of everything.“I’d been in the house so long that one of our downstairs neighbours who moved in four years earlier didn’t even know I lived there.“I knew from research it was important not to push myself into things too fast, so I stopped at the end of the path.“Turning around to go back inside was a huge relief and getting back into our flat was like being wrapped in a big safety blanket but I soon became aware of how confined I was inside.” vw, px\"  Nicola slowly began to attend crafting workshops with her parents also in attendance, the first of which was a puppet making class ran by How It Felt.The social enterprise uses puppet-making and drama sessions to encourage people to talk about mental health issues, which Nicola says played a huge part in her recovery journey.From there she got the confidence to join other crafting groups and started an online distance learning course with the Embroiderer’s Guild to ease back into studying.Nicola says she still often feels unwell but the intensity has reduced to such an extent that she hopes to one day study at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"sweet-smell-success-stunning-star-sophia-loren","story":"ON A rainy day in Glasgow, Sophia Loren gazes wistfully across the city, as starry-eyed shoppers gathered below in the hope of catching a glimpse of their idol."},{"url":null,"title":"2020-edition-glasgow-times-past-calendar---need-know","story":"ITS the bestselling calendar that each year showcases some great images from our huge photo archive."},{"url":null,"title":"rich-man-poor-man-life-expectancy-gap","story":"Men in the poorest areas of Glasgow are expected to die  years earlier than in the most affluent areas of Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"pre-payment-changes-scottish-gas-accounts","story":"Scottish Gas customers are being warned about changes to pre-payment accounts coming in the new year."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-st-mungo-miracles-know-history-books","story":"THE trouble with the Dark Ages is that they are very aptly named.

It’s a tough game at Easter Road, although we have always done particularly well there.“They are a team of similar size and probably ambitions and it was disappointing to lose.“Looking back it didn’t feel like a - game – we were well in the game and we had good opportunities to score the first goal.“We got into good areas but we weren’t clinical enough. We look at the first goal and from our point of view it’s avoidable.“We’ve concentrated on looking at the goals we’ve lost and the types of goals we’ve lost in the last couple of games.“We want to make sure we give ourselves every chance of winning by eradicating the type of goals we’ve lost.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 25 2019","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe have been overwhelmed this week by the musical talent across Argyll # from world-winning drummers, to the singers at last week#s Mòd in Glasgow and the original performers on the MOJO stage in Ardfern.It is encouraging to see such home-grown talent.

Funds raised go towards the peace building work of the Peace Pledge Union, who are unashamedly against wars and the causes of wars.On Tuesday November  and Thursday November  we will be selling white poppies from the foyer of the Lochgilphead Co-op.Bob Dixon, MinardSir,I agree with the points made by Robert MacIntyre in last week#s edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser, when he says that the proposed education cuts are #madness#.This madness is being forced on councils by the SNP government and its Green Party allies at Holyrood, who for years have been voting for Scottish Government budgets which force councils to make cuts.Unless the SNP and the Greens change course and stop cutting the money they give to councils, this madness will continue.I hope that Mr MacIntyre, a former SNP councillor, will write to the leaders of the SNP and the Greens and demand they give councils enough money to stop these mad cuts.Councillor Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll and ButeDear AileenWe are responding to your recent consultation about the council budget.Whilst we are very sympathetic to the dficulties that all public bodies, including the Scottish Government, have faced as a result of a decade of austerity it is only fair to point out that this was imposed not by the Scottish Parliament, but by Westminster.The truth is that overall the Scottish Government has maintained the overall funding for local government, as a share of the overall budget, at around  per cent.Councils have, once again, the option of raising additional funds by increasing the council tax, something they have sought for a long while.The inidual share of the total funding allocated to councils is decided by COSLA, using a needs-based formula. Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"a garden of festive delight","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNot your common or garden evening of entertainment, a special festive concert will be held next week near Minard.Friends of Crarae will present their annual carol concert at Crarae Garden on Thursday December .The evening will feature Cumlodden choir and guests and the audience is welcome to sing along.Festive refreshments and a raffle will be available at the concert, which opens at .pm for a .pm start.Tickets will cost £ on the door, and the National Trust for Scotland shop will be open for those last-minute gts."},{"url":null,"title":"an ardrishaig piano recital to remember","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSaturday November  was a cold and frosty day and, whilst the audience had the luxury of warm hats and coats to fend off the chill of a  degrees centigrade hall, this was not afforded to soloist of the day, the -year-old Ukrainian Russian pianist Vitaly Pisarenko.When many would, however, have struggled with the cold, from his first entry he appeared unphased by it and indeed gave us a memorable exhibition of astonishing virtuosity and musicianship.Each half of his well-balanced programme started with early Beethoven sonatas, beginning with his first, Op. No. . Dedicated to his hero, Haydn, this was delivered with the reverence it deserved and the clarity and drive of the final Prestissimo would have pleased the dedicatee no end.The first half ended with two Chopin Polonaises # Op.  Nos.  and  # and his third Ballade. The second Polonaise was particularly impressive with its menacing opening figure and Vitaly#s judicious use of the sustaining pedal lent great clarity to all three pieces and indeed to all his recital.After the intermission came Beethoven#s Sonata Op.  No. . By this time Beethoven had developed his own inidual persona and the three contrasting movements of this work were beautully executed, particularly the Adagio with its slow melody and stuttering accompaniment and the contrasting fluidity of the final Allegretto.Next we heard Bela Bartok#s Suite Op. . This was typical Bartok from beginning to end, spikey, angular and generally very speedy and played with incredible precision. When I said to Vitaly that it sounded fiendishly dficult he retorted: # It#s actually quite easy I learned it in three days.#While not normal fare for our audience this, hopefully, was an interestingFirebird is probably Stravinsky#s best known work apart from, maybe, his #Rite of Spring#, and both were originally written as ballet scores. However, due to their popularity, over time these and other works of his have been transcribed by ious people for all sorts of instrumental combinations, and the Agosti transcription of Firebird for piano solo that Vitaly played as his finale is probably the most well known. It makes huge demands on the soloist as Agosti endeavoured to encapsulate Stravinsky#s rich orchestration into a work for only two hands it only works in the correct hands and Vitaly#s were just such hands.This was an electrying rendition and not just for the sheer virtuosity as there were gorgeous quiet sections as well. The thunderous applause at the end said it all.Virtuosity is a given nowadays and over the years we have heard some fine pianists at Ardrishaig, but it was Vitaly#s musical integrity and attention to detail which was a cut above and truly inspirational. This was indeed a recital to remember.The concert, in Ardrishaig Public Hall, was staged by Mid Argyll Arts Association in association with Argyll and Bute Concert tours."},{"url":null,"title":"stormy argyll weather to subside for polling day","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more #

the trade.Its December now and, as most of the country are battening down the hatches, we keen photographers are getting their thermies ready for sorties outside to shoot winter scenes.The first pieces of kit before you even think about cameras are proper winter outdoor clothing. Plenty of layers, with a good waterproof top layer. Good thermal socks too as you may find yourself standing around for ages on the spot waiting for suitable light to shoot a scene.If you are comfortable then yoursquoll be thinking about photography and not about getting home to a warm fire. Thatrsquos protection for you, but you have to think about your equipment too.Top-end cameras have good weather sealing these days but it may not be  per cent effective, so get a rain cover for your camera bag and a cover for your camera. You can easily make a camera cover from plastic bags and rubber bands, and yoursquore recycling into the bargain.Another thing to think about is batteries, take at least one spare with you and keep it your pocket, not the camera bag. When itrsquos really cold the batteries donrsquot last very long at all so keeping them a bit warmer than ambient maintains their charge until you need it.Snow scenes make great subjects to photograph, and extremely popular. They are one of my favourite genres, running a close second to pictures of the night sky.There is a big problem with snow scenes however and that is SNOW. In a lot of hurriedly taken snow scenes, the snow will appear blue or grey. Thats not the cameras fault, its exposure meter doing what it was designed to do and try and get a compromise exposure to fit the whole frame. However, the camera tries to base everything on what we call an  per cent grey and averages the exposure to suit. Snow is very reflective, particularly in sunlight, and fools the camera meter into under-exposing the scene hence everything will appear dull and not like the lovely glistening snow you were looking at.This is where the photographer has to intervene. We deliberately over-expose what the camera meter is telling us by at least one stop, probably two. It ies a little between cameras and personal preference. I like to over-expose by one and a half stops. Stop! Whatrsquos a stop  A stop is the doubling or halving of the amount of light reaching your sensor . For example,the camera meter says expose for  th of a second, one stop over-exposed would be  th of a second and two stops over would be  th of a second. Using this method you compensate for the light meter wanting to under-expose.On your camera, you can achieve this by either using full manual control of your exposure or using an exposure compensation setting, which many cameras have. Et voila, nice white snow every time. Be careful you donrsquot drop the shutter speed too low though, or you wont get sharp shots handheld, even with image stabilisation . I try to avoid going below  th handheld, faster than that sometimes, depending on how much coffee Ive had.Irsquom not going to be popular for saying this but I hope we get Beast from the East . I had a couple of the best days out with a camera Irsquove had in years during and after that storm.Herersquos a couple of shots I took before sunrise two days before The Beast struck proper. The sunrise one is two exposures blended, one for the sky and one for the snow. If Irsquod just exposed to get the snow right Irsquod have blown out the sky. If Irsquod exposed for the sky the snow would have been dark grey. Sometimes you have to resort to a few tricks.Photo of the month this time is Festival Salute by our syllabus secretary Alistair Peacock. It is a multi-award-winning image this one, and one my favourites. Taken in Edinburgh around Tattoo time, Alistair asked this US soldierhe could take a photo of him.

particularly bathers going through the motions and winning the No-Belle Prize - the capers and costumes were crazy, and the fun-filled score was sensational.But the true highlights of this adorable show were the tearjerkers and the heart-breaking performances of Aimee Richardson, as Belle, and Sam Johnston, as Prince Danton.The Right Angle Theatre Company has uncovered a couple of crackers with these two.Their dueted version of Calum Scotts Youre the Reason was breathtaking.Johnston had already made an impact with his remarkably good take on Im On My Way, and Richardson had shone throughout the early scenes, but once together it was veneration rather than laughter that resounded around the Volunteer Hall.Steve Hartley-Oliver didnt help either with his accomplished performance as the tormented Beast.And, while slightly more limited in his vocal range than the two leads, his performance of Lewis Capaldis Someone You Loved had most reaching for the tissues.But Beauty and the Beast is much, much more than a weep-fest.Tracy Borthwick and Emma Wilson were a hoot as Belles sisters, Whitney and Britney.From their fainting fits at the sight of Gustave to their obsession with treatments, laughs were never far away.And the dynamic duo of Stuart Mitchell and Amanda Blacklock as the Brawest beauticians in Galae, Marcell and Monique, had the hall in uproar for much of the night.Clad in Olivia Newtown-John-esque Lets Get Physical clobber from the s, Blacklock and Mitchell stole many a scene.And their accents - Mitchells pure Galae and Blacklocks Essex - worked a treat.Craig Douglass De Niro-sounding Gustave also had his fair share of one-liners in his attempts to deflect the unwanted attentions of Whitney and Britney.And both Julie Smith, as Madame Le Fou, and Scott Robertson, as Alphonse, were a delight with their over-the-top performances.A panto, though, isnt a panto without a dame.The Right Angle Theatre Company appears to have a natural - Jodie Millar as Madame Fi was yet again a sensation.From wild wigs and fervently festive costumes to hilariously adapted versions of Ghostbusters and Chansom Damour, Millar made the stage his own.And he was ably supported by Billy Rooney as Fis son, Jacques.Having tumbled straight from the set of childrens show Rainbow, Rooney has a natural ability for slapstick.Rachel Falconer provided the good side of panto from the sidelines as the fairy Flora, while hitting back with her own couplets was Amy Welsh as the sinister Belladonna.,params: .pushWelsh, with her scarlet dress and green-lighting, was remarkably good as the villain.All good shows, though, rely on the music and Calders song choice was spot-on.From the Boo Radleys and Abba to Elton John and Queen, Beauty and the Beast was a foot-tapping, sing-alonging great night out.While the hits rolled, traditional favourites werent forgotten.The wonderful cast of children were delightful with their environmentally aware Country Gardens and Ugly Bugs Ball, and they made sure Coulter wasnt forgotten with a lovely version of Ally Bally Bee.Stuart Mitchell and Julie Smith should take an additional bow for the choreography.And the dancers and chorus were in fine form throughout the show with every big number being turned into a visual treat.As has become the custom with the Right Angle Theatre Companys annual panto, the loudest cheers of the night were saved for the Braw Lad and Lass as well as Santa Claus.While the mood wasnt always merry, Beauty and the Beast provided the opportunity for this talented company to showcase what they can do -

Several of the buildings around the airfield were flying the Hammer and Sickle and painted up with Russian signage etc to suit the situation.If I remember correctly the premiere of the finished film was shown in Campbeltown and those watching who had ever flown into the town on normal domestic flights could easily recognise the approach to the airport and runway with the loch beyond. With a few patches of articial snow here and there it could well have been in Siberia. There were great hoots and laughter at the showing whenever those in the audience recognised their pals in unorm with rles at the ready or being carried in on stretchers. Great memories.I also remember the scrapped jet engines from the wrecked airliner lying in McFadyen#s yard in Glebe street for a long time. It was a great movie anyway and anyone who hadn#t heard about it should seek it out to watch.Ron Gay,Dunoon.Broken promiseSir,The Scottish Accident and Emergencywaiting time target has been missed by a long way for yet another month, with only . per cent of patients treated within  hours in September compared to the  per cent target.Doctors and nurses work incredibly hard, but they’re hindered by the SNP government’s poor workforce planning. Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in. A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

It was this versatility which led a senior manager to describe their assistance as #invaluable#, as they were some of the only engineers capable of repairing boilers once the network was restored.Speaking to the Courier after they ed to Campbeltown last Friday, the men said that during three and a half days# work in Falkirk, they visited  houses.Ronnie, , who has worked for SGN for -and-a-half years described the experience as #quite an eye-opener#.He said: #There were maps up on the walls, managers everywhere # it was like something from a Second World War film. Hats off to the managers who organised everything as it was a major incident.#We lost power here for six days in  so we know what it#s like for them, and how people would be feeling, so we got there as quickly as we could.#People in Falkirk couldn#t have been nicer everyone was very understanding. The staff at Camelon Community Centre, which served as our base, spent a lot of hours volunteering and were really nice and helpful.#Ryan, , who has worked for SGN for two years, was supposed to be receiving training at the time but was pulled out to help in Falkirk.Both men agreed that the incident gave them good on-the-job experience and they would help in a similar situation #in a heartbeat#.Campbeltown has three FCOs, so the town was left in safe hands should a situation have arisen while the boys were away.It is believed that a fault in a piece of equipment that regulates pressure in the gas network was to blame for the issues.In a statement, SGN said: #Over recent days, our engineers have been working tirelessly to restore gas to more than , homes across Falkirk.#We’ve been joined by engineers from across the UK, which has enabled us to reconnect supplies more quickly than we first anticipated.#We know that it’s been a challenging few days without your gas supply, but we’ve been overwhelmed by the sense of community spirit.#Ronnie McKerral, left, and Ryan Deans, right, assisted with the major gas outage. _cgas"},{"url":null,"title":"married-woman-claimed-single-pocket-60-000-benefits","story":"Claire Robertson obtained pound, in tax credits from  to  after she informed the authorities she was living at home as a single woman.Robertson, , began the wrongful claim in August  and carried on claiming cash she was not entitled to, under her maiden name of Wells, until March last year.But following an investigation, it emerged Robertson had married her husband in September  and he was earning an income.Robertson, of Dolphingstone View, appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court last Thursday where she pleaded guilty to obtaining pound, in tax credits she was not entitled to.Prosecutor Heather Carmichael told the court that Robertson had ldquonot advised the tax credit office of her marriage and was claiming the cash as a single person.Ms Carmichael said: ldquoShe was residing with her husband and the tax credits should not have been paid on that basis.

In fact, hatred of dference is indeed amongst us.A friend of mine was on a bus heading from East Lothian into Edinburgh last week and witnessed a horrible racist verbal assault on a Polish family. The horric murders in London are also part of the same hatred of dference ndash a man so full of hatred for people who think dferently that he randomly killed two amazing young people.Hatred is a virus that can infect any society and any inidual in it. History has taught us that fanning its flames can be an easy way for politicians to win power. But like real fire, once itrsquos released it can spread and destroy uncontrollably.People say fight fire with fire, but here the comparison ends, for we cannot fight hatred with hatred. Hatred only spawns more of it.And so I searched for words of that remarkable young woman Anne Frank, who left her diary behind, unknowing that it would be her gt to the world. Words I could share with my daughter, from one young thinking child to another. Despite writing at a time of unimaginable fear and horror, in her diary she has left us a timeless message of hope that comes from her rejection of hate:ldquoItrsquos dficult in times like these ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. Itrsquos a wonder I havenrsquot abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.It is our responsibility to live up to that inspiring message from a young woman who was a victim of the hate she rejected utterly to show our children, our family and friends, our colleagues and those we meet on a bus, that love, tolerance, empathy and respect of dference is the counter to hate.And we should expect no less from all our politicians."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-replace-old-boxing-gym-housing","story":"REM Associates have lodged planning applications seeking to replace the th century former Tranent Methodist Church building on Bridge Street with four two-bedroom flats.They submitted the applications on behalf of businessman and premises owner Alex Brown, who founded Bronx Boxing Gym, which was based at the old church, a decade ago.In recent years, Mr Brown had no involvement in the running of the boxing club but still let its boxers use the building.However, costly repairs were needed to make the former church safe, which led to the boxing club vacating the premises.Earlier this year, the club moved to the newly established Fit-in Fitness Gym on High Street, Musselburgh.A planning application has been submitted for the former church building and the east wall which faces the car park on Coal Neuk to be demolished.Drawings included within a second planning application show designs for erecting four two-bedroom flats with a basement car park with space for four cars."},{"url":null,"title":"familys-spectacular-christmas-lights-display","story":"The Woods family open their very own Santarsquos grotto and decorate their home each year to raise money for Mission Christmas and Cash for Kids.This year, there are more than , lights at their family home and in their garden.Dad Stevie Woods said the family ldquojust love Christmas and hope the stream of visitors theyrsquore expecting will leave donations for charity, either cash or a toy.They raised pound on their opening night.The lights were switched on for visitors on Sunday at pm and will be on from .pm to pm daily until Christmas.The grotto is open for visitors, who can enjoy the Disney characters painted on the inside and the Christmas films playing.There is also a Santa Sleigh where children can get their photograph taken, and this year there will be the addition of a Santa train, which Stevie made himself out of whisky barrels.He said: ldquoLast year we raised about pound so wersquore hoping to beat that.

Bolsover, represented for  years by its very own ldquobeast, Dennis Skinner, and West Bromwich East, until recently the seat of Tom Watson, now ex of the Labour Party, fell.And perhaps even more symbolic was the seat of former premier and three-time Labour election winner Tony Blair, Sedgefield, succumbing to the Tories with a , majority.Alan Johnson, the former Home Secretary, told ITV News Labours huge losses were down to a \"culture of betrayal\" against the working class community.\"I dont live in London, I live in Yorkshire, a working class community. Corbyn was a disaster on the doorstep. Everyone knew that he couldnt lead the working class out of a paper bag,\" declared the former Hull MP.After the result emerged Michael Gove, the critic-turned-cheerleader for Mr Johnson, sought to cheerfully underscore the Toriesrsquo achievement by noting how \"both the Durham Miners Gala and the Notting Hill Carnival will take place in seats held by Conservatives\".Of course, with all those northern working class seats Mr Johnson has a new responsibility indeed, the once liberal Conservative Party under David Cameron has become something dferent: a blue-collar Conservative Party with a strong northern England accent.Indeed, in both his dawn rally speech and his victory address from outside No , the Tory leader acknowledged this.He said: ldquoIn this moment of national resolution I want to speak directly to those who made it possible and to all those who voted for us, for the first time, all those whose pencils may have wavered over the ballot and who heard the voices of their parents and their grandparents whispering anxiously in their ears.ldquoI say thank you for the trust you have placed in us and in me and we will work round the clock to repay your trust and to deliver on your priorities with a parliament that works for you.After the result of the  EU referendum, which took Westminster by surprise, Dominic Cummings, the PMrsquos chief aide, suggested the same ignorance by the denizens of SW was on display.Characteristically frank, he noted: \"After the shock of the referendum MPs and journalists should have taken a deep breath and had a lot of self-reflection of why they misunderstood what was going on in the country.ldquoBut instead a lot of people just doubled down on their own ideas and f****d it up even more.

But has it The SNPrsquos manesto was certainly straight-forward on the point.ldquoA vote for the SNP in this election is a vote to endorse the following proposition: it must be for the Scottish Parliament not Westminster to decide when an independence referendum should be held and the SNP intends that it will be in .Launching the manesto last month, the First Minister also said an SNP win would be a ldquoclear instruction to get on and hold the vote next year.Her partyrsquos gains on that basis, and the Scottish Toriesrsquo losses on an equally direct ldquoNo to Indyref , suggest it ought to be cut and dried.However, although the SNP undoubtedly has momentum on Indyref, the existence of a mandate is not so simple, given Ms Sturgeon has built it on rickety foundations.Ms Sturgeon has consistently identied the  Scottish election as the source of her mandate, arguing it has been raised to ever greater levels of awesomeness through successive elections and votes in Holyrood.For a while, in response to Theresa May saying now was not the time for Indyref, the First Minister said her mandate was ldquocast-iron.Then, in , she said the SNP winning most Scottish seats would upgrade to a ldquotriple-lock version. This weekrsquos win is the latest tier of the tower.But it has always been a mongrel mandate. True, the SNP and Scottish Greens won a majority of Holyrood seats in . But their MSPs were elected on very dferent manestos when it came to independence.In the wake of the No vote just  months previously, both parties felt obliged to tiptoe round the issue.To avoid being accused of ignoring the publicrsquos will, they resorted to tortured formulations that have undermined the notion of a clear mandate ever since.In the  Scottish election, the SNP had been clear and upfront.ldquoWe will give Scots the opportunity to decide our nationrsquos future in an independence referendum, said the manesto on which they won an absolute majority.But in , that straightforward pitch was rewritten and made contingent on other events.The manesto position became a statement that Holyrood ldquoshould have the right to hold another referendumthere is clear and sustained evidence that independence has become the preferred option of a majority of the Scottish people - orthere is a signicant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in , such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will.Despite Ms Sturgeonrsquos subsequent elevation of it, at the time this was essentially a box-ticking exercise. Like most of the country, the SNP did not believe Brexit would happen. It famously spent less money campaigning to stay in the EU than it did on a byelection in Glenrothes.However, as the main party of independence, it had to refer to a referendum somehow.So it arrived at a baroque, Brexit-related form of words that held out the possibility of independence, albeit in what it then considered highly improbable circumstances.The SNP then went backwards in . Although its constituency vote share rose .%, their regional share fell .%, and they fell from  MSPs to , losing their overall majority.A rum sort of basis for a mandate.Meanwhile, the Scottish Greens went off on their own tangent.Their  manesto had touted ldquoa multi-option referendum with choices including the status quo, a stronger Scottish Parliament with powers defined through a participative process, and full independence based on a written constitution.But by September , the Greens said the timing of Indyref, should no longer be the plaything of politicians.Instead it ldquoshould be determined by public appetitehellip For example, a call for a referendum signed by up to m people on the electoral register.Thus their  manesto said: ldquoIf a new referendum is to happen, it should come about by the will of the people, and not be driven by calculations of party political advantage. In such a referendum the Scottish Greens will campaign for independence.But there was never a petition.All of which gives Boris Johnson enough room to contest the validity of Ms Sturgeonrsquos mandate, at least until the  election comes round.

It will be in the early part of next year.\"The Labour leader appeared to lay the complete blame for his partyrsquos woeful performance ndash the worst since  ndash not on his leadership but on Brexit.

There is socialism, there is social justice, there are radical manestos, all of which are there.\"He added: \"I dont think they are unelectable at all.\"The Labour leaderrsquos allies echoed the point that his leadership was not the issue, saying the defeat was down to the inability to overcome dferences over Brexit rather than a rejection of Mr Corbyns radical left-wing policy programme.But an Opinium post-poll survey of more than , people on Friday suggested the reason why voters rejected Labour were its leadership -  per cent - its stance on Brexit -  per cent - and its economic policies -  per cent.Dame Margaret Hodge, re-elected in Barking and Dagenham, who clashed forcefully with the party leader over the anti-Semitism row, tweeted: \"Corbyn talking about a period of reflection. Ive reflected. You failed. Please stand down.\"The veteran backbencher claimed that because anti-Jewish hatred had been allowed to flourish within Labour, it had become the \"nasty party\" under Mr Corbynrsquos leadership.She was not alone in her call for his immediate departure.Lord Blunkett, the former Home Secretary, told the BBC: \"Jeremy should go now. There should be an interim leader agreed between the National Executive and the parliamentary party perhaps somebody like Hilary Benn.\"It would really helpthe clique that runs the Labour Party at the moment just said sorry. I havent heard one of them apologise to all those who lost their seats last night,\" the Labour peer stressed.Mr Benn argued that voters simply did not have confidence in Mr Corbyns leadership.\"Any Labour canvasser will tell you we knocked on too many doors where people said: Ive voted Labour all my le but Im not going to vote Labour on this occasion, and they didnt have confidence in the leadership of the party.\"Phil Wilson, who lost Tony Blairs former seat of Sedgefield to the Tories, said attempts by the leadership to put the result down to Brexit was \"mendacious nonsense\".\"Jeremy Corbyns leadership was a bigger problem. To say otherwise is delusional. The partys leadership went down like a lead balloon on the doorstep,\" he claimed.Now, Labour faces not only an examination of where it all went wrong but also a contest to succeed Mr Corbyn.The early runners and riders are thought to include: Keir Starmer, the Shadow Brexit Secretary Emily Thornberry, the Shadow Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, the former Shadow Home Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey, the Shadow Business Secretary, and Angela Rayner, the Shadow Education Secretary.John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, tipped by some as a potential successor to Mr Corbyn, swtly ruled himself out. However, given the membership now decides who the leader is, then it is likely that whoever succeeds the current party leader will be a Corbynite which would rule out Ms Cooper and probably Sir Keir.Last night, Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, insisted the party had to ldquolisten and rebuild after a devastating result.But after the  Labour landslide Tory leader William Hague embarked on a ldquolistening tour to understand why the voters had rejected his party so comprehensively. The listening, however, was not to the British people but Conservative grassroots, who effectively reinforced the view that there was nothing wrong with the partyrsquos policies they were simply not sold hard enough to an uncomprehending public.If Labour does the same, then it, like the Tories in  will be out of power for at least a decade or more.Last night, a rumour was doing the rounds at Westminster Boris Johnson would on Saturday venture to northern England to make a speech, underpinning his commitment to his new blue-collar constituency in what were former Labour heartlands.As the Oppositionrsquos soul-searching began, so too did the process for the bruised Liberal Democrats, whose own poor performance was encapsulated by the loss of their leader Jo Swinson. For the second time in four years, the Scot became the victim of an SNP surge.In her farewell address, Ms Swinson said she had been \"devastated\" by the election results, in which her party took just  seats, down by one on the partys  showing at the polls.But she insisted she did not \"regret trying\" to be the \"unapologetic voice of Remain\" and \"giving people the chance to choose to stop Brexit\".And yet it may well be the Lib Dem leadershiprsquos decision to aclaim it could go from  seats to  seats in one giant leap to form a majority government and bscrap Brexit altogether without another referendum put many voters off.Ms Swinson and her advisers had been warned at the partyrsquos autumn party conference from grandees like Simon Hughes and Norman Lamb that backing a policy to revoke Article  was a bad move it would push the centrist Lib Dems to an extreme position a mirror image of Nigel Faragersquos Brexit Party.Even at the launch of the partyrsquos manesto in Camden, the leader began to row back on the prospect of a Lib Dem Government, lowering her sights to simply stopping the Conservatives getting a majority.And she later had to admit as the polls for her party went south, that the idea of her entering No  was ldquovery unlikely. Hubris, as always, was followed by nemesis.And so, like Labour, it looks like it will take many years for the Lib Dems to claw their way back to anything like the number of MPs they had under Paddy Ashdown, Charles Kennedy or Nick Clegg.All the zealous converts, Chuka Ummuna, Sam Gyimah and Luciana Berger failed to secure seats under the orange banner.With Ms Swinsonrsquos departure, Ed Davey, the deputy leader, and party President, Baroness Brinton, were quickly installed as their partyrsquos joint acting leaders.Interestingly, in her valedictory speech Ms Swinson name-checked all the partyrsquos experienced female MPs as possible successors: Sarah Olney Wera Hobhouse Christine Jardine and Layla Moran.ldquoWe will reflect, regroup and refresh,\" declared the former party leader.Having seen a Brexit-backing Conservative Party and the Scottish Nationalists make gains at the election, she warned of a \"resurgent Nationalism\" in the country and urged the party to \"foster hope\".She added: \"All of us who share an alternative vision for society have a responsibility to learn from these results and find new answers.

He more recently opened the gastropubs Scran and Scallie in Edinburgh and Gullanersquos Bonnie Badger, both of which achieved Michelinrsquos Bib Gourmand award for good food at great prices.ldquoI think the most important thing is that we are very honest in what we do and give it everything wersquove got, the Scot says. ldquoThe Scottish Restaurant scene is as strong as it has ever been and there are amazing restaurants in Glasgow and the West of Scotland.

The children get a meal and the knock -on effect is they also get an education.Mr Kitchin says he gets asked to support lots of charities but is drawn to those supporting children. Sadly even in Scotland, schools have been used to help families feed their kids, he says, with problems such as ldquoholiday hunger increasingly recognised, he points out.ldquoWe have similar problems here in Scotland. It is brutal what happens to some kids in the holidays and Christmas really hits it all home.ldquoAt this time of year, people are getting a new box from Amazon through the door every day ndash but this Maryrsquos Meals campaign really makes you think.

His five establishments now employ  people, which he says is a big responsibility he and his we Michaela feel keenly.ldquoWe are proud to be doing this in Scotland, he said. ldquoBut we are worried about Brexit.

Our business doesnrsquot work without those people.They will be the chefs of the future, he says, instilled with the philosophy behind his award-wining restaurants and his faith in Scotlandrsquos charms.ldquoMy philosophy is when tourists come, they are going to be blown away with the scenery and the history.

in a declaration thatrsquos enough to make you want to pour a very stf drink ndash a dram, preferably ndash our national drink has been declared as anything but.According to the makers of a new film that explores the cultural impact of whisky from its origins to modern times, whiskyrsquos Scottish roots would appear to be ever so slightly Irish.Asthat wasnrsquot enough to make whisky drinkers choke on their finest malt, therersquos even a very strong hint that our best-loved export might just have a slice of English DNA too.According to Glasgow-based whisky expert Dave Broom, who explores whiskyrsquos heritage in the film The Amber Light, and its producer Adam Park, there is ldquostrong evidence to suggest whisky may have been first developed in Ireland and brought to Islay, to be drunk at the seat of the High Kings.There, under the distilling expertise of one particular Irish family, the spirit is thought to have evolved into a tipple bearing at least a passing similarity to todayrsquos whisky.According to Mr Park, research carried out for the film suggests the Beaton family ndash Irish physicians who developed a vast international knowledge of botanical remedies ndash probably hold the key to the earliest forms of what would become the first Scotch whisky.ldquoThe Beatons were pretty amazing people, they travelled the world translating medical scripts and building their knowledge, he said.ldquoThey came to service of the High Kings and became experts in distilling spirit and added to it the plants and flowers that grew around them.The Beatons, whose family name appears as MacMeic-bethad and MacBeth, are thought to have arrived on Islay in the th century at the time of the marriage between Aine OrsquoCathain and Angus Og MacDonald, Lord Of The Isles.While there is no clear documentation to conclusively link the family to the origins of whisky, there are said to be clear signs their skills were almost certainly involved.Mr Park added: ldquoIt gets murky and therersquos not an accepted history of how whisky came about, but the best guess is the Beatons came to Islay when it was the seat of the High Kings who ruled huge parts of Scotland and Ireland.However, research for the film led to another twist: the English were probably already creating their own form of a dram at about the same time.Speaking to the , Mr Broom said: ldquoIf you look at the north of Ireland and across to Islay, thatrsquos the cradle of distillationhellip but the first record I found is in Chaucerrsquos Canterbury Tales.The Beaton family became hereditary physicians to the Scottish crown, serving Robert The Bruce and every subsequent Scottish king, while also providing medical knowledge to clan chiefs from the Western Isles to the Lowlands.They were known to make use of medicinal plants and traditional therapies at a time when others relied on superstition and myths as often ill-fated cures for illnesses and injuries.As word spread of their comforting drink, whisky stills spread across Scotland.Scotch whisky was first recorded on the Exchequer Rolls in  when a friar called John Cor, distiller at Lindores Abbey in Newburgh, Fe, and servant to the court of James IV, was noted to have made ldquoaqua vitae, VIII bolls of malt.While the Beatonrsquos fellow countrymen pursued distilling their own Irish whiskey, Mr Park says Scotsrsquo ingenious methods of circumventing taxes and American prohibition laws ndash when Scotch was allowed as a ldquomedicinal product ndash helped embed whisky as the premium spirit.Later, shrewd marketing practices with their focus on Highland history and heritage, saw whisky overwhelm its Irish and American cousins and lay foundations for todayrsquos pound. billion export market.The film, which is currently touring cinemas across the country, also explores how whisky has become embedded in Scottish culture yet is constantly evolving to attract new generations of drinkers.That, he adds, includes cocktails and mixers that shatter whiskyrsquos traditional ldquogentleman in tweeds image ndash such as Lagavulin mixed with Coke, dubbed a Smokey Cokey.ldquoLike any commercial enterprise, whisky needs to attract new customers, says Mr Park. ldquoThe image of the stuffy old man in a leather armchair in the library having an undiluted single malt is still there, but itrsquos also not there.A spokesman for the Scotch Whisky Association said: ldquoThe earliest known record of Scotch Whisky production dates from the Exchequer Rolls of , but it is likely the lsquoAqua Vitaersquo was being produced long before this date.ldquoIt is likely early development of distillation in Scotland and Ireland took place in parallel, ultimately leading to two distinct global industries.Details of screenings of The Amber Light can be found at: www.amberlightfilm"},{"url":null,"title":"general-election-2019-turnout-won-snp","story":"At that point, with the polls positive but the Scottish Tories looking stronger to remove than expected, the party was simply anxious to break the psychological threshold of  MPs.Anything below that was seen as depressingly lukewarm, hardly the springboard to another independence referendum Ms Sturgeon needed.In the closing week, the party revised down its expectations. Canvassers reported the Tory vote was holding up and suddenly just two or three gains on top of the  seats won in  became the projection.Strategists discounted taking Jo Swinsonrsquos Dunbartonshire East seat, for instance, reckoning decapitating the LibDems, while enjoyable, was an ask too far.The BBCrsquos exit poll with its prediction of  seats was therefore met with extreme scepticism.The FMrsquos aide sent a one-word text to those asking about it: ldquob****cks. But after a round of frantic phone calls to activists and organisers on the ground, slowly the picture at SNP HQ began to change.One of the key factors was turnout. ldquoThatrsquos what we underestimated, said a source.ldquoWe knew our vote was motivated, but turnout was still better than we expected.While turnout was down in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, it was up in Scotland, rising . points to . per cent. Across the UK it fell . points to .%.The SNPrsquos final tally of  MPs ndash actually  plus one suspended member who still appeared on the ballot as SNP ndash was therefore far better than Ms Sturgeon had hoped.She immediately put it to use, declaring it was a renewed, refreshed and strengthened mandate for holding Indyref in . The SNP improved on every metric.Besides gaining  seats, the party increased its share of the vote from . to %, and gained , votes, with a total of .m.It was a victory made all the sweeter by reversals for the party most opposed to Indyref.The Scottish Tories had also misread their data and had over-estimated their support rather than under-estimating it.They lost seven of their  MPs, and saw their vote share fall from . to .%.Their vote total fell , to ,. Yet, on the eve of polling, the party had been confidently talking up gains to the media.At a joint event with her successor Jackson Carlaw, former leader Ruth Davidson had said she wanted to see her party take seats off the SNP.ldquoIrsquove not just been spending time in the seats that we hold trying to defend them, Irsquove been spending time in seats that wersquore trying to take, she said.In the end, the party went backwards in  of its  seats.The Tories did better on the offensive, increasing their vote in Lanark  Hamilton East, Ayrshire Central and Argyll  Bute, but by small or pitul amounts.They slumped in the ultra-marginal target of Perth  North Perthshire, where the SNPrsquos Pete Wishart had a majority of . He was ed with a majority of ,.The SNP increased their vote across the board.It was a stark contrast to , when Scotland had been the one bright spot for the Tories.Then, Scotland had been the only source of Tory gains, as the party under Ms Davidson picked up  seats and gaveTheresa May the numbers she needed to stay in power. The partyrsquos vote share increased by .%, double the rise across the UK.But at this election, Scotland provided the worst Tory result. The only nation in which the party lost MPs or vote share was Scotland.The Scottish campaign was based on making Ms Sturgeon and the SNP synonymous with Indyref in the belief Labour voters would vote tactically to protect the Union.But it turned out Labour voters preferred voting tactically to help the SNP get rid of Tories.The party knew Boris Johnson and Brexit werenrsquot going down well ndash they latterly airbrushed the PM out of their campaign ndash but thought Ms Sturgeon was even less popular.Their own animosity to ldquothat effing woman proved a blindspot. A big headache for the Scottish Tories is that this election was supposed to be the prelude to their Holyrood campaign of .The party was hoping to build up support and convert it into gains on the regional lists. Butit starts losing constituencies, those MSPs will wash up on the list as consolation wins under the proportional voting system and make net gains will be harder.One bleak omen for Mr Carlaw is that the Tory share of the vote fell almost  points in avowedly Remain East Renfrewshire, while the SNPrsquos rose . points. Now a born-again Leaver, Mr Carlaw represents the equivalent seat at Holyrood.A similar swing to the SNP in  would overturn his ,-vote majority, sending him back to the West of Scotland list. The one possible upside for the Scottish Tories is the election may lead to an injection of new blood at Holyrood, as defeated MPs look to Edinburgh for a new berth, clearing out some of the dead timber.Butthe results were bad for the Tories and their campaign against Indyref, they were truly atrocious for Scottish Labour. Despite its precarious hold on the electoral map ndash four of the seven seats it was defending had majorities below , ndash the party was predicting it wouldnine MPs just hours before the polls closed.It was over-confidence based on positive canvas s. In Glasgow North East, Paul Sweeney publicly predicted he would increase his -vote majority on the back of glowing canvas data.After the massive YouGov poll on Tuesday predicting a Tory landslide, the partyrsquos digital chief Aidan Kerr tweeted: ldquoGlasgow North East is not going to the SNP. Andthe pollsters think this, then God knows what  they have got wrong.Mr Sweeney lost to the SNPrsquos Anne McLaughlin by , votes. It was a profound failure of the party machine that points to deep, systemic problems. The party reckoned it was making a comeback in its old heartlands of Glasgow and North Lanarkshire.But when the results came in, Labour lost vote share in every Glasgow seat and in all its North Lanarkshire targets as well. In fact, Labour lost a bigger slice of its vote share in Scotland than anywhere  in the UK, down . points to a wretched .%, thanks to the loss of , votes.Its sole MP north of the Border is Ian Murray in Edinburgh South, who did not hesitate to blame Mr Corbyn for the partyrsquos desperate decline. Mr Leonard has now lost two elections in a year.Last night he vowed to lead his party into the  election as well. His opponents will be chuffed.The LibDems, despite losing Ms Swinson, were the steadiest party of the night. It gained North East Fe to stay on four MPs, increasing its share of the vote by . points.The upshot of it all is Ms Sturgeon will ramp up demands for Indyref. Mr Johnson called her last night to get his refusal in early. Because whatrsquos in it for him  If he granted a Section  order, despite his ldquoguarantee not do so, it would cause turmoil in his party.He also knows referendums bring down leaders. Ask David Cameron, Theresa May and Alex Salmond. Mr Johnson has no appetite to bring his premiership to an early end by granting and then losing Indyref.Perhaps most compelling for a politician who seems to care for little but himself, defeat would mean going down in the history books as the last Prime Minister of the UK, the man who made himself Minister for the Union then oversaw its break-up.

It means less energy and less space is needed to treat a higher quantity of waste water, reducing the operating costs of the site. It also removes the need to chemically treat the effluent, increasing the protection of the rivers Don and Urie, and provides the capacity to support the local community as it continues to grow and flourish. The project was delivered by Scottish Water alliance partner ESD and included building new sewer pipework, improving the resilience of the site to flooding and upgrading existing equipment. Ms Gougeon said: “While treating waste water isn’t something people probably like to think about too often, it is something that is absolutely vital to protect not only our health and sanitation, but also the environment. “Developing new, more efficient ways of treating waste water through the deployment of new technology, is hugely important as Scotland takes decisive steps towards tackling the climate emergency we are facing around the world.” Chief Executive of Scottish Water Douglas Millican said: “We are always looking for ways to innovate and protect the environment both locally and globally, so it is very exciting to see this new state-of-the-art treatment works officially opened here in Inverurie – the first of its kind in Scotland. “Not only does it mean we can continue to treat waste water effectively and protect the environment for years to come, it also underlines our commitment to pursue new ways to lower our energy requirements, towards reaching our ambitious goal of achieving net zero emissions by .” Most construction work on site was completed in the Spring and the new treatment process has since been closely monitored during commissioning and beyond.While most of the work took place within the established Scottish Water site, installation of new pipework beneath the railway line involved a closure to Keithhall Road which was completed ahead of schedule in April .data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"A group of Logie Durno Primary School pupils taking part in the Wee Sleep Out\"  Wee Sleep Out at Logie Durno School viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"ESD Chief Operating Officer Wendy Cooper said: “We are very proud of what has been achieved at Inverurie, successfully delivering a cutting edge new wastewater treatment technology in Scotland for the first time. “Success in this project has involved close collaboration between Scottish Water, ESD, Royal HaskoningDHV and our wider supply chain.

Those talks are critical to the future of our industry.“It is these negotiations that will be the real bread and butter of Brexit for NFU Scotland members. That is where the terms of the trade deal between the UK and the EU will be agreed.“For NFUS, ensuring as free and as frictionless trade in agri-food goods with the EU, which remains our principal market outside of the UK, has been our priority from the start of this process.“Whether negotiating with the EU, or establishing new trade deals with other countries worldwide, a red line for us is that Scotland’s high standards must be recognised and protected.“Our members can be reassured that their union has begun engagement with this new parliament today and we will make tracks to Westminster at the earliest opportunity as we enter a new era for Scottish farming and crofting.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These may have been used to tie mooring ropes onto, to help hold the roof on.The archaeologists working on site uncovered the carved stones scattered around a hearth within the remains of an enigmatic structure that contained three cists, two hearths and a partial ring of holes packed with broken off upstanding stones. Three of the roughly carved figures were also important enough to the people who used the building to be incorporated within the structure of one of the hearths and in the foundations of one of the standing stones. The purpose of the building and how it was used by the inhabitants of this site four thousand years ago is still an enigma.Dating the necked stones firmly will require further work, since they have also been found on Iron Age sites in Orkney. On initial evidence, the ones from Finstown possibly date to around the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, roughly BC.Identying the purpose of these stones, andthey are figurines, will also require further work, with a close study for abrasion, wear and any other marks on these anthropomorphic objects.Futher details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Indeed, Ministers have stopped even referring to the deadline,” Mr McArthur said.“It is all the more important, therefore, that priority is given to connecting those communities who have been waiting longest for any sort of service. Good quality, affordable broadband is increasingly critical in accessing services, allowing businesses to compete and enable people to go about their daily lives.#The Orkney MSP added: #Mr Matheson seems happy that Orkney continues to languish signicantly behind the level of coverage achieved nationally. As an MSP representing a central belt constituency, perhaps Mr Matheson believes this is just the ‘price you pay’ for living in an island or rural area.“Whatever the reason, it is unacceptable, the Scottish Government needs to re-commit to prioritising future broadband investment in Orkney and other communities who continue to lag behind when it comes to coverage.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr Smales said: “We’re delighted to be able to bring one of our hi-tech taps to Kirkwall, rounding off our first full year of installing Top up Taps across Scotland.#We want to make it easier for Orcadians and visitors to stay hydrated on the go and enjoy our great tasting water whenever they are out and about.“We’re encouraging everybody to top up from the tap as much as possible and get into the habit of carrying a refillable bottle with them when they leave the house. As well as the health benefits of drinking more water, it also saves you money and helps reduce waste.”Since the first tap was launched in Edinburgh in October , more than , litres of water has been drunk from Scottish Water’s expanding collection of Top Up Taps — the equivalent of , standard ml single-use plastic bottles.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He stood as an independent candidate in the  General Election, receiving  votes — despite making previous comments to The Orcadian that the election was #illegal#.But SIC has said that placards erected in Shetland by Mr Hill were #unauthorised#, in that he had not sought prior approval before erecting them.In a press release issued on behalf of the #Sovereign Nation of Shetland#, Mr Hill claimed that the SIC roads department had carried out its #threat# to remove his election signs — which he believes it had no authority to do.He said: “Apparently the left hand doesn#t know what the right hand is doing and neither has the authority to do anything. This is just a strong arm tactic from those who want our message suppressed.#It has long been customary to put up signs on lamp posts at election time and when I was a candidate, no permission was asked and no objections were made. As for not being a candidate – that is nonsense.#I have a message just as valid as any candidate for those wanting to make a legitimate protest vote about the £ million Shetland and Orkney pay to the UK every year for nothing in . Rather than vote in an MP, who can do nothing about it, people should write NO THANX across the ballot paper to keep the power here. All spoiled papers are counted.#The SIC did not have the authority to take down my signs. I will be charging them for doing so. Supporters have rallied round and new ones will be printed and re-erected today. We will not be bullied by those who do not like our message.”Responding to Mr Hill#s comments, a spokeswoman from SIC said:#The road service of the council is in communication with Mr Hill over the matter of unauthorised placards, but we will not publicly comment at this point.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Just days earlier, the North said it conducted a ldquovery important test at the site, prompting speculation that it involved a new engine for either a space launch vehicle or an intercontinental ballistic missile. --President Donald Trump meets with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un --The North Korean announcement suggests that the country is preparing to do something to provoke the United StatesWashington does not back down and make concessions in deadlocked nuclear negotiations.An unnamed spokesman for the academy said scientists received warm congratulations from members from the ruling Workersrsquo Party of Korea Central Committee who attended the test on Friday night at the Sohae Satellite Launching Ground, where the North has conducted satellite launches and liquid-fuel missile engine tests in recent years.The spokesman said the successful outcome of the latest test, in addition to the one last Saturday, ldquowill be applied to further bolster up the reliable strategic nuclear deterrent of the Democratic Peoplersquos Republic of Korea. referring to North Korearsquos formal name.Negotiations faltered after the United States rejected North Korean demands for broad sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of the Northrsquos nuclear capabilities at Mr Kimrsquos second summit with President Donald Trump in Vietnam in February.President Trump and Mr Kim met for a third time in June at the border between North and South Korea and agreed to resume talks.

Meanwhile in Scotland, the SNP’s result was arguably even more remarkable with the party securing  out of  seats. Not quite , but still that means  per cent of Scotland’s MPs are Nationalists.However, their result was achieved on the basis of  per cent of the vote in Scotland and the Tories won . across the UK, so both these ‘majorities’ are actually based on ‘minorities’ and a product of the first-past-the-post system.Amid their understandably triumphant celebrations, Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon now appear to be on a political collision course over a second independence referendum, a bitter and isive constitutional clash of epic proportions.: Jackson Carlaw promises Scottish unionists: We can still stop indyref: Nicola Sturgeon: Indyref is ‘democratic right of the Scottish people’However, they could attempt to take a dferent course, one of humility and respect for the dferent viewpoints of these two political tribes.As he ed to  Downing Street, Boris Johnson said the UK “deserves a break from wrangling, a break from politics”, adding: “I urge everyone to find closure and to let the healing begin.”And he is right about the need for healing. The UK is still ided along Leave Remain lines while, for all Johnson and fellow unionists might wish it to be so, the large number of people who support Scottish independence are unlikely to simply give up. And there are other signicant ides in the UK – between left and right, with newly enthused activists on both sides of the spectrum young and old urban and rural areas north and south – that are problems for our society.Rule by London diktatThe key questions are whether Johnson is serious about trying to heal the country or whether this is rhetoric in preparation for the looming fight with the SNP andSturgeon actually has an interest in joining in such a process, rather than stoking ision as part of efforts to secure independence.ButScotland does ever leave the UK, it is most assuredly in its interests to maintain good relations with its nearest and dearest neighbour, just as it is in the UK’s interests to maintain good relations with the EU. Indeed, this would almost certainly be vital to making a success of an independent Scotland. So it would be a mistake for the SNP to dismiss Johnson’s victory and his pledge to stop a second referendum. Political promises should be hard to break, particularly for a Prime Minister with a reputation for being, perhaps, too ‘economical with the actualité’.And, likewise, it would be a mistake for Johnson to add to the sense of nationalist grievance by acting in a high-handed way that could be portrayed as rule by London diktat.They may not like it, in fact, they may absolutely hate it, but they might be better advised to seek some form of compromise, to find an acceptable middle ground.Quite what that would be is hard to say. But it could be more powers for Scotland or perhaps an agreement to allow a second indyrefthe SNP wins the next Holyrood election. Some commentators believe it would be politically untenable to deny a second voteSturgeon wins in that is the case, it might make more sense for Johnson to allow it and focus on ensuring an SNP defeat, rather than rail against it, only to later concede.Smart politics is not always about being tough. There are powerful forces that could easily push them into an increasingly bitter conflict but, surely, in the long run, that would be in no one’s interest.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense. Scots are shrewd people and will not buy it.No, I was absent because I was at sea.#with Rees-Mogg hiding below decks I think she was campaigning in the SW of England.Not surprising. The Brexit party are all at sea.At least you were at sea doing an honest days work Robert, unlike the other candidates. Nobody will know more about the negative effects of European Union membership than you!I#m a bit baffled. I read tonight that Jo Swinson has apologised that she and her Lib Dems backed the Tories# austerity policies. But last night I saw Willie Rennie backing those policies to the hilt. What a party.Jo was talking about the past.Willie was thinking about the future.Now  have quit, including Rees Mogg. Like what Robert did there though, referring to Jacob#s sister, formerly of the Brexit Party, and no longer campaigning for them in the South East of England. You#ve got to ask how a spare bedroom tax would impact on that family# including in their second and third homes and any additional properties in their portfolios.WHY SOCIALIST SNP MEMBERS SHOULD VOTE LABOUR TOMORROW:For the first time in forty years and possibly for the last time during my le, we have the chance to support a manesto that includes widespread nationalisation and the restoration of worker’s rights.These are policies that any self-respecting socialist would have regarded as red lines before Thatcher came along and “modernised” British politics.After Brexit and Scottish independence, we willto the natural battle between left and right. It will even take place within the SNP itself, once the phoney pre-independence “party of national unity” approach falls apart.During these debates, the left will highlight support for Corbyn’s radical policies as evidence that these are still relevant and can still win votes.Meanwhile, the right will highlight the lack of support for Labour as evidence that strong unions and public ownership are no longer winning policies and should be abandoned forever.If you can’t use your vote to get your candidate elected tomorrow, at lease use it to make a statement.The ideas behind Labour’s bold policies need to be kept alive.They will be as relevant in an independent Scotland as they will anywhere .Absolutely.Absolutely not, Johan. I am old enough to remember the Winter of Discontent. Comrade Corbyn, Comrade Scargill. First Secretary Sturgeon! Reach for the rusty tin, self-castration before I would vote Socialist or Nationalist.I am almost old enough to remember the s also. I went missing from hom when I wis about , because I was busy helping a couple of older folk collect fire wood in the absence of coal during the Tories  day week I think.We are not going back to the s, with what we know now we can run things much better under Corbyn.The absence of coal was due to Socialist and le long Soviet supporterMick McGahey#s miners strike. Hardly down to the Tories. Just the Unions holding the country to ransom. Thank God the Maggie neutered that bunch.It#s almost like you are saying Shetland needs a vocal and united local Labour Party willing to take a stand on environmental and equality issues and prepared to ensure people#s concerns are properly considered.Will the local branch make a start to rebuilding by considering whether it isn#t time to call an end to Sullom Voe Yes, it would be goodmembers stopped voting for other partiesIt#s almost like you are trying to change the subject. Which of the parties that plan to close Sullom Voe did you vote for It’s important that unions be strong but not omnipotent, as in the s when many major industries were still nationalised. We meed balance.Combining the two is all very fine for those who, like me, benefited from working in the public sector however it leads to a two-tier workforce, with those in the private sector footing the bill, in taxes or high product prices, for the privileged ones in the public sector. That also hits private sector pay as employers must maintain viability with their increased costs.Having said that, re-nationalisation of electricity would be hilariously apt because government would become directly accountable totaxpayers and or bill-payers for the soaring costs of energy arising from “decarbonisation”, associated with the lunacy of unilateral “declarations of climate emergency” and policies like Labour’s “net zero ”.The IPCC does not call for that and condemns unilateral action as being unhelpful in achieving international agreement.I voted for Blair when sanity prevailed,now Corbyn takes us all back, well he is trying to, but the result empowers Boris!!! So now we have a Boris   Sturgeon catfight. Interesting times ahead, perhaps an Independent Shetland is the way forward, history repeating.Agreed Johan, and Labour has had my vote this time, but when there is a chance of turffing out an austerity backing LibDem# The main thing is people are being offered a chance to take back control of the vital services they depend on that should never have been privatised in the first place.New management systems will mean these can in future serve the people rather than serving corporate greed.Whether we get there this election or not, Corbin#s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members. Hope remains for a fairer society in which the economy works for the good of the people as well as the environment they depend on.The LibDems on the other hand remain forever compromised between the freedom of business to exploit people and the freedom of people not to be exploited.

And they are calling themselves the Upper Bann congregation of RPCIto dferentiate themselves from the main church, which has around  congregations in the province. Mr Dunlop confirmed that they had broken away from the RPCI over the analysis of ‘sin’ during a sermon at Loughbrickland, and the issue was raised with the sessionat the church. Mr Dunlop was one of four elders, and the minister is Rev David Silversides.He added he was not prepared to go into details, as the matter could have legal implications. But the Upper Bann website claims, “The matter spiralled out of control, when Biblical and church procedures were ignored. Spurious ‘discipline’ was enacted against a number of members and it was impossible for some to continue.” The upshot was that Mr Dunlop was excommunicated. He and another elder moved out, with  members, “for the sake of the peace of the Loughbrickland congregation”. The website adds, “As it is an ongoing controversy, still before the ecclesiastical courts – elements of which my come before the civil courts – we refrain from presenting details at present.” The website claims that members excluded from Loughbrickland were denied “constitutional redress within the RPCI”, and they decided to move to Portadown, and set up the first Covenanters Church in the town.The Watson Centre was available and they moved in earlier this month, with ‘Upper Bann Reformed Presbyterian Church of Ireland ’ sign on the gable wall. Rev David Silversides, who has been minister at Loughbrickland for around  years, confirmed that Mr Dunlop had been excommunicated by the church. He added, “It was a long-drawn-out situation, but I don’t want to comment any further.” He referred to the RPCI’s main ruling body – the Synod – where the clerk, Rev Edward McCollum of Ballymoney, also confirmed the excommunication. “It’s is a dficult situation and I cannot see a resolution,” he added.

Trees decorated or sponsored by local people, churches, organisations and businesses will delight , while musicians and singers will play live Christmas music on the hour. Take a seat, close your eyes, pray and invite God to bring you into not ‘that Christmassy feeling’ but the deep joy that comes from knowing Him through Jesus Christ.There will be a number of points where guets can interact with the trees – for instance add to the decorations of a tree with your own words of joy and thanksgiving, post prayer requests for personal needs and other situations around the world at the Prayer Tree, and use the Blue Christmas ‘remembering’ tree to remember those whose presence we miss due to distance or death. A Kids’ Craft room will be open for children to take some time to also engage with the theme of Christmas Joy.When you’ve spent some time taking in the Christmas forest, head through the link corridor to the new hall, where hot drinks and festive treats will be served. Viewing of the trees and enjoying refreshments can take place on Friday pm-pm, Saturday am-.pm and Sunday pm-pm. The suggested donation for entrance is £and gts will be gratefully received.Rev.

It can, however, offer a “true reflection” of an person’s own experiences, Jake Mac Siacais says ahead of his autobiography launch. From the perspective of those who know him, as an Irish language activist and lelong republican, his story is undoubtedly a fascinating one, and it is one that is laid bare in honest detail in his new book, Ón Taobh Istigh.Written in Irish, the autobiography starts as most stories do – at the beginning. Born onto a wooden bath board, Jake’s translated introduction describes his own beginning as neither “the most auspicious” nor “the worst”. It was, by his account, a relatively unremarkable day, although the events that have marked his le have been anything but.Our recent conflict and, of course, the republican struggle had a profound impact on Jake from an early age. Having joined the Fianna aged just , he had, by the time he was , resigned himself to either prison or death. For him, the latter came first. Arrested, questioned, and waterboarded by the RUC, he was eventually imprisoned at -years-old and would spend the best part of a decade in ‘the Crum’ and Long Kesh – eventually being moved to the H-Blocks in . During his part in the blanket protest, he became a friend and close confidant of Bobby Sands, who would die on hunger-strike in . As well as offering an honest and heartfelt insight into one of the most tragic periods our recent history, Ón Taobh Istigh is a discerning look at the social and political events that have shaped our post-conflict society.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Jake told how he wrote the book as a means of dealing with his own personal struggle with depression.“I had suffered severe depression from  to  and I had worked through that with counselling,” he explained. “Then in , February, the counsellor said to me that one of the things that some people find useful is to write things down. So I just started to write my le story and somebody suggested that it would make a great book, so that’s what I did.”He continued: “It meant that I was examining my le in detail, going through everything that I’ve been through and literally just pouring it out on pages. “I decided that in the book I would be as honest and as forthright as I could, but that I would do it in a way which didn’t inidually insult or attack people. I deal with the politics of things, but not with iniduals.“I’ve dealt in detail with all of the major periods the struggle, the peace process – all of that.”He added: “I’m sure that historical figures will recognise themselves in the book, but the book is written with the clear intention of laying out how I remember things, and not straying into making judgements of any iniduals.”Ón Taobh Istigh is a forthright and genuine attempt by Jake to tell his story. While he admits that memory is often subjective, it is a “true reflection” of his own experiences.“I say in the introduction of the book that memory is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool,” he said.“It’s dficult to trust anyone ’s recall, and even more dficult when it comes to your own because memory is inclined to remember those things which it is favourable to remember, and to forget those things that are painful or dficult. Therefore, before you read this book bear in mind that it’s a true reflection of what I experienced, but others may take a dferent view.”Ón Taobh Istigh will be launched at Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich on Saturday at pm."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"meabha puts irish women in the frame","story":"AN intricate painting is proving to be much more than meets the eye in its celebration of Irish women and their place in the world.Entitled Mná hÉireann Women of Ireland, the painting was created by West Belfast artist Meabha Magerr. The striking piece was commissioned by go-to Andersonstown physiotherapist Dan Turley, taking pride of place in his home.Meabha, originally from Inishmore Crescent, now based across the water, told the Andersonstown News that her interest and talent in art flourished ever since “I could hold a crayon”.“In our household, thankfully, you were allowed to be who and what you were. I passed my -Plus and wanted to go to the school around the corner and that was St Genevieve’s. I had always had a love of painting and came from an artistic, creative family.”Friends since they were teenagers, Dan commissioned Meabha, who has displayed her work at the annual Féile an Phobail artists showcase in St Mary’s University College, to create Mná hÉireann.“My biggest problem was finding the right face, the central figure in this case of the piece, to signy le force and strength. I had painted a portrait of Clannad’s Moya Brennan before and I just kept coming back to her face, especially with her being a Celtic woman, a setter of pace. I did change it slightly, the hair, the colour of the eyes, I wanted to convey the feel of her, not necessarily a repeat portrait,” she said.She continued: “I’ve known Dan since I was , we have a lot of banter. He’s a Michelangelo man and just to annoy him I painted the ‘Da Vinci rose’ in it,” she laughed. “There are forget-me-nots in the painting and fuschias, deora Dé God’s tears, as I’d imagine he’d cry to see the persecution women have and continue to face at the injustices in the world.“Dan was very clear that he wanted only positives in the piece, no negatives.”Contained in Mná hÉireann are leaves of ious sizes withnames on them of women from throughout history in delicate gold lettering, and not immediately obvious.“I spent time researching and wanted to go beyond the obvious,” explained Meabha. “Countess Markievicz is there, my great aunt Nano Mullan is on it who fought alongside Countess Markievicz, Sonia O’Sullivan is there. The names are quite hard to read and that was deliberate, as throughout history women haven’t always been seen. They’ve had to come through back doors, pretend to be less than they were.”The prolic artist said the painting and the names contained in it have proved quite the talking point.“James Barry is on it. A woman who wanted to join the Irish army as a military surgeon and disguised herself as a man to do.”James Barry became a pioneering surgeon who carried out the first successful Caesarean delivery.Meabha spoke of how “not all the contributions, the names are immediately obvious”.“Sinéad Burke is there, Sinéad who is three-and-a-half foot tall, a Dublin-based teacher, PhD student and activist. When I first read about her, I nearly skimmed past the article, which was about the fashion industry. I love style but have no interest in fashion. I soon realised the article wasn’t about fashion in that sense, it was about inclusion – a much bigger topic and much more far reaching in many areas of le.“There are olives painted in the portrait, in dferent stages of development which are symbolizing peace. Some are ripe, some aren’t, the meaning behind this is that this is an ongoing stage, peace is a circle of work that will never end, we are always going to have to work hard for it.“I’m glad that the painting is proving to be such a talking point in Dan’s house. It’s as much about learning in that you pick a name and find out more, there is meaning behind each chosen colour, flower and there are emeralds, in this particular case placed in the Celtic crown to represent the four green fields.“The ring formation of the wreath signies everlasting protection. I didn’t want to follow the trend of portraying a warrior queen, that has been well covered by many fabulous artists.

The staggering tourism data represents an almost  per cent visitor increase since  when over  million vistor trips were recorded.Fáilte Feirste Thiar Executive Director, Harry Connolly, said the record numbers were indicative of the “world class” attractions on offer in West Belfast.“Two million visitors have engaged with our established, world class visitor attractions and that includes the Coiste Political Walking Tours, Black Taxi Tours, people downloading the mural map and discovering the our murals by themselves, or visiting the new James Connolly Visitor Centre,” he said.“West Belfast also offers an urban and rural mix, where people can go to the Bog Meadows and the Belfast Hills or they can go to the city and see what our community has to offer.”He added: “The off-season in West Belfast used to be a lot longer, but that’s shortening and it shows that we are now a year-round destination.”Amongst this year’s tourism highlights were the opening of the new James Connolly Visitor Centre and the annual Féile an Phobail, which welcomed the world to West Belfast with hundreds of events including Michael Conlan’s headline bout in the Falls Park. While celebrating our culture and heritage, Mr Connolly said that the hospitality and tourism industry now employs , local people, who are boosting “regeneration”.“This is , homes, families and jobs sustained, which is enormous,” he said.“When we were established we wanted to ensure that tourism was part of the overall programme for social and economic regeneration. “You can really see now how tourism is having a very positive and profound impact on social and economic development of West Belfast.”Not content to rest on their laurels, Fáilte Feirste Thiar are already looking to  with the aim of bringing even more tourists to the area.“As we approach , we believe that we have a firm foundation in place to make sure that West Belfast’s potential is realised,” Harry enthused.“What will help us achieve that is new world class transformational projects.

Westminster majority means the DUP’s ability to thwart his Brexit proposals is diminished..pushSome checks on goods moving between the rest of the UK and Northern Ireland are expected to take place to keep the Irish land border with the EU frictionless.The speed with which that could happen is disputed but the UK is set to leave the bloc at the end of next month.During the campaign, the Prime Minister attempted to deny that some goods will have to be checked when moving between the rest of the UK and Northern Ireland.This election result is a vote to end paralysis, not a mandate to force through a deal that would be disruptive to businessAnn McGregorJeremy Corbyn said he had obtained a confidential report which “drives a coach and horses” through the claim that there will be no border in the Irish Sea under the Brexit plan.Ann McGregor, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said: “This election result is a vote to end paralysis, not a mandate to force through a deal that would be disruptive to business.“The business community will be calling on the Prime Minister to provide swt certainty about what Brexit means and time to prepare for and implement it.”She added: “The Prime Minister’s current deal, which effectively gives Northern Ireland two borders, should be a concern for all of us – not just business leaders and employers.“Politicians from all parties, and anyone with a vested interest in the Northern Ireland economy, need to recognise the major risks to business growth and job creation, and the serious consequences for young people seeking a career in Northern Ireland.”Queen’s University Belfast reader in sociology Katy Hayward said the result was partly down to electoral pacts to maximise the anti-Brexit vote rather than reliance on tactical voting.She said more unionists and nationalists voted for middle-ground parties like the pro-Remain Alliance Party and SDLP.Demographic change in Northern Ireland’s balance between nationalist and unionist voters was alluded to by DUP leader Arlene Foster.She said the numbers were against her losing candidates in North and South Belfast.The results are symbolically signicant, as there are now more nationalist and republican MPs from Northern Irelandthan unionists , reversing the  seven split from the  election.Irish senator Mark Daly urged the Irish Government to make preparations for a United Ireland.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has rejected the suggestion as inflammatory to unionists.Mr Daly said: “For many unionists in Northern Ireland, their link to the UK is through Scotland andScotland votes for independence, then many will question the future of the Union.“The Irish government needs to show the people of Northern Ireland, particularly the unionist community, a clear alternative and a vision for the future that is inclusive.”"},{"url":null,"title":"election results bring scottish independence and irish unity to

The target of their anger is Boris Johnsons Betrayal Act, so it will be interesting to see what will happenhe manages to win a comfortable majority and pushes ahead with his deal.While it is true that a result which curtails Johnsons room for manoeuvre would dissipate some of the anger, it is also true that, having been harnessed and galvanised, it is hard to see this new movementjust disappearing.The reaction of this movement could prove crucial when the new talks begin.. Boris in Northern IrelandPacemaker Press   Prime Minister Boris Johnson during a visit to Tayto Castle in County Armagh Northern Ireland on Thursday afternoon.Pic Colm Lenaghan Pacemaker  Boris Johnson only made one trip to Northern Ireland during the entire campaign and used it to produce waterfalls of waffle about what was, or wasnt, included in his withdrawal agreement.He hadnt a clue. Im not even sure he could have pointed to the Irish Sea on a map, let alone known where Northern Ireland ended and the Republic began.Bizarrely, he didnt seem to have the slightest concern about trumpeting his ignorance, even when he was having a meeting with local Conservative members. Okay, he knows that the four candidates being fielded by his party wouldnt be getting enough votes between them to fill a smallish hall in the middle of nowhere, but you would have thought that he could, at the very least, have been honest with them. But no, not a bit of it. He continued to waffle. Maybe he just cant help himself.He had already proved that he wasnt listening to the views of the DUP, so why would he even begin to care what anyone  he met during the visit was thinking . Finucane is caugh shortEvery campaign produces a story which is remembered long after the election is over. This particular one isnt as historically signicant as the Relief of Mafeking or the Relief of Derry. That said, the Relief of Finucane was splashed across the front of the Belfastand followed up by a number of other media outlets. It gave rise to a stream of jokes, most of them involving number ones, number twos, iations of flushing away support, inconvenient truths and his determination to meet the challenge from the DU Pee.My own favourite was that he hadnt really done anything wrong because the General Election is based on a \"first p****d the post\" form of voting.If nothing , we can always rely on our much celebrated sense of humour to see us through."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38780628.ece/ac386/BINARY/POLITIC%201843.jpg","title":"at a glance northern irelands 2019 general election winners","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I saw some of the bets that had been struck.Arlene Foster was neither wrong nor sectarian in blaming the grievous blow of losing Nigel Dodds on changing demographics.Lamenting a pan-nationalist pact will not wash, though, given the pressure placed upon Steve Aikens UUP to step aside in North Belfast.Even without a pact, Claire Hanna would almost certainly have won South Belfast for the SDLP.The  high water mark was always going to be dficult to defend. It is also worth remembering that DUP vote shares have risen more often in elections under Fosters stewardship than they have fallen.The DUP remains Northern Irelands largest party. data-dfpadtargetingThe DUPs Alex Easton is consoled by his we DeniseThat said, previous successes owed something to UUP weakness and Thursdays Belfast and North Down failures, along with several reduced majorities where, increase the pressure upon her leadership.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who saw his own constituency turn into a semi-marginal, is the obvious Westminster replacement leader for Dodds. His remit might ultimately be extended.Meanwhile, Alliances time has come.The partys voted soared by nearly %, to add to the % European election increase and % in the council contests.It is Alliances best year. This surge is causing problems for the UUP, searching for niche pro-Union distinctiveness, but Alliances extra vote is also coming from those who do not identy as unionist or nationalist. And that is a big and expanding reservoir in which Alliance can fish. What of Sinn Fein  It got the scalp it wanted with the Dodds decapitation and ended the election with the same number of MPs as it started.Yet overall performance was mediocre at best and occasionally poor.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood handed out a thrashing in Foyle probably beyond his own expectations, let alone anyone s. This in a city where Sinn Fein had staged its ard fheis, launched its manesto and brought in hundreds of volunteers in the last month. Sinn Feins % fall in vote share - even allowing for its non-participation in some constituencies - is part of a broader pattern of generally indferent recent election performances.While a Boris Brexit will now assist the party in establishing economic structures of unication and in effect special status for The North, it seems inconceivable that the Conservative Government will permit a border poll. There is no obvious short-or medium-term route to constitutional unity. The Prime Ministers immediate preoccupation will be somehow attempting to quell the burning independence fires in Scotland.While the success of the SDLP in Foyle will reawaken criticisms of Sinn Feins abstention from Westminster, it is unclear why.The grim truth for even the participatory victorious local MPs is that they will carry precious little clout at Westminster.They might enjoy the sights but not the politics.If the PM could discard the DUP so brutally when it held the balance of power, why would he listen to the pleas of  MPs who offer zero threat to his -seat majority So abstention may remain a non-issue within Sinn Fein. Evenit could be proved beyond doubt that abstention was harming Sinn Feins electoral fortunes, the party leadership would be wary of touching the issue.A two-thirds majority of members would be needed for change and risks a split. And anyone who thinks a split in the republican movement does not have its problems has slept through the last century.If locally elected politicians want power, they will need to restore Stormont.That is a possible outcome of Thursdays results.Sinn Fein would have a power base. The DUP might take the view that an Irish Language Act, in broader form, is the bitter pill that needs swallowing to avoid the grim vista of power being confined to local councils for at least half a generation.But such DUP willingness would be conditional upon them being still the largest party and providing the first minister after the next set of elections to the phantom Assembly, presumably in spring.Ready for yet more hot contests then Jon Tonge is Professor of Politics at the University of Liverpool and Principal Investigator of the ESRC  Northern Ireland election study"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38773263.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/POLITICS%20939.jpg","title":"jon tonge who did best in bbc ni leaders debate","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Asked whether a Boris Brexit might be al for the Irish unity project, O’Neill insisted that running Northern Ireland into the ground was not the way forward for unity — which wiped out a few decades of recent republican history. Naomi Long also rejected the inevitability thesis.Colum Eastwood drew applause by attacking Sinn Fein for being absent from Westminster yet trousering millions in expenses. O’Neill responded sharply, by claiming the SDLP leader was “disingenuous”, highlighting SNP impotence in London. Special status for the North — which a Boris Brexit represented — was a product of Sinn Fein activism beyond Westminster, she claimed.

Back in  he represented the area as mayor, later becoming its MLA.Twelve years later he is now the constituencys MP - a triumph for Alliance which few political pundits would have been comfortable betting their money on until yesterday, with most predicting the seat was there for the DUPs taking.Dr Farrys Westminster win is no mean feat - voters held his successor, the independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon, in huge affection. Like Lady Hermon, he is a firm Remainer, and during his campaign he was keen to stress their shared Brexit position.A Queens University graduate in Politics with a PhD in International Relations, Dr Farry is only the second Alliance politician to be elected to Westminster in its history.A fitting development, perhaps, given the Newtownards man is arguably Alliances second most high-profile name, behind leader Naomi Long.During his tenure in the Executive, he served as minister for employment and learning, and gained widespread praise for capping tuition fees in September . Following the  Assembly elections, he took up positions on the Stormont Committee for the Economy and Business Committee, positions he held until the collapse of power-sharing in .His political work has also garnered global attention: in  he was appointed an International Peace Scholar by the US Institute of Peace. The -year-old has always been a passionate advocate of Alliances cross-community ethos, but he himself has been caught in the crossfire of Northern Irelands green and orange politics.In , after fellow party members on Belfast City Council voted in favour of restricting the flying of the Union flag at City Hall to specic days throughout the year, his own constituency office in Bangor was the target of an attempted arson attack. But with Alliances gains in this latest election, Dr Farry will be hoping it indicates potential for growing the middle ground in local politics. *Stephen Farry was not available for an interview yesterday.Stephen FarryAllianceNorth DownWon by: , votesBrexit: Remain"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38781423.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/FrancieMolloy.jpg","title":"mid ulster sinn feins molloy says irish unity now only way to avoid brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A report with some very positive recommendations was published and then progress halted.\"If you ask me what will the election mean for Northern Ireland in terms of education, it is hard to knowit will make any dference, with education being a devolved matter, but the NAHT took the opportunity over the last few weeks to engage with all local political parties and discuss what needs to change in education.\"School budgets are still at breaking point.

Our young people need the best possible education to prepare them to meet the future with confidenceGeri Cameron\"It is now widely recognised within the education system in Northern Ireland that fewer people are stepping forward to take up leadership roles in schools.\"A career that was once highly sought-after is becoming less and less attractive as decision-makers fail to invest in schools and educators and to prioritise the wellbeing of those working in education.\"A double strategy is needed to, firstly, support school leaders to ensure that these great leaders remain in their role and secondly, to identy teachers who can be supported into leadership roles in the future.\"We cannot wait another , days for change.

The collaboration between Balenciaga and Nuriev reimagines a sofa — the center of so many homes — as an example of environmentally conscious design, giving generations of garments and other materials another le. The oblong sofa — inspired by typical overstuffed recliners — is upholstered with damaged or otherwise unsellable garments and off-cuts from obsolete stocks of Balenciaga clothing, encased by scrapped transparent vinyl. Patterns, cuts, and tags within the stuffing are recognizably Balenciaga, a mix of past seasons and ideas. Intended to encourage sustainable practices within design and where, the piece reflects Balenciaga’s recognition of the responsibility designers have to counterbalance their environmental impact, and dedication to implementing programs that upcycle waste and contribute to a circular economy.

Just days earlier, the North said it conducted a “very important test” at the site, prompting speculation that it involved a new engine for either a space launch vehicle or an intercontinental ballistic missile.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  President Donald Trump meets with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un The North Korean announcement suggests that the country is preparing to do something to provoke the United StatesWashington does not back down and make concessions in deadlocked nuclear negotiations.An unnamed spokesman for the academy said scientists received warm congratulations from members from the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea Central Committee who attended the test on Friday night at the Sohae Satellite Launching Ground, where the North has conducted satellite launches and liquid-fuel missile engine tests in recent years.The spokesman said the successful outcome of the latest test, in addition to the one last Saturday, “will be applied to further bolster up the reliable strategic nuclear deterrent of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea”. referring to North Korea’s formal name.Negotiations faltered after the United States rejected North Korean demands for broad sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of the North’s nuclear capabilities at Mr Kim’s second summit with President Donald Trump in Vietnam in February.President Trump and Mr Kim met for a third time in June at the border between North and South Korea and agreed to resume talks. But an October working-level meeting in Sweden broke down over what the North Koreans described as the Americans’ “old stance and attitude”.Saturday’s news of the test came after US Ambassador Kelly Craft on Wednesday criticised the North’s ballistic testing activity during a UN Security Council meeting, saying that the tests were “deeply counterproductive” and risk closing the door on prospects for negotiating peace.She also cited North Korean hints of “a resumption of serious provocations”, which she said would mean they could launch space vehicles using long-range ballistic missile technology or test ICBMs, “which are designed to attack the continental United States with nuclear weapons”.While Ms Craft said that the Trump administration is “prepared to be flexible” and take concrete, parallel steps toward an agreement on resuming talks, North Korea described her comments as a “hostile provocation” and warned that Washington may have squandered its chance at salvaging the fragile nuclear diplomacy."},{"url":null,"title":"un climate talks head for overtime with key issues unresolved","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Economists say allowing companies and rich countries to invest in carbon-cutting measures such as rain forest protection in poor countries could become a vital tool for lowering emissions, provided the markets are transparent.“We are all looking for a compromise,” said Frans Timmermans, the European Commission’s top official in charge of climate issues. “But there is no way, no way, we could accept a compromise that jeopardises environmental integrity. Just no way.”Developing nations singled out the United States as one of the countries blocking talks over aid to poor nations, agreed in  and known as the Warsaw International Mechanism.American officials pushed back against those claims.“The US government is the largest humanitarian donor in the world,” a State Department official said.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Donald Trump President Donald Trump formally triggered the US withdrawal from the  Paris climate accord, a process that will be completed on Nov  next year, a day after the next US presidential election.The move means the US, the world’s second biggest emitter of greenhouse gases after China, will be excluded from many of the negotiations at next November’s climate talks in Glasgow.As host next year, Britain will have to tackle any issues left over from Madrid and the more daunting task of getting countries to agree tougher emissions targets, even as it continues to negotiate its exit from the European Union.Scientists say big cuts to global emissions have to start next yearthe Paris accord’s goal of keeping global warming at C but ideally .C by the end of the century is to be achieved."},{"url":null,"title":"500212","story":"Photos: nwpresspics googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Our aim at the start of the year was to get back to a county final. We did and won it, so we are in bonus territory.” googletag.cmd.push The current Lavey minor team were Feacuteile champions. In recent years. back to back U championships were secured. They lost to Carrickmore in the final of the Paul McGirr tournament last year and have been successful at Oacuteg Sport. Also, this season, they won the minor hurling championship thanks to a mesmerising display of free-taking from Enda Downey to edge out a fancied Ballinascreen team in the final. In football terms, seven of the current side played in last years defeat to Bellaghy but barring Ryan McGill and Cormac Collins, the other  players expected to start on Saturday will be eligible next season. Four of the starting team, Patrick McGurk, Rory McGill, Niall Duggan and Segdae Melaugh – are currently in their first year of U. Others have dipped in and out, but the underage scene in Derry has, largely, been the Bellaghy, Lavey and Magherafelt show in recent years. Lavey needed extra time to see off Magherafelt before defeating Glen to win the first minor title since the   teams managed by current Chairman Paddy Chivers. From that group, Seamus and Henry Downey have sons now leading the Lavey attack, where Johnny McGurks two sons also feature. All-Ireland Club winning goalkeeper Brendan Regans son Louis is also in the squad. In the county final win over Glen, it was Laveys hunger on the breaking ball that gave them a  to control the game. Cormac Collins and Jamie Duggan are a formidable midfield pairing. James McGurk almost single-handedly dragged Lavey back into their U final with Carrickmore last year and he is an effective leader of the attack. Their inside line is likely to feature the Downey trio, Matthew, Enda and Callum. Matthew is likely to play up front. If Laveys midfield can win enough ball to allow Enda to play inside with him, it will be a cocktail that will pose a serious threat. In the recent Rannafast final, Calum Downey and Patrick McGurk handed more ball than most others on the park andthey can link the play from defence Lavey have the tools to break free. On Saturday, Lavey are in action against Cavan champions Drumloman Gaels, an amalgamation of Mullahoran and Ballymachugh. They come into the Ulster scene on the back of winning the Cavan U championship, therefore wont have played together as a group until Saturday. At midfield Liam Corr and the free-scoring Caolaacuten OReilly will pose a threat to Lavey, while their attack centres around Shane Tynan. Laveys defence will need to get to grips with Tynan, with the dangerous duo of Conor Coyle and Matthew McGahern the benefactors of any link play from midfield. “We are going into the unknown. Like we did every other year, we have done a biton other teams but well be concentrating on our own performance, at getting to that level we need to be at,” Hassan added. “From the Glen game, there are things that didnt go right and we worked on that at training. We are trying to concentrate at getting to a higher level than we did against Glen and see where it takes us. “In the county final, the support we had was like an extra man to the players and I have no doubt it will be the same next Saturday.” It will be eight weeks since their county final and after two weeks off, challenge games and gym work was factored in to freshen things up. “The lads have their batteries recharged. It has been a tough year and with winning the hurling and football, they needed a bit of a rest. They look fresh physically and mentality at the minute,” Hassan continued. Calum Downey had his leg strapped in the recent Rannafast final but the Lavey boss confirmed all his players will be  percent ahead of this weekend. Last year Bellaghy took much of the first-half to get to grips with Dunloy in their first game. If Lavey can do likewise in this years opener, they have the attacking power to advance to the last four.

In the first instance, we urge all players to read in detail the full report from the GAA’s Fixtures Review Taskforce. Key principles agreed by the GPA and CPA are based upon the fundamental understanding that inter-county players are also club players and that this connection is the basis of the GAA. These are:  The club is the primary basic unit of the GAA from which everything springs. Therefore, this must be recognised in the status which club games are given. googletag.cmd.push  The inter-county game is the GAA’s biggest promotional and developmental tool. It is also the GAA’s primary revenue generator. This must be fully recognised in restructuring our national games calendar. Furthermore, both organisations are in agreement that, following the recent publication of the Fixtures Calendar Review Taskforce report, and prior to the next phase in that process which includes a series of regional seminars in which all key stakeholders will be provided with the opportunity to provide further views and feedback, there are a number of key points centred around time and governance that we mutually support and wish to highlight. googletag.cmd.push These are:  The Club Window in April May should be ened to a -week period to allow the fairest opportunity for the window to be successfully utilised.  The demands placed upon inter-county players in both club and inter-county windows will need to be governed to ensure the games training load is not detrimental to the players’ welfare.  The Club Window post the All-Ireland football final needs to be a minimum of  weeks before provincial club championships begin.  Club Windows will only work fairly for all,inter county competitions start their championships on the same dates.  There needs to be stronger adherence to provisions regarding the availability of inter-county players to clubs as referenced within GPA Squad Charters.  Bar club teams involved in provincial championships November should be used exclusively as an off season for inter-county players.  There needs to be strong governance and guidelines introduced to ensure club fixtures schedules are appropriately set out and adhered to throughout the year. “One of our core pillars is to protect the welfare of our members, statedPaul Flynn, GPA CEO. It is therefore vital that fixtures are properly governed to ensure the fundamental link between club and inter-county players is fully recognised and strengthened within the fixtures calendar. “This year we put a motion before GAA Congress to provide for a GPA representative to sit on the Central Competitions Control Committee to input on fixtures involving inter-county hurling and football competitions only, in a bid to improve the situation for our members.” “We will work towards this with the CPA, while prioritising the welfare of our members, keeping in focus the amount of games they are expected to play and amount of training they are expected to undertake.” Micheacuteal Briody, Chairman of the CPA, admitted that both the GPA and CPA have agreed the the current fixtures calendar isnt the best fit for both sets of players. “The CPA have advocated for a radical structural change to the fixtures calendar since our formation in , Briody commented. It is important now that the options for change put forward from the Task Force are disseminated to clubs immediately so that the debate can begin nationwide on what level of change is acceptable.” “We will work to ensurethis communication does happen effectively and it is criticalthat all clubs become aware of the options that are being presented and then vote for change that will alleviate the current unsatisfactory schedule.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The origin tale of the lake, known as ‘The Death of Eochaidh son of Mairid’ is over a thousand years old in oral tradition, but has now been brought up to date in a new telling by children’s author, Maacuteire Zepf.Liacute Ban’s story is tale bursting with colour, from giant horses and ancient gods to mermaids and monks. It tells of a young girl who is transformed into a mermaid when a magical curse floods their ringfort, creating Lough Neagh Six Irish-medium primary schools in the Mid-Ulster area have been working on the story with Maacuteire Zepf over the past months, writing their own creative responses and drawing original illustrations for the story.The young writers and illustrators from Dungannon, Coalisland, Magherafelt, Ballinascreen, Cookstown and Tirkane then came together at the Seamus Heaney HomePlace in Bellaghy on th December for a collaborative showcase performance of their work, to celebrate the project and to hear the story told in its entirety.The story of Liacute Ban is deeply rooted in the locality of the area, mentioning local places by name. References to the legend can also be spotted in many local place names.The project has been funded by a partnership between the Irish Writers’ Centre in Dublin and Mid-Ulster District Council.Martin Kearney, Chair of Mid-Ulster District Council attended the event. He said: “The story of Eochaidh and Liacute Ban shows just how rich and deep our local culture really is. Watching the children take it to their hearts today has been a lovely experience”Commenting on the project, Maacuteire Zepf said: “It was such a joy to unearth this gem of a local story with the children and to see their intense excitement about such an ancient tale. Hopefully, we can be assured now that Liacute Ban will live on now for the next generation.”Hilary Copeland, Acting Director of the Irish Writers’ Centre added:The Irish Writers Centre is delighted to support the Liacute Ban project. Our ‘writer-led’ programme offers writers the opportunity to develop their own creative projects, making use of their skills and experience with language and storytelling. We are grateful to Foras na Gaeilge for their continued support of Irish literature projects as Gaeilge.’ googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They were nursed back to health at Atnagelvin Hospitals Neonatal Intensive Care Unit where they spent the first few weeks of their lives.The girls are now aged four and are happy and healthy, but their mum and dad Bob and Michelle McLaughlin have never forgotten the nurses who cared for them when they were so vulnerable.The couple have since raised thousands of pounds for the NICU for supplies and equipment to help other babies who are born sick or too soon by holding an annual sponsored walk.But this year they wanted to give a special thank you to the NICU earth angel nurses and arranged a huge raffle and quiz night which raised pound, for the staff.The money was spent on  Foyleside vouchers and a pound MS voucher which were hand delivered by Saorlaith and Saoirse earlier this week.These nurses fought our battles in the NICU when we had no one  to turn to, like many other parents, explained Mr McLaughlin.They are the main reason we fundraise for the NICU at Altnagelvin and I think everyone agrees they deserve a thank you.They are our earth angels.The nurses in the Neonatal ward are highly trained and provide one to one care round the clock care for the babies.It is nice to let our nurses know that we appreciate them and everything they do for our children, continued Mr McLaughlin.We hope we put a smile on their faces.Earlier this week Saorlaith and Saoirse donned their Santa hats to pay a surprise visit to the ward where they were reunited with three of the nurses who had looked after them.One of the staff Oonagh hadnt seen the girls since they were born so I think she got a bit of a shock, said Mr McLaughlin.She recalled the sleepless nights she used to have worrying about the girls.Its lovely to know they remember them and shows how much they care and they were really pleased and grateful for the gts they received.Mr McLaughlin added: I would also like to thank all the local businesses who so generously donated to the raffle and the people who bought tickets and took part in our quiz night at the River Inn. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Crucially, Jamie McDonagh, wanted by a number of other clubs in recent weeks, has decided to stay at the club, signing for another year.This is the most important piece of business that weve done up until this point in terms of keeping the nucleus of last years group together, he explained. Everyone here played a huge part for us last year so it was a no-brainer to try and tie everybody down at the club for this coming season. There was a lot of success last year but we need to push it on and I think to achieve success here its going to be very important that the people who were here last year and here to push us on. This gives us that feel from last year but more importantly it gives us really good players and really good people at the club for . googletag.cmd.push  On Jamie McDonagh... Its a major boost. I think Jamie was outstanding for us last year. In my opinion hes one of the top wide players in the country. Jamie filled a lot of gaps last year for us but this year I predominantly see him as a forward player. When we look at Jamie, theres no-one in the country who has a better delivery of the ball and I think theres more to come form him. Some of our biggest rivals were looking to take Jamie. I think everybody in the league knows what he brings to the table. He was fantastic for us last year so were delighted to get it over the line and this could be a big, big year for Jamie. googletag.cmd.push  On Darren Cole... Hes a class act – i said it all last year that Darren Cole is as good a footballer as there is in the county. Everything is easy to Darren Cole, I never see him out of position, out of control. Everything he does is easy for him and thats the sign of a fantastic player. Darrens challenge now is to get back into the first team squad as quickly as possible and hes shown brilliant appetite in the off-season so far. Hes fortunate that theres a couple of other young players here pushing to get fit alongside him so hell have all the support thats required to get him back playing because when Darren Cole is playing theres nobody better in my opinion in the league.”  On Eoin Toal... Eoin Toal in my opinion went from being a young player with a lot of potential to a man who was undroppable. He played every game, made very few mistakes and really matured. Ive watched him in recent weeks playing for Northern Ireland at the highest level and hes wearing the captains armband there when theres so many high level players there from Scotland and England. Eoin has gone in and taken that captaincy and really stood out. You only have to look at his performances over the course of last year because as the season went on he was getting stronger and stronger. It will be interesting to seehe stays for the three years becausehe keeps going the way hes going theres a good chance that he wont see out the contract and one of the big guns from England or Scotland could snap him up.  On Nathan Gartside... I think Nathan and Peter Cherrie are going to fight it out to be number one this year. Last year we were flogging the same players and we fell over the line. We looked tired and fatigued and using the same  or  players – This year we need a squad of  players all on a similar level of ability. Nathans application over the past ten months has probably been the best at the club in the way he trains and conducts himself. His work in the off-season and his ability and his drive to do better is superb and to have the two boys here next year will be a huge asset to Derry City Football Club. Weve a goalkeeper of  whos been about the league and we have a goalkeeper at  who is going to be about for a very long time.  On Mark McChrystal... If I was a young player now and I was looking for a figure that could inspire me to have a good carer in the game then I couldnt look past Mark McChrystal. He probably has one of the best attitudes Ive ever worked with. Lets not forget that some of the best players in this league are in their thirties and Mark has a lot to offer, both on the pitch and off the pitch, and what a fantastic servant he has been. His experience is massive because he has played at the top level. Not just that but hes a brilliant person. He demands respect and hes fitter now than he has been in a long time and thats testament to the person he is.

An economist is also helping compile the document.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down is one of five local authorities paired with Belfast City Council, universities and theprivate sector who have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes across the Province, with the remainder of the cash expected to come from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.At this weekrsquos meeting of the councilrsquos Enterprise, Tourism and Regeneration Committee, politicians were told that officials have been working on the detailed outline business case since last May, with a consultancy team helping prepare the document.Council officials say that when work on the business case is completed next spring, it will provide a detailed analysis and assessment of the projectrsquos strategic fit within the City Deal.In addition, the document will also outline detailed project costs, the benefits, risks and funding requirements.Politicians were told this week that the documentrsquos analysis will recommend a particular procurement route in order to deliver the scheme.It has also been confirmed that the ongoing development of the business case involves planning considerations and the development of exemplar design and output specications, prior to any formal procurement exercise being undertaken.Politicians were informed on Monday night that the outline business case will provide detail on the technical expertise in terms of the design, construction and maintenance of similar international attractions and also provide detailed analysis of commercial operations of a visitor attraction of this scale.It is understood that council officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for other aspects of the tourism investment and support to move the projects through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.Other aspects of the Mournes Gateway scheme include an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, a new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Consultants appointed by the local authority to look at developing the resortrsquos visitor infrastructure have also come up with proposals for the Islands Park, with upgrades planned for existing car parks, alongside new public toilet provision.There are also proposals to reduce the the tree line in Donard Forest on the slopes of the Mournes, with a so-called green travel network which would allow visitors to hire bicycles and electric bikes to make their way round ious attractions is also suggested.The ious proposals form the core of the so-called Mourne Mountains Gateway Study and have already been discussed with the National Trust, Forest Service and Environment Agency and other key players..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019

Someone came forward and this was welcomed by elderly people who would not be forced to travel outside the town to access services.Cllr Walker says it is vital that Ballynahinch retains its dedicated postal office and appealed to someone the townrsquos business community to consider taking over the service.ldquoBallynahinch is Down Districtrsquos third largest town and it would be a body blowthe planned temporary closure became permanent, he said.ldquoThe bottom lines appears to be thatno one comes forward to offer to run the service it will close and that will impact on people across the community.ldquoThe role of local post offices has changed considerably over recent years, with many transferring to large supermarkets which ensured that they were open for much longer, including weekends.ldquoMany elderly people prefer to conduct their business at post offices, not banks. That is one of the many reasons why this vitally important service is not lost to Ballynahinch. A number of local post offices, which provide a much broader range of services including banking facilities, are now housed in retail premises.Cllr Walker added: ldquoIt is my hope that one of the major retailers in Ballynahinch will come forward to ensure that the service is not lost to the town. While the post offices are important to our major towns, many are also at the heart of rural communities across the district.

And while there is a signicant financial benefit for securing geopark status, council officials insist the benefits are not just economic.They have previously argued that geoparks have a ldquosignicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.Currently, there are three designated geoparks in Ireland. In addition to the Marble Arch Caves in Fermanagh, they include The Burren and Clfs of Moher in Co Clare and the Copper Coast geopark in Co Waterford.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed on Monday afternoon that the local authorityrsquos bid for geopark was formally submitted last month..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Publication.jpg","title":"Book delves into the history around Strangford  ","story":"INVERBRENA Local History Group has launched the latest edition of its annual magazine mdash just in time for Christmas.Memories From Inverbrena: Strangford  features a selection of memories, stories, histories and photographs of people and places within the Strangford area, preserved for future generations.The magazine includes an article by Michael McConville in which he chronicles the history of the the local parish drama club during the s and s, including a selection of photographs of local amateur actors and actresses who participated in some of the popular well received productions.In his second article in this yearrsquos publication, Michael remembers happy days potato picking, recalling how everyone worked together as a team, both boys and girls, and all getting the same pay at the end of the day.Melanie Hamill puts pen to paper to provide an invaluable record of her splendid conversion of Strangford Presbyterian Church, earning it the prestigious  Heritage Angel award for Best Rescue of a Historic Building Or Place for projects under pound million.

McIlhone won the ball off a Ballynagross defender and without even looking up let one fly from  yards out.Goalkeeper Ross Preece was stranded in no manrsquos land and his despairing outstretched attempt to tip the ball over the crossbar failed as the ball nestled in the back of the net.Two minutes later, man of the match Ross Armstrong made it -. He chased a lost cause of a ball into the box where Marron and Preece were favourites to win the race, but Armstrongrsquos sheer desire helped to get him to the ball first and he was able to dink it into an empty net.With  minutes gone Armstrong pounced again to make it - after McIlhone had carved out the opening.Killough continued to bombard Ballynagross with everything and anything, but Ballynagross bravely weathered the storm and gradually started to create chances of their own.With  minutes gone they patiently worked an opening for Ryan McKinney, but he was denied a goal when the impressive Sean Og Burns got back to hack the ball off the line.That was as good as it got for Ballynagross as Killough made it - three minutes later. Gareth George picked the ball up from a Ben McLaughlin throw and immediately set off on one of his trademark, penetrating runs.George had only one thing on his mind after leaving three players for dead and his unerring finish into the bottom corner had Preece clutching at thin air.Six minutes later it was - when Armstrong headed a free back across the box and McIlhone had all the time in the world to send Killough into delirium.With  minutes gone a delightful cross from Adam George was met perfectly by Armstrong and the big striker powered an unstoppable header to the net to make it -.Some of Killoughrsquos play in the first half was breathtaking and few teams could have lived with them and as the players trooped off at half-time, everyone feared for Ballynagross.However, the break gave Campbell the chance to reorganise his troops and the were a dferent proposition in the second half.Marron pulled one back from the spot after Sean Og Burns took down Philip Doran in the box, but despite creating several other chances, that was it for Ballynagross.Eoin Rooney and Conor McCarron had shots well saved by Killough lsquokeeper Eddie Hinc, while Liam Graham headed over at the other end and Preece saved from Gareth George.Killough were a pale shadow of the side that lit up Binnian Park in the first  minutes, but they can be forgiven for taking their foot off the pedal after taking a - lead.Ballynagross can only reflect on what might have been, had they been able to field at full strength, but football can be a cruel game as they found out on Friday night.Killough: Eddie Hinc, Matthew Burns, Ben McLaughlin, Colm Stranney, Sean Og Burns, Matt McKiernan, Gareth George, Adam George, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Riain Burns: Subs: Liam Graham, Seamas Tumelty, Ryan McIlhone, Robbie Hagan, Ruairi Sharvin.Ballynagross: Ross Preece, Deaglan Craig, Tom McNeill, Aaron Beattie, Conor Marron, Conor McCarron, Karl Johnston, Mark Magill, Daniel Taggart, Declan Dowie, Ryan McKinney.

The new centre is being well used and the council deserves credit for this major investment but, in my opinion, the mains power issue should have been sorted before it opened for business.Cllr Curran said that given the increased emphasis on recycling, the council is behind innovative plans to allow groups and charities across the district to reuse ious items dumped at household recycling centres in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch.He added: ldquoA number of groups have expressed an interest in taking part and I have no doubt that this scheme will be a success with ious items destined for the scrapheap given a new lease of le.A council spokeswoman confirmed that the recycling centre was operating without mains power.ldquoIt has taken longer than anticipated to connect the mains power supply at the new site, said the spokeswoman.ldquoAs a temporary measure, a generator and security firm are being used to cover requirements.

Her ship was the last passenger ship to sail to the continent for many years, as most ships were then commissioned for the war effort, Mary explained.The young nun swapped the green fields and rain of home for the blistering heat and bustle of Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape, which must have been quite an experience.She completed her religious formation and academic teacher training before taking her vows in . Over the following decades she taught in several schools. Eventually, on retiring, she was assigned a new mission, opening a clinic and a pre-school within an encampment that catered for over , refugees fleeing the horrors of the Mozambique war.In Sr Bartholomewrsquos own words of this period in her le, recorded in a book written over  years ago, Drumgooland ndash A Parish Divided, she recalls: ldquoWith missionary zeal we did our utmost over the following years to render whatever assistance we could to the many thousands of refugees, I taught including adults.ldquoThese poor people had a minimum of education and were eager to learn English. After class we would sit around and read the bible in Shangaan, the local language, and gave help when it was needed.Niece Mary takes up the story again. She added: ldquoNuns donrsquot retire and while Sr Bartholomew found the intense heat too much after several years, she made for the cooler environment of an office and spent time in general admin.Sr Bartholomew would often make the trip back home to Leitrim after Vatican II came to pass when the rigours and discipline of a pious le became more relaxed in the s. However, she was always looked forward to going back to Port Elizabeth.Her last trip home was some years ago when her older sister, Eileen, was seriously ill.ldquoShe had managed to hold her hand and chat briefly before she passed away, Mary recalled.

The meeting was devoted to Emma de Souza, who is campaigning to have British citizenship law amended so that people from Northern Ireland would no longer be automatic British citizens. Letter to the editorShe argues that the provision in the Belfast Agreement that says that people from Northern Ireland may ‘identy as’ Irish or British or both means that British citizenship ought to be relegated to a mere choice. This is despite the same clause of the agreement referring only to a right to hold ‘both British and Irish citizenship’. In October, this argument was dismissed in a withering judgment of the Upper Tribunal , which also declined permission to appeal, but Mrs De Souza has stated her intention to go to the Court of Appeal and is currently fundraising for her legal costs..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The Joint Committee, three of the nine attending members of which were from Sinn Fein , invited Mrs De Souza to give evidence along with Professor Colin Harvey, a nationalist academic, and a representative of the Committee on the Administration of Justice. All three repeated arguments conflating identity and citizenship and asserting a non-existent ‘right’ to choose citizenship. These are based on a nationalist interpretation of the Belfast Agreement and an apparent inability to appreciate that it is as much a unionist creation as a nationalist one. Nobody had been invited to put the case for the interpretation of the Upper Tribunal, or to give a unionist view or indeed any kind of an alternative view. There were no dissenting voices among the committee members. Nobody present even contemplated the possibility that the tribunal may have been correct. All apparently believe that, in , unionists and the UK government agreed that British citizenship should no longer be the default for those born in Northern Ireland and that despite such an agreement, the UK government chose not to include this in the legislation that gave effect to the agreement, and nobody in Parliamentnoticed.The meeting ended with O Caolain, the Sinn Fein chairman of the Joint Committee, asserting that British taxpayers’ money was being used to ‘crush Irish rights’, and accepting a proposal by Gerry Adams that it should write to the Irish government, urging it to give practicalsupport to De Souza’s appeal.As predicted, the De Souza campaign is moving firmly into the political arena. Nationalism is exerting signicant pressure and recent remarks at a Westminster Committee by the Secretary of State Julian Smith — when he appeared to contemplate amendments to UK citizenship law — indicate that it might be working. What are unionist representatives doing to defend the extant interpretation of the Belfast Agreement and UK citizenship law from this campaign J.

Alliances Stephen Farry, pictured with party leader Naomi Long, stunned the DUP by taking North DownIn past elections unionist parties – and most recently the DUP – have talked up the constitutional threat for their own advantage. No longer.Now the future of the United Kingdom is imperilled from myriad directions – and some of those are entirely beyond Northern Irish unionists’ control..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The decisive national outcome of the general election leaves the DUP with no leverage at Westminster. As a consequence, it now faces a rapid move towards an Irish Sea trade border.Having backed Brexit as something which would improve things, the DUP now finds that for which it dreamt and campaigned threatening to unravel the Union itself.Brexit itself and the DUP’s support not only for leaving the EU, but for a harder form of Brexit, was a key factor in the de facto nationalist and Green Party pacts in North Belfast and South Belfast which cost it two seats.The loss in North Belfast of Nigel Dodds, the party’s Westminster leader and one of unionism’s elder statesmen, is devastating.On Thursday night as it became clear that his seat was in jeopardy, one DUP member sent me a message saying: “We could lose anyone but him.”Few people across the DUP’s disparate and frequently warring factions would disagree with that sentiment.Not only is he a strategic asset to the DUP and a respected figure at Westminster in a way that some of his DUP colleagues are not, but his defeat speaks to a profound psychological problem for unionism.This seat, once held by the father of Ulster Unionism, Edward Carson, has never been held by a nationalist before – still less by a republican.As such, Mr Dodds’ defeat represents an old certainty which now is slipping away from unionism.Joint committee of Irish Parliament engages in nationalist groupthink over the de Souza citizenship case Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"And as the latest in a line of once impregnable unionist seats which have been lost by unionism, the result is evocative of a wider sense that not only control of Northern Ireland – but potentially Northern Ireland itself – is slipping away.There is no inevitability that a united Ireland is coming. Just four years ago, prior to Brexit and the collapse of Stormont, polls pointed to Northern Ireland being more constitutionally secure than at any point since its creation in .And even in this election, where unionism has suffered a grievous blow, Sinn Fein’s vote has fallen further than that of the DUP.The rise of the Alliance Party, astonishingly in this election the third largest party, is no guarantee of support for Irish unity.But it is a clear rejection of what has seemed like an archaic form of unionism whose biggest idea often seems to be to circle the wagons with an electoral pact when seats come under pressure.Yesterday the man who is seen by some DUP members as the great hope of unionism said something which appeared to misunderstand the core problem.Asked on Good Morning Ulster about the psychological damage of the result for unionism, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson referred to “the splintering of the unionist vote, for example, in places like North Down” and said that unionists wanted unity.It is a measure of how far unionism has fallen that a sentence like that can be uttered without drawing gasps.North Down is one of the safest unionist seats in Northern Ireland. Less than a decade ago, unionists won % of the votes there.If a unionist pact is required to stop it being lost, that is a pitul reflection on the state of the DUP and UUP.The logic of suggesting a pact in North Down is that there is almost no winnable seat which the UUP should contest without a pact.But while that would suit the DUP’s short-term interests – and perhaps even those of the UUPit gained a seat as a result – the evidence suggests that pacts are one of the reasons that Alliance is surging.Facing a developing fire, a move towards widespread unionist unity could act as an accelerant.Unlike nationalism, where Sinn Fein has – despite its major victory in North Belfast – had a poor election but has seen votes largely slip from it to the SDLP, this election has confirmed the complete dominance of the DUP within unionism.With that dominance comes responsibility when unionism falters.Will Arlene Foster accept that she is either accountable or responsible for any of this crisis  Or will she blame everyone but herself History suggests the latter, despite the fact that DUP members privately say that many voters expressed their unhappiness at Mrs Foster during canvassing.For a party renowned for its bare-toothed ruthlessness, the DUP has been remarkably understanding of the failures on Mrs Foster’s watch.There was an abortive putsch after she led unionism to the first loss of its Stormont majority in the history of Northern Ireland.Those who quietly muttered about challenging her then but chose not to do so must now wonderthey could have helped prevent this catastrophe for unionism.Unionism now lacks a strong leader at the point where it needs one most.Loyalists – including paramilitaries – poured into political activism their efforts at rejecting Boris Johnson’s Irish Sea border. Now that strategy has failed, where do they go Some, based on the recent meeting in Portadown from which my colleague Ben Lowry reported, will be arguing for street protests,not outright violence.Even setting aside moral considerations, past loyalist violence has been strategically disastrous and the street disorder during the flag protests actually boosted Alliance’s vote.Unionism stands weary at another crossroads. But unlike the choice between Terence O’Neill’s moderation and the full-throated unionism of Paisleyism  years ago, this time the possibility of a vote for Irish unity is at levels which then would have been dficult to conceive.And this time there is a sense of unionism lacking a single leader with the ability and ideological purpose to even lead unionist opinion – let alone those now deserting unionism.try catch  TrendingNI snow now due to arrive earlier than originally thought -

Election. PA Photo.- StrangfordThe DUPs Jim Shannon was re-elected MP for the Co Down constituency of Strangford with , votes to spare in a wave of unionist anger at Boris Johnsons Brexit strategy.He said it was a vote of opposition to the Prime Ministers proposed deal over concerns it would create a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Mr Shannon delivered his maiden speech to the House of Commons in the Ulster Scots tongue when first elected in .On Friday, he said: \"The union has been degraded and downgraded by Boris Johnson.\"He would take your alsatian dog for a walk, he would come back an hour later and give you a chihuahua and tell you it was all right.\"He said they needed to convince the British premier of the importance of the union, and claimed the DUPs numbers in the next Parliament would give it influence.Mr Shannon added: \"We will do our bit to make sure that the union, for those who live in Leicester, London, Manchester, Newcastle or wherever  in the UK, also is the same for the people of Strangford and the people of Strangford have told me that.\"His closest rival, the cross-community Alliance partys Kellie Armstrong, said Northern Ireland deserved a restored devolved government.She said: \"We have a health service that is falling apart, we have education that needs reform, we have infrastructure that is in a desperate state of crisis and it is time for the Assembly to be back.\"She added: \"We have had enough, you have had enough and it is time to move on.\"- West TyroneIn an unsurprising victory, Orfhlaith Begley raced across the line to claim the West Tyrone seat.In an election that saw , votes polled, Ms Begley won the seat with , votes.It was expected that the Carrickmore woman would hold to the seat, which has been in Sinn Feins hands since  after Pat Doherty was elected.The -year-old is the first woman to hold the West Tyrone seat.She was selected by Sinn Fein to contest the by-election in  after Barry McElduff stepped down from the seat following a controversy over a video he posted to Twitter.The turnout for West Tyrone was .%, slightly more than the by-election which saw .% of the electorate cast its vote.Speaking after her win, Ms Begley said: \"This was a crucial election, the election of a generation and clearly people wanted their views heard in terms of Brexit.\"This is a border constituency that rejected Brexit in the referendum and people came out again in this election to once again reject Brexit.\"People have been very energised in terms of of this campaign and people came out in their thousands to reject Brexit but also to reject Tory austerity.\"They sent a very clear message that they see their future in a new Ireland for all.\"Sinn Fein has made its voice count where it matters, in terms of Brussels, we have been there, in Dublin and we also travel to London on a regular basis.\"We gave a pledge in  that we would ensure special status for the North, we would protect the Good Friday Agreement and the all Ireland economy and we have delivered on all three of those.\"-North BelfastSinn Feins John Finucane has declared North Belfast has rejected Brexit after winning the seat from incumbent, the Democratic Unionist Party deputy leader Nigel Dodds.Mr Finucane triumphed following a tight contest with Mr Dodds taking the seat with , votes ahead of his rival who finished on , votes.The Sinn Fein man, who benefited from a pro-Remain alliance with the SDLP and Green Party who stood aside in support of him, said his victory was a rejection of Brexit.\"I want to thank each and every person who came out to vote for me today and I also want to acknowledge here tonight that there were those who stretched themselves and I know that this election was an election that transcended party politics and I know that I was very much the beneficiary of that today,\" he said.\"I think this election is about the future of North Belfast, we saw the threat of Brexit and what that meant for the people of Belfast, we saw the threat to our economy, the threat to our childrens futures and I think that message, that remain voice that was heard in  was amplied beyond recognition again tonight.\"North Belfast rejects Brexit, North Belfast is a Remain constituency, North Belfast wants a future as part of the European Union and I think that is hugely signicant.\"He added: \"As an MP I pledge to you all tonight that I will work for every single person in this constituency whether you voted for me or not.\"Referring to Sinn Feins policy of not taking seats at Westminster, Mr Dodds said he \"regrets North Belfast will be left unrepresented in the House of Commons at a challenging time\".The DUP man who had held the seat since  said: \"As far as Brexit is concerned, it is very clear now that Brexit is going to happen with Boris Johnsons predicted majority and it is very very important that the Northern Ireland Assembly is got up and running as quickly as possible so that the Northern Ireland Executive and politicians can have a role in that going forward. But Boris Johnson needs to understand that we must have a Brexit that ensures that it protects the integrity of the United Kingdom and is the best deal for Northern Ireland and that is something we will continue to work with the Government on in the days ahead.\"- Mid UlsterSinn Feins Francie Molloy has comfortably retained his seat in Mid Ulster with .% of the vote.It is a seat the party has held for  years, with former deputy first minister Martin McGuinness the MP from  until  when he was replaced by Mr Molloy in a by-election.With , votes polled, Mr Molloys share is down slightly since the  election when he won .% of the vote.He said: \"This was a Brexit election. Brexit has wrecked the entire political process and it is going to wreck the Union as well. The one certainty for us toto the European Union is Irish unity. Thats the open door we have to Europe and I would hope to continue that as soon as possible.\"As in the  election, Molloys nearest rival was the DUPs Keith Buchanan, whose vote decreased to ,.Mel Boyle of the Alliance Party increased the partys share from .% to .%, while the SDLPs Denise Johnston increased her party share by .%.Turnout in Mid Ulster was .%.- East LondonderryIn one of the most unsurprising victories of the night, the DUPs Gregory Campbell has retained his seat in East Londonderry.With a lions share of the vote at ,, Mr Campbell was ed comfortably.\"When those who try to analyse and say votes are down, I hope they will look at the vote we got in East Londonderry and see that our majority is up,\" he said.\"Thats because the people here want a hardworking, effective hard hitting MP who doesnt pull any punches and thats what they will get in the next few years.\"We will wait to see the outcome, and hopefully all parties commit to get back to Stormont to make this country the best country in the United Kingdom and make it a much more prosperous country weve had in the past.\"Speaking before his win, Mr Campbell said the onus was on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to deliver on his brexit promises, adding: \"Well, whatever majority Boris has there will be an onus on him to deliver on no checks east-west and an even bigger issue on how does he preside over the UK, Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and how does he cement that and build that for the future.\"In my view, he has to do that on an economic basis, so that people here and in Scotland see a tangible benefit of staying in the UK, and then people will want to stay.\"The incumbent Mr Campbell romped home against newcomer SDLP candidate Cara Hunter on ,, who pipped Sinn Fein to the post for second place by just  votes.Also running against Mr Campbell was Richard Holmes, UUP, Sinn Feins Dermot Nicholl, the Alliance Partys Chris McCaw, and from newly-formed Aontu party Sean McNicholl.- FoyleWhat was initially thought to be a tight race saw the SDLPs Colum Eastwood win back the Foyle seat from Sinn Feins Elisha McCallion with a huge majority.The SDLP will be celebrating tonight after garnering , votes, against Ms McCallions ,.Ms McCallion was previously elected in  from Mr Eastwoods colleague Mark Durkan by the tightest of margins with only  votes, in what is historically an SDLP heartland and the home of former leader John Hume.It was clear from early in the evening that the SDLP were due to make something of a comeback in Northern Irish politics, as Mr Eastwood and his colleague Claire Hanna were both predicted for victories.It was made even clearer when upon her arrival to the Magherafelt count centre, Ms McCallion congratulated her rival before

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But right now, more and more people in the Vale are being forced to our food bankrsquos doors.ldquoThis isnrsquot right.ldquoWhile our help is needed, wersquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community without enough money for food are able to access emergency support.ldquoOur vital work in the community has only been possible because of the incredible generosity shown by local people who have donated food, time and funds.ldquoThank you.The Vale Foodbank is particularly in need of UHT milk, fruit juice, tinned meat, and tinned vegetables.The charity has asked for festive donations to be donated in early December at the latest, to ensure volunteers have enough time to process and distribute these donations to people before Christmas. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Just days earlier, the North said it conducted a ldquovery important test at the site, prompting speculation that it involved a new engine for either a space launch vehicle or an intercontinental ballistic missile. --President Donald Trump meets with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un --The North Korean announcement suggests that the country is preparing to do something to provoke the United StatesWashington does not back down and make concessions in deadlocked nuclear negotiations.An unnamed spokesman for the academy said scientists received warm congratulations from members from the ruling Workersrsquo Party of Korea Central Committee who attended the test on Friday night at the Sohae Satellite Launching Ground, where the North has conducted satellite launches and liquid-fuel missile engine tests in recent years.The spokesman said the successful outcome of the latest test, in addition to the one last Saturday, ldquowill be applied to further bolster up the reliable strategic nuclear deterrent of the Democratic Peoplersquos Republic of Korea. referring to North Korearsquos formal name.Negotiations faltered after the United States rejected North Korean demands for broad sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of the Northrsquos nuclear capabilities at Mr Kimrsquos second summit with President Donald Trump in Vietnam in February.President Trump and Mr Kim met for a third time in June at the border between North and South Korea and agreed to resume talks. But an October working-level meeting in Sweden broke down over what the North Koreans described as the Americansrsquo ldquoold stance and attitude.Saturdayrsquos news of the test came after US Ambassador Kelly Craft on Wednesday criticised the Northrsquos ballistic testing activity during a UN Security Council meeting, saying that the tests were ldquodeeply counterproductive and risk closing the door on prospects for negotiating peace.She also cited North Korean hints of ldquoa resumption of serious provocations, which she said would mean they could launch space vehicles using long-range ballistic missile technology or test ICBMs, ldquowhich are designed to attack the continental United States with nuclear weapons.While Ms Craft said that the Trump administration is ldquoprepared to be flexible and take concrete, parallel steps toward an agreement on resuming talks, North Korea described her comments as a ldquohostile provocation and warned that Washington may have squandered its chance at salvaging the fragile nuclear diplomacy..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: North Korea conducts another test at long-range rocket site article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That can only mean one thing – the dreaded hangover.We’ve all been there, right  That last round of tequila shots sounded like a mighty fine idea, but now it’s the morning after the night before and you are paying for it – with interest.Your head is pounding, your stomach is queasy, and it feels like something small and furry crawled into your mouth overnight and died there.Granted, the damage has well and truly been done – but what can you do about it now  How do you cure that hangover  Heck, can you even cure a hangover Well, that depends on who you ask. There’s a host of weird and wonderful hangover cure claims floating around, but the old saying ‘horses for courses’ applies here. That is to say, what works for one person may not do a thing for another.At the risk of stating the obvious, the best way to avoid a hangover is to drink less alcohol. Or none at all.It’s also a very good idea to eat a decent meal before heading out, and alternating between an alcoholic beverage and a hydrating glass of water can lessen the effects of a hangover.Assuming, though, that all that sage advice went out of the window last night, here’s six hangover cures to try.A hearty bowl of soupOkay, so this is only a good ideayou can still stand straight, but Austrians swear by this method.When you’ve had a skinful of booze, grab a big bowl of goulash soup before heading to bed.It will prevent the alcohol soaking further into your bloodstream, and is always a better idea than that kebab you were craving at am.Eat a protein breakfastDr Andrew Irvine, who published How To Cure A Hangover, suggests a simple breakfast.“Protein, in the form of eggs, will help your hypoglycaemia , as will porridge,” he says. “The headache should ease once the blood sugar level has been corrected, then take some soluble paracetamol.”BeroccaThe Aussies, it’s fair to say, seem know a thing or two about drinking.After one too many tinnies, simply drop a tablet of this over-the-counter, nutrient-packed tablet in a glass of water.Works bestyou do the same before drinking. It may not completely cure your hangover, but it’s a refreshing pick-me-up that’s packed with vitamins.ParacetamolDissolve a soluble paracetamol tablet in a glass of water and not only will it go a long way towards curing that throbbing headache, but it will provide rehydration, which is all important. Unlike Ibuprofen it won’t irritate the stomach.Be warned, though: too much paracetamol is toxic to the liver – and it has probably taken enough of a pounding as it is. and cure your hangover\" data-s-urlclick\" news -ways-try-and-cure-your-hangover-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share by email\" data-param-subject\" ways toand cure your hangover\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\"\" and cure your hangover\" data-s-urlclick\" news -ways-try-and-cure-your-hangover-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share to Facebook\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\" and cure your hangover\" data-s-urlclick\" news -ways-try-and-cure-your-hangover-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share to Twitter\" data-param-text\" ways toand cure your hangover\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"these are foods you shouldnt feed your dog christmas ","story":"Suspicious vehicle alertYou could be owed a Cold Weather Payment thanks to the dip in temperatures - how to checkyou’re eligibleNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPeopleThe ethanol in alcohol can hit an animals bloodstream faster than humans.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
